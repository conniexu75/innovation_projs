https://openalex.org/W2083180015,"Over the past decade, strong interactions of light and matter at the single-photon level have enabled a wide set of scientific advances in quantum optics and quantum information science. This work has been performed principally within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics with diverse physical systems, including single atoms in Fabry-Perot resonators, quantum dots coupled to micropillars and photonic bandgap cavities and Cooper pairs interacting with superconducting resonators. Experiments with single, localized atoms have been at the forefront of these advances with the use of optical resonators in high-finesse Fabry-Perot configurations. As a result of the extreme technical challenges involved in further improving the multilayer dielectric mirror coatings of these resonators and in scaling to large numbers of devices, there has been increased interest in the development of alternative microcavity systems. Here we show strong coupling between individual caesium atoms and the fields of a high-quality toroidal microresonator. From observations of transit events for single atoms falling through the resonator's evanescent field, we determine the coherent coupling rate for interactions near the surface of the resonator. We develop a theoretical model to quantify our observations, demonstrating that strong coupling is achieved, with the rate of coherent coupling exceeding the dissipative rates of the atom and the cavity. Our work opens the way for investigations of optical processes with single atoms and photons in lithographically fabricated microresonators. Applications include the implementation of quantum networks, scalable quantum logic with photons, and quantum information processing on atom chips."

Here, we mapped an autosomal recessive form (designated ARHP) to chromosome 4q21 and identified homozygous mutations in DMP1 (dentin matrix protein 1), which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes. Intact plasma levels of the phosphaturic protein FGF23 were clearly elevated in two of four affected individuals, providing a possible explanation for the phosphaturia and inappropriately normal 1,25(OH)2D levels and suggesting that DMP1 may regulate FGF23 expression."

IL-17 plays an important role in promoting tissue inflammation in host defense against infection and in autoimmune diseases. Although IL-17 has been reported to regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases, the signaling mechanism of IL-17 receptor has not been understood. An earlier study found that IL-17 activates NF-κB and MAPK pathways and requires TRAF6 to induce IL-6. However, it is unknown what molecule(s) directly associates with IL-17 receptor to initiate the signaling. We demonstrate here that IL-17 receptor family shares sequence homology in their intracellular region with Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains and with Act1, a novel adaptor previously reported as an NF-κB activator. MyD88 and IRAK4, downstream signaling components of TIR, are not required for IL-17 signaling. On the other hand, Act1 and IL-17 receptor directly associate likely via homotypic interaction. Deficiency of Act1 in fibroblast abrogates IL-17-induced cytokine and chemokine expression, as well as the induction of C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and IκBζ. Also, absence of Act1 results in a selective defect in IL-17-induced activation of NF-κB pathway. These results thus indicate Act1 as a membrane-proximal adaptor of IL-17 receptor with an essential role in induction of inflammatory genes. Our study not only for the first time reveals an immediate signaling mechanism downstream of an IL-17 family receptor but also has implications in therapeutic treatment of various immune diseases.

Inflammatory reactions are complex biological processes involving both innate and adaptive immune systems. Chronic inflammation is crucially regulated by CD4+ T cells in many autoimmune diseases.

Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). T cell differentiation into these cells is regulated by cytokines such as TGFβ, IL-6, and IL-23 (2Weaver C.T. Harrington L.E. Mangan P.R. Gavrieli M. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). More and more evidence has associated these cells with normal host responses to infection and abnormal inflammatory autoimmune diseases (1Dong C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). IL-17, also called IL-17A, is the founding member of a novel cytokine family-IL-17 family (1Dong C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Widely regarded as a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-17 is crucial in regulation of tissue inflammation in vivo (3Park H. Li Z. Yang X.O. Chang S.H. Nurieva R. Wang Y.H. Wang Y. Hood L. Zhu Z. Tian Q. Dong C. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar). IL-17 regulates the production of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β), chemokines (RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-2/IL-8, MIP-3α, and GROα), cell-surface markers (RANKL and ICAM-1) and proinflammatory mediators (prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide, and cyclooxygenase-2) (1Dong C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-17 also synergizes with TNF-α in inflammatory regulation (4Ruddy M.J. Wong G.C. Liu X.K. Yamamoto H. Kasayama S. Kirkwood K.L. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2559-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). IL-17 binds to and signals through IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), a member of the IL-17R family (5Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I. Spriggs M.K. Immunity. 1995; 3: 811-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that IL-17RA might form a heterodimer with IL-17RC (6Toy D. Kugler D. Wolfson M. Vanden Bos T. Gurgel J. Derry J. Tocker J. Peschon J. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). IL-17 activates NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways, which results in up-regulation of IL-6 (7Shalom-Barak T. Quach J. Lotz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27467-27473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Schwandner R. Yamaguchi K. Cao Z. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), although other reports have suggested JAK/STAT pathway involved in IL-17 signaling (9Kao C.Y. Chen Y. Thai P. Wachi S. Huang F. Kim C. Harper R.W. Wu R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3482-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 10Subramaniam S.V. Cooper R.S. Adunyah S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It was shown that IL-6 induction by IL-17 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) is dependent on TRAF6 (8Schwandner R. Yamaguchi K. Cao Z. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-17 may signal via mechanisms similar to IL-1 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). How IL-17R family receptors signal remain largely unknown. IL-17RA has a long cytoplasmic tail with ∼500 amino acids with no sequence conserved in any other cytokine receptor families, suggesting that they belong to a unique cytokine receptor family. IL-17RA and TRAF6 overexpression resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of the two molecules (8Schwandner R. Yamaguchi K. Cao Z. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the association is direct. A consensus TRAF6-binding motif, PXEXXZ(X, aromatic/acidic residue), is absent in IL-17RA. Notably, TLRs, IL-1 receptors, and TNF receptors all initiate their signaling via homotypic interaction with downstream adaptor proteins. Many TLRs and IL-1 receptors utilize MyD88 in their signal transduction leading to activation of TRAF6 and downstream pathways (11Kawai T. Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one article recently suggested that all isoforms of IL-17 receptors contained a conserved sequence segment that shares similar residues in two out of three conserved motifs of Toll-like receptor (TIR)/IL-1R domain. A new superfamily consisting of TIR and IL-17R homology domains was thus proposed as STIR (SEFIR (similar expression to fibroblast growth factor genes and IL-17Rs) and TIR) (12Novatchkova M. Leibbrandt A. Werzowa J. Neubuser A. Eisenhaber F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 226-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). IL-17R SEFIR domain is also observed in one cytoplasmic protein, Act1. Act1 is also known as CIKS, a connection to IκB kinase and stress-activated kinase. Although initially reported to activate NF-κB in CD40-mediated signaling (13Qian Y. Zhao Z. Jiang Z. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9386-9391Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), an analysis on Act1-deficient mice suggested Act1 as a negative regulator for CD40- and BAFF-induced B cell survival (14Qian Y. Qin J. Cui G. Naramura M. Snow E.C. Ware C.F. Fairchild R.L. Omori S.A. Rickert R.C. Scott M. Kotzin B.L. Li X. Immunity. 2004; 21: 575-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A striking feature of Act1 is that it contains the TRAF6 binding motif and exhibited TRAF6 association in vitro (15Kanamori M. Kai C. Hayashizaki Y. Suzuki H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that IL-17RA employs Act1 as its adaptor protein to transduce signaling. In this paper, we show that Act1 not only directly associates with IL-17RA via the SEFIR motif but also is essential for IL-17 regulation of inflammatory gene expression. This is the first report on an adaptor protein for the IL-17R family. Cytokines and Antibodies—Antibodies used in experiments are as follows: anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma), anti-HA.11 (Covance); anti-GST (BD Biosciences); anti-Act1 H-300, anti-IκBα, anti-TRAF6 H-274 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-human IL-17RA (R&D Systems); and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch and GE Healthcare). IL-6 ELISA antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. IL-1β and TNF-α were obtained from BD Biosciences, and IL-17 was obtained from R&D Systems. Phylogeny Analysis—Multiple sequence alignment and tree-building were performed using Bonsai 1.1.6 with default settings. Cell Culture—MEF was derived from C57BL6 using a standard protocol. MyD88–/– MEF was provided by Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov (Yale University) and IRAK4–/– MEF by Dr. Wen-Chen Yeh (University of Toronto). A549 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals). For measurement of IL-6, 4 × 104 cells were plated onto 24-well plates. Next day, cells were treated with cytokines overnight, and the culture supernatant was subjected to ELISA. Plasmids—The full length of Act1 was cloned into pcDNA3. HA tag was added by PCR on N terminus of Act1. The SEFIR domain of Act1, amino acids 336–555, was inserted to pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for GST fusion protein. Cytoplasmic domain of IL-17RA, amino acids 346–864, was either cloned into pcDNA with an N terminus HA tag or inserted to pGEX4T-1. The full length of IL-17RA with a FLAG tag was obtained from Dr. Sarah Gaffen (State University of New York, Buffalo, NY). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Plasmids encoding HA-Act1 was subject to T7 Quick Coupled in vitro transcription and translation (Promega). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE; gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with HA antibody. GST Pulldown Assays—GST-SEFIR Act1 fusion protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Promega) and affinity-purified onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST pulldown assays were performed with a total of 2 μg of GST-Act1 protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Bound GST protein was then incubated with 293T cell lysates expressing HA-IL-17RA. In another experiment, 10 μlof in vitro transcription and translation product, HA-Act1, was incubated in the same binding buffer with GST-cytoplasmic domain of IL-17RA. After washing with binding buffer five times, beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoresis. Bands for bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Transduction of Cell Lines with shRNA of Act1—A retroviral construct, pSM2c, encoding mouse Act1 microRNA-adapted shRNA was purchased from Openbiosystems (Huntsville, AL). The packaging cell line 293T (5 × 106) was plated on 100-mm tissue culture plates. On the following day, 14 μg of the pSM2c-shRNA Act1, 10 μg of Gag/pol plasmid DNA and VSVg plasmid DNA were co-transfected by calcium phosphate method. The medium was changed 12 h after transfection, and the cells were cultured for another 48 h. Conditioned medium was then collected and cleared of debris by low speed centrifugation (2,500 × g for 5 min) and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and stored at –70 °C. MEFs were infected with culture fluid from the virus-producing cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. The medium was changed on the following day. Two days after infection, cells were trypsinized and replated at a 1:3 dilution in puromycin medium. Stable transfectants were obtained at 1–2 weeks. Real-time PCR—MEFs were plated onto 6-well plates at density of 105/well. The cells were treated for 4 h in serum-free DMEM prior to stimulation with the indicated cytokines. DNA was synthesized with RNA prepared by TRIzol using RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in triplicates by using iQ CYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in the iCycler sequence detection system (Bio-Rad). The starting quantity of the initial cDNA sample was calculated from primer-specific standard curves by using the iCycler Data Analysis Software. The expression level of each gene was normalized to actin expression level using standard curve method. The primer sets for real-time PCR are: MCP-1, CTC AGC CAG ATG CAG TTA ACG CCC (forward) and GGT GCT GAA GAC CTT AGG GCA GAT (reverse); MCP-3, CTC ATA GCC GCT GCT TTC AGC ATC (forward) and GTC TAA GTA TGC TAT AGC CTC CTC (reverse); CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), CGC ACC ACG ACT TCC TCT (forward) and CGA GGC TCA CGT AAC CGT (reverse); C/EBPδ, TGC CAT GTA CGA CGA CGA G (forward) and GCC GCT TTG TGG TTG CTG (reverse), molecule possessing ankyrin repeats induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; MAIL)/inhibitor of κBζ (IκBζ), TGA CAT CAC CGC AAA CGC (forward) and GAA ATC CTG GCA CTG GTC TC (reverse); β-actin; GAC GGC CAG GTC ATC ACT ATT G (forward) and AGG AAG GCT GGA AAA GAG CC (reverse). Cell Lysis, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with the lysis buffer. Cell debris and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant fractions were used directly for Western blot analysis or for immunoprecipitation. For Western blots, 50–100 μg of total protein was electrophoresed through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% milk, TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies. HRP-conjugated primary antibodies were removed, the membranes were washed with TBST, and the signal was detected with ECL reagent (Promega). Densitometry (for signal-density) was analyzed with the EpiChemi3 Darkroom™ (UVP Bioimaging Systems) using Labworks Image Acquisition and Analysis Software 4.5. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cleared cell lysates were incubated with 50 μl of FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel for 90 min followed by three 5-min washes in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were denatured with 1× SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 100 °C. IL-17RA Shares Similarity with TIR Domain but Does Not Utilize MyD88 and IRAK4 for IL-6 Induction—Although no information exists on what molecules directly associate with IL-17RA, a recent article suggested that the members of human IL-17 receptor family share some homology with TIR domains existing in TLR/IL-1R family members. This similarity was further supported by a phylogenic sequence analysis on the STIR domains from mouse IL-17Rs, TLRs and IL-1R (Fig. 1A). Thus, we first tested whether IL-17RA shares proximal signaling units with those used by TIR-containing receptors. MyD88 is an essential adaptor downstream of most TLRs, and it is essential for IL-1R signaling. IL-6 was produced equally in WT and MyD88–/– MEF upon IL-17 treatment (Fig. 1B), indicating that MyD88 is not essential in IL-17 signaling. We further investigated the involvement of IRAK4, a crucial downstream molecule of MyD88 in TLR/IL-1R signaling (11Kawai T. Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). IRAK4 acts to recruit IRAK1, which further interacts with TRAF6 leading to its activation. Upon IL-17 treatment, IL-6 production was preserved in IRAK4–/– MEF (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we concluded that IL-17RA may utilize different proximal signaling subunits from those used by TIR. Act1 Physically Associates with IL-17RA through Its SEFIR Domain—In addition to IL-17RA, Act1, a cytoplasmic protein reported to interact with TRAF6, also contains a SEFIR domain. Therefore, we reasoned that Act1 may interact with the cytoplasmic domain of IL-17RA via homotypic interaction. We first tested whether Act1 can associate with IL-17RA. Full-length and SEFIR domain of Act1 and full-length and the cytoplasmic domain of IL-17RA were subcloned into expression vectors and used to determine the association of Act1 and IL-17RA. When Full-length HA-tagged Act1 and FLAG-tagged IL-17RA (16Kramer J.M. Yi L. Shen F. Maitra A. Jiao X. Jin T. Gaffen S.L. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) proteins were simultaneously expressed in 293 cells, HA-tagged Act1 was co-immunoprecipitated by a FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A), suggesting that IL-17RA and Act1 may associate directly or indirectly. Interestingly, TRAF6 was co-precipitated with FLAG-IL-17RA, similar to the previous report (8Schwandner R. Yamaguchi K. Cao Z. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), suggesting that TRAF6 exists in the same complex. In contrast, MyD88 under the same condition was not co-precipitated with IL-17RA and TRAF6 (Fig. 2A). To examine the association of Act1 with IL-17RA complex in a more physiological setting, we treated a lung epithelial cell line, A549, with IL-17, and IL-17RA was immunoprecipitated with an anti-IL-17RA antibody. Endogenous Act1 protein constitutively associated with IL-17RA, which was transiently enhanced after IL-17 treatment (Fig. 2B). To further assess whether Act1 and IL-17RA form direct association, recombinant full-length Act1 with a HA tag was produced by in vitro transcription and translation system. Also, GST fusion construct of cytoplasmic domain of IL-17RA was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. A GST pulldown assay revealed that these proteins indeed form association in vitro (Fig. 2C), indicating that they can directly interact. To examine whether this interaction is mediated by a homotypic interaction, a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing the SEFIR domain of Act1 was used to precipitate associated proteins from lysates of 293 cells expressing a HA-tagged cytoplasmic domain of IL-17RA. Indeed, Act1 SEFIR domain but not GST control was sufficient to pull down IL-17RA cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2D), indicating that Act1 and IL-17RA can form homotypic association mediated by SEFIR domain. Therefore, Act1 physically associates with IL-17RA and may be involved in IL-17RA signaling. Act1 Is Required for IL-17-induced Gene Expression—Next we examined whether the interaction between Act1 and IL-17RA is required for IL-17-mediated gene expression. To facilitate this, we investigated whether Act1 could be silenced by an Act1-specific shRNA. A fibroblast line was established with a retroviral construct expressing Act1 shRNA. As determined by Western blot, Act1 was reduced over 70% in cells expressing shRNA (Fig. 3A), indicative of efficient silencing of Act1. Upon treatments with IL-17 in the presence or absence of TNF-α, IL-6 production was reduced by about 50% in Act1-shRNA MEF (Fig. 3B). In addition, the level of IκBα protein was maintained in Act1-shRNA MEF, while IκBα was degraded in WT MEF upon IL-17 treatment, indicating a critical role of Act1 in activating NF-κB pathway (Fig. 3C). Since both WT and Act1-shRNA MEF all efficiently degraded IκBα in response to TNF-α (Fig. 3C), Act1 is selectively required for IL-17RA signaling leading to NF-κB activation. To substantiate this observation, we examined inflammatory gene expression in wild-type and Act1-deficient MEF treated with various cytokines. Up-regulation of chemokines such as MCP-1(CCL2) and MCP-3(CCL7) were completely abrogated in the absence of Act1 (Fig. 3D). It was reported that IL-17 also induces transcription factors, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. In addition, IκBζ, an inducible nuclear protein that is highly homologous to the IκB family member Bcl-3, is induced by IL-17 (17Shen F. Ruddy M.J. Plamondon P. Gaffen S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Inductions of these transcriptional regulators also depended on Act1 (Fig. 3E). However, no defect was observed in Act1-silenced or -deficient cells after treatment TNF-α, IL-1β, and LPS (Fig. 3, B, D, and E), indicating Act1 is selectively required for IL-17 signaling in fibroblasts. Altogether, our study demonstrates that IL-17RA use a novel adaptor, Act1, as a membrane-proximal factor to initiate the signaling. Act1 likely recruits TRAF6 and other signaling intermediates to IL-17RA complex. Deficiency of Act1 in fibroblasts leads to impaired NF-κB activation and deficiency of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines upon IL-17 treatment. Based on these in vitro our observations, we expect significant contribution of Act1 in IL-17-mediated autoimmune disease. Additional studies are required to elucidate how IL-17RA signaling complex is organized, whether other members of the IL-17RA family utilize Act1 and whether Act1-independent pathway of IL-17 signaling exists. Nonetheless, this study also suggests that interruption of Act1-dependent signaling events may help alleviate immunopathology mediated by IL-17 and IL-17-producing T cells.

https://openalex.org/W2024692400,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an extracellular multifunctional protein belonging to the serpin superfamily with demonstrable neurotrophic, gliastatic, neuronotrophic, antiangiogenic, and antitumorigenic properties. We have previously provided biochemical evidence for high affinity PEDF-binding sites and proteins in plasma membranes of retina, retinoblastoma, and CNS cells. This study was designed to reveal a receptor involved in the biological activities of PEDF. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a novel gene from pigment epithelium of the human retina that codes for a PEDF-binding partner, which we term PEDF-R. The derived polypeptide has putative transmembrane, intracellular and extracellular regions, and a phospholipase domain. Recently, PEDF-R (TTS-2.2/independent phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>)ζ and mouse desnutrin/ATGL) has been described in adipose cells as a member of the new calcium-independent PLA<sub>2</sub>/nutrin/patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 2 (PNPLA2) family that possesses triglyceride lipase and acylglycerol transacylase activities. Here we describe the <i>PEDF-R</i> gene expression in the retina and its heterologous expression by bacterial and eukaryotic systems, and we demonstrate that its protein product has specific and high binding affinity for PEDF, has a potent phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activity that liberates fatty acids, and is associated with eukaryotic cell membranes. Most importantly, PEDF binding stimulates the enzymatic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activity of PEDF-R. In conclusion, we have identified a novel <i>PEDF-R</i> gene in the retina for a phospholipase-linked membrane protein with high affinity for PEDF, suggesting a molecular pathway by which ligand/receptor interaction on the cell surface could generate a cellular signal."
https://openalex.org/W2011647937,"Triacylglycerols are the predominant molecules of energy storage in eukaryotes. However, excessive accumulation of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue leads to obesity and, in nonadipose tissues, is associated with tissue dysfunction. Hence, it is of great importance to have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of triacylglycerol synthesis. The final step in triacylglycerol synthesis is catalyzed by the acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2. Although recent studies have shed light on metabolic functions of these enzymes, little is known about the molecular aspects of their structures or functions. Here we report the topology for murine DGAT2 and the identification of key amino acids that likely contribute to enzymatic function. Our data indicate that DGAT2 is an integral membrane protein with both the N and C termini oriented toward the cytosol. A long hydrophobic region spanning amino acids 66-115 likely comprises two transmembrane domains or, alternatively, a single domain that is embedded in the membrane bilayer. The bulk of the protein lies distal to the transmembrane domains. This region shares the highest degree of homology with other enzymes of the DGAT2 family and contains a sequence HPHG that is conserved in all family members. Mutagenesis of this sequence in DGAT2 demonstrated that it is required for full enzymatic function. Additionally, a neutral lipid-binding domain that is located in the putative first transmembrane domain was also required for full enzymatic function. Our findings provide the first insights into the topography and molecular aspects of DGAT2 and related enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2015946135,"Upon DNA damage, replication is inhibited by the S-phase checkpoint. ATR (ataxia telangiectasia mutated- and Rad3-related) is specifically involved in the inhibition of replicon initiation when cells are treated with DNA damage-inducing agents that stall replication forks, but the mechanism by which it acts to prevent replication is not yet fully understood. We observed that RPA2 is phosphorylated on chromatin in an ATR-dependent manner when replication forks are stalled. Mutation of the ATR-dependent phosphorylation sites in RPA2 leads to a defect in the down-regulation of DNA synthesis following treatment with UV radiation, although ATR activation is not affected. Threonine 21 and serine 33, two residues among several phosphorylation sites in the amino terminus of RPA2, are specifically required for the UV-induced, ATR-mediated inhibition of DNA replication. RPA2 mutant alleles containing phospho-mimetic mutations at ATR-dependent phosphorylation sites have an impaired ability to associate with replication centers, indicating that ATR phosphorylation of RPA2 directly affects the replication function of RPA. Our studies suggest that in response to UV-induced DNA damage, ATR rapidly phosphorylates RPA2, disrupting its association with replication centers in the S-phase and contributing to the inhibition of DNA replication.

Cell cycle checkpoints are surveillance mechanisms to monitor chromatin structures and arrest the cell cycle when DNA damage is detected (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J.

Defects in checkpoint pathways lead to significant genome instability. Checkpoints are operated by DNA damage signal transduction pathways that send damage signals from sensor proteins through transducing proteins to downstream effector proteins, so that different cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest and damage repair, can be activated.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar).The S-phase checkpoint inhibits ongoing DNA replication as soon as DNA lesions are detected, allowing time for DNA repair to take place before replication continues (4Bartek J.

In the IR-induced S-phase checkpoint, two parallel pathways mediated by Chk2-Cdc25A and Nbs1/Mre11/Rad50, respectively, have been described to mediate ATM-dependent replication inhibition (6Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms of how ATR regulates its downstream effectors to control replication are not clear.RPA is a heterotrimeric protein complex that binds specifically to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (9Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). It is composed of three subunits, RPA1 (70 kDa), RPA2 (32 kDa), and RPA3 (14 kDa), and plays multiple roles in DNA metabolism (10Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 11Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). RPA is required for DNA replication initiation, as well as replication elongation (12Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). At the onset of DNA replication, RPA is loaded onto chromatin after the binding of Cdc45 to origins (13Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). RPA is needed for subsequent loading of DNA polymerase α and other replication proteins to initiate DNA replication (14Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After DNA replication begins, RPA moves with replication forks, stabilizing ssDNA and assisting in DNA synthesis. In addition to its replication function, RPA is also known to play essential roles in damage repair and recombination (15Ramilo C. Gu L. Guo S. Zhang X. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Li G.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Park M.S. Ludwig D.L. Stigger E. Lee S.H. J. Biol.

Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar, 19Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, recent studies also indicate that RPA may not be absolutely required for ATR activation, and alternative pathways may exist (20Dodson G.E. Shi Y. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34010-34014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The interaction of RPA with ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) is important for promoting recruitment of ATR/ATRIP to damage-induced foci, but may be dispensable for ATR activation to phosphorylate Chk1 (21Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 22Kim S.M. Kumagai A. Lee J. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38355-38364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).When cells enter S-phase, RPA is phosphorylated, primarily on the RPA2 subunit at the cyclin-dependent kinase sites (23Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Fang F. Newport J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 983-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fotedar R. Roberts J.M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 27Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In response to UV or hydroxyurea (HU) treatment specifically, seven additional residues clustered in the extreme amino terminus of RPA2 have been identified as potential sites of RPA2 phosphorylation (29Zernik-Kobak M.

In mammalian cells, the PI3-like kinases, including DNA-PK, ATM, and ATR, are implicated in the phosphorylation of RPA2 following DNA damage. DNA-PK plays an important role in IR-induced damage repair, particularly in nonhomologous end joining (31Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). DNA-PK interacts with RPA and phosphorylates RPA2 both in vivo and in vitro (28Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W.

Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Chan D.W. Son S.C. Block W. Ye R. Khanna K.K. Wold M.S. Douglas P. Goodarzi A.A. Pelley J. Taya Y. Lavin M.F. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7803-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The involvement of ATR in RPA2 phosphorylation, however, is not quite clear. It has been reported that RPA2 is a good substrate of ATR in vitro (36Liu J.S. Kuo S.R. Melendy T. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but whether ATR phosphorylates RPA2 in vivo and whether this phosphorylation affects RPA function following DNA damage are unknown. The observation that caffeine treatment does not further reduce RPA2 phosphorylation in ATM-deficient cells has led to the conclusion that ATR phosphorylation of RPA2 may not be relevant in vivo (37Wang H. Guan J. Wang H. Perrault A.R. Wang Y. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8554-8563PubMed Google Scholar).Here we show that RPA2 is phosphorylated on chromatin in an ATR-dependent manner when cells are treated with DNA damage-inducing agents that block replication. We demonstrate that not only does ATR phosphorylate RPA2 directly in vitro, but RPA2 phosphorylation on chromatin after UV or HU treatment in vivo is dependent on ATR protein levels and on its kinase activity. Mutations at the ATR-dependent phosphorylation sites of RPA2 specifically impair ATR-mediated replication inhibition following UV treatment. Analysis of phosphomimetic mutants of RPA2 at ATR phosphorylation sites suggests that ATR-dependent RPA2 phosphorylation likely prevents RPA association with replication centers. These studies suggest that RPA2 is a physiologically relevant substrate of ATR in vivo and is a direct effector of ATR to inhibit replication following UV-induced DNA damage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Retroviral Infections, and shRNA—U2OS, 293T, GM847, or GM847/ATR-KD cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% super calf serum. To induce expression of ATR-KD in the GM847 fibroblasts, 1 μg/ml of doxycycline was added to the media 24 h prior to chromatin isolation (38Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). HA-tagged RPA2 or mutant forms of RPA2 were introduced into U2OS cells by retroviral infection followed by selection of puromycin-resistant cells. Silencing of endogenous RPA2 in these cells was accomplished by two rounds of retroviral infection using pMKO vector (39Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben Porath I. Currier J.L. Metz G.B. Brooks M.W.

Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) followed by selection of G418- and hygromycin-resistant cells. Endogenous ATR, ATM, Chk1, and DNA-PK were silenced in U2OS cells by two rounds of retroviral infection using pMKO vector that expressed two different shRNA target sequences. The target sequences used for ATR silencing were AACCUCCGUGAUGUUGCUUGA (41Casper A.M. Nghiem P. Arlt M.F. Glover T.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 779-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and CGAGACUUCUGCGGAUUGCAG. The target sequences used for ATM silencing were AACAUACUACUCAAAGACAUU, and GCACCAGUCCAGUAUUGGCUU. The target sequences used to silence Chk1 were AAGCGUGCCGUAGACUGUCCA and AAGUACUCCAGUUCUCAGCCA. The target sequences used for DNA-PK silencing were GGGCGCUAAUCGUACUGAAAC and GAUCGCACCUUACUCUGUUGA (42An J. Xu Q.Z. Sui J.L. Bai B. Zhou P.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 117: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Plasmids, Mutagenesis, and GST Protein Purification—To generate the serine to alanine mutations in RPA2, HA-tagged full-length RPA2 cloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3β was used as template for several rounds of site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). HA-tagged wild-type RPA2 and mutant forms generated by site-directed mutagenesis were cloned into the retroviral vector pBabepuro. GST-tagged RPA2 fragments were made by cloning a PCR product generated using wild-type RPA2, or one of the mutant forms of RPA2 as a template, into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with 15 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). His-tagged RPA was constructed by cloning a PCR product made using pt11d-RPA, a generous gift from Marc Wold, as a template into pET28b (Novagen). His-tagged RPA containing phospho-mimetic mutations in RPA2 were generated by sitedirected mutagenesis of pET28b-RPA. His-tagged RPA fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 E. coli cells after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen).Immunoprecipitation and Chromatin Isolation—Cells were lysed in NETN (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating primary antibodies with cell lysates at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by the addition of secondary antibody (MP Biomedicals) and protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) for one additional hour. For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated overnight in primary antibodies followed by 1 h of incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.For chromatin isolation, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, collected, resuspended in CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), and incubated at 4 °C for 5 min. Cytoplasmic proteins were separated from nuclei by low speed centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 5 min. Isolated nuclei were washed once in CSK buffer, lysed in solution B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in CSK buffer and 2× SDS loading buffer and boiled.Pulldown Assays—His-tagged RPA wild type (RPA1-RPA2-RPA3 complex) or the RPA complex containing serine or threonine to aspartate mutations at specific residues in RPA2 were purified from E. coli on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). Primase subunits were expressed from baculoviruses infected either individually or in different combinations in insect cells. Insect cells were lysed 48 h after infection, and the lysates were combined with RPA-bound Ni-NTA at 4 °C for 4 h. After extensive washing, primase subunits retained on the RPA beads were analyzed by Western blot.Immunofluorescence—For immunostaining analysis of retrovirally infected U2OS cells, cells grown directly on glass coverslips were washed in PBS and then either fixed directly with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (nonextracted) or extracted first with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min (extracted), fixed with a modified Streck tissue fixative for 30 min at room temperature, and permeabilized for 15 min at room temperature as described previously (43Nelms B.E.

Cells were blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS and then stained with primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-RPA1; polyclonal anti-HA) at 4 °C overnight. The following morning, the cells were washed and stained for 1 h at room temperature with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The frequency of cells with chromatin-bound HA-RPA2 was determined by counting the number of RPA1-positive staining cells with HA-RPA2 foci after extraction from three independent experiments. To detect damage foci, asynchronized cells were fixed by 70% methanol and 30% acetone at -20 °C for 15 min, followed by immunostaining analysis as described above.Antibodies—The antibodies used in this study were purchased from Oncogene (ATM, RPA1, and RPA2), Bethyl Laboratories (RPA2-S4/8P and RPA2-S33P), Calbiochem (ATR), Covance (mono-HA), Cell Signaling Technology (pT68-Chk2), R&D Systems (pS317-Chk1), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Chk1, Chk2, and Ku70), Serotec (DNA-PK), Neomarkers (primase p48 and p58), and Upstate (poly-HA). Monoclonal antibodies 9D5 (recognizing p68) and 1CT 102 and 2CT25 (recognizing p180) were described previously (45Ott R.D. Rehfuess C. Podust V.N. Clark J.E. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5669-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Kinase Assays—For ATR or Chk1 in vitro kinase assays, pcDNA3 containing FLAG-tagged ATR (a generous gift from R. T. Abraham) or HA-tagged Chk1 (a generous gift from C. H. McGowan) was transiently transfected into 293T cells and immunoprecipitated on anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) or with an anti-HA antibody and protein A-agarose (Calbiochem), respectively. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed (three times in NETN and two times in kinase buffer) and then incubated with the glutathione-eluted GST fusion proteins in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP in either ATR kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 10mm MgCl2, 1mm DTT) or Chk1 kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2B, 1mm DTT) at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to film. Coomassie-stained gels were used to confirm that equal amounts of substrate proteins were added to the kinase reactions.UV-resistant DNA Synthesis (UVDS)—Inhibition of DNA synthesis following exposure to UV light was performed by growing U2OS cells in the presence of 0.02 μCi per ml [14C]thymidine for 24 h. Several hours after the removal of [14C]thymidine, cells were either mock-treated or irradiated with 10 J/m2 of UV light, allowed to recover 1 h, and then labeled with 2.5 μCi per ml [3H]thymidine for 15 min. Cells were spotted onto Whatman glass microfiber filters and washed with trichloroacetic acid and 100% ethanol. The filters were allowed to dry, and radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter and a dual energy program.Recovery from S-phase Arrest—U2OS cells expressing HA-tagged RPA2 or the HA-tagged RPA2 phospho-mutant with endogenous RPA2 silenced were grown in the presence of 1 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h. To release the cells, they were extensively washed in PBS and put into fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without hydroxyurea. At specific times following release, cells were trypsinized from the plates and fixed for flow cytometry analysis.Cellular Viability—Cellular viability was determined in U2OS cells where endogenous RPA2 levels were reduced by retroviral infection of one or two shRNAs directed against the 3′-UTR of the RPA2 mRNA or in U2OS cells that were first infected with either HA-tagged RPA2 or with the HA-tagged RPA2 phospho-mutant, followed by two rounds of retroviral infection of the RPA2 shRNA. Forty eight hours after the final retroviral infection of the RPA2 shRNA, cells from each cell line were counted and plated in triplicate at 1 × 104 cells per plate. Three days later, cells were stained with trypan blue and counted. The experiment was repeated three times, and the average number of surviving cells from each cell line was normalized to the average number of viable, uninfected U2OS cells that were plated as a control for each experiment.RESULTSATR Kinase Activity Is Required for RPA2 Hyperphosphorylation on Chromatin in Response to UV or HU Treatment—Chromatin was isolated from U2OS cells after exposure to UV light or treatment with HU. Consistent with previous reports (18Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar, 46Barr S.M. Leung C.G. Chang E.E. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1047-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), RPA1 and RPA2 were both recruited to the chromatin (Fig. 1A, compare the soluble versus the chromatin fractions), and several slower migrating forms of RPA2 appeared specifically on the chromatin after UV and HU treatments (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate conclusively that the slower migrating bands of RPA2 detectable after DNA damage were a result of hyperphosphorylation of the protein, chromatin isolated from U2OS cells exposed to UV light or HU was treated with λ phosphatase. Following phosphatase treatment, the mobility of RPA2 reverted to that of RPA2 from mock-treated cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown), indicating that all of the slower migrating forms of RPA2 detected upon UV or HU treatment are phosphorylated forms of RPA2. Notably, exposure to UV light and HU, two DNA damage-inducing agents that stall replication forks, significantly increased RPA recruitment to the chromatin and RPA2 hyperphosphorylation, and this recruitment and phosphorylation were not detectable after 20 Gy of IR treatment (Fig. 1A). Although RPA2 phosphorylation can be induced with an extremely high dose of IR (100 Gy (27Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5700-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)), this result suggested that RPA2 hyperphosphorylation on chromatin is more prevalent when replication forks are stalled than when DNA double strand breaks are introduced.Because ATR is activated in response to both UV light and HU, we investigated whether RPA recruitment to the chromatin or RPA2 phosphorylation depends on ATR kinase activity. Chromatin was isolated from an SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line GM847 or from GM847 cells expressing a doxycyclineinducible kinase-inactive allele of ATR ((GM847-KD) (47Cliby W.A. Lewis K.A. Lilly K.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1599-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar)) after cells were mock-treated, treated with HU, or exposed to UV light. Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser-317 after UV treatment was reduced when the overexpression of ATR-KD was induced (supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that ATR activity was inhibited. Compared with GM847 cells that had normal ATR kinase activity, cells overexpressing the kinase-inactive allele of ATR (GM847-KD) showed a substantial decrease in RPA2 hyperphosphorylation on the chromatin following UV and HU treatment, as evidenced by the reduction in the hyperphosphorylated form of RPA2 detected by an anti-RPA2 antibody, and the reduction in serine 33 phosphorylation detected using a Ser-33 phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 1C). RPA recruitment to the chromatin was not affected by the overexpression of the kinase-inactive allele of ATR. In fact, there was a significant increase in the unphosphorylated chromatin-bound RPA2 in the GM847-KD cells presumably because of an inability to phosphorylate RPA2 following chromatin loading (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that ATR kinase activity is required for RPA2 hyperphosphorylation, but not for recruitment of RPA to the chromatin following UV and HU treatment.To confirm this result, endogenous ATR expression was silenced by expressing two ATR-shRNA sequences from a retroviral vector (39Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben Porath I. Currier J.L. Metz G.B. Brooks M.W. Kaneko S. Murakami S. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Cell. 2003; 114: 241-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In the presence of the shRNAs directed against ATR, ATR protein levels were significantly reduced (Fig. 1D, top). In addition, both Chk1 phosphorylation and H2AX phosphorylation following UV light, two well characterized ATR-dependent phosphorylation events, were also reduced when compared with the levels of phosphorylation in the vector-infected cells (Fig. 1D, top and data not shown). To look at RPA2 hyperphosphorylation in these cells, the soluble and the chromatin fractions were isolated after exposure to UV or HU treatment. RPA recruitment to the chromatin was again not affected by the reduction in ATR expression (Fig. 1D, compare the soluble versus the chromatin fractions for RPA1 and RPA2), but RPA2 hyperphosphorylation was significantly reduced when ATR was silenced, and there was an accumulation of the chromatin-bound unphosphorylated form of RPA2 in response to both UV and HU treatment (Fig. 1D).Among the multiple UV-inducible phosphorylation sites that have been mapped at the amino terminus of RPA2 (29Zernik-Kobak M.

Nevertheless, using phospho-specific antibodies to serine 33, or serines 4 and 8, we observed that both UV- and HU-induced phosphorylation at Ser-33, and at the Ser-4/Ser-8 sites, were reduced when ATR activity was inhibited (Fig. 1, C and D, bottom). Taken together, our results suggest that in response to UV light or HU, RPA is recruited to the chromatin in an ATR-independent manner, and RPA2 is then phosphorylated at several sites in its amino terminus in an ATR-dependent manner.DNA-PK and ATM Do Not Significantly Contribute to UV- or HU-induced RPA2 Phosphorylation on Chromatin—To determine the contribution of the other members of the PI3-like family of kinases to UV- or HU-induced RPA2 phosphorylation on chromatin, we silenced DNA-PK or ATM in U2OS cells by retroviral infection of two"
https://openalex.org/W2090672652,"Upon herpesvirus infection, viral DNA becomes associated with nuclear structures known as nuclear domain 10 (ND10). The role of ND10 during herpesvirus infection has long been contentious; data arguing for a role for ND10 in repression of infection have been countered by other data showing little effect of ND10 on virus infection. Here we show that knockdown of human Daxx (hDaxx) expression, an important component of ND10, prior to infection with human cytomegalovirus resulted in increased levels of viral immediate early RNA and protein expression and that this correlated with an increased association of the major immediate early promoter with markers of transcriptionally active chromatin. Conversely, we also show that stable overexpression of hDaxx renders cells refractory to cytomegalovirus immediate early gene expression. Intriguingly, this hDaxx-mediated repression appears to be restricted to cells stably overexpressing hDaxx and is not recapitulated in transient transfection assays. Finally, hDaxx-mediated repression of cytomegalovirus major immediate early gene expression was overcome by infecting at higher virus titers, suggesting that an incoming viral structural protein or viral DNA is responsible for overcoming the repression of viral gene expression in hDaxx superexpressing cells. These data suggest that hDaxx in ND10 functions at the site of cytomegalovirus genome deposition to repress transcription of incoming viral genomes and that this repression is mediated by a direct and immediate effect of hDaxx on chromatin modification around the viral major immediate early promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2127343506,"Ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) hydrolyzes mono and polyubiquitylated targets such as epidermal growth factor receptors and is involved in clathrin-mediated internalization. In 1182 residues, USP8 contains multiple domains, including coiled-coil, rhodanese, and catalytic domains. We report the first high-resolution crystal structures of these domains and discuss their implications for USP8 function. The amino-terminal domain is a homodimer with a novel fold. It is composed of two five-helix bundles, where the first helices are swapped, and carboxyl-terminal helices are extended in an antiparallel fashion. The structure of the rhodanese domain, determined in complex with the E3 ligase NRDP1, reveals the canonical rhodanese fold but with a distorted primordial active site. The USP8 recognition domain of NRDP1 has a novel protein fold that interacts with a conserved peptide loop of the rhodanese domain. A consensus sequence of this loop is found in other NRDP1 targets, suggesting a common mode of interaction. The structure of the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of USP8 exhibits the conserved tripartite architecture but shows unique traits. Notably, the active site, including the ubiquitin binding pocket, is in a closed conformation, incompatible with substrate binding. The presence of a zinc ribbon subdomain near the ubiquitin binding site further suggests a polyubiquitin-specific binding site and a mechanism for substrate induced conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W2050754241,"The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for embryonic development and carcinogenesis. Activation of Hh signaling has been identified in several types of gastrointestinal cancers, including esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and liver cancers. Several recent studies suggest that Hh signaling activation can inhibit Wnt signaling. However, the molecular basis underlying this inhibition remains unclear. As transcription factors in the Hh signaling pathway, Gli molecules transform cells in culture, and their expression are associated with cancer development. Here we report that expression of a secreted frizzled-related protein-sFRP-1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts is dependent on Gli1 and Gli2. In human gastric cancer cells, inhibition of Hh signaling reduces the level of sFRP-1 transcript, whereas ectopic expression of Gli1 increases the level of sFRP-1 transcript. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation indicate that Gli1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of sFRP-1. In 293 cells with Gli1 expression, Wnt-1-mediated β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol and DKK1 expression are all abrogated, which can be reversed by inhibiting sFRP-1 expression. Furthermore, while SIIA cells do not respond to Wnt-1-conditioned medium, inhibition of Hh signaling by smoothened (SMO) antagonist KAAD-cyclopamine (keto-N-aminoethylaminocaproyldihydrocinnamoylcyclopamine) leads to Wnt1-mediated β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol.

Expression of sonic hedgehog appears to stabilize SMO protein possibly through post-translational modification of SMO. In Drosophila, SMO stabilization triggers complex formation with Costal-2, Fused, and Gli homologue cubitus interruptus, which prevents cubitus interruptus degradation and formation of a transcriptional repressor (4Lum L.

STKE. 2005; 2005: cm1PubMed Google Scholar). Two recent studies indicate that tumors with activated Hh signaling often do not have nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, a major indicator for the canonical Wnt signaling (16Huang S. He J. Zhang X.

One study indicates that Indian Hh negatively regulates Wnt signaling (20van den Brink G.R. Bleuming S.A. Hardwick J.C. Schepman B.L. Offerhaus G.J. Keller J.J. Nielsen C.

Genet. 2004; 36: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar); however, the molecular basis for such an inhibition remains elusive. SFRP-1 is a 30-kDa glycoprotein that was first identified as the antagonist of Wnt signaling and regulator of apoptosis (21Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The sFRP-1 gene is frequently up-regulated in Hh-activated tumors (22Romer J.T. Kimura H. Magdaleno S. Sasai K. Fuller C. Baines H. Connelly M. Stewart C.F. Gould S. Rubin L.L. Curran T. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We have found that expression of sFRP-1 is dependent on Gli1 and Gli2 in MEF cells and regulated by the Hh pathway in gastric cancer cell lines. Gli1 protein appears to be involved in regulation of the endogenous sFRP-1 promoter. As a consequence of Hh signaling activation and consequent sFRP-1 expression, Wnt-1-mediated β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol and DKK1 expression are inhibited. This inhibition can be reversed when sFRP-1 expression is reduced. These data indicate that sFRP-1 serves as the molecular link for Hh signaling-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling. Cell Culture and Plasmids—The SIIA cell line was established in the Department of Surgery in our institution (23Barranco S.C. Weintraub B. MacLean K.K. Beasley E.G. Jenkins V.K. Townsend Jr., C.M. Invest. New Drugs. 1991; 9: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). AGS is another cell line from gastric adenocarcinomas used in this study. Both cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Mark Hellmich and cultured according to the suggested conditions (14Ma X. Chen K. Huang S. Zhang X. Adegboyega P.A. Evers B.M. Zhang H. Xie J.

Ectopic expression of Gli1 in AGS cells was achieved by the stable retrovirus infection. For retrovirus infection, pLNCX-Gli1 (MYC-tagged) was transfected into Phoenix packaging cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Supernatant was collected 24–48 h post-transfection (24Sheng T. Chi S. Zhang X. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Empty pLNCX vector was used to produce the control retrovirus. Infection for AGS cells was carried out overnight in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. A day later, 250 μg/ml G418 was added to the culture medium for selection of a pool of Gli1 stable expressing clones. Western blot was used to detect the Gli1 protein. 293-Wnt1 cells were made from the pLNCX-Wnt1 plasmid (25Chen R.H. Ding W.V. McCormick F. J. Biol.

Total RNA of cells was extracted using a RNA extraction kit from Promega according to the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI), and quantitative PCR analyses were performed according to a previously published procedure using primers and probes from Applied Biosystems (16Huang S.

Triplicate CT values were analyzed in Microsoft Excel using the comparative CT(ΔΔCT) method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The amount of target (2–ΔΔCT) was obtained by normalization to an endogenous reference (18 S RNA) and relative to a calibrator. We performed RT-PCR of Gli1, sFRP-1, and HIP with 32 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s with the following primers: Gli1, 5′-GGAATTCTGTTTCCCCAGGT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ACCCCCTGGACTCTCTTGAT-3′ (reverse primer); sFRP-1, 5′-CCCTCGGGGAACTTGTCACA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCTCAACAAGAACTGCCACA-3′ (reverse primer); HIP, 5′-TGCTAAGCCTCGCATTCCA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ACAACCCTAAGAATGTGGTCATGA-3′ (reverse primer). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in protein loading buffer, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, protein was electrotransferred on nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and blotted against appropriate primary antibodies (sFRP-1 antibodies were from R&D System, Inc., catalog number AF 1384; Myc-tag (9B-11) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Inc., catalog number 2276; β-catenin antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratory, catalog number 610154; β-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, which was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Different dilutions were used for different primary antibodies: anti-sFRP-1, 1:1,000; anti-β-catenin, 1:1,000; anti-MYC 9B11, 1:5,000; and anti-β actin, 1:5,000. The protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (24Sheng T. Chi S. Zhang X. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Log-phase AGS cells and the AGS cells with ectopic Gli1 expression (2 × 107 cells for each immunoprecipitation experiment) were cultured and fixed by the addition of formaldehyde (1% (w/v) final concentration) for 10 min. After addition of 125 mm glycine, cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended in 900 μl of lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors and left for 10 min at 4 °C. DNA was sheared by sonication to yield an average length of 500–700 bp and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Lysates were diluted with the dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). 100 μlofthe sample was used as the “input,” and the rest of sample was incubated with 1 μg of MYC or the control HA antibody beads at 4 °C for overnight. Gli1-DNA complexes were isolated by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 1 min, and pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of 1× dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) and three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation wash buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid) for 5 min with rotation. After wash, 200 μl of digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K) was added to each sample, incubated at 55 °C for 3 h, followed by 6 h at 65°C. The samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform following by precipitation with ethanol at –80 °C in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen overnight. The pellets were suspended in 20 μl of TE buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). PCR was performed with 35 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s using the following primers flanking the putative Gli-binding sites in the human sFRP-1 promoter: sFRP-1F, 5′-GTTGGAGCTGTTTGCTGTGA-3′; sFRP-1R, 5′-ATGTTTTGGCTTTCCACACC-3′. Cell Fractionation—Following treatment with KAAD-cyclopamine (2.5 μm) for 24 h (for SIIA cells) or conditioned medium from 293-Wnt1 cells for 3 h (for 293 cells), the cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline for each 10 cm dish, and collected by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were incubated with 2 ml of hypotonic buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m sodium fluoride, 0.5 m, 1× proteinase inhibitor). After 20 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions as the cytoplasmic and membrane fraction were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions (containing the cytosol) were collected (25Chen R.H. Ding W.V. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17894-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). All extracts were normalized for protein amounts determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE for further analysis. Antibodies to β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratory) were used to detect the level of β-catenin in different fractions. To identify Hh target genes, we compared gene expression between wild type MEFs and Gli1–/–/Gli2–/– MEF cells. We found that expression of sFRP-1 was dependent on Gli1 and Gli2. As shown in Fig. 1A, the sFRP-1 mRNA level in wild type MEFs was about 3-fold higher than that in Gli1/Gli2 double knock-out MEF cells. This result was further confirmed by the Northern blot analysis (data not shown). To validate the results in cancer cells, we detected the sFRP-1 mRNA expression in the human cancer cell lines with activated Hh pathway. As shown in Fig. 1B, the Hh activation level was lower in AGS cells than that in SIIA cells. Consistent with Hh signaling activation, a higher level of sFRP-1 mRNA expression was detected in SIIA cells (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemistry analysis of primary human cancers further confirmed that sFRP-1 was expressed highly in gastric cancer specimens with activated Hh signaling (data not shown). Following ectopic expression of Gli1 via retrovirus-mediated gene transfer in AGS cells, we further showed that sFRP-1 expression was induced (Fig. 1C). Conversely, treatment of SIIA cells for 12 h with SMO antagonist, KAAD-cyclopamine, decreased the sFRP-1 mRNA level by 80% in SIIA cells (Fig. 1D). To confirm the expression of sFRP-1 at the protein level, we performed Western blotting analysis using conditioned medium of SIIA cells since sFRP-1 is a secreted molecule. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, we found that sFRP-1 protein expression was reduced after KAAD-cyclopamine treatment in SIIA cells. These data indicate that expression of sFRP-1 is regulated by Hh signaling. To determine whether Gli transcription factors are involved in regulation of the sFRP-1 promoter, we analyzed the promoter sequence of sFRP-1 and found two putative Gli-binding sites. We performed ChIP assays to assess whether Gli1 is involved in binding the endogenous sFRP-1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 2, we found that immunoprecipitation of ectopically expressed Gli1 can pull down the endogenous sFRP-1 promoter DNA sequence containing one Gli-putative binding site, suggesting that Gli1 is involved in regulation of the sFRP-1 promoter. It is known that sFRP-1 is an inhibitor for Wnt signaling (21Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To understand if Hh-induced sFRP-1 expression affects Wnt signaling, we assessed β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol of 293 cells in different conditions. Consistent with previous published results (25Chen R.H. Ding W.V. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17894-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), Wnt-1 conditioned medium significantly induced β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol (Fig. 3A). However, following expression of Gli1, Wnt-1-mediated β-catenin accumulation was greatly reduced (Fig. 3A). In both cases, no significant changes of membrane β-catenin were observed (supplemental Fig. 2). To confirm this result, we examined the expression of DKK1, a Wnt target gene (27Chamorro M.N. Schwartz D.R. Vonica A. Brivanlou A.H. Cho K.R. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), in these cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, while Wnt-1-conditioned medium induced expression of DKK1 by 3-fold, ectopic expression of Gli1 prevented Wnt-1-mediated induction of DKK1. As predicted, Gli1 expression was accompanied by elevated level of sFRP-1 in the conditioned medium (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). This induction was independent of new protein synthesis because addition of cycloheximide did not affect the level of sFRP-1 (supplemental Fig. 3C). To test whether sFRP-1 is required for Gli1-mediated inhibition of Wnt-1 signaling, we knocked down sFRP-1 in Gli-expressing 293 cells. We found that following sFRP-1 knockdown (supplemental Fig. 4), Wnt-1-conditioned media were able to induce cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 3A) as well as DKK1 expression (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrated that Hh signaling attenuates Wnt signaling in 293 cells through regulation of sFRP-1 expression. We hypothesized that if sFRP-1 is induced in cancer cells with activated Hh signaling, these cells should be insensitive to Wnt-1 stimulation. Indeed, we found that Wnt-1-conditioned medium did not cause β-catenin accumulation in SIIA cells, which have active hedgehog signaling. However, following inhibition of Hh signaling by KAAD-cyclopamine (2.5 μm), which is accompanied by reduced expression of sFRP-1 (Fig. 1D), Wnt-1-conditioned medium was able to stimulate cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 3C). These data confirm that Hh signaling affects Wnt signaling through regulation of sFRP-1. The biological relevance of our findings were reflected by the fact that most gastrointestinal cancer specimens with Hh signaling activation did not have elevated cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin (16Huang S.

Koga K. Nakashima H. Yao T. Tsuneyoshi M. Tanaka M. Katano M. Gut. 2006; 55: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As we showed in liver and gastric cancers, only one out of 40 tumors with activated Hh signaling contains nuclear localization of β-catenin (the p value < 0.03) (16Huang S. He J. Zhang X. Bian Y. Yang L. Xie G. Zhang K. Tang W. Stelter A.A. Wang Q. Zhang H. Xie J. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In summary, our data provide direct evidence to support that sFRP-1 is the downstream target gene of Hh signaling that mediates the suppressive effect on Wnt signaling. Our data from ChIP assay suggest that the Hh signaling pathway regulates sFRP-1 expression through the promoter. The inappropriate activation of Hh and Wnt signaling occurs frequently in cancer. Recent studies indicate that Ihh serves as an inhibitor for Wnt signaling during colon development and in colon cancer (20van den Brink G.R. Bleuming S.A. Hardwick J.C. Schepman B.L. Offerhaus G.J. Keller J.J. Nielsen C. Gaffield W. van Deventer S.J. Roberts D.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is shown that Gli1 plays an inhibitory role in the development of colorectal cancer involving Wnt signaling (19Akiyoshi T. Nakamura M. Koga K. Nakashima H. Yao T. Tsuneyoshi M. Tanaka M. Katano M. Gut. 2006; 55: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have shown that activation of Hh signaling is rarely associated with nuclear localization of β-catenin in liver cancers (16Huang S. He J. Zhang X. Bian Y. Yang L. Xie G. Zhang K. Tang W. Stelter A.A. Wang Q. Zhang H. Xie J. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that elevated expression of sFRP-1 following activation of the Hh pathway provides the molecular link for the inhibitory effect on Wnt signaling. We have shown that sFRP-1 expression is dependent on Gli1 and Gli2. Tumors with activated Hh signaling have a high level of sFRP-1 expression, and inhibition of Hh signaling also reduces the level of sFRP-1. We further show that Gli1 is involved in binding the endogenous sFRP-1 promoter. SIIA cells in which Hh signaling is activated do not respond to Wnt-1-mediated β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol, whereas inhibition of Hh signaling sensitizes Wnt-1 stimulation. We predict that this inhibitory signaling loop is defective in some cancers in which sFRP-1 is inactivated through promoter methylation (28Suzuki H. Watkins D.N. Jair K.W. Schuebel K.E. Markowitz S.D. Chen W.D. Pretlow T.P. Yang B. Akiyama Y. Van Engeland M. Toyota M. Tokino T. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), which can be tested in future studies. Thus, loss of sFRP-1 not only allows Wnt signaling to occur without proper control but also abrogates the inhibitory effect from the Hh pathway. In addition to elevated expression of sFRP-1, other mechanisms may be also responsible for this inhibitory role, such as β-catenin accumulation (19Akiyoshi T. Nakamura M. Koga K. Nakashima H. Yao T. Tsuneyoshi M. Tanaka M. Katano M. Gut. 2006; 55: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the biological activity of sFRPs has been largely attributed to their inhibition of Wnt activity, other mechanisms of action may exist. Recently sFRP-2 was reported to promote cell adhesion and inhibit apoptosis through an association with a fibronectin-integrin complex and stimulation of integrin signaling (29Lee J.L. Lin C.T. Chueh L.L. Chang C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14602-14609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A screening of peptide library using recombinant sFRP-1 identified several molecules involved in cell-cell signaling, such as RANKL and UNC5H3, a human homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans netrin receptor Unc5 (30Chuman Y. Uren A. Cahill J. Regan C. Wolf V. Kay B.K. Rubin J.S. Peptides. 2004; 25: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to assess if these mechanisms are involved in Hh-mediated signaling in human cancer. We thank Drs. Chunming Liu and Kathy O'Connor for help and Dr. Stuart A.

https://openalex.org/W2023188630,"Amphiregulin (AR) autocrine loops have been associated with several types of cancer. We demonstrate that SUM149 breast cancer cells have a self-sustaining AR autocrine loop. SUM149 cells are epidermal growth factor (EGF)-independent for growth, and they overexpress AR mRNA, AR membrane precursor protein, and secreted AR relative to the EGF-dependent human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A. MCF10A cells made to overexpress AR (MCF10A AR) are also EGF-independent for growth. Treatment with the pan-ErbB inhibitor CI1033 and the anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) antibody C225 demonstrated that ligand-mediated activation of EGFR is required for SUM149 cell proliferation. AR-neutralizing antibody significantly reduced both SUM149 EGFR activity and cell proliferation, confirming that an AR autocrine loop is required for mitogenesis in SUM149 cells. EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was dramatically decreased in both SUM149 and MCF10A AR cells after inhibition of AR cleavage with the broad spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001, indicating that an AR autocrine loop is strictly dependent on AR cleavage in culture. However, a juxtacrine assay where fixed SUM149 cells and MCF10A AR cells were overlaid on top of EGF-deprived MCF10A cells showed that the AR membrane precursor can activate EGFR. SUM149 cells, MCF10A AR cells, and MCF10A cells growing in exogenous AR were all considerably more invasive and motile than MCF10A cells grown in EGF. Moreover, AR up-regulates a number of genes involved in cell motility and invasion in MCF10A cells, suggesting that an AR autocrine loop contributes to the aggressive breast cancer phenotype.

Ligand binding facilitates dimerization of the EGFR, which activates downstream pathways known to be involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration (8Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Each EGF family ligand is expressed as a transmembrane precursor, which is proteolytically cleaved and released into the external milieu. There is no obvious homology in the predicted cleavage sites of the EGFR ligands, but it has been shown that metalloprotease activity is required for their release (9Hinkle C.L. Sunnarborg S.W.

Although it is well known that soluble growth factors are biologically active, there is substantial debate in the current literature about the activity of EGF family precursor proteins. Certain EGF family members, such as HB-EGF, AR, TGF-α, and betacellulin, have been suggested to activate EGFR via juxtacrine interactions, whereas membrane-bound EGF has been shown to lack activity (13Anklesaria P.

AR was originally purified from the conditioned media of MCF-7 breast cancer epithelial cells treated with the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (20Shoyab M. McDonald V.L. Bradley J.G. Todaro G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6528-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It is synthesized as a 252-amino acid heparin-binding glycoprotein with an EGF-like domain and a basic NH2 terminus, which contains glycosylation sites and putative nuclear localization signals (21Plowman G.D.

Due to differential processing and glycosylation, many different sizes of membrane-anchored AR (16-50 kDa) and secreted AR (9-60 kDa) have been found (2Shoyab M. Plowman G.D. McDonald V.L.

Cell Physiol. 1996; 169: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In vivo, AR mRNA is expressed in many normal tissues, including placenta, testis, pancreas, spleen, kidney, lung, breast, ovary, and colon (21Plowman G.D. Green J.M. McDonald V.L. Neubauer M.G.

AR activation of EGFR appears to play a particularly relevant role in the developing breast, since AR is the critical EGFR ligand required for ductal morphogenesis in the mouse mammary gland, and it has been shown to act as an autocrine growth factor for some normal human mammary epithelial cells (25Sternlicht M.D. Sunnarborg S.W.

Cell Physiol. 1992; 153: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There is direct evidence that an EGFR/AR autocrine loop exists in pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (27Castillo J. Erroba E. Perugorria M.J. Santamaria M. Lee D.C. Prieto J. Avila M.A. Berasain C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6129-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Funatomi H. Itakura J. Ishiwata T. Pastan I. Thompson S.A. Johnson G.R. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). AR expression was also found to be strongly correlated with inflammatory breast cancer, and a putative AR/EGFR autocrine loop is suggested to contribute to breast cancer progression (30Ma L. de Roquancourt A. Bertheau P. Chevret S. Millot G. Sastre-Garau X. Espie M. Marty M. Janin A. Calvo F. J. Pathol. 2001; 194: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, AR may play a specific role in cancer progression, since it has been shown that AR activation of EGFR contributes to the synthesis, secretion, and activation of some proteins involved in invasion and metastasis, such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (31Silvy M. Giusti C. Martin P.M. Berthois Y. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 936-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33O-charoenrat P. Modjtahedi H. Rhys-Evans P. Court W.J. Box G.M. Eccles S.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1121-1128PubMed Google Scholar). We have developed the cell line SUM149 in our laboratory from an aggressive inflammatory breast cancer, and we used this cell line as a model to study the mechanism of AR action and its potential role as an autocrine growth factor in breast cancer (34Ignatoski K.M. Ethier S.P. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 54: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SUM149 cells are estrogen receptor-negative and overexpress EGFR but do not express any other active ErbB family members. In this report, we demonstrate that AR functions as an autocrine growth factor for a breast cancer cell line and show that this self-sustaining autocrine loop is dependent on EGFR activity. MCF10A cells are immortalized, nontransformed human mammary epithelial cells with an obligatory requirement for EGF for their growth and proliferation (35Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar). We show that overexpression of AR in MCF10A cells renders them EGF-independent for cell proliferation and increases both their cell motility and invasion capabilities. Similarly, SUM149 cells show increased cell motility and invasion relative to MCF10A cells. In addition, we provide evidence that membrane-anchored AR precursor can activate EGFR in a juxtacrine fashion, and therefore membrane-anchored AR may play an important role in the maintenance of an AR autocrine loop in breast cancer. Reagents and Antibodies—The antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody Ab-5 (Oncogene) to immunoprecipitate EGFR, mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody clone 31G7 (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) to detect EGFR, anti-EGFR human (mouse) antibody clone 225 (C225) (Calbiochem) to block ligand binding to EGFR, goat polyclonal anti-AR antibody AF262 (R&D Systems) to detect AR and neutralize AR, mouse monoclonal antibody PY-20 (Calbiochem) to detect EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, and mouse monoclonal anti-AR antibody MAB262 (R&D Systems) also used to neutralize AR. CI1033 was obtained from Pfizer, and GM6001 was obtained from Calbiochem. Recombinant AR was obtained from R&D Systems. Cell Culture—AR-overexpressing MCF10A cells (MCF10A AR) were made as previously described (36Berquin I.M. Dziubinski M.L. Nolan G.P. Ethier S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4019-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SUM149 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 2 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. The serum-free base medium for MCF10A and MCF10A AR cells was SFIH (Ham's F-12 with 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm ethanolamine, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 10 nm triiodothyronine, 50 nm sodium selenate, 5 μg/ml gentamicin, 2.5 μg/ml fungizone, and 5 μg/ml insulin), and MCF10A cells required 10 ng/ml EGF (SFIHE). MCF10A + AR cells were MCF10A cells grown in SFIH medium with 20 ng/ml exogenous AR (SFIHA), which was found previously to be the biologically equivalent concentration to EGF for these cells (36Berquin I.M. Dziubinski M.L. Nolan G.P. Ethier S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4019-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from subconfluent cell culture plates using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 4 μg of total RNA using the Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). Primers used were designed and synthesized by the Applied Biosystems Assays-by-Design service. AR primer sequences were 5′-GTTACTGCTTCCAGGTGCTCTA for the forward primer and 5′-GTTACTGCTTCCAGGTGCTCTA for the reverse primer. The probe sequence was 5′-ACGGAGAATGCAAATATA. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primer set was used as control. Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed in 96-well plates using Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center Affymetrix and cDNA Microarray Core Facility. The reactions were done in replicates of 6. Calculation of the ΔΔCT values was performed as previously described (37Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each cell line, the average number of cycles for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control primer reactions to reach threshold fluorescence was calculated and subtracted from the average number of cycles for AR primer reactions to reach threshold fluorescence. These values for SUM149 and MCF10A AR cells were then subtracted from MCF10A values. These differences were then raised to the -2 power. Data are represented as -fold change relative to MCF10A control. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The antibody anti-EGFR Ab-5 (Oncogene Research Products) was used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as previously described (38Woods Ignatoski K.M. Livant D.L. Markwart S. Grewal N.K. Ethier S.P. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar). Protein from whole cell lysates was loaded onto 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for AR detection, and EGFR immunoprecipitates were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transferring proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blots were probed with anti-EGFR antibody 31G7 (Zymed Laboratories), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY-20 (Calbiochem), or anti-AR antibody AF262 (R & D Systems) and visualized by enzymatic chemiluminescence (Pierce). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Conditioned medium was obtained from cells grown in 6-well plates. An AR DuoSet ELISA from R & D Systems was used to measure AR medium concentration. High binding ELISA plates were coated with 3 μg/ml MAB262 monoclonal AR antibody in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at room temperature. Absorbance was measured on a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.). Cells were lysed, and nuclei were counted with a Z1 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter) for normalization. Samples were done in triplicate. Cell Proliferation Assays—Cells were seeded on day 0 in 6-well plates at ∼1.0×104 cells/well. Either 1 μg/ml AF262, 1 μg/ml MAB262, 1 μg/ml C225, or 1 μm CI1033 was added daily. After 5 or 7 days of treatment, plates were washed with PBS three times and agitated on a rocker table with 0.5 ml of a Hepes/MgCl2 buffer (0.01 m Hepes and 0.015 m MgCl2) for 5 min. Cells were then lysed for 10 min using a Bretol (ethyl hexadecyldimethylammonium) solution, and the nuclei were counted using a Z1 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter). Day 1 cells were counted for seeding counts. All experiments were done in triplicate. Juxtacrine Assays—MCF10A cells, SUM149 cells, and MCF10A AR cells were removed from confluent plates using 10 mm EDTA, washed three times with an acid wash (pH 4.0 Hanks' balanced salt solution), and fixed in formalin for 10 min. After fixation, the cells were washed three times in SFIH medium. The fixed cells were then resuspended in SFIH medium with either PBS or 1 μg/ml AF262 for 5 min and then overlaid on top of MCF10A cells that had been grown in EGF-free medium for 24 h. After 5 min, the plates were washed three times with PBS, followed by EGFR immunoprecipitation and Western analysis. Cell Motility Assay—The Cell Motility Bioapplication and Hitkit from Cellomics was used for these experiments. According to the manufacturer's instructions, collagen-I-coated 96-well plates were coated with prewashed blue fluorescent beads. ∼500 cells/well of MCF10A, SUM149, MCF10A AR, and MCF10A cells growing in AR were added to the wells of the plate. The plate was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2. UV images were taken at ×20 using a Nikon inverted microscope. Cell Invasion Assay—Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) were rehydrated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h in a 37°C incubator. ∼2.5 × 105 of MCF10A cells in SFIHE medium, SUM149 cells and MCF10A AR cells in SFIH medium, and MCF10A + AR cells in SFIHA medium were added to the upper chamber of both control and rehydrated Matrigel invasion chambers. 5% fetal bovine serum was added to media in the bottom chamber as a chemoattractant. After 24 h, membranes were fixed and stained using the Hema 3 Staining System (Fisher). Membranes were allowed to dry and then were placed onto slides for visualization. Cells on control and Matrigel membranes were counted from three microscopic fields after 24 h. Percentage of invasion was calculated by dividing the mean number of cells on the invasion membranes by the mean number of cells on the control membranes for each cell line. Experiments were repeated three times. Affymetrix Expression Array and Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from subconfluent cell culture plates using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA peak ratios were determined using microfluidics technology at the Wayne State University Applied Genomics Technology Center. The 28 S/18 S ratios of the RNA were determined to be higher than 1.3. 5-8 μg of RNA was then used for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). cRNA amplification was then performed using a kit from Enzo Diagnostics Inc. The cleaned cRNA was then hybridized to an Affymetrix human genome HGU133A array platform with 20,000 genes/chip. The expression array chip was scanned using an Agilent GeneArray scanner. The -fold change of fluorescence intensities was calculated relative to MCF10A. Analysis of array data was performed using Pathways-Express (39Khatri P. Sellamuthu S. Malhotra P. Amin K. Done A. Draghici S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W762-W765Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (40Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T.

SUM149 Cells Require Ligand Activation of EGFR for Cell Proliferation—Constitutive EGFR signaling in cancer cells contributes to aberrant cell proliferation and tumor progression. Our laboratory has shown previously that EGF-independent SUM149 breast cancer cells overexpress constitutively active EGFR protein but do not express any other active ErbB family members (41Rao G.S. Murray S. Ethier S.P. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2000; 48: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, we utilized the pan-ErbB small molecule inhibitor CI1033 to determine whether SUM149 proliferation is dependent on EGFR activity. CI1033 prevents ATP binding in the kinase domain of the EGFR, thereby preventing activation of the receptor (42Smaill J.B. Rewcastle G.W. Loo J.A. Greis K.D. Chan O.H. Reyner E.L. Lipka E. Showalter H.D. Vincent P.W. Elliott W.L. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1380-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was profoundly reduced in SUM149 cells treated with 1 μm of CI1033 for 1 h (Fig. 1A), which is in agreement with published data (41Rao G.S. Murray S. Ethier S.P. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2000; 48: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment with 1 μm CI1033 every day for 5 days almost completely inhibited SUM149 cell proliferation (Fig. 1B). Therefore, SUM149 cells require EGFR activity for proliferation despite their EGF independence. Growth factor independence is a hallmark of malignancy, and one mechanism for this phenotype is the development of autocrine loops in cancer cells. Therefore, it is possible that SUM149 cells synthesize their own ligand in an autocrine fashion, which is necessary to maintain EGFR phosphorylation. To determine whether the constitutive EGFR activity in SUM149 cells can be attributed to ligand activation of the receptor, SUM149 cells were incubated for 15-min, 30-min, 1-h, or 2-h time periods with the clone 225 (C225) mouse monoclonal antibody to EGFR. The C225 antibody neutralizes EGFR activity by competing for the ligand binding domain of EGFR (43Thomas S.M. Grandis J.R. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2004; 30: 255-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We observed that treatment with C225 antibody resulted in complete attenuation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation at 15 and 30 min. At 1 and 2 h after antibody, EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation had increased but not to the levels of control (Fig. 1C). These data are consistent with our hypothesis that the EGFR in SUM149 cells exhibits a dependence on an autocrine ligand for activity. To confirm that ligand activation of EGFR is required for SUM149 cell proliferation, a growth assay was performed in which the C225 antibody was added daily for 5 days and the cells were counted. The immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A, which requires EGF for proliferation, was used as a positive control. The C225 antibody considerably reduced MCF10A cell proliferation, as expected. In addition, we found a significant reduction in SUM149 cell proliferation by growing cells in the presence of the antibody (Fig. 1D). The ability of C225 to decrease EGFR activity and cell proliferation suggests that endogenous EGFR ligands are regulating mitogenesis in SUM149 cells. AR Is Overexpressed at the Message and Protein Levels in SUM149 Cells—Previous expression cloning experiments performed in our laboratory identified candidate genes expressed by breast cancer cells that mediate growth factor autonomy. Using this expression cloning strategy with a cDNA library derived from SUM149 cells, we found that overexpression of the EGF family member AR could transduce the EGF-independent phenotype to MCF10A cells (36Berquin I.M. Dziubinski M.L. Nolan G.P. Ethier S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4019-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The AR-overexpressing MCF10A cells derived in these experiments (MCF10A AR cells) are EGF-independent for growth and have ∼40-fold more AR mRNA than control MCF10A cells (Fig. 2A). AR was the only EGFR ligand isolated from the SUM149 cDNA library that enabled MCF10A cells to grow without EGF (36Berquin I.M. Dziubinski M.L. Nolan G.P. Ethier S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4019-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since our data show that SUM149 cells are dependent on ligand activation of EGFR for proliferation, we hypothesized that SUM149 cells overexpress AR, which enables their EGF independence. To begin to test this hypothesis, we measured AR mRNA expression in SUM149 cells relative to MCF10A cells using quantitative RT-PCR analysis and discovered that SUM149 cells overexpress AR mRNA at levels ∼2-fold higher than MCF10A cells (Fig. 2A). Although the level of AR message is not dramatically higher in SUM149 cells relative to MCF10A cells, this difference in message contributes to a more notable difference in AR protein between the two cell lines (Fig. 2B). Following whole cell lysis and Western blot analysis, we observed a 16- and 21-kDa AR form as well as a 26- and 28-kDa doublet in all three cell lines, which is in agreement with previously described AR membrane precursors in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells after wild type AR overexpression (11Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 44Brown C.L. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29538-29549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, SUM149 cells and MCF10A AR cells overexpress the 21-, 26-, and 28-kDa forms of AR protein relative to MCF10A cells. It is notable that a 25-kDa form, which has been suggested to be a less glycosylated version of the 26-kDa AR, was the predominant AR form in both SUM149 and MCF10A AR cells (11Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In stark contrast, the 25-kDa form was not detectable in MCF10A cells, suggesting that this form in particular may play a significant role in EGF independence. An ELISA was performed to quantitate secreted AR protein present in the conditioned media of SUM149 and MCF10A AR cells. Our results show that SUM149 cells secrete ∼600 pg/ml AR into the medium/100,000 cells over a 24-h period, whereas MCF10A cells secrete ∼150 pg/ml AR/100,000 cells over 24 h (Fig. 3A). MCF10A AR cells secrete about 6-fold more AR than MCF10A cells alone (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data show that AR is overexpressed at the message level as well as the membrane and secreted protein levels in EGF-independent SUM149 breast cancer cells and MCF10A AR cells and therefore may be permitting SUM149 EGF independence via an autocrine loop. Autocrine AR Is Required for EGFR Activity and SUM149 Cell Proliferation—AR was originally described as a bifunctional growth modulator, since it has both mitogenic and growth-inhibitory properties. Whether AR acts as a mitogen or a growth inhibitor is dependent upon several factors, including the concentration of AR and the nature of the target cells (19Dong J. Opresko L.K. Chrisler W. Orr G. Quesenberry R.D. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2984-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 39Khatri P. Sellamuthu S. Malhotra P. Amin K. Done A. Draghici S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W762-W765Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was critical to confirm that AR is the autocrine ligand required to activate EGFR in SUM149 cells. To address this question, two neutralizing antibodies were used to sequester AR. Western analysis following an EGFR immunoprecipitation demonstrated that 15 min after the addition of the AF262 AR-neutralizing antibody (R & D Systems), EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced, and phosphorylation continued to decrease in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A). SUM149 cell proliferation was also significantly reduced following the addition of both neutralizing antibodies daily for 7 days (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, MCF10A AR cells showed almost a 3-fold reduction in proliferation relative to control cells when the AR neutralizing antibody was added (Fig. 4C). Thus, SUM149 cells and MCF10A AR cells are dependent on AR for their EGF-independent proliferation. MCF10A cells, which express AR mRNA and detectable AR protein but still require exogenous EGF for growth, showed slightly reduced cell proliferation with AR-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that secreted AR contributes in a small way to the growth of MCF10A cells that takes place in EGF-containing medium. To determine whether SUM149 EGFR activity contributes to the synthesis of AR, which would perpetuate the maintenance of an AR autocrine loop, CI1033 was added to SUM149 cells for 24 or"

Liver disease in the form of cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma arises after many years of persistent virus infection following sub-clinical acute episodes. For this reason intervention is limited to chemotherapeutic treatment of chronic patients. The current regime of pegylated interferon α and ribavirin, while effective against certain viral genotypes, is largely ineffective against the most common HCV genotype 1 (1Pawlotsky J.M. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 16: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Simmonds P. Gut. 1997; 40: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) viruses making the search for new HCV anti-viral drug targets crucial. A recent meta-analysis of multiple clinical trials where amantadine was included alongside current therapies showed that an improved sustained viral response was achieved in patients that had previously failed to respond to dual therapy (3Deltenre P. Henrion J. Canva V. Dharancy S. Texier F. Louvet A. De Maeght S. Paris J.C. Mathurin P. J. Hepatol. 2004; 41: 462-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HCV is the prototype member of the Hepacivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It is an enveloped virus, and its genome comprises a single-stranded positive sense RNA of ∼9.6 kb (4Choo Q.L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6250) Google Scholar) that is translated from an internal ribosome entry site to yield a single polyprotein. This is cleaved by both host signalases and virus-encoded proteases yielding viral structural proteins and the non-structural proteins (5Lohmann V. Koch J.O. Bartenschlager R. J. Hepatol. 1996; 24: 11-19PubMed Google Scholar); the latter form the viral RNA replication complexes on modified cellular membranes and modulate host cell metabolism (6Moradpour D. Gosert R. Egger D. Penin F. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Antiviral Res. 2003; 60: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The region of the HCV genome between the structural and non-structural regions encodes a 63-amino acid integral membrane protein known as p7 (7Lin C. Lindenbach B.D. Pragai B.M. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5063-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), comprising two trans-membrane domains separated by a short basic loop (7Lin C. Lindenbach B.D. Pragai B.M. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5063-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Carrere-Kremer S. Montpellier-Pala C. Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3720-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We identified the function of p7 as a cation channel whose activity in suspended lipid bilayers was sensitive to the drug amantadine, providing a potential mechanism for the proposed efficacy of this drug in HCV treatment (9Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Others have subsequently identified alternative channel blocking compounds, validating p7 as a potential therapeutic target (10Pavlovic D. Neville D.C. Argaud O. Blumberg B. Dwek R.A. Fischer W.B. Zitzmann N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6104-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 11Premkumar A. Wilson L. Ewart G.D. Gage P.W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is not known whether p7 is a component of the HCV virion, nor at which stage in the replication cycle of HCV it performs its function, although importantly it has been shown as essential for HCV replication in chimpanzees (12Sakai A. Claire M.S. Faulk K. Govindarajan S. Emerson S.U. Purcell R.H. Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11646-11651Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and is required for production of infectious virus in cell culture for the related bovine viral diarrhea virus (13Harada T. Tautz N. Thiel H.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9498-9506Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). p7 is proposed to belong to a family of viral ion channels known as viroporins. These are small integral membrane proteins that homo-oligomerize to form channels that mediate cation fluxes across cellular and viral membranes (14Gonzalez M.E. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Precedent for these proteins as therapeutic targets in a clinical setting is made by the M2 protein of influenza A virus (IAV), which is also sensitive to amantadine and related derivatives (15Hay A.J. Wolstenholme A.J. Skehel J.J. Smith M.H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3021-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). We showed previously that p7 was able to replace M2 in a functional assay assessing its role in maintaining the pH-sensitive IAV hemagglutinin protein in its receptor binding conformation during cellular export (16Griffin S.D. Harvey R. Clarke D.S. Barclay W.S. Harris M. Rowlands D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Amantadine inhibited both M2 and p7 in this assay at the same concentration, and we identified the basic loop as critical for p7 function; a fact subsequently confirmed in the context of virus replication in chimpanzees (12Sakai A. Claire M.S. Faulk K. Govindarajan S. Emerson S.U. Purcell R.H. Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11646-11651Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). High resolution structural analysis is a vital component of present day drug design. There have been many structural analyses of the M2 ion channel (17Pinto L.H. Dieckmann G.R. Gandhi C.S. Papworth C.G. Braman J. Shaughnessy M.A. Lear J.D. Lamb R.A. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11301-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 18Song Z. Kovacs F.A.

J. 2000; 79: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the interaction of amantadine with histidine residues in the channel lumen has been modeled (19Salom D. Hill B.R. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14160-14170Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Stouffer A.L. Nanda V. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). M2 is known to form a tetrameric channel (21Sakaguchi T. Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the trans-membrane domain of the protein is sufficient for this interaction to occur; indeed, the trans-membrane domain alone is capable of forming channels in vitro (22Duff K.C. Ashley R.H. Virology. 1992; 190: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and it is this region in isolation that has been the subject of many studies (23Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 25Wang J. Kim S. Kovacs F. Cross T.A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In contrast p7 has two trans-membrane domains that comprise the majority of the protein sequence; thus channel formation is likely to involve almost the entirety of the protein. The length and composition of p7 makes it difficult to synthesize chemically, and those that have pursued this method have found the resulting material to be contaminated with premature termination products (10Pavlovic D. Neville D.C. Argaud O. Blumberg B. Dwek R.A. Fischer W.B. Zitzmann N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6104-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We previously described a bacterial expression system for p7 based on a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion methodology. The fusion protein was seen to form ring-like structures in liposomes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) corresponding to the formation of channel structures (9Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Both the fusion protein and the subsequently derived near-native p7 protein formed functional ion channels in vitro. Here, we have refined this methodology to increase both yield and purity of an N-terminally FLAG-tagged p7 protein: FLAG-p7. We have used rotational averaging and harmonic analyses of TEM images to determine the precise stoichiometry of channel complexes formed by GST-p7 fusion proteins in a lipidic environment. Oligomerization of this protein was supported by higher order structures observed in subsequent SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry of concentrated near-native protein. Finally, we confirm that the near-native FLAG-p7 utilized in these studies forms functional ion channels and can be blocked by amantadine. This system should provide the future means for high resolution analysis of the p7 channel complex to facilitate drug design. Plasmid Design and Construction—A PCR amplimer generated using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) comprising the p7 sequence of the HCV genotype 1b J4 infectious clone (26Yanagi M. St Claire M. Shapiro M. Emerson S.U. Purcell R.H. Bukh J. Virology. 1998; 244: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) with appropriate sites in the forward and reverse primers was cloned into pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) digested with EcoRI and NotI as previously described (9Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), generating plasmid pGEX6-FLAG-p7. The pGEX-6 backbone contains a “PreScission” protease (Rhinovirus serotype 14 3C protease, available as a GST fusion from Amersham Biosciences) cleavage site at the C terminus of GST and immediately prior to the polylinker region where the p7 cassette was introduced. The forward primer included a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) immediately N-terminal to the p7 sequence and a short linker to increase the distance between the hydrophilic GST and the hydrophobic p7 domains of the fusion protein. The integrity of the plasmids was checked by DNA sequencing. All primer sequences are available on request. Expression and Purification of GST-FLAG-p7 from Escherichia coli—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pGEX6-FLAG-p7 and grown at 30 °C overnight. Fresh colonies were used to inoculate a 5-ml culture in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. After overnight growth this was diluted 1/100 into a 2-liter flask containing 400 ml of broth with antibiotic and grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.7. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultures were grown for a further 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation then resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cell suspensions were then subjected to two rounds of lysis at 14,000 p.s.i. in a manual fill French Pressure Cell (Thermo Life Sciences). To eliminate contaminating nucleic acids, 200 units of deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma) was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Lysates were then stored at 4 °C for immediate use or at -80 °C for long term storage. To obtain soluble protein, detergent was added to the bacterial lysate (typically 1% (v/v) Triton X-100), and the lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g in a Sorvall SLA1500 rotor for 15 min. Supernatant recovered from this centrifugation represented the soluble E. coli fraction. GST fusion proteins recovered from the soluble fraction were purified using a 5-ml GSTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Where appropriate, protease cleavage of GST-FLAG-p7 fusion proteins was conducted while protein was bound to the GSTrap column, eluted in phosphate-buffered saline. Inclusion bodies were isolated from bacterial cell lysates (typically in 1 ml of lysates for each preparation) by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were then washed with 1/10th original volume of 100 mm ammonium acetate prior to further centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. Subsequent pellets were resuspended in 1× original volume cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). At this point, fusion protein could be solubilized by adding 0.5% w/v N-laurylsarcosine or could be subjected to proteolysis. Generation and Purification of Cleaved Near-native FLAG-p7—FLAG-p7 was cleaved from the parental fusion protein by the addition of 20 units of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Cleavage was conducted at 4 °C on a rotating blood mixer for 16 h. The resulting mix was adjusted to 0.5% w/v N-laurylsarcosine to solubilize the cleaved proteins, and the efficiency of cleavage was checked by SDS-PAGE. The resulting mix was then separated, and proteins were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Dionex HPLC system, incorporating an automated fraction collector. The system was controlled using Chromeleon software (Dionex) on a windows-based PC. An ACE 5 C4-300 column (Advanced Chromatography Technologies) was used for analytical HPLC purifications. Purifications were carried out using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Initially, all purifications were conducted on an analytical scale, with sample injections of 50 μl in volume. Solvent solutions for the mobile phase were: Solution A = 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Solution B = 80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Solution A was used for equilibration of the column and washing after the injection of sample. Solution B was used for protein elution, introduced over a continuous gradient of 0-100% of solution B. The protein content of eluted solvent was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 and 215 nm. Fractions were collected automatically, using a peak threshold, which was typically an absorbance of 150 milliabsorbance units at 215 nm. Protein was then lyophilized in a vacuum drier and resuspended in appropriate buffer, either 100% MeOH, SDS-PAGE Laemmli sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS w/v, 20% glycerol, 100 mm DTT) or phosphate-buffered saline, and checked by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Larger scale production was later achieved using a Jupiter C4 300 semipreparative column (Phenomenex) column using the same buffers, with flow rate adjusted for column volume. Western Analysis and Antibodies—Proteins were typically separated on a 12.5% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide-resolving gel, poured using a mini-protean III system (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred in 20% MeOH, 1× Tris-glycine on a Bio-Rad semi-dry electroblotter at 15 V for 50 min onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Filters were blocked in 5% (w/v) fat-free milk in TBS-T (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for a minimum of 1 h prior to incubation with antibody. Antibody #1055 was used at 1/1000 dilution in blocking solution and is an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibody, raised against the C-terminal 6 amino acids of the HCV 1b J4 infectious clone p7 sequence: PPRAYA. The peptide was coupled to tuberculin-purified protein derivative via a CGG linker. Antibody #1055 has been described previously (27Griffin S. Clarke D. McCormick C. Rowlands D. Harris M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15525-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The anti-FLAG tag monoclonal mouse antibody, M2, was obtained from Sigma (used at 1/20,000), and the mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibody was from Serotech (used at 1/1,000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or -mouse secondary antibodies were used at 1/5,000 dilution and were obtained from Sigma. Filters were washed for 3 × 10 min in TBS-T following incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, and proteins were visualized using in-house enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent. TEM—2 μg of GST-p7 fusion protein was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence or absence of 20 μl of 1 mg/ml artificially synthesized PA:PC unilamellar vesicles prepared by extrusion. Both protein and vesicles were taken from stock solutions in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0). 10 μl of sample was then applied directly to Formvar/carbon 400-mesh copper electron microscopy grids (Agar) for 30 s, and negative stain was applied as follows: residual sample was removed by blotting with filter paper, grids were then washed with 10 μl of distilled water for a further 10 s, prior to staining with 10 μl of 2% uranyl acetate for another 30 s. Excess stain was removed by blotting with filter paper. Grids were allowed to air dry prior to examination. Images were captured on a Phillips CM-10 electron microscope using Kodak SO-163 film. Micrographs were taken at ×52,000 or ×73,000 magnification. Negatives were scanned into a digital format using an Imacon Flextight 848 scanner. Digital micrographs were imported into the SPI-DER suite of programs and subjected to single-particle image processing (28Frank J. Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies, Visualization of Biological Molecules in Their Native State. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2005Google Scholar). Particle picking was performed manually using the computer mouse to locate the approximate center. Windowed images were brought into mutual alignment by a reference-free strategy. Image classification was performed using K-means clustering (29Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. White H.D. Trinick J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Harmonic analysis, incorporating rotational filtering, was conducted by Prof. P. Bullough (University of Sheffield). Cross-linking of FLAG-p7—Dithiobis succinimidyl propionate (DSP, Pierce) of an appropriate working concentration (diluted from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO) was incubated with FLAG-p7 at a ratio of 20:1 (protein/DSP, v/v). Cross-linking was conducted at 20 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by incubation with 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 15 min. SDS-PAGE analysis of cross-linked samples was performed under non-reducing conditions. Slow Crystallization Mass Spectrometry—Cross-linked FLAG-p7 was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a TofSpec 2E (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in linear mode. The sample was prepared using the slow crystallization method (30Botting C.H. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 2030-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein sample (5 μl of a 1 μg/μl preparation in 4% SDS, 5% Me2SO) was thoroughly mixed with 20 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in formic acid/water/2-propanol (1:2:3, v/v) in a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was left with the lid open at 20 °C for 3 h, to allow protein-doped matrix crystals to form. Scratching the sides of the tube with a pipette tip helped promote crystal growth. The supernatant was removed, and the crystals were washed twice with deionized water. After the final wash the crystals were suspended in 2 μl of deionized water. A portion of the crystal suspension (0.5 μl) was applied to the MALDI target plate and allowed to dry. Samples were calibrated using a suitable standard protein prepared following the slow crystallization protocol. Black Lipid Membrane Analysis—Lipids l-α-phosphatidylserine (porcine brain, sodium salt) and l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (plant) were acquired from Avanti Polar Lipids. Stock solutions of individual lipids for black lipid membranes (BLMs) were made at 20 mg/ml in chloroform. Two chloroform solutions were then mixed 1:1 (v/v) before being dried to a thin film under nitrogen gas. Lipids were then resuspended by vortexing in n-decane (Sigma) to a final concentration of 40 mg/ml. Lipid preparations were made only on the day of the experiment. Aqueous solutions of 1 m KCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, were passed through a 0.22-μm filter before use. BLM experiments were performed in a polycarbonate cup and chamber. The cup contained a circular aperture of 200 μm in diameter, across which the lipids were painted after being primed with lipid in n-decane and dried under nitrogen gas. The aperture was the only connection between two chambers; cis and trans that each contained 600 μl of buffered salt solutions. Each chamber was connected to a 300-μl, 1 m KCl salt reservoir via a salt bridge (1 m KCl, 3% agar). An Ag/AgCl electrode was placed into each of the salt reservoirs, the trans electrode was connected to the input of a Geneclamp 500B voltage and patch clamp amplifier, and the cis electrode was connected to ground. Potentials were expressed as the trans chamber with respect to cis. FLAG-p7 dissolved in methanol was added to the cis chamber at 1 μm. No stirring mechanism was applied to either chamber. Bilayer integrity was monitored by capacitance using a BC-200 bilayer capacitance measuring system. A stable capacitance of ≥115 picofarads was used as evidence of a bilayer of sufficient quality to show activity. Background capacitance of the system was 76 picofarads. All bilayers were formed with the amplifier set to the nanoamp range. This was adjusted to picoamp sensitivity after the bilayer (capacitance) was shown to be stable. Recordings were filtered at 200 Hz, and sampling was at 500 Hz. Recordings were made using the software Axoscope 9 (pClamp 9). Statistics, histograms, and representative traces were derived using the associated software Clampfit 9. BLM traces shown were further digitized at 50 Hz in the software using a low pass eight-pole Bessel filter. Calculations Used in Ion Channel Analysis—Reversal potentials in asymmetrical buffers were calculated using the Nernst equation (Equation 1), Erev=RTzFln[Kcis+][Ktrans+](Eq. 1) where Erev is the reverse potential, R is the gas constant (8.3143 J/mol/degree), T is temperature (298 K), F is the Faraday constant (96,490 J/mol/V), and z is the charge and valency of the transported substance. A derivation of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation was used to determine the relative permeabilities of potassium and chloride ions in the BLM system (Equation 2), PKPCl=[Cltrans]-[Clcis]Erev/59[Ktrans+]Erev/59-[Kcis+](Eq. 2) where PK is the permeability of potassium ions, PCl is the permeability of chloride ions, and Erev is the reverse potential determined by the Nernst equation. Generation of High Purity GST-p7 Fusions from E. coli—We previously described a GST-p7 fusion-based methodology for the purification of HCV p7 (9Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This was based on the observation that fusion to GST rendered a portion of the fusion protein soluble, thereby allowing purification via glutathione-agarose chromatography. Immobilized fusion protein could then be cleaved using thrombin resulting in a near-native HIS6-tagged p7 protein with which we demonstrated the ion channel function of p7. Here we have further developed this methodology, replacing the His6 tag with a FLAG epitope, and incorporating a PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) cleavage site in place of a thrombin recognition sequence. The FLAG tag permits improved immunological detection of the protein and Pre-Scission protease avoids issues of protein purity associated with many commercially available thrombin preparations. Preparation of the fusion protein was performed as previously described (9Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), using Triton X-100 to generate a soluble protein fraction from sonicated bacteria. This fraction was then passed over a glutathione-agarose column and washed, and protein was eluted using reduced glutathione (Fig. 1). A degree of cleavage of the fusion protein occurred during preparations from soluble protein fractions, although the more hydrophobic p7 fusion protein was easily separated from GST by taking the early elutions from the column (Fig. 1). In addition, a band of 22 kDa was always observed. As the 22-kDa band was reactive to the anti-FLAG antibody in Western blots and not to the anti-GST antibody, it was thought to represent an N-terminal truncation of GST-FLAG-p7. GST-FLAG-p7 Forms Heptameric Oligomers in Membranes—We previously reported the lipid-dependent formation of ring-like structures by GST-p7 fusion proteins in liposomes using TEM and estimated visually that these structures represented hexameric assemblages (9Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Immunogold labeling showed that the GST moiety was present on the outside of the rings; the central electron dense core of between 3 and 5 nm was therefore surmised to contain the p7 portion of the fusion protein projecting into the plane of the liposome. To generate definitive data on stoichiometry using TEM images, however, it is necessary to apply computer-based rotational averaging and harmonic analysis to relatively large data sets to resolve individual components of protein structures: individual GST moieties in this instance. Large scale preparation of GST-FLAG-p7 from soluble bacterial protein fractions allowed us to revisit these experiments by using protein of improved concentration and purity, and thereby allowing the generation of several data sets, each containing over 100 individual particles. These data sets were deemed sufficiently large due to the mono-planar orientation of the complex within the liposome (one such representative data set used for Fig. 2; other data sets (not shown) were comparable). GST-FLAG-p7 was incubated with or without artificially synthesized PA:PC unilamellar vesicles (see “Experimental Procedures”) prior to negative staining and visualization. As seen previously for GST-HIS-p7, the presence of lipid promoted either the formation or stability of ring structures by the GST-FLAG-p7 fusion protein; no such structures were visible in the absence of membranes, nor when GST was added to liposomes (9Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Cross"
https://openalex.org/W1969561254,"HSPA2 (formerly HSP70.2) is a testis-specific member of the HSP70 family known to play a critical role in the completion of meiosis during male germ cell differentiation. Although abundantly present in post-meiotic cells, its function during spermiogenesis remained obscure. Here, using a global proteomic approach to identify genome-organizing proteins in condensing spermatids, we discovered an unexpected role for HSPA2, which acquires new functions and becomes tightly associated with major spermatid DNA-packaging proteins, transition proteins 1 and 2. Hence, HSPA2 is identified here as the first transition protein chaperone, and these data shed a new light on the yet totally unknown process of genome-condensing structure assembly in spermatids.

Although several waves of genome-wide reorganization have long been known to occur during male germ cell post-meiotic maturation, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. The most spectacular of these reorganizations are those associated with the replacement of histones by transition proteins (TPs) 2The abbreviations used are: TP, transition protein; HSP, heat shock protein; Spc, spermatocyte; R, round spermatid; RE, round and elongating spermatids; EC, elongating and condensing spermatids. 2The abbreviations used are: TP, transition protein; HSP, heat shock protein; Spc, spermatocyte; R, round spermatid; RE, round and elongating spermatids; EC, elongating and condensing spermatids. and of TPs by protamines (1Lewis J.D. Song Y. de Jong M.E. Bagha S.M. Ausio J. Chromosoma. 2003; 111: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Kimmins S. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 2005; 434: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In somatic cells, specific sets of chaperones control the assembly of nucleosomes containing canonical and variant histones and hence are considered as major regulators of the establishment of differential genome organization (5Polo S.E. Almouzni G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In differentiating spermatids, despite the fundamental role of TPs and protamines in genome organization, nothing is known on the chaperone system escorting these proteins and mediating their assembly into new DNA-packaging structures. In general, very little is known on chaperones specific for histone and non-histone genome organizers that are in action during spermiogenesis. The only characterized testis-specific histone chaperone is tNASP, which binds the male germ cell linker histone, H1t (6Alekseev O.M. Widgren E.E. Richardson R.T. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2904-2911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, by analyzing the nature of proteins soluble in acids present in condensing spermatids, we have discovered an unexpected property of the testis-specific chaperone HSPA2 that sheds light on potential mechanisms controlling the post-meiotic genome reorganization. HSPA2 had already been shown to possess an essential and specific role in male germ cell meiosis (7Allen J.W. Dix D.J. Collins B.W. Merrick B.A. He C. Selkirk J.K. Poorman-Allen P. Dresser M.E. Eddy E.M. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Zhu D. Dix D.J. Eddy E.M. Development. 1997; 124: 3007-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because of a meiotic blockade and massive apoptosis of spermatocytes in HSPA2 knock-out mice, the post-meiotic function of this protein has remained obscure. Here, HSPA2 is identified as the first chaperone of transition proteins TP1 and TP2. Our data therefore strongly suggest that, after meiosis, HSPA2 acquires new functions and contributes to the dramatic spermatid-specific genome-wide reorganization. Detailed methods are available in supplemental information. Germinal Cell Fractionation—The fraction composed of condensing spermatids (steps 12-16) used for mass spectrometry analysis was obtained as described in Ref. 11Marushige Y. Marushige K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 761: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Other spermatogenic cell fractions were obtained using the Bellvé sedimentation method (12Bellve A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 84-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 13Pivot-Pajot C. Caron C. Govin J. Vion A. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5354-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cell fractions were enriched at 80% in each major stage (Spc, spermatocytes; R, round spermatids; RE, mix of round and elongating spermatids; EC, mix of elongating and condensing spermatids). Acid Extraction—Proteins were extracted by direct sonication of spermatogenic cell nuclei in sulfuric acid (0.2 N). The quality of extraction was controlled by SDS-PAGE gel stained by Coomassie. Immunoprecipitation—25-40 μg of acid-soluble proteins were incubated with 1-2 μg of anti-HSPA2 or anti-hemagglutinin (Santa Cruz) antibodies in the appropriate buffer (see supplemental information). Protein G coupled to dynabeads (Invitrogen) were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Bound proteins were washed, eluted in loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (SilverQuest; Invitrogen) or Western blots using standard procedures. Chromatin Fiber Extraction—Nuclei of pooled fractions obtained after fractionation were submitted to micrococcal nuclease digestion in the appropriate conditions (see supplemental methods). Nuclei were broken by osmotic shock by resuspension in H2O, trichostatin A 300 nm, and antiprotease mixture Complete (Roche Applied Science). Micrococcal nuclease-released proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, using core histone amounts as internal loading control. Immunofluorescence on Germ Cells—Nuclei were prepared as described under “Chromatin Fibers” and fixed on Superfrost slides. Detection details are available in supplemental methods. Confocal images were taken using a CLSM microscope (Zeiss) with slices of 0.7-1 μm. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Acid-soluble Proteins—Many genome-organizing proteins including histones and testis-specific DNA-packaging proteins, such as TPs and protamines, are highly basic and can be purified thanks to their solubility in acid. We reasoned that a global identification of acid-soluble proteins extracted from condensing spermatids would allow us to gain an insight into the nature of genome-organizing proteins in these cells. Accordingly, nuclei from a population of sonication-resistant mouse spermatids, composed mostly of condensing spermatids at steps 12-16, were used to extract proteins soluble in 0.2 N sulfuric acid. A proteomic approach for the global identification of these proteins was undertaken. The identified proteins are listed in supplemental Table S1. As expected, many DNA-packaging proteins are on the list. Among the linker histones, the newly identified H1t2 (14Martianov I. Brancorsini S. Catena R. Gansmuller A. Kotaja N. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Davidson I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2808-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was present, and within the high mobility group proteins testis-specific as well as yet uncharacterized members could be identified. In addition to canonical core histones, many variants were found including new H2A and H2B variants, which we called H2AL1, H2AL2, and H2BL1 and characterized elsewhere. 3J. Govin, C. Caron, and S. Khochbin, submitted for publication. Other proteins non-related to histones were also found. We then examined the isoelectric points (pI) of all the proteins found soluble in H2SO4 and plotted the pI values for each of these proteins along a pI scale (Fig. 1). This representation revealed the presence of two distinct groups of proteins. The first group contained, as expected, basic and mostly DNA-packaging structural proteins (Fig. 1, black arrows). Surprisingly, the other group was mostly composed of acidic proteins with a pI between 4.5 and 6 (Fig. 1, gray arrows). An analysis of the nature of these acidic proteins revealed that known chaperones are among them. Based on these data, we hypothesized that a tight association between these acidic proteins, mainly the chaperones, and their basic partners may have induced their solubility in H2SO4. Accordingly, we had here an interesting opportunity to uncover new functions for some of these chaperones in spermatids by identifying their partners. Stage-specific HSPA2 Acid Solubilization—Among the identified chaperones, HSPA2, a testis-specific member of the HSP70 family (15Eddy E.M. Rev. Reprod. 1999; 4: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), appeared to us as an interesting candidate chaperone. Indeed, the data presented above provided an excellent opportunity to investigate its functions in post-meiotic cells where its role had remained obscure. Spermatogenic cells were fractionated, and pools of cells enriched in spermatocytes (Spc), round spermatids (R), a mix of round and elongated spermatids (RE), and a mix of elongating and condensing spermatids (EC) were obtained and used to confirm that HSPA2 is expressed in meiotic as well as in post-meiotic cells (Fig. 2A). Our proteomic data suggested that HSPA2 becomes acid soluble because of its tight association with DNA-packaging basic proteins. To test this hypothesis, fractionated spermatogenic cells obtained as above were submitted to acid extraction. Fig. 2B shows the results of two independent experiments. Very interestingly, a fraction of HSPA2 becomes acid soluble only at late stages of spermiogenesis, after the accumulation of transition protein 2 (TP2). In the same extracts we did not find any evidence for the selective solubility of HSPA1B/HSP70 (Fig. 2B, Exp 2, and not shown). Because of high sequence identity between HSPA2 and HSPA1B, this experiment ruled out the possibility that the stage-specific acid solubility of HSPA2 could be due to nonspecific binding of basic proteins to HSPA2 during the extraction procedure. HSPA2 Function Switch during Spermiogenesis—Our data suggested that the function of HSPA2 changes during spermatogenesis and that it becomes specifically associated with spermatid-specific DNA-packaging proteins during the late stages of spermiogenesis. According to this hypothesis, we predicted a recruitment of HSPA2 to DNA-organizing structures as spermiogenesis proceeds. Proteins preferentially released by micrococcal nuclease from post-meiotic cell nuclei (EC) compared with a spermatocyte pool (Spc) were identified by a proteomic approach. A silver stain analysis of these proteins showed that at least two major proteins are preferentially released from the nuclei of spermatids compared with spermatocytes (Fig. 3A, arrows). Interestingly, in band 1, in addition to HSPA2, mass spectrometry identified HSPA1L/HSC70t, another testis-specific member of the HSP/HSC70 family. Band 2 contained disulfide isomerase A3 (PDA3). We also tried to visualize the stage-specific HSPA2 redistribution in situ. A wave of histone acetylation is known to occur prior to histone replacement during spermatid elongation (2Govin J. Caron C. Lestrat C. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Eur J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Caron C. Govin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2005; 38: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To have an insight into the relationship between HSPA2 localization and histone replacement, both histone acetylation and HSPA2 were detected in spermatogenic cells using, respectively, a monoclonal mouse anti-acetyl-lysine antibody (16Komatsu Y. Yukutake Y. Yoshida M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 272: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for HSPA2. Fig. 3B shows examples of three critical periods during spermiogenesis as a function of changes occurring in global histone acetylation. In round spermatids (R), HSPA2 is almost homogenously distributed in the nucleus, and, as previously shown, histones are found underacetylated in these cells (17Hazzouri M. Pivot-Pajot C. Faure A.K. Usson Y. Pelletier R. Sele B. Khochbin S. Rousseaux S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the wave of histone acetylation observed at stage VIII spermatids (17Hazzouri M. Pivot-Pajot C. Faure A.K. Usson Y. Pelletier R. Sele B. Khochbin S. Rousseaux S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) is associated with a dramatic redistribution of HSPA2, which becomes concentrated in a cap-like structure penetrating into the inner side of the nucleus. Co-localization with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DNA staining clearly shows that these regions are DNA-containing subacrosomal domains and, interestingly, also correspond to the domain previously shown to accumulate the spermatid-specific linker H1t2 at stage VIII (14Martianov I. Brancorsini S. Catena R. Gansmuller A. Kotaja N. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Davidson I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2808-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, the absence of hyperacetylated histones and accumulation of H1t2 in this region indicate that this particular zone is probably one of the first concerned by the replacement of somatic-type histones in the nucleus of condensing spermatids. Fig. 3B also shows an example of a more advanced spermatid (C), where most of the histone replacements have already occurred. It is interesting to note that the global disappearance of histone acetylation nicely matches the extension of HSPA2 localization into various regions and its concentration in the nucleus. Acid-resistant Association between TP1/TP2 and HSPA2—To visualize the binding of proteins to HSPA2 in condensing spermatids, which supposedly mediates the latter's acid solubility, acid extracts from round and elongating/condensing pools of fractionated spermatogenic cells were used to immunoprecipitate HSPA2. The HSPA2 antibody did not immunoprecipitate any histone, showing that if there is any HSPA2-histone interaction, it does not resist acid extraction (Fig. 4A, lane 3). The silver-stained profile of the immunoprecipitated proteins, as well as other data shown here (mainly the timing of TP accumulation and HSPA2 acid solubility) suggest that HSPA2 can form an acid-resistant complex with TP1 and TP2. To confirm this hypothesis, acid extracts from condensing spermatids were immunoprecipitated either with an irrelevant antibody (Fig. 4B, Ir) or the anti-HSPA2. Western blots confirmed the existence of a specific acid-resistant complex between TP1/TP2 and HSPA2 in elongating and condensing spermatids. It is interesting to mention that HSPA2 immunoprecipitation, after sonication of elongating-condensing spermatids in a buffer containing increasing amounts of salt, also allowed pull down of DNA fragments containing TP1 and TP2 (not shown). This confirms the association of HSPA2 with genomic regions where TP1/2 assembly takes place. HSPA2, although sharing important sequence identity with other members of the HSP70 family, shows unique functions in spermatogenic cells. Indeed, the knock-out approach revealed the occurrence of specific meiotic defects in male germ cells despite the presence of another testis-specific member, HSPA1L/HSP70t, and the somatic type HSP70 in these cells (8Dix D.J. Allen J.W. Collins B.W. Mori C. Nakamura N. Poorman-Allen P. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Male germ cells lacking HSPA2 arrest in prophase of meiosis I and pachytene spermatocytes undergo massive apoptosis (8Dix D.J. Allen J.W. Collins B.W. Mori C. Nakamura N. Poorman-Allen P. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In these cells, HSPA2 was shown to be associated with the synaptonemal complex and to play a role in desynapsis (7Allen J.W. Dix D.J. Collins B.W. Merrick B.A. He C. Selkirk J.K. Poorman-Allen P. Dresser M.E. Eddy E.M. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Dix D.J. Allen J.W. Collins B.W. Poorman-Allen P. Mori C. Blizard D.R. Brown P.R. Goulding E.H. Strong B.D. Eddy E.M. Development. 1997; 124: 4595-4603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein also appears to play a role in the assembly of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex during meiosis (10Zhu D. Dix D.J. Eddy E.M. Development. 1997; 124: 3007-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the amount of HSPA2 in post-meiotic cells is equivalent to that in meiotic cells, no function has been attributed to this chaperone in spermatids. Here we have shown that a fraction of HSPA2 becomes soluble in acid only in elongating spermatids. Specific association of HSPA2 with spermatid basic proteins, including TP1 and TP2, accounts for this selective solubility of HSPA2 when extracted from elongating and condensing spermatids. There is a considerable lack of information on the chaperone systems involved in the assembly of spermatid-specific DNA-packaging structures. Chaperones such as nucleolin or NPM3, known to be expressed in spermatogenic cells (18Biggiogera M. Kaufmann S.H. Shaper J.H. Gas N. Amalric F. Fakan S. Chromosoma. 1991; 100: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Eirin-Lopez J.M. Frehlick L.J. Ausio J. Genetics. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar), have also been found among the acid-soluble proteins identified here (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1), but no information on their chaperone activity during spermiogenesis is available. This report provides the first evidence for such an activity and, moreover, reveals a unique physiological situation where the activity of a chaperone, HSPA2, evolves in a differentiation-dependent manner. The detailed analysis of the nuclear distribution of HSPA2 in spermatids with respect to histone acetylation confirms the existence of a specific nuclear subacrosomal compartment in elongating spermatids where transitions in genome-reorganizing structures seem to start. Interestingly, Davidson and co-workers (14Martianov I. Brancorsini S. Catena R. Gansmuller A. Kotaja N. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Davidson I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2808-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) had already noticed that H1t2, a new spermatid-specific linker histone, accumulates in a highly polar manner at the apical pole of stage V-VIII spermatids under the acrosome compartment before its spreading within the nucleus in stage X spermatids. We observed a specific accumulation of HSPA2 in the same region at approximately the same stage (VIII). Moreover, this particular mobilization of HSPA2 perfectly correlates with the disappearance of histone acetylation. Like H1t2 (14Martianov I. Brancorsini S. Catena R. Gansmuller A. Kotaja N. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Davidson I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2808-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), HSPA2 accumulation spreads to various nuclear regions at later stages. Because histone acetylation is thought to be linked to their removal (2Govin J. Caron C. Lestrat C. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Eur J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Caron C. Govin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2005; 38: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), our data on the intranuclear distribution of HSPA2 strongly suggest that its spreading within the nucleus follows histone removal and the assembly of new spermatid-specific structures. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that, at these stages, specific acid-resistant complexes are formed containing HSPA2 and TP1 and TP2. Based on all these data we propose here that, after the completion of meiosis, HSPA2 acquires a new function as a chaperone of spermatid-specific DNA packaging proteins and hence could be considered as the first identified factor controlling the histone to TP transition.

https://openalex.org/W2002655273,"An increase in the cytoplasmic-free Ca2+ concentration mediates cellular responses to environmental signals that influence a range of processes, including gene expression, motility, secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, changes in energy metabolism, and apoptosis. Mitochondria play important roles in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling, but the roles of specific mitochondrial proteins in these processes are unknown. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are a family of proteins located in the inner mitochondrial membrane that can dissociate oxidative phosphorylation from respiration, thereby promoting heat production and decreasing oxyradical production. Here we show that UCP4, a neuronal UCP, influences store-operated Ca2+ entry, a process in which depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores triggers Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane “store-operated” channels. PC12 neural cells expressing human UCP4 exhibit reduced Ca2+ entry in response to thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store depletion. The elevations of cytoplasmic and intramitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations and mitochondrial oxidative stress induced by thapsigargin were attenuated in cells expressing UCP4. The stabilization of Ca2+ homeostasis and preservation of mitochondrial function by UCP4 was correlated with reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, oxidative stress, and Gadd153 up-regulation and increased resistance of the cells to death. Reduced Ca2+-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 activation and oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid also contributed to the stabilization of mitochondrial function in cells expressing human UCP4. These findings demonstrate that UCP4 can regulate cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, suggesting that UCPs may play roles in modulating Ca2+ signaling in physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2051673939,"RDH12 has been suggested to be one of the retinol dehydrogenases (RDH) involved in the vitamin A recycling system (visual cycle) in the eye. Loss of function mutations in the RDH12 gene were recently reported to be associated with autosomal recessive childhood-onset severe retinal dystrophy. Here we show that RDH12 localizes to the photoreceptor inner segments and that deletion of this gene in mice slows the kinetics of all-trans-retinal reduction, delaying dark adaptation. However, accelerated 11-cis-retinal production and increased susceptibility to light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis were also observed in Rdh12-/- mice, suggesting that RDH12 plays a unique, nonredundant role in the photoreceptor inner segments to regulate the flow of retinoids in the eye. Thus, severe visual impairments of individuals with null mutations in RDH12 may likely be caused by light damage1.

Thus, RDH12 is possibly a key enzyme in the visual cycle pathway. Rdh12-/- Mice, Genotyping, and PCR—Rdh12-/- mice were generated by standard procedures (Ingenious Targeting, Inc., Rochester, NY). The targeting vector was constructed by replacing exons 1, 2, and 3 with the neo cassette (supplemental Fig. S1). The Rdh12-/- genotype was maintained in a mixed background of C57BL/6J and 129Sv/Ev mice, and siblings were used for the majority of experiments. Genotyping was carried out by PCR using primers RDH12U5, 5′-GCTGAGCCACTTTCCCTGCCCT-3′, and RDH12d5, 5′-AGAGCCGCCAGAGCACAGCCT-3′, for wild type (751 bp) and RDH12U5 and neoa1, 5′-GCCCCGACTGCATCTGCGTGTT-3′, for targeted deletion (468 bp).

The RPE65 variant was verified by direct sequencing. Rdh12-/- mice were fertile, developed normally, and reached similar body weights in both sexes. All animal experiments employed procedures approved by the Case Western Reserve University Animal Care Committee and conformed to both the recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the Association of Research for Vision and Ophthalmology. Mice were maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark (6 a.m./6 p.m.) cycle and were reared under less than 10 lux white light. All manipulations were done under dim red light employing a Kodak No. 1 safelight filter (transmittance >560 nm). Total RNA was isolated from 3-month-old Rdh12-/-, Rdh8-/-, and Rdh12+/+ mouse retinas and the RPE. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). Primers for mouse RDH12 (Mm01307472_m1) and RDH8 (Mm01178944_m1) were ordered from Applied Biosystems. All samples were triple-loaded and 18 S rRNA was used as the internal control.

Typically, two mouse eyes were used. All-trans-RDH activities of the retina and ROS were assayed by monitoring the production of all-trans-retinol (reduction of all-trans-retinal) as previously reported (14Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y.

Grimm C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but with slight modifications. Mice were dark-adapted for 48 h, and LD was induced after pupil dilation with 0.1% atropine (Sigma) by exposure to 3,000 or 10,000 lux diffuse white fluorescent light (150 watt spiral lamp, Commercial Electric) (lights on at 11:00 a.m.). DNA Fragmentation—Genomic DNA was extracted from two dissected retinas with a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). DNA samples (1 μg) were loaded on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was carried out at 50 V, and gels were visualized under UV light. Disruption of the Rdh12 Gene in Mice and RDH Activity— Here we sought to elucidate the physiological role of RDH12 in vision by understanding how disruption of its function leads to retinal degeneration in a knock-out mouse model. By targeted recombination, we generated an Rdh12-/- mouse in which exons 1-3 of the mouse Rdh12 gene were replaced by a neo cassette (supplemental Fig. S1). The expression of RDH12 was abolished in the retina of Rdh12-/- mice as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A), immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1B), and quantitative PCR (Table 1); RDH8 expression was unchanged in Rdh12-/- mice. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed uniform labeling of RDH12 in the photoreceptor inner segment layer, suggesting the RDH12 is localized to both cone and rod inner segments. More extensive double immunolabeling studies will be needed to reveal the detailed localization of RDH12 in cone photoreceptor cells.TABLE 1Differences and similarities between dark-adapted mice from different Rdh12 genetic backgroundsRdh12+/+Rdh12+/–Rdh12–/–pmol/eyepmol/eyepmol/eyeRhodopsinaMice were dark-adapted for more than 48 h.

Next, we measured how disruption of the Rdh12 gene affected reduction of all-trans-retinal. All-trans-retinal was applied exogenously to the dissected retina, and all-trans-RDH activity was determined from the rate of all-trans-retinol production (see “Materials and Methods”). Retinas from Rdh12+/+, Rdh12+/-, and Rdh12-/- mice showed comparable NADPH-specific all-trans-RDH activities (Fig. 1Ca). The all-trans-RDH activity of expressed RDH8 and RDH12 in Sf9 cells also showed NADPH dependence (not shown) (9Haeseleer F. Jang G.F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45537-45546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Isolated ROS from Rdh12+/+ and Rdh12-/- mice displayed similar activities in the presence of NADPH (Fig. 1Cb). Thus, deletion of RDH12 did not affect the all-trans-RDH activity in the retina and ROS and showed that other enzymes are sufficient to reduce a majority of all-trans-retinal in mouse retina. This observation does not mean that RDH12 is a minor enzyme in certain specific subcellular structures, like inner segments. However, RDH12 is a minor activity relative to the total RDH activity in the retina. To determine the influence of the lack of RDH12 on decay of photoactivated rhodopsin, Meta II, we used an assay based on Trp fluorescence. When the data were fitted to a first-order reaction, comparable τ = 30.6 min and τ = 27.8 min for the decay of Meta II were observed in ROS membranes from Rdh12+/+ and Rdh12-/- mice, respectively (Table 1; supplemental Fig. S2). This finding suggested that RDH12 does not directly facilitate removal of the chromophore from the binding site in rhodopsin. These observations are also consistent with RDH12 localization to photoreceptor inner segments (Fig. 1B). Histology and ERG of Rdh12-/- Mice—Light microscopy revealed no apparent abnormalities in the retinas of 6-week-old Rdh12-/- mice raised in 12-h dark/12-h light conditions (data not shown). The ROS were similar in length in Rdh12-/-, Rdh12+/-, and Rdh12+/+ mice (Fig. 1 Da). The thickness of each major layer in the retina was also similar in all three genetic strains (Fig. 1Db). In 1-year-old animals, light microscopy revealed that the ROS around the central area of the retina (500 μm from the optic nerve head) were reduced in length in Rdh12-/- mice (Fig. 1Dc). In contrast, the thickness of each major layer in the retina at 1250 μm from the optic nerve head (superior area of the retina) was similar in the three genetic strains (Fig. 1Dd). To evaluate rod- and cone-mediated light responses, we studied Rdh12-/- mice using ERG. The amplitudes of the a and b waves were not significantly different in dark- and light-adapted Rdh12-/-, Rdh12+/-, and Rdh12+/+ mice (p > 0.2, one-way analysis of variance) (Fig. 2, A and B). Flicker ERG responses also were similar for dark- and light-adapted Rdh12 mice (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, RDH12 deletion did not have a significant effect on the ability of rods and cones to generate light responses. Recovery of the ERG response (dark adaptation) after bleach was then also measured by monitoring the amplitude of the a-wave after exposure to intense constant illumination (500 cd·m-2) for 3 min. Recovery of the responses was substantially slower in Rdh12-/- mice compared with Rdh12+/+ mice (p < 0.0001, Fig. 2C). Rdh12+/- mice showed slower dark adaptation in the first 20 min, but their adaptation kinetics became similar to Rdh12+/+ mice by 30 min after the bleach. Amounts of all-trans-retinal and 11-cis-retinal after the bleach indicated that the delay was correlated with the amount of accumulated all-trans-retinal (Fig. 2D). This suggested that clearance of all-trans-retinal in Rdh12-/- mice is slower than production of 11-cis-retinal during dark adaptation. Flow of Retinoids in Rdh12-/- Mice Exposed to a Single Flash—To understand how loss of RDH12 affected the retinoid flow throughout the visual cycle, we analyzed retinoids by HPLC at various times after an intense flash (bleaching ∼35% rhodopsin). As expected, bleaching caused the formation of all-trans-retinal, levels of which decreased with time (Fig. 3A) because it was reduced to all-trans-retinol and esterified. The reduction kinetics were slower in Rdh12-/- in than in Rdh12+/+ retinas. Slower reduction was also observed in Rdh12+/- retinas (data not shown). Mice lacking an alternative enzyme, RDH8, also showed slow reduction kinetics, and the delay in Rdh8-/- mice was statistically more significant compared with that in Rdh12-/- mice (14Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W. Saperstein D.A. Rieke F. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18822-18832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The kinetics of 11-cis-retinal formation were faster in Rdh12-/- than in Rdh12+/+ mice (Fig. 3B), indicating that although the reduction of the conversion rate of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol in Rdh12-/- mice was slightly reduced, 11-cis-retinal formation in the visual cycle was accelerated. Rdh8-/- mice with slower all-trans-retinal reduction did not show accelerated 11-cis-retinal production (14Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W. Saperstein D.A. Rieke F. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18822-18832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Total amounts of retinoids in the eye were not changed before and after illumination in Rdh12+/+, Rdh12+/-, and Rdh12-/- mice (data not shown). Recovery of the Chromophore in Rdh12-/- Mice Exposed to an Intense Bleach—We employed different light conditions to analyze the process of 11-cis-retinal formation in Rdh12-/- mice further. After intense light that bleached ∼90% of rhodopsin, accelerated 11-cis-retinal production was observed in Rdh12-/- mice (half-life of the 11-cis-retinal recovery was 2 h compared with 3 h in Rdh12+/+ mice) (Fig. 3C). Retinoid analysis performed in the dissected retina and the RPE after 48 min of illumination that bleached ∼98% of rhodopsin is shown in Fig. 3D. All-trans-retinal was detected in the retina, and more accumulated in Rdh12-/- mice (arrow in Fig. 3D). Increased retinoid amounts in the retina and in the eye confirmed that slower reduction of all-trans-retinal was detectable in Rdh12-/- mice (data not shown). Retinal Damage in Rdh12-/- Mice Exposed to Intense Light—RPE65 is another component of the visual cycle involved in the isomerization of all-trans-retinyl esters to 11-cis-retinol (20Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 22Jin M. Li S. Moghrabi W.N. Sun H. Travis G.H. Cell. 2005; 122: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It also is a modifier of light-induced retinal degeneration (LD) because RPE65 null mice show resistance to LD (23Grimm C. Wenzel A. Hafezi F. Yu S. Redmond T.M. Reme C.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). An RPE65 variation in which Leu-450 is replaced by Met (M450L) shows less efficient production of 11-cis-retinal, and indeed mice carrying this variation are also resistant to LD (19Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inset of Fig. 3C shows the amount of 11-cis-retinal after the intense light (bleaching ∼90% rhodopsin) in Rdh12-/- back-crossed to mice with Leu or Met at position 450 of RPE65. Mice with the Leu-450 variation showed higher levels of 11-cis-retinal as reported previously (19Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, deletion of RDH12 clearly showed accelerated 11-cis-retinal production after illumination in both RPE65 variants. Similar experiments to those shown in Fig. 3 were also done with Leu-450 background mice, confirming that 11-cis-retinal regeneration was accelerated (data not shown). The regeneration rate of 11-cis-retinal regulates susceptibility to LD, and the M450L RPE65 variation affects its sensitivity due to reduced 11-cis-retinal regeneration. Because Rdh12-/- mice showed accelerated 11-cis-retinal regeneration (Fig. 3, B and C), susceptibility to LD was examined. When exposed to 3000 lux white light for 48 h, the nuclear layer of Rdh12-/- around the central area (500 μm from the optic nerve head), where the strongest intensity light penetrates, was reduced, and ROS were shortened (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas no changes were observed in the same area of control Rdh12+/+. No significant changes in the peripheral retina were detected in either genotype. Rhodopsin amounts in illuminated Rdh12-/- mice were lowered to half those present in non-illuminated mice, whereas rhodopsin amounts in Rdh12+/+ mice after illumination were similar to those before illumination (Fig. 4C). When total retinoids in illuminated eyes were analyzed by HPLC, Rdh12-/- mice had less retinoids compared with Rdh12-/- mice (Fig. 4D), suggesting that broad photoreceptor outer segment loss occurred in Rdh12-/- mice after intense light. A stronger light intensity (10,000 lux) was also employed to induce LD in Rdh12-/- mice. In Rdh12-/- mice with Leu-450 in RPE65, apoptotic cells were detected after 20 min of illumination, whereas 2 h of illumination were needed for Rdh12+/+ mice with Leu-450 in RPE65 (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S4). LD was induced in only a few cells in Rdh12+/+ mice with Met-450 RPE65 after 2 h of illumination. By contrast, extensive LD over a large area was evident in Rdh12-/- mice (supplemental Fig. S3) and was accompanied by DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5B). ERG showed significant reduction in Rdh12-/- mice with 24 h of illumination (Fig. 5C), also suggesting that Rdh12-/- mice are more susceptible to LD, with their photoreceptors more broadly impaired. These experimental light conditions are equivalent to daylight brightness. During summer in Cleveland the typical shade illumination is 7,000 lux, whereas during a sunny day at noon illumination approaches 80,000 lux. A2E Fluorophore in the Retina of Rdh12-/- Mice—Free all-trans-retinal can condense into an A2E fluorescent product as observed in Abca4-/- mice (24Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). A2E was detected in Rdh12-/- and Rdh12+/+ mice at levels higher than in Rdh12+/+ mice but was still several times lower than in Abca4-/- mice (Table 1) (24Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). A2E accumulated in Rdh12-/- mice is unlikely to be the cause of observed LD because Abca4-/- mice with higher accumulations of A2E manifest only mild photoreceptor degeneration (24Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Abca4-/- (24Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M.

We recently discovered that PPM1A can dephosphorylate Smad2/3 at the C-terminal SXS motif, implicating a critical role for phosphatases in regulating TGF-β signaling. Smad2/3 activity is also regulated by phosphorylation in the linker region (and N terminus) by a variety of intracellular kinases, making it a critical platform for cross-talk between TGF-β and other signaling pathways. Using a functional genomic approach, we identified the small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 (SCP1) as a specific phosphatase for Smad2/3 dephosphorylation in the linker and N terminus. A catalytically inactive SCP1 mutant (dnSCP1) had no effect on Smad2/3 phosphorylation in vitro or in vivo. Of the other FCP/SCP family members SCP2 and SCP3, but not FCP1, could also dephosphorylate Smad2/3 in the linker/N terminus. Depletion of SCP1/2/3 enhanced Smad2/3 linker phosphorylation. SCP1 increased TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity in agreement with the idea that phosphorylation in the Smad2/3 linker must be removed for a full transcriptional response. SCP1 overexpression also counteracts the inhibitory effect of epidermal growth factor on TGF-β-induced p15 expression.

A key step in TGF-β signaling is ligand-induced phosphorylation of R-Smads (Smads 2 and 3 in TGF-β signaling; Smads 1, 5, and 8 in BMP signaling) in the distal C-terminal SXS motif, which is mediated by the type I receptor kinase (TβRI) (1Abdollah S.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Smad SXS phosphorylation controls a cascade of downstream events, which include hetero-oligomeric complex formation with Smad4, and the nuclear import of this complex which regulates gene transcription in conjunction with a variety of transcriptional cofactors (3Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 5Massague J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Although C-terminal SXS phosphorylation by TβRI is key in Smad activation, Smad signaling is fine-tuned for diverse biological responses by further post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and SUMOylation (6Izzi L. Attisano L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 7Feng X.H. Lin X. Dijke P.T. Heldin C.H. Smad Signal Transduction. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2006: 253-276Google Scholar), as well as phosphorylation by other intracellular protein kinases (8Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4155) Google Scholar, 9Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). R-Smads contain two conserved polypeptide segments, the MH1 (N) and MH2 (C) domains, joined by a less conserved linker region. R-Smad linker regions are serine/threonine-rich and contain multiple phosphorylation sites for proline-directed kinases. They are phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which exhibit some preference for specific serine residues in the linker (3Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 8Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

CDK2/4-mediated phosphorylation occurs mostly at Thr-8, Thr-179, and Ser-213 (10Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Smad3 inhibits its transcriptional activity, negating the anti-proliferative action of TGF-β and serving as a novel means by which CDKs promote aberrant cell cycle progression and confer cancer cell resistance to growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-β. MAPK-mediated linker phosphorylation appears to have a dual role in Smad2/3 regulation. Mitogens and hyperactive Ras result in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 at Ser-204, Ser-208, and Thr-179 and of Smad2 at Ser-245/250/255 and Thr-220. Mutation of these sites increases the ability of Smad3 to activate target genes, suggesting that MAPK phosphorylation of Smad3 is inhibitory (11Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 12Matsuura I. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12546-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, in contrast, ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2 at Thr-8 enhances its transcriptional activity (13Funaba M. Zimmerman C.M. Mathews L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41361-41368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Smad3 by p38 MAPK and ROCK (Ser-204, Ser-208, and Ser-213) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Ser-208 and Ser-213; analogous Ser-250 and Ser-255 in Smad2) may enhance Smad2/3 transcriptional activity, suggesting that Smads and the p38/ROCK/JNK signaling pathways might cooperate in generating a more robust TGF-β response (14Engel M.E.

A significant increase in Ser-208/Ser-213 phosphorylation of Smad3 is associated with late stage colorectal tumors, suggesting that the linker-phosphorylated Smad3 may mediate the tumor-promoting role of TGF-β in late tumorigenesis (17Yamagata H. Matsuzaki K. Mori S. Yoshida K. Tahashi Y. Furukawa F. Sekimoto G. Watanabe T. Uemura Y. Sakaida N. Yoshioka K. Kamiyama Y. Seki T. Okazaki K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar). Additional kinases, e.g. MEKK-1, CaMKII, protein kinase C, and CKϵ, target R-Smads and regulate Smad-dependent transcriptional responses (18Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R.

Matsuzaki K. Yoshida K. Furukawa F. Tahashi Y. Yamagata H. Sekimoto G. Seki T. Matsui H. Nishizawa M. Fujisawa J. Okazaki K.

Thus, the Smad linker region is emerging as an important and critical regulatory platform in TGF-β signaling. Phosphorylation state and the subsequent activity of many proteins are controlled by dynamic interplay between kinases and phosphatases. Protein-serine/threonine phosphatases (PS/TPs) cleave phosphate molecules from serine and threonine residues in target proteins and can largely be grouped into the PPM, PPP, or FCP/SCP families (22Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). TFIIF-associating C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase (FCP1) and small CTD phosphatases (SCP1, SCP2, and SCP3) are characterized by a conserved DXDX(T/V) motif that is essential for their activity and that they share with a superfamily of phosphotransferases and phosphohydrolases (23Collet J.F.

Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 399-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). FCP/SCPs are well known for their ability to negatively regulate RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) by dephosphorylating its CTD at Ser-2 and Ser-5 (25Yeo M. Lin P.S. Dahmus M.E. Gill G.N. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1401-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). SCPs have also been shown to silence neuronal genes in non-neuronal tissues (28Yeo M. Lee S.K. Lee B. Ruiz E.C. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Science. 2005; 307: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and to attenuate androgen-dependent transcription (29Thompson J. Lepikhova T. Teixido-Travesa N. Whitehead M.A. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2757-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, SCPs were reported to dephosphorylate Smad1 in the BMP pathway (30Knockaert M.

It is likely that other as yet unidentified proteins involved in gene regulation are also targeted by SCPs. We recently discovered that Smad2/3 can be dephosphorylated by the PPM family phosphatase PPM1A at the C-terminal SXS motif, to terminate Smad signaling, implicating a critical role for Smad2/3 dephosphorylation in the regulation of TGF-β signaling (31Lin X.

Using a similar functional genomic approach and taking advantage of phospho-Smad2/3-specific antibodies, we undertook a screen for PS/TPs whose expression reduced Smad2/3 linker/N-terminal phosphorylation. Here we present data identifying SCPs as specific Smad2/3 linker/N-terminal phosphatases, and we show that SCP1 functions to enhance TGF-β signaling and counteract the inhibitory effect of EGF on TGF-β-induced p15 expression. In addition to providing the first example of a Smad2/3 linker phosphatase(s), we reveal an important new SCP substrate and identify the first scenario in which an SCP positively regulates gene transcription.

In brief, for phosphatase screening HEK293T cells were co-transfected with tagged Smad2/3 and the relevant phosphatase using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). After 48 h cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, with the addition of protease (aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (NaF, Na3VO4)), and subjected to anti-FLAG or anti-HA immunoprecipitation. Products were analyzed by Western blotting using phospho-Smad2/3-specific antibodies.

Total Smad2/3 levels were assessed by using anti-HA (Mouse 1.1; Babco), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), or anti-Smad2/3 antibody (E20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Equal protein loading was assessed using an anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins was performed as described (35Lin X. Liang Y.Y. Sun B. Liang M. Shi Y. Brunicardi F.C. Feng X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9081-9093Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using anti-SCP1 sera (a generous gift from Dr. Soo-Kyung Lee, Baylor College of Medicine). Precipitated proteins were subjected to Western blotting using an anti-Smad2 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling). For growth factor treatment, cells were treated with 2 ng/ml TGF-β and/or 50 ng/ml EGF (in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% fetal bovine serum), for the indicated times, prior to harvest for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and/or in vitro phosphatase assay. EGF activity was confirmed by Western blot analysis of lysates with anti-ERK (M12320; Transduction Laboratories) and anti-P-ERK (9106; Cell Signaling) antibodies. TGF-β activity was confirmed by assessing Smad2/3 SXS phosphorylation as described above. Nucleofection was used to examine the effect of SCP1 expression on endogenous TGF-β target gene expression. HaCaT cells were nucleofected with GFP or FLAG-SCP1 DNA using the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofector™ with solution V and program U-020 (Amaxa Inc.). After 24 h, cells were treated with TGF-β and/or EGF for 20 h prior to harvest. Samples were subject to Western blotting using anti-p15 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and antibodies as described above. In Vitro Protein Binding—Recombinant GST-SCP1 and GST-dnSCP1 were generated by purification of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins. HEK293T cells were lysed in Myc-lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 138 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and lysates pre-cleared with 5 μg of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST. Lysates were subsequently rotated with 2 μg of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST, GST-SCP1, or GST-dnSCP1 for 1 h at 4°C. After washing (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), samples were subject to Western blot analysis using anti-Smad2/3 and anti-GST (Babco) antibodies. In Vitro Phosphatase Assays—FLAG-Smad2/3 and FLAG-SCPs (or negative control FLAG-SnoN) were immunoprecipitated from separately transfected HEK293T cells. FLAG-SCPs (or SnoN) were eluted from protein A-Sepharose using FLAG peptide (Sigma) and incubated with protein A-Sepharose-bound FLAG-Smad2/3 in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 60 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Alternatively, protein A-Sepharose-bound FLAG-Smad2/3 was incubated with recombinant GST-SCP1 or GST-dnSCP1, in phosphatase buffer, for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Assay products were analyzed for Smad2/3 phosphorylation by Western blotting. In Vitro Kinase Assay/SCP1 Phosphatase Assay—Recombinant GST-Smad3 and GST-SCP1/dnSCP1 were generated by purification of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins. Glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-Smad3 (1 μg per reaction) was incubated in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 μm ATP) in the presence or absence of recombinant activated ERK2 (Upstate; 15 ng per 1 μg of GST-Smad3) for 30 min at 30 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-Smad3 was subsequently washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and once in phosphatase buffer, prior to incubation with recombinant GST, SCP1, or SCP1dn for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Assay products were analyzed by Western blotting using phospho-Smad2/3-specific antibodies. RNA Interference and RT-PCR—siRNA duplexes were commercially synthesized (Sigma-Proligo). Sense strands (5′ to 3′) for the indicated targets are as follows: SCP1 (siSCP1, GCCGGUUGGGUCGAGACCUTT; published previously (30Knockaert M. Sapkota G. Alarcon C. Massague J. Brivanlou A.H. Proc.

HaCaT cells were nucleofected with 3 μg each of siSCP1, siSCP2, and siSCP3 siRNA oligonucleotides or 9 μg of control siRNA, using the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofector™ as described above for DNA. Cells were harvested for Western blot analysis or for RNA extraction (Trizol®, Invitrogen) and RT-PCR using MultiScribe™ reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The SCP primers (5′ to 3′) are as follows: SCP1 (forward, ATCCCTAAGCAGACCCCAGT; reverse, GTGGAAGACGCAGGACTCTC), SCP2 (forward, CGCTGCGTATAAGGAGGAAG; reverse, GTCACAGGGTCGGCATACTT), and SCP3 (forward, CTGCTGCTTCCGTGATTACA; reverse, TTCCCACGATGAAAAACACA). Transcription Reporter Assays—Plasmid SBE-luc (containing the luciferase gene under the control of Smad-binding elements (SBE)), p15-luc, and p21-luc were used to assess TGF-β-induced transcription in HaCaT cells. Transfections were carried out using DEAE-dextran, and TGF-β treatment and reporter assays were performed as described (32Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.H. J. Biol.

SCP1 Dephosphorylates Smad2/3 in the Linkers—Our laboratory recently discovered that PPM1A can dephosphorylate Smad2/3 at the C-terminal SXS motif (31Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H.

Smad2/3 activity is also regulated by phosphorylation in the linker/N terminus at Thr-220 and Ser-245/250/255 in Smad2, the comparable sites Thr-179 and Ser-204/Ser-S208/Ser-213 in Smad3, and at Thr-8 in both Smad2/3 (Fig. 1A). Several kinases responsible for Smad linker phosphorylation have been identified (Fig. 1B), whereas the identity of a phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating these sites remains elusive. In this study, we sought to determine which phosphatase(s) might dephosphorylate Smad2/3 in the linker region and what effect this would have on TGF-β signaling. As Smad2/3 linker phosphorylation occurs on serine/threonine residues, we screened 40 PS/TPs, including 5 SCPs, 13 PPPs, 18 PPMs, and 4 DUSPs (Table 1), all of which were assessed for Smad SXS motif phosphatase activity in our previous screen (31Lin X.

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged Smad2/3 and the specified phosphatase for 48 h, and cells were lysed for anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. Samples were subject to Western blotting with antibodies specific for the linker/N-terminal Smad phosphorylation sites. As shown in Fig. 1C (lane 7), Smad2/3 were phosphorylated in the linker/N terminus in HEK293T cells cultured in regular growth medium alone. SCP1 was clearly able to dephosphorylate Smad2 at Ser-245/250/255 and Thr-8, and Smad3 at Ser-204/208/213 and Thr-8 (Fig. 1C, lane 6). Interestingly, SCP1 was unable to dephosphorylate Smad2 or Smad3 at Thr-220 or Thr-179 respectively. GFP as a negative control (lane 7) and other phosphatases such as PPP1CC (lane 2) and PPP2CB (lane 4) were unable to dephosphorylate Smad2/3 at the linker/N terminus (Fig. 1C; Table 1). All of the phosphatases screened were untagged to ensure no interference with their phosphatase activity, although a tagged set was also made to examine and normalize their expression level in cells (31Lin X.

Open table in a new tab SCP1 Specifically Targets the Linker Regions and Not the SXS Motif of Smad2/3—We next examined the specificity of SCP1 for the Smad2/3 linker by testing its ability to dephosphorylate Smad2/3 at the C-terminal SXS motif. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-Smad2/3 and FLAG-SCP1 or FLAG-PPM1A phosphatase. Transfected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of TGF-β for 1 h prior to harvest, to stimulate SXS phosphorylation, and lysed for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described above. PPM1A failed to dephosphorylate Smad2/3 in the linker/N terminus, in the presence or absence of TGF-β, as determined by immunoblotting with phospho-specific Smad2/3 antibodies (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). The FLAG-PPM1A protein was active as judged by its ability to dephosphorylate Smad2/3 at the SXS motif (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). Conversely, SCP1 was unable to dephosphorylate the Smad2/3 SXS motif but was efficient at dephosphorylating the other Smad2/3 Ser(P)/Thr(P) residues, with the exception of Thr(P)-220 (Smad2) and Thr(P)-179 (Smad3) (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7). The ability of SCP1 to dephosphorylate Smad2/3 at linker/N-terminal Ser/Thr residues was independent of SXS motif phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7). Equal levels of FLAG-Smad2/3 immunoprecipitated product, and expression levels of FLAG-PPM1A and FLAG-SCP1, were confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. Smad Linker Dephosphorylation Requires the Catalytic Activity of SCP1 and Is Independent of the Proteasome—SCP1 is a class 2 phosphatase whose activity is dependent on acidic residues in the conserved DXD motif (25Yeo M. Lin P.S. Dahmus M.E. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26078-26085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To confirm that SCP1 phosphatase activity is essential for Smad2/3 linker/N-terminal dephosphorylation, we took advantage of a catalytically inactive SCP1 mutant, dnSCP1, which has an Asp-Glu substitution at residue 96 (D96E) and an Asp-Asn at residue 98 (D98N) (25Yeo M. Lin P.S. Dahmus M.E. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26078-26085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We found that unlike its wild type counterpart, FLAG-dnSCP1 had no ability to dephosphorylate Smad2 at Ser(P)-245/250/255 and Thr(P)-8, and Smad3 at Ser(P)-204/208/213 and Thr(P)-8 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). The wild type and phosphatase-inactive SCP1 proteins were similarly expressed, as determined by anti-FLAG immunoblotting of whole cell lysates. We next determined whether the ability of SCP1 to dephosphorylate Smad2/3 is dose-dependent. Almost no linker Smad2/3 phosphorylation was detected on co-transfection with 0.5 μg of SCP1, as represented by immunoblots for pS245/250/255 (Smad2) and pS213 (Smad3) in Fig. 2C (lane 3). However, phosphorylation levels increased with decreasing concentrations of SCP1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 4–6), providing more evidence that SCP1 is a Smad2/3-specific phosphatase. Finally, to confirm that the SCP1-induced decrease in pSmad2/3 is because of phosphatase activity and not because of pSmad2/3 degradation, we examined the effect of SCP1 on Smad2 linker/N-terminal phosphorylation in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. MG132 treatment did not block the SCP1-induced decrease in linker/N-terminal phosphorylated Smad2 (Fig. 2D, lane 4), suggesting that SCP1 reduces pSmad2/3 levels independently of degradation via the 26 S proteasome. SCP1 Physically Interacts with Smad2/3—The above data suggest that SCP1 is a specific phosphatase for the Smad2/3 linker/N-terminal region. To determine whether Smad2/3 interacts with SCP1, we first generated recombinant GST-SCP1 and GST-dnSCP1 fusion proteins and assessed them for their ability to bind to endogenous Smad2/3 in HEK293T cell lysates. Western blot analysis revealed that GST-SCP1, but not GST alone, could specifically bind to Smad2/3 in HEK293T lysates (Fig. 3A). Use of an even amount of GST, as compared with GST-SCP1 and GST-dnSCP1, was confirmed by using an anti-GST antibody. Equal amounts of total protein and Smad2/3 in each cell lysate were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-actin and anti-Smad2/3 antibodies, respectively (Fig. 3A). The catalytically inactive mutant dnSCP1 was still able to interact with Smad2/3 (Fig. 3A, lane 3), suggesting that SCP1 phosphatase activity is not essential for Smad2/3 binding. We next wish"

APF is the first naturally occurring, low molecular weight sialoglycopeptide negative growth regulator to have been completely characterized. The peptide sequence of APF is identical to residues 541-549 of the 6th transmembrane domain of Frizzled 8, a Wnt ligand receptor. The glycosyl moiety of APF consists of sialic acid α-2,3 linked to galactose β1-3-N-acetylgalactosamine, which is α-O-linked to the N-terminal threonine residue of the nonapeptide (1Keay S.K.

Furthermore, APF can induce multiple changes in the pattern of cellular gene expression, including decreased production of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor and increased production of E-cadherin, resulting in a more differentiated bladder epithelial cell phenotype (2Keay S.

Identification of a receptor for APF on human bladder epithelial cells will therefore advance understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis for IC, as well as aid in the development of specific therapies for this disorder. The potency of APF (IC50 in the high picomolar range), its varied effects on bladder epithelial cell protein expression and proliferation, and the requirement for a hexosamine-galactose disaccharide linked in a specific α configuration to the backbone peptide for activity (1Keay S.K.

Urol. 2005; 174: 2382-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), all suggest that the effects of APF may be mediated by binding to a transmembrane receptor. Microarray analysis suggested a potential role for specific transcription factors such as AP-1, SP-1, and TCF/LEF-1 in abnormal gene expression in cells explanted from IC patients or following APF treatment of normal cells, providing additional evidence for involvement of a receptor (8Keay S. Seillier-Moiseiwitsch F. Zhang C.O. Chai T.C. Zhang J. Physiol. Genomics. 2003; 14: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Identification of a receptor for APF is important for understanding its mechanism of action and could lead to development of therapeutic agents for IC that specifically bind to APF or its receptor to block its effects on the bladder epithelium. To isolate potential receptor proteins, solubilized microsomal preparations from APF-sensitive bladder epithelial cells were passed over an avidin column to which biotinylated, synthetic APF was attached. After a series of high stringency washing steps, two proteins were observed in the eluate and identified by mass spectrometry as cytoskeletal associated protein 4 (CKAP4/p63) and vimentin. Demonstration that CKAP4/p63 is a functional receptor for APF was accomplished through the use of anti-CKAP4/p63 antibodies that effectively blocked APF activity. Additional evidence was provided by decreased normal bladder epithelial cell sensitivity to APF following siRNA knockdown of CKAP4/p63, as well as by APF sensitivity of another cell line (HeLa) known to express CKAP4/p63. Co-localization of CKAP4/p63 and APF binding in bladder epithelial cells was confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Cell Cultures—Explanted bladder epithelial cells were propagated from biopsies of four patients who had undergone cystoscopy and fulfilled the NIDDK/National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis (13Gillenwater J.Y. Wein A.J. J. Urol. 1987; 140: 203-206Crossref Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and their age-, race-, and gender-matched controls. (Three of the four normal control cell explants were obtained from biopsies of patients undergoing cystoscopy following living kidney donation or bladder resuspension surgery who also consented to undergo bladder biopsy at that time for research purposes. The fourth normal control explant was grown from tissue obtained at autopsy from a patient who had no history of bladder disorder.) These cells were grown from the tissue specimens using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.25 units/ml insulin (all from Sigma), and 5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and were characterized by binding of AE-1/AE-3 pan-cytokeratin antibodies (Signet, Dedham, MA), as described previously (1Keay S.K. Szekely Z. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Barchi Jr., J.J. Zhang C.O. Koch K.R. Michejda C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11803-11808Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Keay S.

All patients were at least 18 years old and enrolled in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-2) and grown in MEM containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), plus 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Sigma). Biotinylated Synthetic APF—APF biotinylated on the C-terminal lysine residue was synthesized up to the N-terminal valine by solid phase methods on a Nautilus 2400 synthesizer (Argonaut Technologies, Foster City, CA) utilizing standard Fmoc chemistry on N-α-Fmoc-N-ϵ-biotinyl-l-lysinyl 2-chlorotrityl resin. Fmoc-protected l-amino acids (Novabiochem) were coupled using O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N-N-N′-N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (Sigma) and 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (Anaspec) reagents. The Fmoc-protected Galβ1-3GalNAcα-O-threonine was then coupled to the remaining peptide backbone, as described previously (1Keay S.K. Szekely Z. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Barchi Jr., J.J. Zhang C.O. Koch K.R. Michejda C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11803-11808Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After purification by HPLC on a C8 column, the identity of the biotinylated synthetic APF was confirmed by mass spectrometry, and its antiproliferative activity was confirmed in primary normal bladder epithelial cells (this congener has ∼80% activity as compared with the parent synthetic GalNAcβ1-3Gal-APF congener). Receptor Purification—Explanted bladder epithelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with supplements as described above until confluent and then cultured in serum-free MEM (containing only 1% l-glutamine and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution) for 48 h at 37 °C, rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the culture flasks, scraped with sterile cell scrapers into ice-cold PBS, pelleted by low speed centrifugation at 4 °C, and then immediately frozen at -80 °C. The frozen pellet (containing 3 × 107 cells) was then washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, 1 mm sodium vanadate (NaVO3), 10 mm sodium fluoride (NaF), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) and repelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 × g. Cells were then further resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and sonicated with a microtip sonifier (Branson Digital Sonifier, model 250, Branson Ultrasonics, Corp., Danbury, CT) for 30 s at 20% power on ice. Sonication was performed three times allowing for a 5-min cool down on ice between sonic bursts. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the microsomal fraction. The pellet was then washed three times by resuspending in 0.5 ml of wash buffer followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The microsomal fraction was finally solubilized in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100. This solution was allowed to incubate on ice for 30 min and diluted to 0.5% Triton X-100 with ice-cold wash buffer. The solubilized protein fraction was then loaded onto an APF-bound affinity spin column generated by immobilizing synthetic biotinylated APF to a streptavidin-agarose bead stationary phase support (400-ml bed volume; Pierce). The column was washed six times with 500 ml of PBS, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.2% Triton X-100, where each wash contained an increasing concentration of NaCl as follows: 10, 100, 250, and 500 mm and 1 m NaCl. The remaining bound proteins were eluted with 1% formic acid containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Each of the eluates was lyophilized to dryness, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE followed by visualization by silver stain. Sections were cut from the one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing the protein bands uniquely isolated by high affinity binding to the immobilized APF (as compared with the control isolations), and proteins in these slices were digested according to Wilm et al. (14Wilm M Shevchenko A Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). The extracted tryptic peptides were then analyzed by nanoflow reverse phase liquid chromatography (nano-RPLC) coupled on line with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Nanoflow Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Chromatographic separations of the tryptic peptides were conducted using a microcapillary column with an integrated electrospray ionization (ESI) emitter constructed by flame-pulling a fine tip (∼5-7-mm orifice) on a 75-mm inner diameter × 360-mm outer diameter × 10-cm long segment of fused silica (Polymicro Technologies Inc., Phoenix, AZ). This integrated ESI column was slurry-packed in-house with 5-mm, 300-Å pore size C-18 stationary phase (Jupiter, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The integrated ESI column was connected via a stainless steel zero dead volume union to an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), coupled on line to a linear ion-trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, ThermoElectron, Inc., San Jose, CA). After sample injection, a 20-min wash with 98% mobile phase A (0.1% HCOOH in water) was applied, and peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 2% mobile phase B (0.1% HCOOH in CH3CN) to 42% mobile phase B over 40 min with a constant flow rate of 200 nl/min. The column was washed for 15 min with 98% mobile phase B and re-equilibrated with 98% mobile phase A prior to subsequent sample loading. The integrated nano-RPLC ESI column was coupled on line to a linear ion-trap-MS using the manufacturer's nanoelectrospray source with an applied electrospray potential of 1.5 kV and capillary temperature of 160 °C. The linear ion-trap-MS was operated in a data-dependent mode where each full MS scan was followed by five MS/MS scans, in which the five most abundant peptide molecular ions detected from the MS scan were dynamically selected for five subsequent MS/MS scans using a collision-induced dissociation energy of 35%. Dynamic exclusion was utilized to minimize redundant MS/MS acquisition. The collision-induced dissociation spectra were analyzed using SEQUEST operating on a 40-node Beowulf parallel virtual machine cluster computer (ThermoElectron) and the Homo sapiens proteome data base. Only peptides with conventional tryptic termini (allowing for up to two internal missed cleavages) possessing δ scores (DCn) >0.08 and charge state-dependent cross-correlation (Xcorr) criteria were considered as legitimate identifications as follows: >1.9 for [M + H]1+, >2.2 for [M + 2H]2+, and >3.1 for [M + 3H]3+ peptide molecular ions. Western Blots—Solubilized high affinity APF-binding bladder epithelial cell proteins were prepared as described above. Solubilized bladder epithelial cell membrane proteins were prepared by rinsing cells in the culture flasks with ice-cold PBS and then scraping the cells into ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 50 μg/ml PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml diisopropyl fluorophosphate). The cell slurry was then vortexed until homogeneous, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and the pelleted membrane fraction was washed once with ice-cold extraction buffer and repelleted, and membrane proteins were solubilized using ice-cold extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Solubilized total cell proteins were extracted into ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 1.0% Nonidet P-40, as described previously (9Zhang C. Wang J. Koch K. Keay S. J. Urol. 2005; 174: 2382-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of solubilized protein samples was measured using a Folin reagent-based protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The solubilized proteins were then incubated for 10 min at 70 °C in sample reducing buffer; each lane was loaded with 20 μg of protein, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis using 4-12% NuPAGE NOVEX BisTris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) in MOPS/SDS running buffer (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) according to the NuPAGE gel manufacturer's protocol for Western transfer (30 V constant voltage for 1 h). Following protein transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBS-T buffer containing mouse monoclonal anti-CKAP4/p63 antibodies (“anti-CLIMP-63,” clone G1/296) (Alexis Biochemicals), mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin antibodies (BD Biosciences), or mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibodies (Sigma); when more than one antibody was used for binding to proteins on a single membrane, the membrane was stripped between antibody incubations using Re-Blot Plus Mild solution (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were subsequently washed three times with TBS-T, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature, and developed with ECL chemiluminescence Reagent (Amersham Biosciences). [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—Cell proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into explanted normal human bladder epithelial cells, as described previously (1Keay S.K. Szekely Z. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Barchi Jr., J.J. Zhang C.O. Koch K.R. Michejda C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11803-11808Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Keay S. Zhang C.O. Hise M. Trifillis A.L. Hebel J.R. Jacobs S.C. Warren J.W. J. Urol. 1996; 156: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), or into HeLa cells. Briefly, purified lyophilized synthetic APF was resuspended in acetonitrile/distilled water (1:1), diluted in serum-free MEM (containing only glutamine and antibiotics/antimycotics), and applied to normal bladder epithelial or HeLa cells; cell controls received acetonitrile/distilled water diluted in serum-free MEM alone. Cells were then incubated at 37C in a5%CO2 atmosphere for 48 h. The cell contents were harvested and methanol-fixed onto glass fiber filter paper, and the amount of radioactivity incorporated was determined. Significant inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation was defined as a mean decrease in counts/min of greater than 2 S.D. from the mean of control cells for each plate. Rhodamine-labeled Synthetic APF—Rhodamine-APF was synthesized in a similar manner to the biotinylated APF using solid phase methods, starting with N-α-Fmoc-N-ϵ(ivDde)-l-lysinyl 2-chlorotrityl resin. After coupling of the sugar-threonine residue to the peptide, the glycopeptide was treated with hydrazine hydrate (1:11 in MeOH) to remove the sugar-protecting groups and also the lysine ivDde-protecting group. The glycopeptide was cleaved from the resin and purified by HPLC on a C8 column. It was then dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide, and 5(6)-rhodamine B isothiocyanate (Sigma) (1 eq) and triethylamine (3 eq) were added. The solution was left stirring in the dark for 1.5 h. After removal of the solvent, the residue was dried under vacuum overnight and purified by HPLC. The identity of the rhodamine-labeled synthetic APF was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Normal control bladder epithelial cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well on 8-well LabTek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution, 1% l-glutamine, 0.25 units/ml insulin, and 5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor. On day 2, the medium was changed to serum-free MEM containing 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution and 1% l-glutamine. After 48 h, the cells were fixed using ethanol/acetone (1:1) for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with 1× PBS, and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-CKAP4/p63 antibodies (“anti-CLIMP-63,” clone G1/296) (Alexis Biochemicals) in PBS, for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled secondary antibody diluted in PBS (goat anti-mouse IgG 1:2000 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.)) for 2 h at 37°C. Following five additional washes with PBS, cells were incubated with rhodamine-labeled synthetic APF diluted in PBS at room temperature for 30 min, washed with PBS, and examined using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Negative controls for the method included cells incubated without primary and/or secondary antibodies or APF, as well as cells incubated with secondary antibody alone. siRNA—Double-stranded siRNA corresponding to nucleotides 594-616 (5′-AACUUUUGAGUCCAUCUUGAGAA-3′ sense strand) of CKAP4/p63 (GenBank™ accession number NM_006825) and a scrambled double-stranded negative control siRNA (5′-AAUUCUGUAUGCUACCUGUAGAA-3′ sense strand) were prepared by preincubating single-stranded sense and antisense strands prepared with double A overhangs in serum-free MEM at 37 °C for 1 h. Primary normal bladder epithelial cells were trypsinized for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged in growth medium (MEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution, and 1% l-glutamine), and the cell pellet was resuspended in serum-free medium at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 200 μl of the cell suspension was then transferred to a sterile 2-mm cuvette with 14 μg of siRNA and electroporated at 160 V/500 microfarad capacitance using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell. The cells were then immediately transferred to culture flasks (for Western blot) or 96-well plates (for thymidine incorporation assay). Solubilized bladder epithelial cell membrane proteins that bound with high affinity to biotinylated APF were eluted with 0.1% formic acid, 20% acetonitrile. The eluate was resolved by denaturing SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by silver staining. Two protein bands were evident with molecular masses of ∼63 and 54 kDa (Fig. 1A). These bands were excised and in-gel digested with trypsin, and the resulting tryptic fragments were analyzed by nano-RPLC coupled with a linear ion-trap mass spectrometer operating in a data-dependent MS/MS mode. This analysis resulted in the unequivocal identification of the 63-kDa band as CKAP4/p63 (16 unique peptides, 30% sequence coverage) and the 54-kDa band as vimentin (13 peptides, 28% sequence coverage) (Fig. 1B). The identities of the 63- and 54-kDa proteins were confirmed by Western blot using monoclonal antibodies specific for CKAP4/p63 and vimentin. As shown in Fig. 2, these antibodies bound specifically to the 63- and 54-kDa proteins, respectively, that had been isolated by high affinity binding to biotinylated APF. To establish that CKAP4/p63 may indeed be a cell membrane receptor for APF required evidence that this protein is present on the cell membrane of bladder epithelial cells from both normal controls and IC patients. Cell membrane preparations from four IC patients and their age-, race-, and gendermatched controls all expressed CKAP4/p63 protein on the cell membrane as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). Although the amount of CKAP4/p63 expression relative to β-actin expression varied between individuals, there was not a notable difference in expression between cells explanted from IC patients versus controls. APF was discovered as a cell growth inhibitor from the urine of patients with IC. To establish whether CKAP4/p63 is a true receptor for APF, we determined whether antibodies that bind to CKAP4/p63 prevent the antiproliferative effects of APF on bladder epithelial cells. Normal human bladder epithelial cells were preincubated with monoclonal anti-CKAP4/p63 antibodies for 1.5 h at 37 °C prior to APF exposure. As shown in Fig. 4, preincubation with anti-CKAP4/p63 antibodies decreased the sensitivity of normal bladder epithelial cells to APF in a dose-dependent manner. In comparison, preincubation of cells with the same concentrations of anti-vimentin antibodies or an isotype control antibody directed against an unrelated cell protein did not inhibit APF activity (data not shown), and incubation of the cells with anti-CKAP4/p63 antibodies alone neither stimulated nor inhibited thymidine incorporation (Fig. 4). Additional evidence that CKAP4/p63 is a functional cell membrane receptor for APF was provided by transient transfection of cells with siRNA for CKAP4/p63 prior to APF exposure. Electroporation of normal bladder epithelial cells with double-stranded siRNA for CKAP4/p63 resulted in decreased protein expression of CKAP4/p63 relative to β-actin (Fig. 5A) as well as approximately 1000-fold decreased sensitivity of the cells to APF (Fig. 5B). In comparison, control cells electroporated without siRNA or with a scrambled siRNA had little or no change in CKAP4/p63 protein expression relative to β-actin, and there was no decrease in sensitivity to APF compared with negative control cells that did not undergo electroporation. To determine whether APF co-localizes with CKAP4/p63 in cells, normal bladder epithelial cells were fixed and incubated with anti-CKAP4 monoclonal antibodies and a FITC-labeled secondary antibody, followed by rhodamine-labeled APF. The rhodamine-labeled APF congener was determined to have similar (∼85%) antiproliferative activity to synthetic, unlabeled APF on normal bladder epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the distribution of anti-CKAP4/p63 binding (Fig. 6A) overlapped with rhodamine-labeled APF binding (Fig. 6B), with both entities presen"

Protein glycosylation is a common co- and post-translational modification that has important biological functions at the cellular and organism level. In eukaryotes, O-glycosylation is the most diverse class of protein glycosylation as any amino acid with a hydroxyl group (Ser, Thr, Tyr, hydroxylysine, and hydroxyproline) can be modified with one of eight different monosaccharides (GalNAc, GlcNAc, Gal, Glc, Man, Fuc, xylose, arabinose) in either an α or β configuration (1Spiro R.G.

These domains are cysteine knot motifs of between 30–40 and ∼60 amino acids in length for an EGF repeat and TSR, respectively. The TSR superfamily contains different extracellular matrix and transmembrane proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (11Tucker R.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There are TSRs present in 41 different human proteins and 27 different Caenorhabditis elegans proteins including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), multiple ADAMTS proteases, F-spondin, and UNC-5 (12Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Dong Y. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Lawler J. Wang J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Significantly, the TSR domain within these diverse proteins has been shown to be the site of protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interaction and is nearly always essential for function. The crystal structure of TSR2 and TSR3 from human TSP-1 expressed in Drosophila S2 cells shows that each domain consists of three antiparallel strands (12Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Dong Y. Zhang R.

This modification is carried out in the ER by protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) (18Luo Y. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), a paralogue of POFUT2. The role of POFUT1 is essential in Notch signaling, and mutant mice defective in POFUT1 expression are embryonic lethal with a phenotype similar to Notch1 deficiency (20Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We recently reported that an enzymatically inactive mutant of the gene for POFUT2 in C. elegans results in an abnormal shape of the anterior gonadal arm (16Canevascini, S., Kozma, K., Grob, M., Althaus, J., Klein, D., Chiquet-Ehrismann, R., and Hofsteenge, J. (2006) European Worm Meeting, April 29–May 3, 2006, p. 71, Hersonissos, Crete, GreeceGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, the O-fucose on Notch serves as a substrate for a β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, Fringe, a known modulator of Notch function (21Haines N. Irvine K.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 22Haltiwanger R.S. Stanley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The product of the Fringe reaction is then further extended by the addition of a galactose and sialic acid to form the tetrasaccharide (NeuAcα2, 6Galβ1, 4GlcNAcβ1, 3Fuc-α1-O-Ser, NeuAc is N-acetyl neuraminic acid) (8Moloney D.J.

This mature Notch glycoform leads to strong activation of Notch signaling via its interaction with the Delta ligand, whereas there is inhibition of Notch signaling via the Jagged ligand (24Chen J. Moloney D.J. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the particular O-glycosylation in an EGF repeat or TSR module on the protein can have significant functional and biological consequences. Although there are similarities between these two O-fucosylation pathways in that both fucosyltransferases are present in the ER, use GDP-fucose as the donor sugar, and require properly folded acceptor substrate, there does not appear to be any biosynthetic cross-talk (14Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast to O-fucosylation of the EGF repeat, the second and final step in the TSR O-fucosylation pathway involves the addition of a capping β1,3-glucose residue. As a first step to understanding the functional significance of the Glcβ1,3Fuc disaccharide structure in TSR, we wanted to identify the missing β1,3-glucosyltransferase. A soluble enzyme activity capable of forming a Glcβ1,3Fuc linkage has been reported in cell lines from different species and multiple rat tissues (25Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We postulated that the β1,3-glucosyltransferase may share sequence similarity with known β1,3-glycosyltransferase members of family 31 in the carbohydrate active enzymes data base (CAZy) (26Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). One putative human β1,3-glycosyltransferase, B3GTL, that shares 28% sequence identity to the human radical Fringe was recently reported (27Heinonen T.Y. Pasternack L. Lindfors K. Breton C. Gastinel L.N. Maki M. Kainulainen H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this paper we identify and characterize this protein as the missing β1,3-glucosyltransferase and we will refer to it as β3Glc-T. 4During the revision of this manuscript a paper describing the characterization of B3GTL as a novel β1,3-glucosyltransferase appeared (58Sato T. Sato M. Kiyohara K. Sogabe M. Shikanai T. Kikuchi N. Togayachi A. Ishida H. Ito H. Kameyama A. Gotoh M. Narimatsu H. Glycobiology. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). This enzyme is localized in the ER compartment of HEK 293T cells and shows high specificity toward TSR-fucose in comparison to fucosylated EGF repeat in vitro. Materials—UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, and GDP-β-l-fucose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. UDP-[6-3H]glucose (60 Ci/mmol) and GDP-[2-3H(N)]fucose (17.5 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Oligonucleotides for PCR were synthesized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). Oasis® HLB cartridges (30 mg) were purchased from Waters Associates (Rupperswil, Switzerland). Antibodies used in Western blots included mouse anti-myc (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-calnexin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare). All other chemicals were of the highest quality available. Subcloning of β3Glc-T and Site-directed Mutagenesis—We identified a full-length cDNA clone of 3467 bp (accession number BC068595, IMAGE 4837250, obtained from Geneservice, Cambridge, UK) that has a single base substitution of an A to a G at position 852 in its 1497-bp coding sequence compared with the B3GTL sequence (accession number AY190526) (27Heinonen T.Y. Pasternack L. Lindfors K. Breton C. Gastinel L.N. Maki M. Kainulainen H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This results in a conservative change from an isoleucine to a methionine at position 284. The open reading frame encoding the 498-amino acid-long human β3Glc-T (protein ID AAH68595.1) was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pBluescript-B3GTL (IMAGE 4837250) with the forward primer (5′-TGCTCTAGAACCACCATGCGGCCGCCCGCCTGCTG-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GCGGATCCTAACTCCTCTCGAAAACCTTTCTG-3′) to create XbaI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined) at the 3′- and 5′-end of the gene, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1™ (–)-myc-His A (Invitrogen) to give the plasmid pcDNA3.1-β3Glc-T-Myc-His. The 349DDD351 motif in β3Glc-T was mutated to 349ADD351 and to 349ADA351 by inverse PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Wallisellen, Switzerland) with overlapping primers containing the desired point mutations (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The coding regions of all expression plasmids were sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of unwanted ones. Cell Culture—HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. HEK 293T cells that were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding C. elegans POFUT1 or POFUT2 5S. Canevascini, D. Klein, J. Althaus, K. Kozma, R. Chiquet and J. Hofsteenge, manuscript in preparation. were grown in the same medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Preparation of Cell Lysates—The plasmids encoding either the wild type or mutant forms of β3Glc-T were transiently transfected into HEK 293T cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sixty hours post-transfection the cells were washed and scraped from the plates in ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, complemented with EDTA-free Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (PIC, Roche Applied Science). The cells were centrifuged at 170 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing PIC to a density of ∼3 × 107 cells/ml and disrupted by sonication at 4 °C with three 30-s bursts (35% probe energy, using a 3-mm Microtip from Branson). The lysate was centrifuged at 3320 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The high speed supernatant was collected, separated into aliquots, and stored at –80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting, GE Healthcare) kit. Expression and Purification of TSR4—The protein rat F-spondin TSR4 (residues 615–666 (29Klar A. Baldassare M. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 95-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar)) fused to a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site followed by a Myc epitope and a His affinity tag (TKLCLLSPWSEWSDCSVTCGKGMRTRQRMLKSLAELGDCNEDLEQAEKCMLPECPENLFQGSRGPEQLISEEDLNSAVDHHHHHH, T indicates Thr at position 18) was prepared by standard PCR methods using a rat F-spondin cDNA as the template (a gift from Dr. A. Klar, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel). The PCR product was subcloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pET22b. Bacteria, strain BL21 (DE3), that had been transformed with pET22b-F-spondin-TSR4-tobacco etch virus-Myc-His were grown to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, PIC, and 10 mm imidazole), and lysed in a French pressure cell. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and loaded onto nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). The resin was washed in lysis buffer with 20 mm imidazole, and the TSR4 was eluted in lysis buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The protein was gel-filtered on a Sephacryl FF S-200 column in 50 mm NH4HCO3, and the fractions containing monomeric TSR4 were lyophilized. Final purification was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q 5/50 fast protein liquid chromatography column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein eluted at 120 mm NaCl in a linear gradient of 0–200 mm NaCl over 30 min in the same buffer. The concentration of the purified protein was determined from its absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated molar absorption coefficient of 12962 m–1cm–1. The overall yield of the procedure was 0.3 mg/liter of culture. Aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Characterization of the TSR4 Protein—The molecular mass of purified TSR4 and of TSR4 after treatment with 102 mm iodoacetamide in 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, containing 6 m guanidinium-HCl and 10 mm EDTA with and without prior reduction with 54 mm dithiothreitol were determined by LC-MS (9Hofsteenge J.

Far-UV CD spectra of TSR4 and TSR4-fucose (0.3–0.8 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were measured on an Aviv 62 DS or a Shimadzu circular dichroism spectropolarimeter in 1- or 2-mm cuvettes, respectively. The reported data (molar ellipticity mean residue weight, [θ]MRW) are the average of six spectra and have been base line-corrected. Thermal denaturation and renaturation curves were measured in 1 °C steps at the maxima of ellipticity. Fluorescence spectra of TSR4 (0.06 mg/ml) in the same buffer were measured on an Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer in a 1-cm quartz cuvette. Excitation was at 295 nm with a band pass of 2 nm, whereas the emission was recorded with a width of 4 nm. The spectra were quantum-corrected, and contributions from the buffer solution were subtracted. Production of Fucosylated TSR and EGF Repeat—High speed supernatant from sonicated HEK 293T cells that stably express C. elegans POFUT2 (25 μg of total protein) was incubated with 20 μm TSR4 and 100 μm GDP-fucose in 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.9, 5 mm MnCl2 for 2 h at room temperature. The fucosylated product was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare) affinity column and desalted. The mass of the TSR4-fucose was 10,106 Da, as determined using an internally calibrated MALDI-TOF-MS (Brucker Daltonics, Ultraflex II) and sinapinic acid as the matrix. Recombinant EGF repeat from human factor VII was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described (30Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Complete fucosylation of the EGF repeat (EGF-fucose) was performed in a similar way except that the enzyme source was from HEK 293T cells stably expressing C. elegans POFUT1 and 20 μm EGF repeat was used instead of TSR4 as the acceptor substrate. The fucosylated product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column (Zorbax, 1.0 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm, Agilent Technologies) with a 30-min linear gradient of 0–30% buffer B (buffer A, 2% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B, 80% CH3CN and 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid). The purified glycoproteins were examined by MALDI-TOF-MS using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix. The masses of the unmodified and fucosylated EGF repeat were 5688.6 and 5834.4 Da, respectively. Glucosyltransferase Assays—Reaction mixtures for assaying the glucosyltransferase activity of recombinant human β3Glc-T contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, PIC, 2.64 μm UDP-glucose, 0.33 μm UDP-[6-3H]glucose, 10 μm TSR4-fucose, and high speed supernatant (25 μgof total protein) in a volume of 25 μl. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl ice-cold 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. In the case of blank reactions, the acceptor substrate was added after the reactions were stopped. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto Oasis® HLB cartridges (30 mg) that were previously equilibrated in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid and washed with 1.2 ml of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid followed by 1.2 ml of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, 20% CH3CN. The glucosylated product was eluted with 600 μl of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, 40% CH3CN. With the unmodified and fucosylated EGF repeats (EGF-fucose) as acceptor substrates, the cartridges were washed with 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% CH3CN, and the product was eluted as above. Incorporation of [3H]glucose into the acceptor substrate was determined by scintillation counting. Product analysis of glucosylated TSR4-fucose by reversed-phase HPLC, alkali-induced β-elimination, gel filtration, and high pH anion exchange chromatography on a Dionex MA1 column was performed as described (17Luo Y. Koles K. Vorndam W. Haltiwanger R.S. Panin V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9393-9399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J.

Donor Substrate Specificity of β3Glc-T—The glucosyltransferase assay was carried out as above, except that 20 μm concentrations of the different UDP-sugar donors were used. The products were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using the C18 Zorbax column with a 35-min linear gradient of 0–35% buffer B (buffer A, 2% CH3CN, 0.1% formic acid; buffer B, 80% CH3CN, 0.1% formic acid) on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system interfaced to an upgraded API 300. The product peak in the 280-nm absorbance trace was integrated. In Vitro Glucosylation of TSR4-fucose and Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The glucosylation reaction was carried out as above, except that 200 μm UDP-glucose was used, and the incubation was for 2 h. The nearly fully glucosylated product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC on the C18 Zorbax column with a 30-min linear gradient of 0–48% buffer B using the trifluoroacetic acid system described above. Fractions containing glucosylated TSR4-fucose were neutralized, dried, reduced, and carboxymethylated as described (32Krieg J. Hartmann S. Vicentini A. Gläsner W. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), except that the EDTA was omitted from the buffer and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (20% w/w, Wako) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 700 mm guanidinium-HCl for 12 h at 37 °C. The peptide of interest was isolated by reversed-phase HPLC-MS on a C18 column (GraceVydac 1.0 × 230 mm) with a 2-h linear gradient of 0–50% buffer B using the formic acid system, neutralized, dried, and digested overnight at 37 °C with endopeptidase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. Nanospray Mass Spectrometry of O-Fucosylated and Glucosylated Peptide—Static nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry was performed on a quadrupole linear 4000 Q TRAP instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the positive ion mode. In the mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation experiments the precursor ion was selected in the quadrupole analyzer and fragmented in the collision cell. Masses were analyzed in the linear ion trap. For MS3 analysis, the daughter ion was isolated in the linear trap and fragmented, and the granddaughter ions were analyzed using Analyst software. The mass accuracy of all measurements was better than 0.3 m/z units. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions of wild type HEK 293T cells were obtained by ultracentrifugation on a nonlinear Nycodenz gradient, and marker proteins for ER and Golgi subfractions were determined as described. 6J. J. Keusch, T. Smilda, J. Krieg, and J. Hofsteenge, manuscript in preparation. Fractions were assayed for β3Glc-T activity as described above. POFUT2 activity was determined as described elsewhere.5 Production of Properly Folded TSR4 and TSR4-fucose—Previous studies have shown that O-fucosylation of EGF repeats (33Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and TSRs (14Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) requires their correct three-dimensional structure. Therefore, we prepared properly folded recombinant TSR4 from rat F-spondin in E. coli as a suitable acceptor substrate for the assays described below. The highly purified protein showed a single band both on reducing and non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels that had been stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Furthermore, a single peak was detected by reversed-phase HPLC (not shown). F-spondin TSR4 consists predominantly of β-strands connected by turns and contains three disulfide bridges (13Paakkonen K. Tossavainen H. Permi P. Rakkolainen H. Rauvala H. Raulo E. Kilpelainen I. Guntert P. Proteins. 2006; 64: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis of TSR4 in our purified preparations revealed a molecular mass of 9960 Da, which would be consistent with the presence of three disulfides and the absence of free thiol groups (expected mass 9960 Da). This interpretation was confirmed by the observation that the mass of TSR4 did not change upon treatment with iodoacetamide in the presence of 6 m guanidinium-HCl. In contrast, reduction with dithiothreitol before alkylation resulted in a mass of 10,308 Da, consistent with the incorporation of six carboxamidomethyl moieties (not shown). We examined the secondary structure of TSR4 by spectroscopic techniques that have previously been used to ascertain the correct folding of recombinant TSRs from human TSP-1 (34Huwiler K.G. Vestling M.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14329-14339Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At 25 °C the far-UV CD spectrum of TSR4 displayed positive ellipticity with maxima at 212 and 231 nm (Fig. 1A). As expected for a fully denatured protein, the spectrum obtained at 81 °C was dominated by strongly negative ellipticity (Fig. 1A). Determination of the thermal denaturation curves at either ellipticity maximum yielded very similar transition temperatures,"
https://openalex.org/W2061640456,"To identify genes involved in the regulation of plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, patients with low HDL-C and age- and sex-matched controls (normal HDL-C) were extensively characterized. Comparative transcriptome analysis was carried out in cholesterol-loaded monocyte-derived macrophages from low HDL subjects segregated into groups with or without cholesterol efflux defects or ABCA1 mutations. Clusters of differentially regulated genes were evident in the low HDL groups as compared with controls. Of particular note, expression of cathepsin D (CTSD), a lysosomal proteinase, was reduced by ∼50% in monocyte-derived macrophages of low HDL-C subjects, most significantly those with cholesterol efflux defects but without mutations in ABCA1 (p < 0.01). These results were verified by reverse transcription-PCR and replicated in a second cohort. We show here that blocking the activity or expression of CTSD, by pepstatin or CTSD small interfering RNA, respectively, reduced ABCA1 expression and protein abundance in both macrophages and CHO cells and apolipoprotein A-I-mediated lipid efflux by more than 70%. Conversely, expression of CTSD increased both ABCA1 mRNA expression and cellular ABCA1 protein. Consistent with its role in the proteolytic processing of prosaposin, inactivation of CTSD function resulted in the accumulation of glycosphingo-lipid and free cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes, a phenotype similar to NPC1 deficiency. Inhibition of CTSD also caused retention of ABCA1 in lysosomal compartments, reducing its trafficking to the plasma membrane. These studies demonstrate a novel and potentially important role for CTSD in intracellular cholesterol trafficking and ABCA1-mediated efflux. Therefore, decreased CTSD expression may contribute to low plasma HDL-C levels."
https://openalex.org/W2091565573,"Native or recombinant SERCA (sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase) was adsorbed on a solid supported membrane and then activated with Ca2+ and ATP concentration jumps through rapid solution exchange. The resulting electrogenic events were recorded as electrical currents flowing along the external circuit. Current transients were observed following Ca2+ jumps in the absence of ATP and following ATP jumps in the presence of Ca2+. The related charge movements are attributed to Ca2+ reaching its binding sites in the ground state of the enzyme (E1) and to its vectorial release from the enzyme phosphorylated by ATP (E2P). The Ca2+ concentration and pH dependence as well as the time frames of the observed current transients are consistent with equilibrium and pre-steady state biochemical measurements of sequential steps within a single enzymatic cycle. Numerical integration of the current transients recorded at various pH values reveal partial charge compensation by H+ in exchange for Ca2+ at acidic (but not at alkaline) pH. Most interestingly, charge movements induced by Ca2+ and ATP vary over different pH ranges, as the protonation probability of residues involved in Ca2+/H+ exchange is lower in the E1 than in the E2P state. Our single cycle measurements demonstrate that this difference contributes directly to the reduction of Ca2+ affinity produced by ATP utilization and results in the countertransport of two Ca2+ and two H+ within each ATPase cycle at pH 7.0. The effects of site-directed mutations indicate that Glu-771 and Asp-800, within the Ca2+ binding domain, are involved in the observed Ca2+/H+ exchange.

Two Ca2+ are transported from the medium into the vesicles, whereas one ATP is utilized. ATPase activation requires binding of two Ca2+ per enzyme molecule (E1·2Ca2+) followed by ATP utilization and formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1-P). The free energy derived from ATP is utilized by the phosphoenzyme for a conformational transition (E1-P to E2-P) that favors translocation and release of the bound Ca2+ against its concentration gradient. The cycle is completed by hydrolytic cleavage of E2-P. Ca2+/H+ countertransport and electrogenicity were noted (7Chiesi M. Inesi G.

It was then possible to demonstrate that, at neutral pH, the stoichiometry of Ca2+/H+ countertransport is ∼1/1, and because of uneven charge distribution, Ca2+ transport is electrogenic (12Yu X. Carroll S. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1232-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The stoichiometric ratio of Ca2+/H+ exchange varies as the pH outside and inside the vesicles is changed (13Yu X. Hao L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16656-16661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the protonation probability of acidic protein residues involved in Ca2+/H+ exchange varies as E2-P is formed, whereby H+ acquisition favors Ca2+ dissociation. A recent contribution (14Sugita Y. Miyashita N. Ikeguchi M. Kidera A. Toyoshima C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6150-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Obara K. Miyashita N. Xu C.

A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) derives from continuum electrostatic calculations based on high resolution crystal structures, where E2 or E1 ATPase states were stabilized with the high affinity inhibitors (E2-thapsigargin) or high concentrations of Ca2+ (E1·2Ca2+). The electrostatic calculations yielded estimates of H+ occupancy of specific acidic residues in the E2 and E1 states of the enzyme and suggested that a minimum of 1.7 and a maximum of 3.0 H+ are countertransported in a reaction cycle that transports two Ca2+ ions. We have described here pre-steady state charge movements induced by Ca2+ concentration jumps in the absence of ATP or by ATP concentration jumps in the presence of Ca2+ delivered to Ca2+-ATPase vesicles adsorbed onto an alkanethiol/phospholipid mixed bilayer anchored to a gold electrode (16Pintschovius J. Fendler K. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 814-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This technique has been used in studies of electrogenic transport by several membrane proteins (17Pintschovius J. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 827-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Bartolommei G. Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Hua S. Moncelli M.R. Inesi G. Guidelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the detected charge movements are attributed to the binding of activating Ca2+ to the Ca2+-ATPase in the absence of ATP and to translocation of bound Ca2+ following the addition of ATP. We have determined the pH dependence of these charge movements and demonstrated unambiguously that the observed electrogenic events correspond to sequential steps within a single enzymatic cycle. We have also demonstrated a different pH dependence of electrogenic signals originating from Ca2+ binding to the enzyme in the absence of ATP, as compared with translocation of bound Ca2+ following the addition of ATP. This difference is attributed to the variation in the stoichiometric ratio of Ca2+/H+ exchange and in the protonation probability (apparent pKa) of acidic residues in the ground (E1) and intermediate states (E2P) of the enzymatic cycle. Chemicals—Calcium and magnesium chlorides and MOPS were obtained from Merck at analytical grade. ATP (∼97%) and dithiothreitol (≥99% purity) were purchased from Fluka. Octadecanethiol (98%) from Aldrich was used without further purification. EGTA and calcimycin (calcium ionophore A23187) were obtained from Sigma. The lipid solution contained diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and octadecylamine (very pure; Fluka) (60:1) it was prepared at a concentration of 1.5% (w/v) in n-decane (Merck) as described by Bamberg et al. (24Bamberg E. Apell H.J. Dencher N.A. Sperling W. Stieve H. Läuger P. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1979; 5: 277-292Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ATPase Preparations—SR vesicles were obtained from the hind leg muscles of New Zealand White rabbits as described by Eletr and Inesi (25Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Recombinant Ca2+-ATPase was obtained from COS-1 cells infected with adenovirus vectors carrying chicken WT (26Karin N.J. Kaprielian Z. Fambrough D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or mutant cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (27Strock C. Cavagna M. Peiffer W.E. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15104-15109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Measurement of Charge Movements—Charge movements were measured by adsorbing the SR vesicles containing the Ca2+-ATPase onto a mixed bilayer anchored to a gold electrode (the so-called solid supported membrane (SSM)). The SSM consisted of an octadecanethiol monolayer covalently linked to the gold surface via the sulfur atom with a diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine monolayer on top of it (28Seifert K. Fendler K. Bamberg E. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 384-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The gold electrode preparation, the whole experimental setup, as well as the solution exchange technique are described in detail elsewhere (22Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Bartolommei G. Moncelli M.R. Inesi G. Guidelli R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3671-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SR vesicles, following a brief sonication in the absence of detergent, were adsorbed on the SSM (usually at an applied potential of +0.1 V, with respect to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode), and the protein was activated by the rapid injection of a solution containing a suitable substrate, e.g. Ca2+ or ATP, as follows. In Ca2+ concentration jump experiments, the “washing” solution contained 150 mm choline chloride, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.25 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol; the “activating” solution contained, in addition, the required concentration of CaCl2. In ATP concentration jump experiments, the washing solution contained 150 mm choline chloride, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm CaCl2 (100 μm free Ca2+), and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol; the activating solution contained, in addition, the required concentration of ATP (100 μm). In the case of recombinant Ca2+-ATPase, the concentration jump experiments were carried out by employing the SURFE2ROne device (IonGate Biosciences GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Free Ca2+ concentration was calculated with the computer program WinMAXC (29Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 was used to prevent formation of a Ca2+ concentration gradient across the SR vesicles (30Hartung K. Froehlich J.P. Fendler K. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2503-2514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Binding, Enzyme Phosphorylation, and Ca2+ Transport— Ca2+ binding to the ATPase under equilibrium conditions, in the absence of ATP, was measured using a radioactive calcium tracer and EGTA-Ca2+ buffers as previously described (31Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-steady state enzyme phosphorylation, occlusion of bound Ca2+, and Pi production were measured by adding ATP to enzyme pre-incubated with Ca2+ using rapid quench mixers (32Inesi G. Coan C. Verjovshi-Almeida S. Lewis D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 307: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport was measured by adding ATP to SR vesicles in a medium containing 20 mm pH buffer, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm CaCl2. The loaded vesicles were then vacuum-filtered (Millipore 0.45 μm) after 10-90 s of incubation, and the filters containing the loaded vesicles were washed with 1 mm LaCl3 and processed for determination of radioactive calcium by scintillation counting. Radioactive (45Ca)Ca and (γ-32P)ATP were alternatively used to provide radioactive tracers. The temperature was maintained at 22-23 °C for all of the experiments. Pre-steady state electrical measurements on an ion pump may yield direct information on charge movements within the transport cycle (16Pintschovius J. Fendler K. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 814-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Läuger P. Electrogenic Ion Pumps. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1991Google Scholar). In our experiments, we activated the pump by delivering Ca2+ and/or ATP by a rapid solution exchange procedure, and we detected electrogenic steps by measuring electrical currents along the external circuit. A diagram of our experimental system, with cartoons representing a minimal number of sequential reactions within an ATPase cycle, is shown in Fig. 1. Useful information is gained from current transients. In fact, numerical integration of each transient is related to a net charge movement, which depends upon the particular electrogenic event (i.e. following Ca2+ or ATP concentration jumps). In addition, kinetic information may be obtained by fitting the current versus time curves to a sum of exponentially decaying terms (33Läuger P. Electrogenic Ion Pumps. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1991Google Scholar). A current transient induced by a Ca2+ concentration jump in the absence of ATP at pH 7 is shown by curve a in Fig. 2. This transient is due to binding of Ca2+ to the cytoplasmic side of the pump (the exterior of the vesicles), which creates a difference in potential across the vesicular membrane, positive in the direction of the metal support. To keep the applied voltage constant across the whole system, the experimental variation of potential across the vesicular membrane is compensated for by an equal and opposite potential difference across the octadecanethiolphosphatidylcholine mixed bilayer. This potential difference is produced by a flow of electrons along the external circuit toward the electrode surface. Curve b in Fig. 2 shows a current transient induced by an ATP concentration jump at pH 7 in the presence of Ca2+ (i.e. on Ca2+-ATPase vesicles pre-equilibrated with Ca2+). Here also, the release of the pre-bound Ca2+ ions into the vesicle interior (the luminal side) induced by ATP creates a potential difference, again positive toward the metal, which is compensated for by an electron flow along the external circuit. Following the first cycle, when steady state conditions are attained, the flow of Ca2+ ions out of the vesicles (favored by a Ca2+ ionophore) becomes equal to their flow into the vesicles because of continuous pumping. Under these conditions, the potential difference across the vesicular membrane becomes constant, and consequently, no further signal is detected. In fact, the current flowing along the external circuit (induced by changes in the transmembrane potential) vanishes, whereas the pump current attains its stationary value. The current recorded with the SSM technique is, therefore, different from that recorded with a bilayer lipid membrane incorporating the pump; the former is a measure of the rate of change of the transmembrane potential, whereas the latter measures the pump current. Voltage-dependent stationary pump currents were recorded by Eisenrauch and Bamberg (34Eisenrauch A. Bamberg E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) upon incorporating Ca2+-ATPase directly into a bilayer lipid membrane. In a previous work (22Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Bartolommei G. Moncelli M.R. Inesi G. Guidelli R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3671-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we have shown that the SSM current vanishes within a fraction of a second time frame. Thus, jumps of ATP concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 100 μm carried out on Ca-ATPase in the presence of 100 μm free calcium generate current transients whose peak currents increase with ATP concentration following the Michaelis-Menten equation (21Bartolommei G. Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Moncelli M.R. Bioelectrochemistry. 2004; 63: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 22Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Bartolommei G. Moncelli M.R. Inesi G. Guidelli R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3671-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Even though the rate of ATP binding to the pump varies to an appreciable extent, the charge obtained by the integration of these current transients remains constant and may be attributed to the overall amount of Ca2+ ions translocated by the pumps in the first cycle. The current transient induced by a simultaneous concentration jump of ATP and Ca2+ is shown by curve c in Fig. 2. Integration of transient a yields a charge (∼50 pCi) that is not particularly accurate, because the current does not vanish completely in 1 s. Integration of the current transients b and c can be performed more accurately, and yields 93 and 150 pCi, respectively. It is clear that the current transient c is practically the sum of the current transient a induced by a Ca2+ concentration jump on Ca2+-ATPase in the absence of ATP and the current transient b induced by an ATP concentration jump on Ca2+-ATPase pre-equilibrated with Ca2+. Subtracting the charge under transient b from that under transient c yields 57 pCi; this value is more accurate than that (50 pCi) obtained by direct integration of transient a and can be regarded as the charge under the current transient generated by binding of Ca2+ to the cytoplasmic sites. From a kinetic standpoint, it is also apparent that curve c includes the b component preceded by the a component. It is most important to realize that a 100 μm ATP concentration jump in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, curve d) yields no electrogenic signal. We now consider these events in greater detail. Ca2+ Concentration Jumps—A Ca2+ concentration jump (in the absence of ATP), performed with the SSM-based technique by rapid injection of Ca2+, yields a current transient (Fig. 3, Ca2+) that can be ascribed to Ca2+ binding to the ATPase. Identical current transients were obtained in the absence and in the presence of a Ca2+ ionophore, indicating that only initial binding to the cytoplasmic side of the protein is involved. Subsequent addition of a Ca2+-chelating solution (containing EGTA) produces dissociation of bound Ca2+ revealed by a reverse “off current.” The off-current transients (Fig. 3, EGTA) are better defined than the on-current transients and allow a more accurate estimate of the corresponding charge by numerical integration over time. Plots of the charges under the current transients against the concentration of added Ca2+ are shown in Fig. 4 at three different pH values, yielding Ca2+ binding isotherms quite similar to those obtained by direct measurements of Ca2+ binding to SR vesicles in suspension under equilibrium conditions. The binding affinity is higher as the pH is raised from 6.0 to 8.0, as shown by the shift of the curves toward lower Ca2+ concentrations, demonstrating the same pattern in both sets of experiments. Fig. 4 was obtained by plotting the charges under the current transients at various Ca2+ concentrations normalized with reference to the maximum charge attained at saturating Ca2+ for each pH. The solid and dashed curves in Fig. 4 are fits of the plots to the Hill equation, and the plots are consistent with the known cooperativity of binding. Most importantly, we found that the net moved charge obtained with saturating Ca2+ increases from acidic pH values up to pH 7 and then remains constant up to pH 8.0, as shown by plot a in Fig. 5. This indicates that charge movement by Ca2+ binding is counterbalanced to an appreciable extent by exchange with H+ at acidic pH but not at neutral or alkaline pH. The favorable definition of the off-current transients (Fig. 3, EGTA) allows fitting to a multiexponential function, yielding two distinct relaxation rate constants of 33 and 10 s-1, which are probably related to sequential dissociation of the two bound Ca2+ ions from the cytoplasmic side of the ATPase. This is in agreement with the stacking modality of the two Ca2+ per ATPase molecule (31Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the two distinct rate constants for Ca2+ binding to the ATPase observed with a fluorescent probe (35Peinelt C. Apell H.J. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 2427-2433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ATP Concentration Jumps—An ATP concentration jump in the presence of saturating Ca2+ produces a current transient due to electrogenic Ca2+ dissociation from the phosphoenzyme on the luminal side of the SR membrane. Because the Km value for ATP is 2.9 μm (22Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Bartolommei G. Moncelli M.R. Inesi G. Guidelli R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3671-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we added 100 μm ATP to ensure a saturating substrate concentration. Fig. 6 shows two current transients induced by ATP jumps in the absence (curve a) and in the presence (curve b) of a Ca2+ ionophore. The current transient in curve a decays more rapidly than that in curve b, and the underlying charge is smaller. In fact, in the absence of ionophore, the high density of ATPase units in the SR vesicle (36Franzini-Armstrong C. Ferguson D.G. Biophys. J. 1985; 48: 607-615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the limited luminal volume of the vesicle contribute to a rapid rise of luminal Ca2+ with consequent “back inhibition” and blocking of further dissociation of bound Ca2+. Conversely, the presence of ionophore prevents rapid saturation of the vesicle by Ca2+, and the pump is allowed to operate under turnover conditions. In this case, we detect the electrogenic signal generated by the first cycle undergone by the entire population of ATPase molecule. Subsequent stationary currents are not detected by the SSM technique. The time frame of the current transient produced by the addition of ATP to SR vesicles adsorbed on the SSM (Fig. 6, curve b) is comparable with that of the first cycle obtained by the addition of ATP to a suspension of SR vesicles in a rapid mixing apparatus. In fact, it is shown in Fig. 6, inset, that the first cycle triggered by simultaneous activation of the ATPase molecules upon the addition of ATP is completed in ∼150 ms, including enzyme phosphorylation (1 mol/mol), occlusion and translocation of bound Ca2+ (2 Ca2+/mole ATPase), and phosphoenzyme cleavage (1 mol Pi/ATPase). The kinetic analogy of the electrogenic and biochemical measurements is related to the use of vesicles and the addition of ATP by rapid mixing in both cases. Steady state turnover of the ATPase in these preparations is 6-8 s-1 at 20 °C, which is consistent with the time frame of the first cycle. If we compare currents obtained in the presence (Fig. 5, curve b) or in the absence of ionophore (Fig. 5, curve c), we find that the pH dependence of the translocated charge is practically identical under these two conditions but clearly different from the pH dependence of charge movements induced by Ca2+ jumps in the absence of ATP (Fig. 5, curve a). This indicates that, in both cases, the pH dependence of the current obtained by ATP jumps is related to dissociation of bound Ca2+ from the phosphoenzyme. The pH dependence of the current transients following ATP jumps indicates that charge movements related to Ca2+ release from E2P are counterbalanced by significant H+ binding at acidic and neutral pH but progressively less at alkaline pH. Comparing the diverse pH dependence of the charges under the current transients after (saturating) Ca2+ or ATP jumps (Fig. 5) and considering that the net magnitude of the electrogenic signal is dependent on the ratio of Ca2+/H+ exchange, it is apparent that, following ATP utilization, the protonation probability of the pertinent acidic residues is increased (i.e. their apparent pKa is shifted to more alkaline pH) as the enzyme undergoes the conformational change from E1P to E2P. To evaluate this effect on the ability of the ATPase to unload bound Ca2+ from E2P, we then measured the steady state levels of luminal Ca2+ that are reached by active transport at different pH values. These levels are limited by the dissociation constant of the internal phosphoenzyme sites as luminal Ca2+ increases because of active transport. It is shown in Fig. 5, curve d, that the levels of accumulated Ca2+ are significantly reduced as the pH is raised to 8, indicating that, under conditions limiting exchange with H+ following ATP utilization, Ca2+ is less likely to dissociate from E2P. Effects of Site-directed Mutations—The relatively high yield of recombinant ATPase from COS-1 cells infected with adenovirus vectors carrying WT or mutant cDNA (27Strock C. Cavagna M. Peiffer W.E. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15104-15109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) rendered possible studies on the effects of site-directed mutations on electrogenic signals produced by Ca2+ and ATP jumps. It is shown in Fig. 7a that the electrogenic signals obtained by concentration jumps of Ca2+ and ATP on recombinant WT ATPase display the same pattern as previously observed with native ATPase (Fig. 2). We then tried the effect of Asp-351 mutation. Asp-351 is the residue receiving the γ-phosphate of ATP at the catalytic site to form the phosphorylated intermediate. Its mutation produces catalytic inactivation, even though Ca2+ binding is retained. Accordingly, we found that the D351N mutant yields an electrogenic signal upon Ca2+ jumps but no signal at all upon ATP jumps in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7b). The effects of specific mutations on Ca2+ binding were previously studied in detail (38Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19383-19387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiment, we first tried the effect of a Glu-309 mutation. Glu-309 resides on Ca2+ site II, and its mutation interferes with binding of the second Ca2+, whereas non-cooperative binding of the first Ca2+ is retained (37Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because of a strict requirement for occupancy of site II, the enzyme is not able to utilize ATP following Glu-309 mutations. In our experiments, we found that an electrogenic signal was generated by the addition of Ca2+, although within a significantly slower time frame (Fig. 7c) as compared with WT or D351N mutant (Fig. 7, a and b). The evidently slower charge movement may be due to interference (by the E309A mutation) with Ca2+ entry into the binding cavity (40Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). No signal was obtained with the E309A mutant following ATP jumps in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7c). Finally, we tried the effect of a Glu-771 mutation. Glu-771 is located in Ca2+ site I, and because of the tight cooperativity of the Ca2+ binding mechanism, its mutation interferes with binding of both Ca2+. In fact, we observed no electrogenic signal upon the addition of Ca2+ or ATP to the E771Q mutant (Fig. 7d), demonstrating a direct relationship of the electrogenic signals with Ca2+ binding. We have reported pre-steady state charge movements within a Ca2+-ATPase cycle obtained with ATPase protein adsorbed on a SSM and subjected to Ca2+ jumps in the absence of ATP or to ATP jumps in the presence of Ca2+. In Fig. 5, the charges under the current transients, observed upon Ca2+ binding from the cytoplasmatic side in the absence of ATP and upon Ca2+ dissociation into the lumen of the vesicles following the addition of ATP, are normalized to their maximum value. This value corresponds to two Ca2+ bound and transported per cycle as determined by biochemical measurements (Fig. 6, inset). We then estimated the stoichiometry of Ca2+/H+ exchange at any given pH by using the values obtained in the same SSM experiments. The pH dependence shown in Fig. 5 indicates that, at pH 7, cooperative binding of two Ca2+ ions from the cytoplasmic side takes place without H+ exchange. This defines the E1 state, as shown in the diagram of Fig. 8, and implies that the E1/E2 equilibrium is pH-dependent. On the other hand, release of the bound Ca2+ into the lumenal side following ATP jumps is accompanied by exchange with two H+ ions. Therefore, the charge of 93 pCi under curve b in Fig. 2, generated following the addition of ATP, involves dissociation of two Ca2+ ions and exchange of two H+ ions and, hence, movement of two electronic charges. On the other hand, the charge of 57 pCi (curve a) is associated with the movement of two Ca2+ ions across a fraction x of the membrane domain of the pump with no H+ exchange (i.e. four charges). Therefore, 4x is to 57 pCi as 2 is to 93 pCi; this yields an x value of 0.31. Differently stated, these results indicate that the Ca2+ binding sites are located in the membrane domain at ∼30% of the membrane thickness from the cytoplasmic side. These conclusions agree with the three-dimensional structure of the Ca-ATPase (41Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 42Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP occurs with a cooperative mechanism involving sequential occupancy of two neighboring sites (31Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acids involved in Ca2+ binding within the membrane-bound region of the ATPase were identified by mutational analysis (43Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). High resolution structures of the Ca2+ binding sites were then obtained by crystallography (41Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 42Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Related atomic models reveal that, in addition to backbone carbonyl oxygens, two water molecules, the Thr-799 side chain, and four acidic residues (Glu-309, Glu-771, Asp-800, and Glu-908) are involved in binding two Ca2+ ions. Glu-771 and Asp-800 have very low probability of retaining protons while participating in Ca2+ complexation (14Sugita Y. Miyashita N. Ikeguchi M. Kidera A. Toyoshima C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6150-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Obara K. Miyashita N. Xu C. Toyoshima I. Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Glu-309 and Glu-908 may retain their protons even in the presence of bound Ca2+, as they are involved in stabilization of local structure by hydrogen bonding. In the absence of ATP, the electrogenicity of the Ca2+ binding step increases as the pH is raised from 6.0 to 7.0 and does not increase any further beyond pH 7.0 (Fig. 5). This variation of net charge movement is related to the H+ stoichiometry available for exchange upon Ca2+ binding with an apparent pKa value within the 6-7 pH range (Fig. 5). At higher pH values, the carboxyl groups of these residues are completely deprotonated, and no exchange with H+ occurs to compensate for the charge introduced by Ca2+ binding. A pH-dependent equilibrium (Fig. 8) between E2 (with protonated acidic residues at pH 6.0) and E1 (with non-protonated acidic residues at pH 7.0) states is consistent with the requirement for enzyme phosphorylation with Pi in the absence of Ca2+ (i.e. E2 phosphorylation by Pi in the reverse direction of the pump), which is strongly dependent on acid pH (44Masuda H. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, Ca2+ dissociation from the phosphoenzyme is electrogenic at pH 7.0, indicating that compensation by Ca2+/H+ exchange is not sufficient to provide complete charge balance at pH 7.0. On the other hand, whereas the signal produced by Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP already reaches its maximal intensity at pH 7.0, the signal produced by Ca2+ release following ATP utilization doubles its intensity as the pH is raised from 7.0 to 8.0 (Fig. 5). Therefore, at pH 7.0, the protonation probability of residues involved in Ca2+/H+ exchange is increased as a consequence of enzyme phosphorylation. In fact, the moved charge increases 2-fold by raising the pH from 7.0 to 8.0 (Fig. 5) and reaches its maximum at pH 8.0. This indicates that H+ exchange is totally lacking beyond pH 8, whereby interference with Ca2+ transport is observed (Fig. 5). On the other hand, at pH 7.0, H+ exchange compensates for half the charge moved by two Ca2+ ions. Ca2+/H+ exchange was previously revealed by steady state rate measurements with proteoliposomes (13Yu X. Hao L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16656-16661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observed exchange was attributed to countertransport, although H+ release from nonspecific sites (i.e. calsequestrin or others) was not excluded. Presently, our pre-steady state measurements demonstrate directly a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio for Ca2+/H+ countertransport (i.e. 2.0 H+/2 Ca2) within a single cycle at pH 7.0. A 1:2 stoichiometric ratio for Ca2+/H+ countertransport is to be excluded, because such a countertransport would be electrosilent and would yield no current transient. In conclusion, our findings indicate that, at pH 7, two protons are gained from the luminal medium upon release of 2 bound Ca2+ ions from the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. Following Pi release, the two protons are released from the enzyme into the cytoplasmic medium concomitant with the E2 to E1 transition, whereupon Ca2+ binding from the cytoplasmic side takes place (Fig. 8). We also conclude that, in the physiological transport cycle at pH 7, the protonation probability of the acidic residues participating in Ca2+/H+ exchange will be very high in E2-P (apparent pKa value between pH 7 and 8 (Fig. 5, b and c), high in E2 (15Obara K.

A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), presumably low in E1, and very low in E1·2Ca2+ (Fig. 5a) (15Obara K. Miyashita N. Xu C. Toyoshima I. Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The results of electrostatic calculations (14Sugita Y. Miyashita N. Ikeguchi M. Kidera A. Toyoshima C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6150-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Obara K. Miyashita N. Xu C. Toyoshima I. Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) may be helpful in predicting the residues involved in H+ exchange, as they indicate that protonation of the four relevant transmembrane carboxyl groups is most probable for Glu-771 and then for Asp-800, Glu-309, and Glu-908 in decreasing order of probability. It was also noted (15Obara K. Miyashita N. Xu C. Toyoshima I. Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) that Glu-309 and Glu-908 may retain their protons through the cycle, because of involvement in hydrogen bonding and stabilization of the Ca2+-bound conformation. Our experiments with site-directed mutations (Fig. 7) reveal electrogenic signals following Ca2+ jumps on the E309A mutant. Because Ca2+ binding on site II does not occur in this mutant, the signal must be attributed to binding on site I. Development of the electrogenic signal then indicates that, at pH 7, the Ca2+ charge movement is not neutralized by H+ release from Glu-771 or Asp-800. Therefore, these residues are dissociated at neutral pH, as the enzyme resides in the E1 state to favor Ca2+ binding (Fig. 8). It is then likely that Glu-771 and Asp-800 are involved in the acquisition of H+ upon dissociation of Ca2+, as their protonation probability increases as a consequence of conformational changes upon enzyme phosphorylation. Finally, we consider that replacement of Ca2+ with H+ as well as introduction of water molecules may have an important role in stabilizing the enzyme structure in the E2 state (14Sugita Y. Miyashita N. Ikeguchi M. Kidera A. Toyoshima C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6150-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Obara K. Miyashita N. Xu C. Toyoshima I. Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, our pre-steady state measurements demonstrate that the protonation probability (i.e. apparent pKa) of acidic residues is altered during the ATPase cycle to favor the acquisition of Ca2+ in the ground state of the enzyme and exchange of the bound Ca2+ with H+ in E2-P. These reversible shifts in H+ acquisition sustain a mechanistic role in promoting dissociation of bound Ca2+. They are produced by changes of H+ accessibility and/or alterations of the electrostatic environment resulting from long range conformational changes triggered by utilization of ATP. In fact, we show in Fig. 5 that a reduction of H+ exchange, as the pH is increased to 8, places a limit to Ca2+ dissociation from the phosphoenzyme and to the Ca2+ concentration that can be reached in the lumen of the vesicles. A sequence of partial reactions within a Ca2+-ATPase cycle, as required to explain our findings, is shown in Fig. 8. Countertransport of H+ by the Ca2+-ATPase finds an analogy in the mechanism of the Na+,K+-ATPase as well as in the structural similarity of the two enzymes (45Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We are indebted to Prof. Chikashi Toyoshima for helpful comments and suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2072372524,"Catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis is primarily a β-adrenergic and cAMP-dependent event. In previous studies we established that the β3-adrenergic receptor (β3AR) in adipocytes utilizes a unique mechanism to stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK) by direct recruitment and activation of Src kinase. Therefore, we investigated the role of the ERK pathway in adipocyte metabolism and found that the β3AR agonist CL316,243 regulates lipolysis through both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and ERK. Inhibition of PKA activity completely eliminated lipolysis at low (subnanomolar) CL316,243 concentrations and by 75-80% at higher nanomolar concentrations. The remaining 20-25% of PKA-independent lipolysis, as well as ERK activation, was abolished by inhibiting the activity of either Src (PP2 or small interfering RNA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR with AG1478 or small interfering RNA), or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 or 2 (MKK1/2 with PD098059). PD098059 inhibited lipolysis by 53% in mice as well. Finally, the effect of estradiol, a reported acute activator of ERK and lipolysis, was also totally prevented by PP2, AG1478, and PD098059. These results suggest that ERK activation by β3AR depends upon Src and epidermal growth factor receptor kinase activities and is responsible for the PKA-independent portion of the lipolytic response. Together these results illustrate the distinct and complementary roles for PKA and ERK in catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis.

Together these results illustrate the distinct and complementary roles for PKA and ERK in catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis. When exogenous nutrients are insufficient to meet energy needs, the sympathetic nervous system stimulates the mobilization of free fatty acids from triacylglycerol stored in white adipose tissue through lipolysis (1Frayn K.N.

Lipolysis proceeds in a stepwise fashion generating diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, and glycerol while releasing three moles of free fatty acids/mole of triacylglycerol. The catalytic steps responsible for lipolysis have been traditionally understood to involve the β-adrenergic activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 2The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; βAR, β-adrenergic receptor; CL, (CL316,243) disodium (R,R)-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]-propyl]-1,3-benzodi-oxazole-2,2-dicarboxylate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; E2, estradiol; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NE, norepinephrine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PD, PD098059. 2The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; βAR, β-adrenergic receptor; CL, (CL316,243) disodium (R,R)-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]-propyl]-1,3-benzodi-oxazole-2,2-dicarboxylate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; E2, estradiol; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NE, norepinephrine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PD, PD098059., whose key targets of phosphorylation are hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin A. These events are required together in a coordinated fashion to bring the lipase to the surface of the lipid droplets and are key steps in the lipolytic response to catecholamines (2Belfrage P. Jergil B. Stralfors P. Tornqvist H. FEBS Lett. 1977; 75: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Vernon R.G. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5011-5015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). More recently, the involvement of a novel lipase was predicted when the HSL knock-out mice exhibited a relatively normal triacylglycerol hydrolysis, preferentially accumulating diacylglycerol, and actually a greater deficit in cholesterol ester hydrolysis (9Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This revealed that HSL is the rate-limiting step of diacylglycerol, but not triacylglycerol, hydrolysis, because one or more additional lipase(s) could apparently bring about triacylglycerol hydrolysis (9Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol.

In that respect a novel hormone-responsive adipose tissue triacylglycerol lipase (also referred to as desnutrin or calcium-independent phospholipase A2ζ), has been described (10Jenkins C.M.

Targeted disruption of the adipose tissue triacylglycerol lipase gene in mice unequivocally demonstrates its necessity for lipolysis (13Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although adipose tissue triacylglycerol lipase is a phosphoprotein, it is not a PKA substrate (10Jenkins C.M. Mancuso D.J. Yan W. Sims H.F. Gibson B. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48968-48975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), leaving its mode of activation unclear. Additional triacylglycerol hydrolases have been described in adipocytes, but their contributions to catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis have not yet been assessed (11Birner-Gruenberger R. Susani-Etzerodt H. Waldhuber M. Riesenhuber G. Schmidinger H. Rechberger G. Kollroser M. Strauss J.G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Zechner R. Hermetter A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1710-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Previously we showed that the β3AR, which is expressed primarily in adipocytes, is coupled to the two heterotrimeric G-proteins, Gs and Gi (12Soeder K.S.

This dual coupling permits two parallel signaling pathways to be activated: (i) cAMP generation and PKA activation, and (ii) c-Src recruitment to the receptor and activation of ERK (13Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We then proposed that ERK activation might be responsible, at least in part, for the lipolytic response to catecholamines or a β3AR agonist. Subsequently, an involvement of ERK in the lipolytic response was described but not characterized (14Greenberg A.S. Shen W.J. Muliro K. Patel S. Souza S.C. Roth R.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45456-45461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have investigated both the relative contribution of the PKA and ERK signaling pathways in β3AR-stimulated lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and probed the upstream mechanism of ERK activation. The conclusions derived from these studies show that β3AR agonists, in addition to their high intrinsic potency toward PKA-mediated lipolysis, activate ERK in a Src- and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent manner. This ERK activation in the adipocyte serves as a supplemental mechanism to augment and maximize the lipolytic response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chicken anti-rat HSL antisera were described previously (15Holst L.S.

Tris-glycine 4-20% acrylamide-bisacrylamide gels were from NOVEX (Invitrogen). Western Blue Stabilized Substrate for alkaline phosphatase was from Promega (Madison WI).Cell Culture and siRNA Treatment—3T3-L1 cells were maintained at 37 °C in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% calf serum in a 5% CO2 environment. Cells were differentiated 1 day after confluence by replacing calf serum with fetal bovine serum and by adding 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.4 μg/ml dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 10 μm troglitazone to the medium. After 3 days, cells were maintained for an additional 6-9 days in the same medium without additives, and fresh medium was replenished every 3 days. For the siRNA treatment, cells were differentiated for 6 days and then trypsinized and seeded on dishes containing 25 nm siRNA of EGFR or Src in siPORT lipid.Lipolysis—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed with PBS and incubated in Kreb's Ringer buffer containing 2% fatty acid-free BSA at 37 °C for 3 h (for experiments with E2, cells were incubated overnight). This medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing various concentrations (0, 10-50 μm) of the PKA inhibitors H89 or Rp-cAMPS (0.5 mm) and/or the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD098059 (0, 10-50 μm) for 1 h. After this preincubation, CL or NE (0, 0.1-1000 nm) was added for an additional 1 h. All incubations with NE were preceded by a 2-min preincubation with a mixture of adrenergic receptor (AR) blockers (to limit the action of NE to β3AR only) consisting of 10 μm prazosin, 10 μm yohimbine, and 0.1 μm propranolol. The glycerol released into the buffer was measured by the GPO-Trinder method (DMA, Inc., Arlington, TX).Protein Kinase Activity—PKA activity was measured in vitro from whole cell extracts prepared from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes that had been pretreated as described above for the lipolysis experiments. After this preincubation, CL or NE (0, 0.1-1000 nm) was added to the cells for 5 min. All incubations with NE were preceded by a 2-min preincubation with the mixture of AR blockers. Cells were washed with PBS, and 200 μl of a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. The cells were then collected and homogenized by five passages through a 23-gauge needle, centrifuged (12,000 × g, 4 °C) for 10 min, and the infranatant (cytosolic fraction) was collected. A 10-μl aliquot of this extract was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 30 μl of a phosphorylation mixture containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm MgSO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP containing 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of Kemptide (17Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, these incubations were done in the presence or absence of H89 (10 μm) or cAMP (5 μm) in order to quantify the PKA-dependent phosphorylation. At the end of the incubation the tubes were placed on ice and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 1% (w/v) BSA, 1 mm ATP (pH 3.0), and 10 μl of 12.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Aliquots (20 μl) of the supernatants were removed and applied to phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81 paper, VWR). After three washes in 75 mm H3PO4 and one wash in acetone, the amount of 32P retained was determined by scintillation counting. ERK MAP kinase activation assays were performed as previously detailed (12Soeder K.S. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol.

After brief washing with water, the nitrocellulose membranes were scanned (HP4300C) and analyzed using ImageQuant 4.2a software (GE Healthcare).Confocal Microscopy—Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were replated on Lab-Tek Permanox slides, allowed to attach to the substratum for 6 h, and grown an additional 18 h in fresh medium. Cells were preincubated for 1 h with 40 μm H89, 40 μm PD098059, or vehicle as described for the lipolysis experiments. Following the addition of CL (100 nm, 15 min), cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS. The slides were incubated in PBS containing 5% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 2 h with chicken anti-rat HSL antisera (18Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J.

After three additional washes with PBS, the slides were incubated an additional 2 h with goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor594 (Molecular Probes). The slides were covered with glass coverslips, mounted using Vectashield mounting medium from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA), and visualized by laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) at 585 nm.RESULTSWhen we reported that the β3AR in adipocytes is coupled to the stimulation of both PKA and ERK (12Soeder K.S. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12017-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) we proposed that one consequence of this event could be a convergence of these pathways on lipolysis or on brown fat thermogenesis. We could detect no role for ERK in the β3AR-stimulated increase in Ucp1 gene expression in brown adipocytes (16Green H. Meuth M. Cell. 1974; 3: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied whether ERK, when activated through the β3AR, was involved in the acute stimulation of lipolysis in cultured white adipocytes. In the first set of experiments we characterized the relative activation of PKA and ERK in response to selective β3AR stimulation. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with increasing concentrations of the β3AR-selective agonist CL or NE (the latter in the presence of 10 μm prazosin, 10 μm yohimbine, and 0.1 μm propranolol, conditions that will only allow stimulation of β3AR), and kinase activities were measured. Fig. 1A shows that ERK activation, measured as phosphorylation of the kinase by Western blotting (18Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), was increased 3-fold by both agonists and, as expected, more potently by CL (EC50, 14 nm) than by NE (EC50, 109 nm). A similar approach was used for the activation of PKA, as measured by in vitro phosphorylation of Kemptide (17Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, CL was also more potent (EC50, 0.4 nm) than NE (EC50, 6 nm) at stimulating the catalytic activity of PKA. Therefore, these results indicate that lower concentrations of both agonists favor the activation of PKA as compared with ERK. This suggests that, although phenethanolamine agonists like CL interact with additional residues of β3AR not involved in catecholamine binding (19Granneman J.G. Lahners K.N. Zhai Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 856-861PubMed Google Scholar), both CL and NE seem to equally activate ERK. Fig. 1C shows that the dose-response relationship for the stimulation of lipolysis (EC50 of 0.1 and 6 nm for CL and NE, respectively) was best correlated with their ability to stimulate PKA. Nevertheless, the ability of β3AR to stimulate both signaling pathways, and the clear capacity of ERK to stimulate lipolysis in certain situations, required that we fully characterize these two kinase cascades for their involvement in lipolysis selectively stimulated through the β3AR. Therefore, we first confirmed the selectivity of CL toward the β3AR at submicromolar concentration. As shown in Fig. 1D, 0.1 μm propranolol, a β1/β2AR antagonist, was unable to influence the EC50 value of CL toward lipolysis (0.3 versus 0.1 nm), substantiating that CL acts solely through the β3AR.The approach in the next series of experiments was to empirically define the minimal concentrations of the PKA inhibitor H89 and the MEK inhibitor PD098059 necessary for complete inhibition of their respective kinases. As shown in Fig. 2A, PKA activity in response to 100 nm CL was inhibited by H89 in a dose-dependent fashion, with elimination of all kinase activity at a concentration of 40 μm. Although increasing concentrations of H89 led to a progressive inhibition of lipolysis (Fig. 2B), note that 21 ± 6% of β3AR-stimulated lipolysis persisted despite the complete blockade of PKA activity. This result strongly implicated the existence of an alternative signaling route to lipolysis by β3AR. Equally significant were the results of reciprocal experiments in which a dose-response curve for CL was performed in the presence of a fixed concentration (40 μm) of H89. Despite the absence of PKA activity (Fig. 2C), a small but significant (p <0.05) increase in lipolysis (26 ± 5% of the control CL dose-response curve) was measured (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the potency of CL for this PKA-independent lipolytic activity (EC50, 39 nm) corresponds quite well to the EC50 for CL-stimulated ERK activation estimated in Fig. 1A (14 nm), suggesting its participation in the lipolytic response to β3AR. Because of the possibility that the effects of H89 might be attributed to inhibition of other H89-sensitive kinases (20Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3919) Google Scholar), we tested the competitive cAMP analog and more specific PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS on the lipolytic response of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes (21Hoppe J. de Wit R.J. Stec W.J. Baraniak J. Jastorff B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2E, Rp-cAMPS inhibited 64 ± 6% of CL-promoted lipolysis. This persistent residual activity in the presence of these inhibitors supports the interpretation that there is a PKA-independent component in the lipolytic response to catecholamine.FIGURE 2Contribution of PKA to β3AR agonist-stimulated lipolysis. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were prepared as described in Fig. 1. A and B, cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of H89 for 1 h followed by the addition of CL316,243 (100 nm), and PKA catalytic activity (A) or lipolysis (B) was measured as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are from four independent experiments. C and D, cells were pretreated or not with H89 (40 μm) for 1 h, followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of CL316,243.

As shown in Fig. 3A, PD progressively diminished CL-dependent levels of phospho-ERK to basal values at a concentration of 40 μm. Similarly, CL-stimulated lipolysis was reduced by 27 ± 4% by PD (Fig. 3B). Finally, under conditions where CL-stimulated ERK activation was completely prevented with 40 μm PD (Fig. 3C), again 26 ± 5% of total CL-stimulated lipolysis could be inhibited (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Contribution of ERK to β3AR agonist-stimulated lipolysis in vitro and in vivo. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were prepared as described in Fig. 1. A and B, cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of PD098059 for 1 h, followed by the addition of CL316,243 (100 nm), and ERK activation (A) or lipolysis (B) was measured as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are from three independent experiments. C and D, cells were pretreated or not with PD098059 (40 μm) for 1 h, followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of CL316,243. ERK activation (C) or lipolysis (D) was measured as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are from two independent experiments. E, lipolysis evaluated in mice by measuring the plasma glycerol level. Results are from five mice/group. *, p <0.05 and ***, p <0.001 for the effect of CL316,243; +, p <0.05, ++, p <0.01, and +++, p <0.001 for the effect of PD098059.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the hypothesis that ERK plays a physiological role in vivo, we measured plasma glycerol levels following CL injection (3 mg/kg) with or without prior PD injection (10 mg/kg). Because MEK/ERK are broadly expressed in tissues, the effect of PD is obviously not restricted to adipose tissue. However, β3ARs are expressed only in adipose tissue, so any increase in plasma glycerol after CL injection reflects adipose tissue lipolysis. The results shown in Fig. 3E are suggestive of a role for ERK in lipolysis in vivo. Although PD alone increased the basal glycerol level by 45 ± 28% (p <0.01), it nevertheless was able to blunt the CL-dependent increase by 53 ± 7% (p <0.001).The results at this point supported the conclusion that both PKA and ERK contribute to lipolysis stimulated by β3AR. However, as shown in the dose-response results from Figs. 2 and 3, the relative roles of these kinases appear to depend on the concentration of CL, with the combined actions of PKA and ERK best observed at maximal concentrations of CL. To directly test this hypothesis, the collective effect of these kinases was tested under both low (1 nm) and high (100 nm) concentrations of CL in the presence of H89 and/or PD. As shown in Fig. 4A, at 1 nm CL essentially all lipolysis is derived from PKA. Fig. 4, B and C, further shows that under the conditions of these experiments H89 was solely responsible for inhibition of PKA, with no impairment of ERK activity. Therefore, these experiments yielded conclusive evidence that PKA and ERK together are contributing to lipolysis in response to CL, but only under conditions of maximal β3AR stimulation. The data also reinforce the point that ERK activation in response to β3AR is only observed at higher concentrations of agonist (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4Both PKA and ERK are responsible for maximal lipolytic activity by β3AR. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were prepared as described in Fig. 1. A-C, cells were pretreated or not with H89 (40 μm), PD098059 (40 μm), or both for 1 h, followed by the addition of CL316,243 (1 or 100 nm). Lipolysis (A), PKA catalytic activity (B), or ERK activation (C) was measured as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are from four (A) or two (B, C) independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because these results together demonstrate that ERK is a significant contributor to total lipolytic activity by β3AR, we tested the hypothesis that, under conditions of peak stimulation of β3AR, ERK activation might contribute to the translocation of HSL. Using confocal microscopy to visualize HSL, 15 min after addition of 100 nm CL there was a robust redistribution of HSL from a diffuse cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 5A) to a peri-vacuolar pattern around the lipid inclusion (Fig. 5B). HSL translocation was blocked completely by 40 μm H89 (Fig. 5D), but not by 40 μm PD (Fig. 5F), a concentration that was sufficient to completely prevent ERK activation.FIGURE 5Translocation of HSL in response to β3AR stimulation requires PKA catalytic activity but not ERK activation. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were preincubated with vehicle (A, B), 40 μm H89 (C, D), or 40 μm PD098059 (E, F) for 1 h prior to the addition of vehicle (A, C, E) or 100 nm CL (B, D, F) for 15 min. The slides were processed as described under “Experimental Procedures”, followed by 2 h of incubation with chicken anti-rat HSL antisera and 2 h with goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor594 (Molecular Probes). Visualization was made on a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) set at 585 nm. The bar in panel A indicates a 10-μm distance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In earlier work on the activation of ERK by the β3AR we described an essential role for a direct interaction between proline-rich intracellular portions of the receptor and the cytosolic tyrosine kinase Src (13Cao W.

At that time, several of the more detailed mechanistic studies were not conducted in adipocytes and no clear functional role was identified. Therefore we directly tested the hypothesis in adipocytes that Src activity and one of its downstream targets, the EGFR, may not only be involved in ERK activation but might also mediate the increase in lipolysis. Fig. 6A shows that inhibition of Src kinase activity with the relatively specific inhibitor PP2 (23Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J.

Interestingly, these two inhibitors are also able to partially block lipolysis and do so to an extent equivalent to PD (Fig."

We found that silencing the expression of CgA reduced the number of secretory granules in normal sympathoadrenal cells (PC12), and we therefore questioned whether a discrete domain of CgA might promote the formation of a regulated secretory pathway in variant sympathoadrenal cells (A35C) devoid of such a phenotype. The secretory granule-forming activity of a series of human CgA domains labeled with a hemagglutinin epitope, green fluorescent protein, or embryonic alkaline phosphatase was assessed in A35C cells by deconvolution and electron microscopy and by secretagogue-stimulated release assays. Expression of CgA in A35C cells induced the formation of vesicular organelles throughout the cytoplasm, whereas two constitutive secretory pathway markers accumulated in the Golgi complex. The lysosome-associated membrane protein LGP110 did not co-localize with CgA, consistent with non-lysosomal targeting of the granin in A35C cells. Thus, CgA-expressing A35C cells showed electron-dense granules ∼180-220 nm in diameter, and secretagogue-stimulated exocytosis of CgA from A35C cells suggested that expression of the granin may be sufficient to restore a regulated secretory pathway and thereby rescue the sorting of other secretory proteins. We show that the formation of vesicular structures destined for regulated exocytosis may be mediated by a determinant located within the CgA N-terminal region (CgA-(1-115), with a necessary contribution of CgA-(40-115)), but not the C-terminal region (CgA-(233-439)) of the protein. We propose that CgA promotes the biogenesis of secretory granules by a mechanism involving a granulogenic determinant located within CgA-(40-115) of the mature protein.

We propose that CgA promotes the biogenesis of secretory granules by a mechanism involving a granulogenic determinant located within CgA-(40-115) of the mature protein. The regulated secretory pathway that exists in neurons and neuroendocrine cells is characterized by the concentration and sorting of a pool of secretory proteins into specialized intracellular organelles with a typical electron-dense appearance upon transmission electron microscopy, prompting the morphologic term dense-core granules. These granules may remain in the cell for an extended period of time after their formation, until prompted for exocytotic fusion with the plasma membrane by a secretagogue characteristic for a particular cell type. The mechanism underlying the initiation and regulation of dense-core secretory granule biogenesis is poorly understood. The formation of secretory granules is believed to be initiated at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 2The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; CgA, chromogranin A; CgB, chromogranin B; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EAP, embryonic alkaline phosphatase; HA, hemagglutinin; SgP, signal peptide; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; SEAP, secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GH, human growth hormone; BoNT/C1, botulinum neurotoxin C1 light chain. apparatus, where aggregation and condensation of secretory proteins are typically viewed as the initial step prior to granulogenesis. Thus, formation of protein aggregates may occur in the mildly acidic environment that exists in the TGN and in the presence of millimolar concentrations of bivalent cations like Ca2+. Aggregation and condensation are the underpinning processes of two basic models of sorting of proteins within the regulated secretory pathway, viz. sorting for entry and sorting by retention (1Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 3Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar). In the sorting-for-entry model, selective aggregation of the secretory protein may take place in the lumen of the TGN, followed by subsequent binding of a specific structural motif of the protein aggregate to the membrane of the nascent secretory granule or to a sorting receptor therein. In the sorting-by-retention model, sorting takes place in post-TGN immature secretory granules, wherein selective aggregation and condensation occur, leading to preferential retention of regulated secretory proteins while unaggregated (non-retained) proteins are removed from maturing granules by clathrin-coated vesicles through a constitutive-like secretory pathway. The prohormone chromogranin A (CgA) is a member of the granin family of regulated secretory proteins, which are widely distributed in secretory granules of endocrine, neuroendocrine, and neuronal cells (4Taupenot L. Harper K.L. O'Connor D.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1134-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Because of its abundance and its susceptibility to form aggregates in the presence of millimolar Ca2+ and in the mildly acidic pH environment that exists in the TGN and within the immature secretory granule, CgA has long been suspected to contribute to some key aspect of the formation of dense-core secretory granules (5Gorr S.U. Shioi J. Cohn D.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E247-E254PubMed Google Scholar, 9Taupenot L. Harper K.L. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol.

Indeed, recent studies have provided evidence that CgA is required for the formation of dense-core secretory granules and hormone sequestration in sympathoadrenal chromaffin cells. For instance, depletion of CgA in the sympathoadrenal PC12 cell line by antisense or small interfering RNAs reduces the number of dense-core secretory granules (this study and Refs. 10Kim T.

For instance, introduction of CgA into non-neuroendocrine fibroblast cell lines such as CV1, NIH/3T3, and COS-7 cells drives the formation of dense-core vesicles, allowing regulated exocytosis of the granin cargo in response to secretagogue stimulation (10Kim T.

We reported previously that information necessary for CgA trafficking within the regulated pathway of chromaffin cells is contained in the N-terminal region (CgA-(1-115)) of the granin (15Taupenot L.

O'Connor D.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 971: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus far, little information is available on specific structural determinant(s) in CgA that may be required for the granulogenic function of the protein in sympathoadrenal cells. Thus, we have proposed recently that a V-ATPase-mediated acidification of the TGN and/or the immature chromaffin granule contributes to the sorting of CgA to the regulated secretory pathway and the biogenesis of dense-core secretory granules by a mechanism that may recruit a sorting/granulogenic determinant located within CgA-(1-115), but not the C-terminal region of the protein (9Taupenot L. Harper K.L. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3885-3897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To further refine these studies on the presence of both cis- and trans-determinants for the granulogenic function of CgA, we questioned whether expression of a specific domain of CgA might effectively drive the formation of regulated secretory organelles in a sympathoadrenal cell type devoid of such a phenotype. The sympathoadrenal cell variant A35C lacks densecore secretory granules or a regulated secretory pathway and does not express several membrane or soluble secretory granule proteins, including synaptophysin, and several members of the granin family such as CgA, CgB, and secretogranin II (17Pance A. Morgan K. Guest P.C. Bowers K. Dean G.E. Cutler D.F. Jackson A.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this work, we further probed the granulogenic function of CgA in wild-type sympathoadrenal PC12 cells and studied the intracellular trafficking of a series of human full-length CgA or truncated domains fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), embryonic alkaline phosphatase (EAP), or an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope after adventitious expression in A35C cells. Our results show that silencing the expression of CgA in normal PC12 cells decreased the number of secretory granules, whereas expression of CgA in the sympathoadrenal cell variant A35C drove the formation of dense-core vesicular organelles containing a releasable cargo of CgA in response to extracellular stimulation of the cells. Our data suggest that expression of CgA in A35C cells restores a functional regulated secretory pathway, allowing regulated trafficking of other secretory proteins (e.g. growth hormone) that would be otherwise constitutively secreted in naive A35C cells. We propose that CgA contains a granulogenic determinant located within its N-terminal (CgA-(40-115)), but not C-terminal (CgA-(233-439)), region. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were cultured as described previously (16Taupenot L. Harper K.L. Mahapatra N.R. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Rat pheochromocytoma A35C cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen). Supercoiled plasmid DNA for transfection was grown in Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) and purified on columns (Qiagen Inc.). Two days before transfection, cells were split onto either poly-l-lysine (Sigma)/collagen (Upstate)-coated 15-mm round glass coverslips (Fisher No. 1) in 12-well Costar plates or uncoated 6- or 12-well Costar plates. Cells were transfected with 1.25 μg (12-well plate), 2 μg (6-well plate), or 10 μg (100-mm plate) of supercoiled plasmid DNA/well using a high efficiency cationic scaffold method (GenePORTER 2, Gelantis) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five hours after the beginning of transfection, the culture medium was replaced, and cells were further cultured for 48 h. Construction of Expression Vectors—The expression vectors for human full-length CgA and CgA domain chimeric proteins (including the CgA 18-amino acid signal peptide (SgP), MRSAAVLALLLCAGQVTA) fused to the enhanced GFP (EGFP) gene (pCMV-CgA-EGFP, pCMV-SgP-EGFP, pCMV-CgA253-EGFP, pCMV-CgA481-EGFP, pCMV-CgA805-EGFP, and pCMV-CgAΔN-EGFP) or to a truncated domain of the human full-length secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene (pCMV-CgA-EAP, pCMV-CgA253-EAP, and pCMV-CgA481-EAP) were constructed as described previously (9Taupenot L.

The pSEAP2-Basic plasmid (Clontech) was used for the eukaryotic expression of full-length SEAP (including the SEAP 17-amino acid signal peptide, MLLLLLLLGLRLQLSLG). To label proteins at the C terminus with the HA epitope, a doublestranded DNA oligonucleotide incorporating a KpnI and a NotI site and encoding YPYDVPDYA-stop was ligated in-frame into the KpnI and NotI cloning sites of the EGFP gene in pCMV-CgA-EGFP, pCMV-CgA481-EGFP, or pCMV-CgAΔN-EGFP (15Taupenot L.

The CgA481-HA fragment obtained after digestion of pCMV-CgA481-HA with XhoI and NotI was subcloned into the same sites of the internal ribosome entry site-based bicistronic vector pPRIG (18Martin P. Albagli O. Poggi M.C. Boulukos K.E. Pognonec P. BMC Biotechnol. 2006; 6: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) to produce pPRIG-CgA481-HA. Plasmid numbering refers to the position of the 3′-end of the CgA fragment subcloned within the original human CgA cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_001275) (Fig. 1). All constructs were verified by restriction and nucleotide sequence analyses. Chimeric Photoprotein Fluorescence and Immunocytochemistry—Transfected cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed for 1 h at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min), and exposed to the nucleic acid stain Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) for nuclei visualization. Coverslips were subsequently washed with PBS, mounted in buffered Celvol (Celanese), and processed for three-dimensional imaging by deconvolution microscopy. For immunocytochemistry, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated for 5 min in PBS containing 0.1 m glycine and subsequently exposed for 30 min to PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum to reduce nonspecific antibody labeling. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase polyclonal antibody (1:50; Biomeda), mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (1:1000; Covance), or rabbit anti-rat LGP110 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 in buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) (19Reaves B.J. Bright N.A. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then washed and incubated for 30 min with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or antirabbit IgG (F(ab′)2 at 1:250; Molecular Probes) together with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. Coverslips were subsequently washed with PBS, mounted in buffered Celvol, and processed for three-dimensional imaging by deconvolution microscopy. Three-dimensional Imaging by Deconvolution Microscopy—Images were captured on a DeltaVision deconvolution microscopy system (Applied Precision) operated by softWoRx software (Applied Precision) on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation using a ×60 (numerical aperture of 1.4) or ×100 (numerical aperture of 1.4) oil immersion objective. The system included a Photometrics CoolSNAPHQ CCD camera mounted on a Nikon inverted fluorescence/differential interference contrast microscope and a mercury arc lamp light source. Fluorescence was detected using a standard DeltaVision 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/fluorescein isothiocyanate/Texas Red filter set. Pixel intensities were kept in the linear response range of the digital camera. Optical sections along the z axis were acquired with increments of 0.2 μm. The fluorescence data sets were deconvolved and analyzed using DeltaVision softWoRx programs on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation to generate three-dimensional images of the data sets. Silencing of CgA Expression by Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—CgA siRNA (5′-CAACAACAACACAGCACUdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCUGCUGUGUUGUUGUUGdTdT-3′ (antisense)) and scrambled CgA siRNA (CT-CgA siRNA, 5′-GCCACAUACACGAACACAAdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUGUGUUCGUGUAUGUGGCdTdT-3′ (antisense)) were synthesized (Dharmacon) according to a AA(N19)TT pattern (siRNA selection software, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA). Annealed siRNA duplexes were resuspended in RNase-free solution buffered to pH 7.4. One day before transfection, PC12 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well plates. Cells were transfected for 72 h with 4 μg/well siRNA CgA duplex using RNAiFect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Silencing of CgA expression was evaluated by immunoblotting, and the effect of reduced expression of CgA on dense-core secretory granule cellular content was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Flow Cytometry—A35C cells grown on 100-mm plates and transiently transfected with the bicistronic expression vector pPRIG (expressing GFP alone) or pPRIG-CgA481-HA (expressing two separate open reading frames: GFP and SgP-CgA-(1-115)-HA) were suspended in Accutase detachment solution (Innovative Cell Technologies) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cells (7 × 106/sample) were analyzed for GFP fluorescence using a MoFlo cell sorter (DakoCytomation). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) resulted in the isolation of either pPRIG- or pPRIG-CgA481-HA-expressing cells, with both populations showing ∼72% of cells positive for GFP fluorescence. An aliquot of each cell sample was processed for immunocytochemistry (anti-HA monoclonal antibody) and three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy to confirm the vesicular distribution of SgP-CgA-(1-115)-HA and the concurrent cytosolic expression of GFP. The remaining cells were processed for imaging by TEM. Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C in modified Karnovsky's fixative (2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4)), followed by 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), and subsequently dehydrated using a graded series of ethanol solutions, followed by propylene oxide and infiltration with epoxy resin. After polymerization overnight at 65 °C, thin sections were cut and stained with 4% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol, followed by bismuth subnitrate. Sections were examined at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV using a Zeiss EM10B electron microscope. Chemiluminescence Detection of EAP Secretion and Colorimetric Immunoassay of Human Growth Hormone (GH) Secretion—A35C cells transfected with an expression plasmid for a CgA domain-EAP chimera or for GH (pXGH5, Nichols Institute) were grown on 6- or 12-well culture dishes. Cells were washed with calcium secretion buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) and subsequently exposed to calcium secretion buffer or barium secretion buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm BaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) for 15 min. Supernatants were collected, and cell lysates were prepared by quick freeze/thaw in calcium secretion buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. EAP enzymatic activity or GH was measured in the culture supernatant and cell lysate. Detection of EAP activity from CgA-EAP chimera-expressing PC12 or A35C cells was achieved with a high sensitivity chemiluminescence assay (Phospha-Light, Applied Biosystems) using a AutoLumat 953 luminometer (EG&G Berthold). GH was measured with a colorimetric enzyme immunoassay (GH enzymelinked immunosorbent assay, Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a Spectramax microplate reader. The secretion rate was calculated as a percentage of the total EAP activity or GH present in the cells before stimulation. Total EAP activity or GH is the sum of the amount released plus the amount remaining in the cells. Secretion Assay of Epitope-tagged CgA—Transfected A35C cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 100-mm tissue culture dishes were extensively washed with calcium secretion buffer and sequentially exposed to calcium secretion buffer (15 min, 37 °C, 5% CO2), followed by incubation in barium secretion buffer (15 min, 37 °C, 5% CO2). Culture supernatants were collected at the end of each 15-min incubation period, cleared by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and concentrated using reverse-phase SepPak C18 silica cartridges (Millipore). The solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 100% CH3CN. Eluates were lyophilized and processed for immunoblotting. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analysis—In some experiments, total cell lysates were prepared by detergent extraction for 20 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The lysate were cleared by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked for 1 h either in buffer containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum plus 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS or in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS. Nitrocellulose blots were subsequently incubated for 2 h with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (1:1000 in 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum plus 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), rabbit anti-catestatin polyclonal antibody (rat CgA-(363-383); 1:1000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS) (20Taylor C.V.

Blots were subsequently incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Fcγ fragment; 1:7500 in 5% fetal calf serum plus 0.05% Tween 20; BIODESIGN International) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:3000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS; Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by detection of peroxidase activity by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). In some experiments, protein expression was evaluated by densitometry (NIH Image Version 1.6).

A35C cells were transfected with the expression plasmid encoding SgP-CgA-HA, SgP-CgA-GFP, SgP-CgA-EAP, SgP-GFP, or SEAP. Detection of the EAP moiety or HA epitope was achieved by immunocytochemistry using anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase or anti-HA primary antibody and an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody. A series of optical sections along the z axis was acquired with increments of 0.2 μm using a ×60 or ×100 (numerical aperture of 1.4) oil immersion objective.

To test whether helix-helix interactions between the αIIb and β3 transmembrane domains regulate the activity of integrin αIIbβ3, we synthesized a soluble peptide corresponding to the αIIb transmembrane domain, designated αIIb-TM, and we studied its ability to affect αIIbβ3 activity in human platelets. αIIb-TM was α-helical in detergent micelles and phospholipid vesicles, readily inserted into membrane bilayers, bound to intact purified αIIbβ3, and specifically associated with the transmembrane domain of αIIb, rather than the transmembrane domains of β3, α2, and β1, other integrin subunits present in platelets. When added to suspensions of gel-filtered platelets, αIIb-TM rapidly induced platelet aggregation that was not inhibited by preincubating platelets with the prostaglandin E1 or the ADP scavenger apyrase but was prevented by the divalent cation chelator EDTA. Furthermore, αIIb-TM induced fibrinogen binding to platelets but not the binding of osteopontin, a specific ligand for platelet αvβ3. The peptide also induced fibrinogen binding to recombinant αIIbβ3 expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells, confirming that its effect was independent of platelet signal transduction. Finally, transmission electron microscopy of purified αIIbβ3 revealed that αIIb-TM shifted the integrin from a closed configuration with its stalks touching to an open configuration with separated stalks. These observations demonstrate that transmembrane domain interactions regulate integrin function in situ and that it is possible to target intra-membranous protein-protein interactions in a way that can have functional consequences.

The affinity of integrins for ligands appears to be regulated by interactions between the transmembrane (TM) 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; ATR-IR, attenuated total reflection infrared; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMC, critical micellar concentration; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; OPN, osteopontin; PGE1, prostaglandin El; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; POPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; ATR-IR, attenuated total reflection infrared; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMC, critical micellar concentration; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; OPN, osteopontin; PGE1, prostaglandin El; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; POPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. and/or cytoplasmic domains of their α and β subunits (1Bennett J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3363-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that a TM domain heterodimer, acting in concert with a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain clasp, maintains integrins in a low affinity state. The prototypic example of integrin regulation is platelet αIIbβ3. αIIbβ3, a receptor for the plasma proteins fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and vitronectin is maintained in an inactive state on circulating platelets, but following vascular trauma, it shifts allosterically to an active conformation, a prelude to the formation of hemostatic platelet aggregates (1Bennett J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3363-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Data supporting the heteromeric association of the αIIb and β3 TM domains in unstimulated platelets are largely indirect (2Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: 776-786Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Partridge A.W. Melnyk R.A. Yang D. Bowie J.U. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22056-22060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, proteins containing these domains also associate homomerically in micelles and bacterial membranes (4Li R. Gorelik R. Nanda V. Law P.B. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26666-26673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Li R.H. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that mutations that either enhance or disrupt homomeric αIIb and β3 TM domain interactions in vitro can activate the intact integrin expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. These observations suggest a “push-pull” mechanism for αIIbβ3 regulation in which processes that destabilize heteromeric αIIb and β3 TM domain interactions push αIIbβ3 to its activated state, whereas processes that favor their homomeric association pull αIIbβ3 toward its active conformation (6Li W. Metcalf D.G. Gorelik R. Li R.H. Mitra N. Nanda V. Law P.B. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1424-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the absence of the extracellular portion of the protein, αIIb-TM domain peptides tend to form homodimers in micelles and Escherichia coli membranes, rather than associating with the β3 TM domain (5Li R.H. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the residues involved in αIIb homodimerization are also implicated in binding of the αIIb-TM domain to the β3 TM domain, implying that the two interaction sites overlap. Accordingly, we would expect that an αIIb-TM domain peptide might be able to bind to the TM region of αIIb in αIIbβ3-expressing cells, thereby disrupting heteromeric αIIb/β3 TM domain helix-helix interactions. If helix-helix interactions between the αIIb and β3 TM domains are indeed critical for αIIbβ3 activation, disruption of these interactions should cause activation of the integrin. We show here that a synthetic peptide, designated αIIb-TM, corresponding to the wild type αIIb-TM domain, undergoes specific association with the αIIb-TM domain in micelles and bacterial membranes and induces platelet aggregation by interacting directly with αIIbβ3. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that separation of the αIIb and β3 TM helices is required for αIIbβ3 activation. Furthermore, they demonstrate that it is possible to alter the function of an integrin in situ by targeting its TM domains, providing a new approach for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Finally, these results demonstrate a way to perturb TM-TM interactions in intact integrins, allowing determination of the role of these interactions in integrin activation and clustering. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides were synthesized using a 430A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) at 0.25-mmol scales and on a Rink amide AM resin (200–400 mesh) (Novabiochem) with a substitution level of 0.71 mmol/g. Activation of the free amino acids was achieved with N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)uronium hexafluorophosphate as a 0.40 m solution in N,N′-dimethylformamide and using a reaction solvent containing 25% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and 75% 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinon. Side chain deprotection and simultaneous cleavage from the resin was performed with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/1,2-ethanedithiol/anisole (94:2.5:2.5:1 v/v) at room temperature under N2 flow for 2 h. Crude peptides collected after precipitation with cold diethyl ether were dissolved in a mixture of 2-propanol/acetonitrile/water (6:3:1) and then lyophilized. Peptides were then purified on a preparative reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography system (Varian ProStar 210) with a C-8 semi-preparative column (Vydac) using a linear gradient of buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in Millipore water) and buffer B, 2-propanol/acetonitrile/water (6:3:1 v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The N terminus of nascent peptides was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) using a modification of a standard protocol (7Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). To direct the modification to only the N-terminal amine, the reaction was conducted at the end of the automated peptide synthesis while the peptide was still attached to the resin and its lysine side chains protected by butoxycarbonyl groups. Briefly, N-ϵ-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-aminohexanoic acid (Fmoc-ϵ-Ahx-OH; AnaSpec) was coupled to the N terminus of the peptide resin using manual peptide synthesis conditions. The fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl protecting group was removed with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide. Resin was then rinsed with N,N-dimethylformamide four times and swelled with dichloromethane. FITC (Aldrich) was dissolved in a mixture of pyridine/N,N-dimethylformamide/dichloromethane (12:7:5) to prepare a 0.1 m solution. The resulting solution was added to the resin, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature in the dark until a ninhydrin test indicated that the reaction was complete. CD Spectrometry—CD spectrometry was performed using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco). Samples were prepared at 20 μm concentrations in micelles (2.5 mm 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, critical micellar concentration (CMC) 1.0 mm; Sigma) or unilamellar vesicles (500 μm total phospholipid consisting of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (POPG) (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.)) at an 8:2 ratio. Measurements were conducted at 25 °C in step scanning mode with a response time of 4 s. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Equilibrium sedimentation was performed in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 25 °C using six-channel carbon-epoxy composite centerpieces. Peptides, prepared at concentrations of 50 μm, were dissolved in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm C14-betaine (3-(N,N-dimethylmyristylammonio)propanesulfonate; Sigma) and 29% D2O previously determined to match the density of the detergent component (8Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 457: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Partial specific volumes of peptides were calculated using a method described previously (9Kharakoz D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10276-10285Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and residue molecular weights corrected for the 29% D2O exchange expected for the density-matched buffer. The solvent density (1.0245 g·ml–1) was measured using a Paar densitometer. Aqueous solution molar extinction coefficients were calculated using the program Sednterp and multiplied by the molar detergent concentration to provide mole fraction units. Data fitting and analysis were accomplished as described previously (10Kochendoerfer G.G. Salom D. Lear J.D. Wilk-Orescan R. Kent S.B. DeGrado W.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11905-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Tryptophan Fluorescence—Peptide insertion into lipid vesicles was assayed by monitoring changes in the emission spectrum of tryptophan as described previously (11Hammond K. Caputo G.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3243-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An aliquot of peptide from a concentrated stock in Me2SO was added to 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 2 μm in 1.7 ml and was allowed to equilibrate for 5 min at which point the Trp emission spectra was recorded. The sample was then titrated with aliquots of vesicles (POPC/POPG, 8:2). After incubation for 10 min with constant mixing, the Trp emission spectra were re-recorded. Attenuated Total Reflection Infrared (ATR-IR) Spectroscopy— ATR-IR spectroscopy was performed as described previously (12Caputo G.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3275-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, αIIb-TM, solubilized in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 2-propanol/H2O, was mixed with lipid and dried under a stream of N2. The dried film was reconstituted in 5 mm HEPES-buffered D2O at pH 7.1 by vigorous vortexing. The peptide/lipid suspension was then extruded 17 times using an Avestin liposofast mini extruder (Avestin Inc.) equipped with two stacked polycarbonate membranes with average pore diameter of 200 nm. The peptide-containing vesicles were deposited on the ATR crystal, gently spread with a Teflon bar to form a film, and dried under a gentle stream of N2. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 4700 infrared spectrophotometer (Thermo-Electron Corp.) equipped with a DTGS detector and a ZnSe wire-grid polarizer. The internal reflection element was a zinc-selenide ATR crystal (80 × 20 × 3 mm) with an angle of 45° yielding 25 internal reflections. A total of 512 scans at polarizations of 0 and 90° were collected for each sample. Spectra were recorded at 2 cm–1 resolution and analyzed using the OMNIC software package for peak deconvolution and area analysis. Helix orientation angle was calculated from the spectra as described previously (13Arkin I.T. MacKenzie K.R. Brunger A.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 8973-8980Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with the exception that the value used in this study for the crystal refractive index was 2.42 (ZnSe). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). FITC-labeled peptide (1 μm) and purified αIIbβ3 protein (10 mg/ml) were mixed and incubated overnight. The mixture was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the elution buffer (10 mm HEPES, 60 mm N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and fluorescence was measured using a SpectraMax Gemini EM microplate fluorometer (Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission wavelengths at 485 and 515 nm, respectively. Fluorescence Anisotropy—Full-length αIIbβ3 in 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 60 mm N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN, pH 7.5, was prepared as reported previously (14Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence polarization experiments were conducted on an ATF105 spectrofluorometer (Aviv Instrument, Inc.) using a 0.3-cm path length cuvette. Spectra were measured at 25 °C using 1.0 nm slit widths. Excitation at 485 nm was used for the FITC-labeled peptide, and the emission maximum at 515 nm was monitored. Anisotropy measurements were recorded by titrating a 64 nm FITC-αIIb-TM peptide solution with increasing concentrations of purified αIIbβ3 protein. A dissociation constant and base-line parameters were derived from the fluorescence anisotropy signal/concentration isotherm using methods described previously (15Yin H. Lee G.I. Sedey K.A. Rodriguez J.M. Wang H.G. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 5463-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—The contents of the elution fractions from the size exclusion chromatography were identified using precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels; Invitrogen). Before electrophoresis, each sample was incubated at 90 °C for 7 min. Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature with NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting was performed after electrophoretically transferring proteins to nitrocellulose paper (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). The paper was then incubated with the anti-β3 monoclonal antibody SSA6. Primary antibody binding was detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents after 6000-fold dilution of the stock solution, followed by fluorography using Kodak Biomax MS film. TOXCAT—TM peptide dimerization in membrane bilayers was measured by the TOXCAT assay using the expression vector pccKAN kindly provided by Donald M. Engelman (Yale University, New Haven, CT) (16Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). After changing the EcoRV restriction site between the TM region and the malB gene in pccKAN to a BamHI site, the vector was digested with NheI-BamHI, and cDNA encoding integrin TM helices were ligated into the vector in-frame. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli MM39 cells. CAT synthesis was assayed by using a CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Sciences), as described (4Li R. Gorelik R. Nanda V. Law P.B. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26666-26673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Chimeric protein expression was quantified from immunoblots using a Personal Densitometer SI (Amersham Biosciences) and was used to compare CAT expression by the various constructs. Platelet Function Assays—Turbidometric measurements of platelet aggregation were performed in a Chrono-Log Lumi-Dual Aggregometer as described previously (17Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Investig. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelet-rich plasma, prepared from human blood anti-coagulated with 0.1 volume of 0.13 m sodium citrate, was gel-filtered on Sepharose 2B (Amersham Biosciences) using an elution buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.35 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, and 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. 400-μl aliquots of the gel-filtered platelet suspension were stirred at 900 rpm in siliconized aggregometer cuvettes and were supplemented with human fibrinogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and CaCl2 to final concentrations of 200 μg/ml and 1 mm, respectively, prior to adding platelet agonists. Binding of FITC-conjugated fibrinogen to gel-filtered platelets was measured by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) as described previously (18Basani R.B. D'Andrea G. Mitra N. Vilaire G. Richberg M. Kowalska M.A. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13975-13981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following the addition of ADP or the αIIb-TM peptide to platelet suspensions, the platelets were fixed with 0.37% formalin in PBS buffer for 10 min, washed, and examined by FACS analysis. Peptide-induced Cell Lysis—Three methods were used to assess peptide-induced cell lysis. First, peptide-induced lysis of unilamellar vesicles containing the dye Tb(III)/dipicolinic acid was measured as described previously (19Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31218-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Melittin and buffer alone were positive and negative controls, respectively. Second, peptide-induced lysis of erythrocytes was measured as described previously (20Liu D. DeGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 7553-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1% (v/v) suspensions of washed human erythrocytes were incubated with peptide in 4 mm HEPES buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.35 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 3 min. After centrifuging the samples at 14,000 rpm, the optical density of the supernatant was measured at 405 nm. Third, peptide-induced release of [14C]serotonin from nonaggregating platelets was measured as described previously (17Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Investig. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Platelets were loaded with [14C]serotonin, gel-filtered, and incubated with peptide for 30 min in the absence of stirring. The [14C]serotonin content of 100-μl aliquots of platelet-free supernatant was then measured and compared with the [14C]serotonin content of a 100-μl aliquot of the original platelet suspension. Rupture Force Spectroscopy (Laser Tweezers)—A custom-built laser tweezers setup was used to measure the strength of fibrinogen and osteopontin binding to CHO cells or platelets (21Litvinov R.I. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7426-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Litvinov R.I. Vilaire G. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51285-51290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Purified human fibrinogen and recombinant osteopontin (OPN) were covalently bound to 1.87-μm carboxylate-modified latex beads. An individual platelet was manually attached to a 5-μm diameter silica pedestal coated with polylysine, whereas CHO cells were permitted to settle and attach spontaneously to the polylysine-coated bottom of the chamber. A ligand-coated bead, trapped by the laser light, was brought into proximity of an immobilized cell, oscillated at 10 Hz, and then brought into repeated intermittent contact with the cell by micromanipulation. Data collection was initiated at the first contact. Rupture forces following repeated contacts were collected into 5 pn- or 10 pn-wide bins. The percentage of events in a particular bin represented the probability of rupture events at that tension. Optical artifacts observed with or without trapped latex beads produced signals that appear as forces below 10 pn; rupture forces in this range were not considered when data were analyzed. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—Electron microscopy of purified αIIbβ3 heterodimers was performed as described previously (23Litvinov R.I. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Blood. 2004; 104: 3979-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rotary-shadowed samples were prepared using a modification of standard procedures (24Weisel J.W. Stauffacher C.V. Bullitt E. Cohen C. Science. 1985; 230: 1388-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) by spraying a dilute solution of molecules in a volatile buffer (0.05 m ammonium formate) and glycerol (30–50%) onto freshly cleaved mica and shadowing with tungsten in a vacuum evaporator (Denton Vacuum Co., Cherry Hill, NJ). All specimens were examined in an FEI/Philips 400 electron microscope (Philips Electronic Instruments Co., Mahwah, NJ), operating at 80 kV and at a magnification of 60,000. Synthesis and Characterization of an αIIb-TM Peptide—We prepared a 22-residue peptide, designated αIIb-TM, encompassing residues Trp968–Lys989 of the αIIb-TM domain, a length we determined previously to be optimal for αIIb-TM domain homodimerization (4Li R. Gorelik R. Nanda V. Law P.B. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26666-26673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Two lysine residues were added at each terminus of the peptide to enhance its solubility, inhibit the formation of peptide aggregates, and facilitate its insertion into membranes (25Gerber D. Sal-Man N. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21177-21182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Table 1). We also prepared mutant peptides in which one or both of the Gly residues of the critical αIIb GX3G motif were changed to Leu, as well as the unrelated peptide MS-1, a model membrane peptide that forms dimers and trimers in membranes (26Bilgicer B. Kumar K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Amino acid sequences of the αIIb-TM and control peptidesαIIb-TMKKWVLVGVLGGLLLLTILVLAMWKKKLX3GKKWVLVLVLGGLLLLTILVLAMWKKKLX3LKKWVLVLVLGLLLLLTILVLAMWKKKMS1BQLLIAVLLLIATNLILLIAVARLRYLG (B = β-Ala) Open table in a new tab CD spectroscopy of αIIb-TM (Fig. 1, a and b) and LX3L (not shown) in micelles (2.5 mm DPC, CMC 1.0 mm) and phospholipid vesicles (500 μm phospholipid, POPC/POPG 7:3) revealed minima at 208 and 222 nm, confirming that both peptides assume an α-helical secondary structure in micelles and phospholipid bilayers. Furthermore, analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that both αIIb-TM and FITC-labeled αIIb-TM assemble into homodimers in zwitterionic C14-betaine and DPC micelles, as we had shown previously for a peptide that encompassed the αIIb-TM and cytoplasmic domains (5Li R.H. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The pKd values for αIIb-TM and FITC-αIIb-TM in betaine micelles (expressed in mole fraction units, the concentration of peptide in the detergent micellar phase) were 1.8 ± 0.3 and 3.0 ± 1.0, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1). Next, the propensity of αIIb-TM to insert into phospholipid vesicles was examined using fluorescence spectroscopy. Measurement of the maximum fluorescence emission (λmax) of the Trp residues in αIIb-TM revealed a shift from 351 to 340 nm as the peptide inserted into the less polar environment of the lipid vesicle (Fig. 1c). A λmax value of 340 nm is consistent with emission from a Trp located in the polar head group region of a bilayer (12Caputo G.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3275-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at a peptide concentration of 2.0 μm, the shape of the binding curve exhibited near linear titration behavior at low lipid concentrations, indicating that the peptide binds very tightly to the vesicles with an estimated Kd value in the low micromolar range. Although the Trp fluorescence experiments indicated that αIIb-TM binds to POPC/POPG vesicles, polarized ATR-IR spectroscopy was used to confirm that αIIb-TM is capable of forming a TM α-helix in this environment. ATR-IR spectroscopy exploits the fact that in an ordered sample a given bond will absorb infrared radiation differentially, depending on the polarization of the light and the angle at which the bond is oriented relative to the polarized light. If the secondary structure of a peptide is known, the dichroic ratio (RATR) of the amide-I absorbance when the incident light is polarized at 0° to the amide absorbance when the light is polarized at 90° can be used to calculate the angle between the helical axis of the peptide and the bilayer normal. The amide-I vibration observed at 1656 cm–1 indicated that αIIb-TM adopted primarily an α-helical conformation in the POPC/POPG bilayers, consistent with the CD data (Fig. 1d). The RATR of 4.7 corresponds to an angle of ∼15°, indicating that the peptide was inserted nearly perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer. The αIIb-TM Peptide Binds to αIIbβ3 in Micelles and Membranes—Two approaches were taken to determine whether αIIb-TM can associate with full-length αIIbβ3. First, FITC-αIIb-TM, either alone or mixed with purified αIIbβ3, was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column, and the amount of fluorescently labeled peptide in the eluted fractions was measured. As shown in Fig. 2a, the fluorescence intensity of eluted fractions decreased progressively when increasing amounts of αIIbβ3 were present, and a new peak of early eluting fluorescence appeared. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the early peak revealed that it contained αIIbβ3, confirming that the elution of FITC-αIIb-TM was affected by its association with αIIbβ3. By contrast, when the gel filtration was performed using LX3L instead of αIIb-TM, there was no decrease in the LX3L peak in the presence of increasing amounts of αIIbβ3 (data not shown), implying that the GX3G motif in αIIb-TM plays a critical role in its interaction with αIIbβ3. Second, the physical association of FITC-αIIb-TM with αIIbβ3 wa"

Here, we report a novel role of Rac1 in regulating genomic stability and cell senescence. We observed in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts that deletion of rac1 by gene targeting, as well as expression of the constitutively active Rac1 mutant L61Rac1, led to decreased cell growth that was associated with altered cell cycle progression at both G1/S and G2/M phases, increased apoptosis, and premature senescence. The senescence induction by either loss or gain of Rac1 activity was due at least in part to an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). rac1 gene deletion caused a compensatory up-regulation of a closely related family member, Rac3, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the activity of which induced ROS production independently of Rac1. Furthermore, the Rac1-regulated ROS production and senescence correlated with the extent of DNA damage in the Rac1-/- and L61Rac1 cells. Treatment of these cells with a ROS inhibitor inhibited phospho-H2AX-positive nuclear focus formation. Finally, phospho-Ser15 p53 was significantly increased in L61Rac1 and Rac1-/- cells, and genetic deletion of p53 from these cells readily reversed the senescence phenotype, indicating that Rac1 is functionally dependent on p53 in regulating cell senescence. Taken together, our results show that Rac1 activity serves as a regulator of cell senescence through modulation of cellular ROS, genomic stability, and p53 activity.

Cell senescence is a permanent form of cell cycle arrest in primary cells that has recently gained acceptance as a mechanism of tumor surveillance (1Collado M. Gil J. Efeyan A. Guerra C.

Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Senescence can be triggered by DNA damage and/or activated oncogenes and is typically characterized by up-regulation of cell cycle inhibitors such as p16INK4a, p27Kip, and/or p53 that accompanies irreversible G1 or G2 growth arrest (4Lundberg A.S. Hahn W.C. Gupta P. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).

Thus, in addition to the role in DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell cycle control, the oncogene- or DNA damage-activated p53 pathway has been proposed to be a key regulator of cell senescence (1Collado M.

Rac1 and Rac3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas Rac2 is hematopoietic lineage-specific (6Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A.

Rac1, the better characterized Rac subfamily member, can regulate unique signal pathways through engagement of specific effectors. Although Rac1 is well known for its pivotal roles in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, adhesion, and migration (6Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar, 7Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), accumulating evidence has also implicated this Rho GTPase in multiple aspects of cell proliferation, including cell cycle progression and cell survival (9Gu Y. Filippi M.D. Cancelas J.A. Siefring J.E. Williams E.P. Jasti A.C. Harris C.E. Lee A.W. Prabhakar R. Atkinson S.J. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams D.A.

For example, a constitutively active (e.g. Q61L Rac1) or fast cycling (e.g. Rac1b) Rac1 mutant, as well as many of the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (e.g. Tiam1 and Vav), are oncogenic in fibroblast cells and tumorigenic in mice (12van der Malliri A.

Microinjection of active mutants of Rac1 into quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells stimulates G1/S phase progression and DNA synthesis, whereas a dominant-negative Rac1 mutant inhibits the cell cycle. Ras and other oncoproteins such as Tiam1 require Rac1 to cause cell transformation and tumor induction (12van der Malliri A. Kammen R.A. Clark K. van der Valk M. Michiels F. Collard J.G.

Constitutively active Rac1 has also been shown to be a potent inducer of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (19Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K.

Fenster B.E. Ito H. Takeda K. Bae N.S. Hirai T. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Howard B.H. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7936-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This and other related evidence have led to the proposal that Rac1 may serve as a potential anticancer therapeutic target (11Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar).Using a genetic approach, our laboratory has shown that the p19Arf-p53 pathway negatively modulates Rac1 activity and regulates the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, and cell migration mediated by Rac1 in primary MEFs (23Guo F. Gao Y. Wang L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14414-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Guo F. Zheng Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rac1 may contribute to the p53 regulation of cell proliferation by modulating transcriptional and cell cycle machinery, and Rac1 hyperactivation can collaborate with p53 loss of function to promote primary cell transformation (25Guo F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1426-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic connection between Rac1 and p53 remains to be defined. Several recent reports have begun to associate Rac1 activity with cell senescence, particularly in regulating cell morphology and actin structure in the senescence state (26Alexander K. Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2808-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Cho K.A. Ryu S.J. Oh Y.S. Park J.H. Lee J.W. Kim H.P. Kim K.T. Jang I.S. Park S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42270-42278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Partly because of the lack of a suitable primary cell system that allows genetic manipulation of Rac1 expression and because of the nonspecific and dosage-dependent mode of action of dominant-negative Rac1 mutants that have previously been widely used in cell biology studies, the involvement of Rac1 in cell senescence regulation, and in cell proliferation in general, remains incompletely understood.To better understand the role of Rac1 in cell growth regulation, we generated Rac1 gain-of-activity (L61Rac1 mutant-expressing) primary MEFs by retroviral transduction and produced Rac1 loss-of-activity (Rac1-/-) primary MEFs from conditionally rac1 gene-targeted mice. The examination of these primary cells allowed us to determine the contribution of Rac1 activity to various cell growth properties (including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and senescence) that could not be easily assessed previously. We found that, in addition to regulating cell cycle G1/S and G2/M phase transitions and cell survival, appropriately regulated Rac1 activity plays an important role in regulating cell senescence through the maintenance of cellular ROS levels and genomic stability in primary cells. By further examination of Rac1 gain- or loss-of-activity cells in the p53-/- genetic background, we demonstrate that Rac1 activity serves as a key regulator of cell senescence by a p53-dependent mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—Rac1 point mutants (N17Rac1 and L61Rac1) were generated previously (25Guo F.

Only low passage (fewer than five passages) MEFs were used for the initiation of all described studies.Recombinant retroviruses were produced using the Phoenix cell packaging system (28Debreceni B.

Primary MEFs were infected with the respective retroviruses and harvested 48-72 h post-infection. The EGFP-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The Cre recombinase-expressing adenovirus was amplified in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and the supernatant was applied by serial dilution to the WT or Rac1loxP/loxP MEFs to achieve complete Rac1 deletion in the Rac1loxP/loxP MEFs without detectable toxicity.To determine cell population doubling, 1 × 106 cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, and the cells were passaged at the same density and quantified every 3 days. Such a passage protocol was repeated until the cells reached full senescence.To specifically knock down Rac3 expression in MEFs, mouse Rac3 SMARTpool small interfering RNA (siRNA) and control mock siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The siRNAs were transfected into MEFs using Lipofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were grown for 3 days after transfection in serum-containing medium and harvested for Western blotting and ROS activity measurement.Immunoblotting—The protein concentrations in the whole cell lysates were normalized by the Bradford method. Ectopic expression of dominant-negative or constitutively active Rac1 was probed using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). p53 and phospho-Ser15 p53 were probed using anti-p53 and anti-phospho-p53 (Ser15) monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively, and phospho-Ser139 H2AX was probed using anti-phospho-H2AX (Ser139) polyclonal antibody (Upstate). Anti-β-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma. Anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories, and anti-Rac3 polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Adrienne Cox (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC).Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Activity Assay—Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-galactosidase) activity of the cells was detected as described (31Cammarano M.S.

The percentage of positively stained cells was quantified using a phase-contrast microscope.Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analysis—Cell cycle progression of the MEFs was monitored by propidium iodide labeling, followed by flow cytometry analysis on a FACSCalibur (25Guo F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1426-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells in S phase expansion were captured by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, followed by anti-BrdUrd immunostaining and immunofluorescence analysis. The apoptotic cells in the cell culture were detected by staining with 7-aminoactinomycin D and allophycocyanin-conjugated annexin V, followed by flow cytometry analysis as described (9Gu Y.

For phospho-Ser139 H2AX staining, the cells were incubated with anti-phospho-H2AX (Ser139) polyclonal antibody, followed by TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Cell nuclei were labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min. The stained cells were mounted on slides in Aquamount and viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope or a Leica fluorescence microscope equipped with deconvolution software (Improvision Inc.). For BrdUrd incorporation assay, the cells were grown on coverslips, labeled with 30 μm BrdUrd for 10 min at 37 °C, and fixed as described previously (24Guo F. Zheng Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Li R. Debreceni B. Jia B. Gao Y. Tigyi G. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

The cells were probed for 1 h with anti-BrdUrd antibody (Amersham Biosciences), followed by TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody.ROS and Hydrogen Peroxide Detection—MEF cells were assessed for cellular ROS content by staining with the redox-sensitive dye fluorochrome 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes) as described (19Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 34Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared H2DCFDA stock solution was added directly to the cell culture at a final concentration 10 μm and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the relative levels of cytosolic ROS were detected by FACS analysis. Separately, the hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the N17Rac1, L61Rac1, and WT cells expressing the EGFP marker due to prior retroviral transduction procedures were detected using a colorimetric hydrogen peroxide kit (Assay Design) following the manufacturer's instructions.Rac-GTP Effector Domain Pulldown Assay—The glutathione S-transferase-fused p21-binding domain of PAK1 was used to probe the relative Rac1-GTP and Rac3-GTP levels in the cell lysates by a glutathione S-transferase-agarose affinity precipitation method as described previously (30Liliental J. Moon S.Y. Lesche R. Mamillapalli R. Li D. Zheng Y. Sun H. Wu H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 401-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).Karyotype Analysis—Metaphase slides were prepared from log phase growing MEF cells. The slides were aged overnight at 55 °C before incubation with DAPI. Metaphase spreads were captured using a SpectraCube® (Applied Spectral Imaging) mounted on an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope, and the chromosome images were analyzed using FISHView Version 3.0 software (Applied Spectral Imaging). The chromosome integrity of 100 cells for each genotype was analyzed and quantified.RESULTSRac1 Gain or Loss of Activity Results in Impaired Cell Proliferation—WT, Rac1loxP/loxP, and p53-/- MEFs were derived from the congenic strains of mice at embryonic days 11.5-13.5 and cultured following a well established protocol in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (29Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). To achieve a gain of Rac1 activity, WT MEFs were transduced with retrovirus bicistronically expressing the N-terminally HA-tagged constitutively active Rac1 mutant L61Rac1 and EGFP. The EGFP-positive cell population was isolated by FACS and used for further analysis. To obtain the Rac1 loss-of-activity cells, the Rac1loxP/loxP MEFs were infected twice with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the Cre recombinase at a titer that showed no detectable toxicity in the WT MEFs (referred to as WT+Cre). Expression of L61Rac1 in transduced cells was confirmed by anti-HA Western blotting, whereas effective deletion of Rac1 by the adenoviral Cre treatment was confirmed by anti-Rac1 Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Anti-Rac1 antibody appears to be highly specific toward endogenous Rac1 because it did not detect Rac2 or Rac3 in various Rac1-/- blood lineages or Rac3 in Rac1-/- mouse forebrain (data not shown) (9Gu Y. Filippi M.D. Cancelas J.A. Siefring J.E. Williams E.P. Jasti A.C. Harris C.E. Lee A.W. Prabhakar R. Atkinson S.J. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams D.A.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3963-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The cells were passaged every 3 days following a 3T3 subculture schedule in standard MEF medium, and population doubling was quantified over a 12-day period (passages 4-7). As shown in Fig. 1A, WT, WT+Cre, L61Rac1, and Rac1-/- MEFs had a similar doubling time in the first 3 days (passage 4), but the growth rates of L61Rac1 and Rac1-/- cells were significantly slower than those of WT or WT+Cre cells after 9 days of culture (passage 6). As expected, the p53-/- MEFs showed a hyperproliferative growth rate during the course of the examination (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, expression of the dominant-negative Rac1 mutant N17Rac1 in WT or Rac1-/- MEFs caused significant cell growth inhibition (data not shown) (25Guo F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1426-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results indicate that both gain of Rac1 activity by L61Rac1 mutant expression and loss of Rac1 activity by gene targeting of rac1 led to impaired primary MEF growth under the early passage conditions.The reduced proliferative potential of the cells due to Rac1 gain or loss of activity might be related to the previously characterized Rac1 function in cell cycle or apoptosis regulation (35Zugasti O. Rul W. Roux P. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Franke T.F. Fort P. Hibner U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6706-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of Rac1 in the primary MEF cell cycle, we carried out parallel experiments by BrdUrd labeling and propidium iodide staining of the L61Rac1, WT, and Rac1-/- cells to reveal the effect of the gain or loss of Rac1 activity on the various stages of cell cycle progression. Incubation of BrdUrd in the regular medium with passage 5 cells led to effective labeling of the nuclei of the WT+Cre cells, but the L61Rac1 or Rac1-/- cells showed an ∼50% reduction in BrdUrd-positive numbers (Fig. 1B). Propidium iodide staining also revealed a significantly reduced S phase population of the L61Rac1 and Rac1-/- cells compared with that of the WT cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Rac1 gain or loss of activity caused an inhibition of S phase transition. Interestingly, the G2/M phase population of the L61Rac1-expressing and Rac1-deficient cells displayed a more marked increase in the propidium iodide staining profiles (Fig. 1C), indicating that the alteration of Rac1 activity also affected the G2/M phase transition.To investigate the effect of Rac1 gain or loss of activity on cell survival, we carried out annexin V/7-aminoactinomycin D staining analysis of the MEFs under both standard and stress-induced conditions. As shown in Fig. 1D, Rac1-/- cells were prone to spontaneous apoptosis compared with WT cells under the normal serum culture conditions, displaying an ∼3-fold increase in apoptosis rate, as we have shown previously (36Guo F. Debidda M. Yang L. Williams D.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18652-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The L61Rac1 cells also showed increased spontaneous apoptosis (∼2-fold), albeit to a lesser extent compared with the Rac1-/- cells. The apoptosis rates were enhanced by >5-fold in both Rac1-/- and L61Rac1 MEFs when the cells were exposed for 12 h to 300 nm staurosporine, a nonselective inhibitor of multiple protein kinases, whereas WT cells showed only a marginal increase (Fig. 1D). The MEFs infected with either adenoviral Cre or retrovirus expressing only EGFP showed an apoptotic profile similar to that of the parental WT MEFs (Fig. 1D) (data not shown), indicating that the apoptotic effect of the cells was not related to adenoviral Cre or retrovirus infection. These results suggest that both Rac1 gain and loss of activity, i.e. L61Rac1 expression and rac1 gene deletion, can cause increased cell apoptosis. Taking into account the effects on the cell cycle G1/S and G2/M phase transitions (Fig. 1, B and C), we conclude that balanced Rac1 activity is important for maintaining normal cell survival and cell cycle progression.Rac1 Gain or Loss of Activity Induces Premature Senescence—Although the increased cell apoptosis and cell cycle changes in the L61Rac1 and Rac1-/- MEFs contributed to the slowed cell proliferation, these effects may provide only a partial explanation for the significant cell growth arrest noted in the later passages of these cells (Fig. 1A). Because premature cell senescence has been associated with cultured primary cells, particularly under oncogenic stress (4Lundberg A.S. Hahn W.C. Gupta P. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5Woo R.A. Poon R.Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we next examined the cells at various passages for the cell senescence phenotype by SA-β-galactosidase staining. Despite the drastically different morphologies (L61Rac1 cells showed a typical large, flat, “senescent” appearance, whereas Rac1-/- cells were thin, elongated, and spindle-shaped) (Fig. 2A) that are attributable to the altered actin cytoskeleton structures of the cells (36Guo F.

APP is the precursor of Aβ, whose metabolism is strongly implicated in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. To examine the roles of X11L function in APP metabolism, including the generation of Aβ in the brain, we produced X11L-deficient mutant mice on the C57BL/6 background. The mutant mice did not exhibit histopathological alterations or compensatory changes in the expression of other X11 family proteins, X11 and X11L2. The expression level and distribution of APP in the brain of mutant mice were also identical to those in wild-type mice. However, in the hippocampus, where substantial levels of X11L and APP are expressed, the mutant mice exhibited a significant increase in the level of the C-terminal fragments of APP produced by cleavage with β-secretase but not α-secretase. The levels of Aβ were increased in the hippocampus of aged mutant mice as compared with age-matched controls. These observations clearly indicate that X11L suppresses the amyloidogenic but not amyloidolytic processing of APP in regions of the brain such as the hippocampus, which express significant levels of X11L.

NFTs are composed of insoluble paired helical filaments of tau protein. The major components of amyloid plaques are amyloid β-proteins (Aβ), including Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are generated by consecutive cleavages of the amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar). The production and aggregation of Aβ in the brain are believed to be a primary cause of AD pathogenesis (2Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5063) Google Scholar). APP is a type I integral membrane protein composed of a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar). Most APP is proteolytically processed by the α-secretases ADAM10 and ADAM17, which cleave APP at the α-site within the Aβ sequence (3Huovila A.P.J. Turner A.J. Pelto-Huikko M. Karkkainen L. Ortiz R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), generating the C-terminal fragment CTFα. Alternatively, a minor population of APP is cleaved at the β-site by β-secretase (BACE), which generates the C-terminal fragment CTFβ and preserves the entire Aβ sequence (4Vassar R. Bennett B.D.

The X11 family includes X11 (X11α/Mint1), X11L (X11β/Mint2), and X11L2 (X11γ/Mint3); the expression of X11 and X11L is brain-specific, while X11L2 is expressed ubiquitously (14Ho A. Morishita W.

In neurons, X11L mediates an interaction between APP and Alcadein (Alc) by bridging their cytoplasmic domains, and forming a tripartite complex of the three proteins (15Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Alc is a neural type I membrane protein that is subjected to consecutive cleavages identical to those of APP (16Araki Y. Miyagi N. Kato N. Yoshida T. Wada S. Nishimura M. Komano H. Yamamoto T.

In this complex, APP and Alc are stable and apparently shielded from proteolytic processing by secretases (15Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). When X11L is induced to dissociate from the tripartite complex, APP and Alc are then subjected to coordinate metabolism (16Araki Y. Miyagi N. Kato N. Yoshida T. Wada S. Nishimura M. Komano H.

X11 and X11L appear to have identical functions, but the expression and localization of X11 and X11L differs among regions of the brain (17Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For example, in the hippocampus, X11L is expressed predominantly in excitatory pyramidal neurons, while X11 is strongly expressed in inhibitory neurons (18Nakajima Y. Okamoto M. Nishimura H. Obata K. Kitano H. Sugita M. Matsuyama T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 92: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The hippocampus is a region susceptible to amyloid plaque formation, which contributes to dementia in AD (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar). Indeed, transgenic Tg2576 mice with the APP Swedish mutation which also overexpress X11 or X11L have decreased levels of cerebral Aβ and a reduction of Aβ plaques in the cortex and hippocampus (19Lee J.H. Lau K.F. Perkinton M.S. Standen C.L. Shemilt S.J. Mercken L. Cooper J.D. McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C. J. Biol.

In contrast to these overexpression studies, RNAi silencing of X11 and X11L suppressed the generation of Aβ40 from APP in neuroglioma cells (21Xie Z. Rommano D.M. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is still unclear whether endogenous X11 and X11L have a crucial role in endogenous APP metabolism, including Aβ generation, and how X11 and X11L suppress the generation of Aβ in the brain. To address these issues, we produced X11L-deficient mice with gene-targeting technologies. X11L was originally isolated as an APP-binding protein and it has been more extensively analyzed than X11 (7Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J.

We report here that X11L-deficient mice exhibit enhanced amyloidogenic but not amyloidolytic cleavage of APP in the hippocampus, indicating the importance of X11L function in APP metabolism in the brain and a possible role in AD pathogenesis. Generation of X11L-deficient Mice—All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University and the University of Tokyo, and the RIKEN Brain Science Institute. A 14-kb genomic fragment containing exon 1 of the X11L gene from C57BL/6 mice was used to construct a targeting vector. A 1.4-kb XhoI-BsaHI fragment including the translation initiation site of X11L was replaced by the PGK-neo gene cassette flanked by loxP sites for a positive selection marker. A 1.1-kb MC1-DTA cassette, a negative selection marker, was added at the 3′-end of the targeting vector. After transfection of MS12 ES cells derived from C57BL/6 mice (24Kawase E. Suemori H. Takahashi N. Okazaki K. Hashimoto K. Nakatsuji N. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 385-390PubMed Google Scholar) and selection with G418, targeted clones were identified by Southern blot analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of the targeted MS12 ES cells into Balb/c blastocysts and mated with C57BL/6 mice to obtain heterozygotes. The PGK-neo cassette flanked by loxP sites was excised by mating with CAG-Cre transgenic mice (25Sakai K. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Mouse genotypes were determined by PCR using genomic DNA as a template and the primers L19: 5′-gtcgacggtatcgataagct-3′, L20: 5′-tgagtcctctctggaggtct-3′ and L22: 5′-acatagcacacggtgcacat-3′ (see Fig. 1a). Fragments of 550 bp and 310 bp were amplified from wild-type and knock-out mutant alleles, respectively. Antibodies—The polyclonal anti-APP cytoplasmic domain antibody G369 was a gift from Dr. S. Gandy and has been described previously (26Oishi M. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Lim G.S. Isohara T. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 111-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing X11/mint1, X11L/mint2, X11L2/mint3, cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130 (BD Biosciences), APP extracellular domain (22C11) (Chemicon), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Chemicon and Sigma), protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) (1D3, Stressgen Biotechnologies), sAPPα (2B3, IBL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (PROGEN), and synaptophysin (DAKO), and polyclonal antibodies recognizing phospho-Thr668-APP (Cell Signaling), sAPPβ (IBL), and anti-BACE (Calbiochem) were purchased from the indicated commercial sources. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-β-tubulin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-Aβ antibodies BNT77, BC05, and BA27 were supplied by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Immunohistochemistry—Mice were deeply anesthetized with tribromoethanol (avertin) and transcardially perfused with physiological saline and then 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 20 min. The brains were excised, postfixed with the same fixative at 4 °C overnight, and equilibrated in 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS as a cryoprotectant. The brains were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetech), and frozen coronal sections (20 μm) were prepared. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the ABC method (Vector Laboratories). Free-floating sections were incubated with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS followed by incubation with 0.3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in PBS to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were then blocked with 5% (v/v) horse or goat serum in PBS. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies, the sections were further incubated with horse anti-mouse IgG or goat antirabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to biotin (Vector Laboratories), followed by the ABC complex. Peroxidase activity was revealed using diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. Preparation of Mouse Brain Lysate and a Crude Membrane Fraction—Total brain and hippocampal tissues were dissected on ice immediately after cervical dislocation. Tissue samples were homogenized in a 10-fold volume of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaCl) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) with pepstatin A (5 μg/ml), and centrifuged at 14,200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (crude lysate) was used for Western blot analysis. In other experiments, the tissues were homogenized on ice in a 10-fold volume of buffer A (5 mm HEPES. pH 7.4 containing 0.32 m sucrose) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture with pepstatin A (5 μg/ml) at 900 rpm by 12 strokes of a Teflon homogenizer. Samples were centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the resulting postnuclear supernatants were further centrifuged at 14,200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets (crude membrane fraction) were used for Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—The indicated amounts of protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% (w/v) polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels for X11, X11L, X11L2, APP and a large extracellular N-terminal domain truncated at the α-site (sAPPα) and/or the β-site (sAPPβ), and 16% (w/v) polyacrylamide Tris-Tricine gels for APP CTFs, or 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide Trisglycine gels for subcellular fractions). The separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with primary antibodies. The ECL-advance detection system (GE Healthcare) or Western blotting Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for detection of immunoreactive proteins. Band densities were quantified using the Scion Image program (Scion Corp.) and normalized to β-tubulin or MAP2 as an internal control. Student's two-tailed t test analysis was performed to determine statistical significance. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Detection of Hippocampus sAPP—Hippocampal tissues were dissected as described above, homogenized in a 2-fold volume of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5 μg/ml chymostatin and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant included almost all the sAPP and was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-pan sAPP, anti-sAPPα, and anti-sAPPβ antibodies. Quantification of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the Hippocampus of X11L-deficient Mice—Aβ was measured by previously described methods (27Iwata N. Mizukami H. Shirotani K. Takaki Y. Muramatsu S. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Ozawa K. Saido T.C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Hippocampi dissected from 15∼16-month-old mice (tissues from three mice were combined in each assay) were homogenized in a 6-fold volume of TBS (pH 7.6), containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture with pepstatin A (0.7 μg/ml). The homogenates were transferred to a polyallomer tube (Beckman 357448) and centrifuged (200,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C with a TLA 100.4 rotor. The supernatant was collected and 9.1 μl of 6 m guanidine chloride in TBS was added to 100 μl of supernatant and used for quantification of soluble Aβ. The pellet was washed in TBS with centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 5 min, and an equal volume of 6 m guanidine chloride in TBS was added to the washed pellet. The pellet was sonicated for 30 s and allowed to stand for 60 min at room temperature. Then, the sample was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was recovered. The sample was diluted with a 12-fold volume of ELISA blocking buffer (PBS containing 25% (w/v) Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceuticals), 0.05% (w/v) NaN3 and a complete protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was used for quantification of insoluble Aβ. A 96-well ELISA plate was coated with BNT77 (10 μg/ml in 0.1 m carbonate buffer pH 9.5) at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed with PBS and buffer EC (0.02 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) Block Ace, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, and 0.075% (w/v) CHAPS was added to the wells. Aliquots (200 μl) of samples and synthetic Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptides as calibration standards were poured into the wells, and the plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed with PBS four times, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BA27 anti-body specific for Aβ40 or the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BC05 antibody specific for Aβ42 was added, and the plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed with PBS and PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. An aliquot (100 μl) of substrate solution (TMB microwell peroxidase substrate system; Kirkegaard & Perry Lab. Inc.) was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 5-20 min. Stop solution (100 μl; 1 m H3PO4) was added, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader. Generation of an X11L-deficient Mutant Mouse Line—Mutant mice were generated by a standard gene knock-out method using an ES cell line derived from mice with the C57BL/6 background. We constructed a targeting vector that lacked the translation initiation site (Fig. 1a). Mutant mice carrying an allele without the PGK-neo gene cassette were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice several times, and heterozygous mice were then intercrossed to produce homozygotes. Thus, the mutant lines produced in this study were coisogenic with the C57BL/6 strain. The mutation was confirmed by Southern blot (data not shown) and PCR (Fig. 1b) analyses. We also confirmed the protein deficit by Western blot analysis using an anti-X11L antibody (Fig. 1c). There was no X11L in the brain of homozygous (-/-) mutant mice, while approximately half the wild-type (+/+) level was observed in the brain of heterozygotes (+/-). Another X11L antibody, UT30, which recognizes the C-terminal region of X11L (7Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), also did not detect X11L in the brain of homozygous mutant mice (data not shown). These results indicate that homozygous mutant mice express neither full-length X11L nor truncated X11L derivatives. This was further confirmed by immunostaining of the hippocampal region, which expresses substantial levels of X11L in wild-type mice (+/+ in Fig. 1d). For homozygous mutant mice, immunostaining was not observed in any brain region (data not shown) including the hippocampus (-/-in Fig. 1d), while Nissl staining did not reveal any cytoarchitectural abnormalities in the hippocampal region of the brain (Fig. 1e). Other brain regions were also histochemically normal (data not shown). The homozygous mutant mice had no overt behavioral abnormalities and bred normally. Expression and Distribution of X11, X11L2, and APP in the Hippocampus of X11L-deficient Mice—We focused our analysis of X11L-deficient mice on the hippocampus, because the expression of X11L protein in this region is high and its localization differs from that of X11 (17Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We examined the levels of X11 and X11L2 in the hippocampus (Fig. 2), and the expression and distribution of APP and other neural proteins (Figs. 2 and 3). We first tested whether there are changes in the expression of X11 and X11L2 in the hippocampal region of X11L-deficient mice. In both younger (3 months) and older (24 months) adult mice, no remarkable changes in X11 or X11L2 protein expression were observed (X11, p = 0.33 (3 months) and p = 0.33 (24 months); X11L2, p = 0.94 (3 months) and p = 0.52 (24 months)). We also did not detect significant changes in these proteins in the whole brain of aged mice (data not shown), indicating that there was no compensatory increase in the expression of X11 and X11L2 because of the absence of X11L in the brain of mutant mice. Expression of full-length APP composed of mature (mAPP, N- and O-glycosylated form) and immature (imAPP, N-glycosylated form) forms (28Iijima K. Ando K. Takeda S. Satoh Y. Seki T. Itohara S. Greengard P. Kirino Y. Nairn A.C. Suzuki T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was also quantitatively similar in young adult and aged mice (3 months, p = 0.43; 24 months, p = 0.81) (Fig. 2).FIGURE 3Expression and distribution of proteins in the hippocampal CA1 region of X11L-deficient mice. Coronal sections of the hippocampal CA1 region of wild type (left panels, +/+) and X11L homozygous mutant (right panels, -/-) mice (16∼17 months) were immunostained for APP (panels a and b), GFAP (an astrocytic marker, panels c and d), MAP2 (a neuronal dendritic marker, panels e and f), and synaptophysin (a presynaptic marker, panels g and h). Sections were also Nissl-stained (panels i and j). S.o., stratum oriens; Py, pyramidal neuron; Rad, stratum radiatum. The scale bar is 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Protein localization in the hippocampal region of aged (16∼17 months) wild type (+/+) and homozygous mutant (-/-) mice was compared by immunostaining (Fig. 3). Immunostaining of hippocampal CA1 sections with antibodies to APP, GFAP, MAP2, and synaptophysin did not show remarkable differences between wild-type and mutant mice. APP was strongly expressed in the pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region, as was X11L (Fig. 1d), and its cellular localization was identical in wild-type and mutant mice; gliosis was not observed in wildtype or mutant mice. Moreover, no differences were detected in MAP2 and synaptophysin expression or in Nissl staining in wild-type and mutant mice, suggesting that there are no histopathological neuronal abnormalities, such as synaptic loss or dendritic atrophy, in the hippocampus of the X11L-deficient mouse. Deficit of X11L Increases the Level of β-Cleavage Products of APP in the Hippocampus—To examine the role of X11L in endogenous APP processing in vivo, we first analyzed the brain content of C-terminal fragments of APP produced by cleavage with α- and β-secretases. Cleavage by α-secretase generates CTFα, which is composed of the C-terminal 83 amino acids (C83), and β-secretase generates two CTFβ fragments, C99 and C89 (29Liu K. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because CTFs are phosphorylated at Thr668, we treated CTFs with lambda protein phosphatase (λPPase) to identify CTF species (Fig. 4a), as described (30Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the mouse brain, five CTF species can be detected by Western blot analysis: phosphorylated C99 (pC99), C99, phosphorylated C89 (pC89), a mixture of C89, and phosphorylated C83 (pC83), and C83 (31Buxbaum J.D. Thinakaran G. Koliatsos V. O'Callahan J. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9629-9637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of immunoprecipitates containing these CTFs with λPPase resulted in the appearance of three discrete bands corresponding to C99, C89, and C83 on Western blots (Fig. 4a). CTFs in the hippocampus and whole brain of wild-type and mutant mice were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4b), and the total levels of CTFs were normalized to β-tubulin, which is detected in membrane or cytoplasmic fractions at a constant level (32Lopez L.A. Bertini F. Brain Res. 1986; 382: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4c). The relative amounts of β-tubulin, synapsin, and NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) in crude membrane fractions were comparable between wild-type and mutant mice (supplemental Fig. S1). In the hippocampus of middle-aged (12∼13 months) and old (28 months) mutant mice, total CTFs increased significantly when compared with those in the hippocampus of wild-type mice (12∼13 months, p = 0.004; 28 months, p = 0.003). The total amount of CTFs tended to increase in the hippocampus of young adult (4∼5 months) mutant mice, although the difference between genotypes was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). There were no marked differences in the level of total CTFs in the whole brain of wild-type and mutant mice (p = 0.46), even for 28-month-old mice. The level of CTFβ (a mixture of C99 and pC99) in the hippocampus increased 1.5∼2-fold in mutant mice of all ages examined (4∼5 months, p = 0.008; 12∼13 months, p = 0.005; 28 months, p = 0.02), while there was no significant increase in the whole brain of mutant mice (28 months, p = 0.10) (Fig. 4d).

The H+-transporting F1F0 ATP synthases of oxidative phosphorylation utilize the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons or Na+ to mechanically drive the synthesis of ATP via two coupled rotary motors in the F1 and F0 sectors of the enzyme (1Yoshida M.

In the intact enzyme, ATP synthesis or hydrolysis takes place in the F1 sector at the surface of the membrane, synthesis being coupled to H+ transport through the transmembrane F0 sector.

High resolution structures of the homologous α3β3γ subunits of the bovine mitochondrial enzyme revealed two extended α-helices of the γ subunit extending through the core of a hexamer of alternating α and β subunits (4Abrahams J.P.

The linkage between γ and ϵ and the c-ring appears to be permanent, as these subunits can be cross-linked to each other without loss of function (17Schulenberg B. Aggeler R. Murray J. Capaldi R.A. J.

Subunit a is believed to provide aqueous access pathways to the proton-binding Asp-61 residue in the c-ring, but the actual proton translocation pathway has only been partially defined (24Cain B.D.

The interaction of the conserved Arg-210 residue in aTMH4 with cTMH2 is thought to be critical during the deprotonation-protonation cycle of cAsp61 (24Cain B.D. J. Bioenerg.

Cross-linking of Cys residues introduced into subunits a and c, or b and c, supports the positioning of subunit a and the two b subunits at the periphery of the c-ring (23Jiang W. Fillingame R.H.

Little is known about the structure or three-dimensional arrangement of the TMHs in subunit a. Several sets of second site suppressor mutations in one TMH to the primary mutation in a second TMH have suggested possible helicalhelical interactions (20Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34Fillingame R. Angevine C. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 2000; 347: 797-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and five of these pairs have been used as distance restraints in modeling a structure for TMH2-5 (41Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 42Aksimentiev A. Balabin I.A. Fillingame R.H. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1332-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The second site suppressor analysis suggested an arrangement of helices with interactions of TMH2 and TMH4 with TMH5 and of TMH3 with TMH4 (34Fillingame R. Angevine C. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 43Fillingame R. Angevine C. Dmitriev O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this study, we have introduced pairs of Cys residues in putatively opposing TMHs, initially in the vicinity of the second site suppressor pairs, and tested for zero-length oxidative crosslinking of the Cys thiol groups to disulfide bonds. Cross-links were found with eight different Cys pairs that define a juxtaposition of TMHs 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 3-4, 3-5, and 4-5 in a fourhelix bundle. When correlated with chemical modification data (25Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Angevine C.M. Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13179-13183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the juxtaposition of helices suggests the presence of two aqueous access pathways through subunit a. The first pathway maps to one face of TMH4 at the periphery of the fourhelix bundle and extends from the cytoplasm to the center of the membrane. The second pathway is centered in the midst of the four-helix bundle and extends from the periplasm to the center of the membrane. Construction of Mutants—The cysteine substitutions generated here were transferred into plasmid pCMA113 (25Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which encodes genes for the entire unc (atp) operon in which all endogenous Cys residues have been substituted by Ala (44Kuo P.H. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or the C21S substitution in subunit b and which also encodes a subunit a with a His6 tag at the C terminus. Cysteine substitutions were introduced by a two-step PCR method using a synthetic oligonucleotide, which contained the codon change, and two wild type primers (45Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 203-215PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were transferred directly into pCMA113 using unique HindIII (870) or PflMI (1136) and BsrGI (1913) sites (see Ref. 46Gay N.J. Walker J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar for nucleotide numbering). aTMH2 and aTMH3 products were first transferred into pVF196 (20Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), using NcoI (1305) and PstI (1561) sites or PflMI (1136) and PshAI (1805) sites, respectively, and then were transferred to pCMA113 with HindIII (870) and BsrGI (1913) as described above. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the cloned fragment through the ligation sites. All experiments were performed with the mutant whole operon plasmid derivative of pCMA113 in the unc operon deletion host strain JWP292 (10Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Growth Studies Testing Capacity for Cellular Oxidative Phosphorylation—Single colonies were grown on glucose minimal medium plates and then tested for growth in a 0.04% glucose liquid medium (31Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells were also plated on succinate minimal medium agar plates, and colony size was compared after incubation at 37 °C for 72 h (23Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation—The JWP292 transformant cells were grown in media containing 0.6% glucose, 1 mm arginine, 0.2 mm uracil, 40 μm 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2 μg/ml thiamine, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a 10% dilution of LB medium (31Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation after reaching the late exponential phase of growth. The cell pellet was then resuspended in TMG (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5) with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease I and disrupted using an Aminco French press at a pressure of 1.38 × 108 nt/m2. After centrifugation and washing in TMG buffer, the resulting membranes were suspended in TMG buffer, and a modified Lowry assay was used to determine the protein concentration (47Fillingame R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 870-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Copper Cross-linking—Cross-linking was performed using membranes in TMG buffer at a membrane concentration of 10 mg/ml. A stock solution of 15 mm CuSO4 and 45 mm o-phenanthroline in TMG, pH 7.5 (CuP), was added to the membranes to a final concentration of 1.5 mm CuSO4 and 4.5 mm o-phenanthroline and incubated for 1h at 37°C.To stop the reaction, a stock solution of 500 mm EDTA in water at pH 8.0 was added to a final concentration of 50 mm EDTA, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. In some cases, 10 mm 4-dimethylaminophenylazophenyl-4′-maleimide (DABMI) in dimethylformamide was then added to the samples to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the samples were incubated an additional 15 min at 37 °C. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) was added to solubilize the membrane, and samples were incubated for 1h at room temperature before analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In some cases, β-mercaptoethanol was added to 2% (v/v) with the 2× SDS sample buffer. Iodine Cross-linking—Membranes were diluted in TMG to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. A 2.5 mm I2 solution was made in absolute ethanol immediately before cross-linking. Iodine was added to a final concentration of 250 μm, and the mixture was incubated for 30 s at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding one-tenth volume of a fresh 60 mm sodium thiosulfate solution made immediately before initiating the cross-linking reaction. Samples were treated with DABMI and solubilized for analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. SDS Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the Tris-glycine system described by Laemmli with acrylamide and bis-acrylamide concentrations of 15 and 0.47%, respectively (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Following SDS electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using an anti-subunit a rabbit serum that recognizes the first 10 amino acids of subunit a (49Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2815-2817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with a 1:5000 dilution of antiserum into PBS-Tween-BSA (137 mm NaCl, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) and a 1-h incubation followed by an anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, NA-934) at a 1:10000 dilution in PBS-Tween-BSA. The blot was incubated for 1 min with a chemiluminescence detecting solution (50 μl of 90 mm p-coumaric acid in dimethyl sulfoxide and 100 μl of 250 μm Luminol in dimethyl sulfoxide added to 20 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5) and then exposed to film for visualization. Characteristics of Double Cys Mutants—All mutants were able to grow on succinate as a carbon source, which indicates retention of functional oxidative phosphorylation systems, and most mutants grew as well as wild type did in glucose liquid medium. As reported previously (20Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the E219C mutant grew weakly on succinate and also less well than wild type on glucose liquid medium. The H245C mutant did not grow on succinate, and therefore cross-linking from Cys-245 was tested in a functional D119H/H245C suppressor background (20Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Copper- and I2-catalyzed Cross-linking of TMH2/TMH4 Double Mutants—Cross-linking between TMHs within subunit a was assessed by a gel shift assay using 15% polyacrylamide gels. Such an assay had previously been used to measure crosslink formation between the extended α-helices of the Tar chemotactic receptor (50Lee G.F. Burrows G.G. Lebert M.R. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29920-29927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking between helices of subunit a led to faster migration of the protein on SDS gels, as was also the case for the Tar receptor (50Lee G.F. Burrows G.G. Lebert M.R. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29920-29927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conclusion that the gel shift was caused by cross-link formation was supported by experiments with the L120C/G218C double mutant (described in Fig. 1). In our exploratory set of experiments, cysteines were substituted at positions Asn-116, Leu-117, Met-118, Asp-119, Leu-120, Leu-121, and Pro-122 of TMH2 in combination with cysteines also substituted either at Gly-218 or Glu-219 in TMH4. Of these mutants, only the L120C/G218C showed a gel shift with a faster migrating band after treatment with CuP (see Fig. 1, lane 5 versus lanes 1 and 2). Treatment with CuP led to protection of the two Cys residues from reaction with the maleimide DABMI (Mr = 320). Reaction of DABMI with the non-CuP-treated protein resulted in an upward shift of the subunit a band because of the predicted increase in molecular mass of the doubly substituted protein by 640 Da (Fig. 1, lane 3). Prior treatment of membranes with CuP prevented the DABMI reaction and an upward shift of the band (Fig. 1, lane 4). Finally, sequential treatment with CuP, DABMI, and then 2% β-mercaptoethanol led to restoration of normal electrophoretic migration (Fig. 1, lane 6). The β-mercaptoethanol, which was added to a 280-fold molar excess versus the DABMI present, was expected to reduce the disulfide bond formed in the presence of CuP and simultaneously to react with the DABMI to prevent adduct formation with subunit a. A similar mobility shift in the subunit a band was seen when D119C/G218C mutant membranes were treated with I2, which like Cu+2 catalyzes Cys-Cys disulfide bond formation (Fig. 2A). I2 treatment of D119C/G218C membranes protected the subunit a cysteines from reaction with DABMI, and the gel shift was quantitatively reversed by treatment with β-mercaptoethanol. The 119/218 Cys pairs were subject to cross-link formation catalyzed by I2 but not to Cu+2-catalyzed cross-link formation (Fig. 2B). Thus, two reagents that catalyze Cys-Cys disulfide bond formation by different chemical mechanisms (51Friedman M. The Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Sulfhydryl Group in Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins, 1st Ed. Pergamon Press, Oxford1973Google Scholar, 52Capozzi G. Modena G. Patai S. The Chemistry of the Thiol Group, Part 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1974: 785-839Google Scholar) caused identical gel shifts for neighboring Cys pairs, i.e. the 119/218 Cys pair in the case of I2 and the 120/218 Cys pair in the case of Cu+2. We conclude that the increase in electrophoretic mobility observed on SDS-PAGE for the Cu+2- or I2-treated, Cys-substituted subunit a was due to disulfide bond formation. (We have also found that bis-methanethiosulfonate reagents (53Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which react very specifically with Cys residues to cause cross-link formation (54Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), cause a similar shift in electrophoretic mobility for the 120/218 Cys pair and three of the Cys pairs discussed below, i.e. Cys-120/245, -148/245, and -218/248.) 3K. Moore and R. Fillingame, unpublished observations. Cross-linking of TMH2 and TMH4 with TMH5—To further probe the structure of subunit a, cross-linking analysis was performed between TMHs 2 and 5 and TMHs 4 and 5. Fig. 3A shows a cross-linking experiment between Cys in TMHs 2 and 5 using the aL120C/aH245C double mutant in the aD119H suppressor background. As was the case for cross-linking of TMHs 2 and 4, CuP treatment resulted in a subunit a band with increased electrophoretic mobility and also protected it from DABMI adduct formation. The faint band seen at the position of the DABMI adduct in the untreated sample is likely because of trace sample spillover during loading of the wells. The magnitude of the band shift was smaller than that observed with the TMH2/TMH4 cross-links shown in Figs. 1 and 2. A band shift of similar magnitude to that seen for residues 120/245 was also seen for the L120C/I246C double mutant (Fig. 3B). The extent of cross-link formation for this mutant was variable, i.e. there was incomplete cross-linking in this and two other experiments. However, nearly quantitative cross-linking was observed in two other experiments. Fig. 3B also shows crosslinks between G218C(TMH4) and I248C(TMH5). The specificity of cross-linking is illustrated by the lack of cross-linking between Cys at positions 219 and 248 in TMHs 4 and 5, respectively. Cross-linking of TMH3 with TMHs 2, 4, and 5—Cross-linking resulting in increased electrophoretic mobility was observed between S144C(TMH3) and L120C(TMH2), as shown in Fig. 4A. The specificity is illustrated by the lack of cross-linking between Cys at positions 120 and 145 (Fig. 4A). Cross-linking was also observed between N148C(TMH3) and E219C(TMH4) as shown in Fig. 4B, and the specificity is illustrated here by the lack of a band shift with the 148/220 Cys pair. The N148C(TMH3) Cys also cross-linked with H245C(TMH5), as shown in Fig. 4C. The 148/245 Cys pair was constructed in the D119H suppressor background. Cross-link formation was incomplete in this and three other experiments. Specificity in TMH3/TMH5 cross-link formation is illustrated in the 149/247 Cys pair by the lack of a CuP-catalyzed band shift and the lack of CuP protection from DABMI adduct formation (Fig. 4C). Summary of Residues Surveyed for Cross-link Formation—Examples of the band shifts observed for the eight double Cys mutants forming cross-links are given in Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4 together with a few examples of non-cross-linkable Cys pairs to illustrate specificity. A total of 93 double Cys mutants were surveyed for band shifts following CuP treatment. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 5. Remarkably, 85 of the Cys pairs tested did not show band shifts after treatment with CuP. Conceivably, cross-link formation could have occurred without band shifts for some of the negative pairs; but such cross-linked Cys would have been protected from reaction with DABMI, and this did not happen. The large number of negative results emphasizes the precise positioning required for the eight residue pairs that did form cross-links. We have used zero-length crosslinking of Cys residues introduced into four of the five TMHs in subunit a as a means of defining the spatial relationship between these helices. Cross-linking was detected by a shift in the mobility of the subunit a band during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lee et al. (50Lee G.F. Burrows G.G. Lebert M.R. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29920-29927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had previously used such mobility shifts in an analysis of cross-linking of the Tar chemotactic receptor. The cross-linking between the helices may result in a more compact structure in SDS and hence greater electrophoretic mobility through the polyacrylamide gel. In this study, we generated 93 pairs of Cys residues in different transmembrane helices, and eight of these pairs were concluded to form cross-links based upon the gel shift assay. The cross-linkable Cys residues in TMHs 2-5 are displayed in a helical wheel format in Fig. 6A. The cross-sectional arrangement of helices shown is consistent with the complete set of cross-linking data, supporting the packing of helices in a four-helix bundle. The peripheral surface of TMH4 with the essential Arg-210 residue is the surface that is cross-linkable to TMH2 of subunit c over a span of 19 residues (23Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The arrangement shown in Fig. 6A is consistent with many of the results from second site suppressor analysis (20Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32313-32317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that the following pairs of mutant/suppressor residues may be structurally proximal to each other: Asp-119 and His-245, Ala-145 and Glu-219, Gly-218 and His-245, and Glu-219 and His-245. On the other hand, an explanation other than structural proximity is required to explain the function of the G213N/L251V mutant/suppressor pair (40Kuo P.H. Nakamoto R.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 797-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the salt bridge proposed by Howitt et al. (36Howitt S.M. Lightowlers R.N. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) between Asp-124 in TMH2 and Arg-140 in TMH3 seems unlikely. The mild suppression of the R210Q mutation by the Q252R suppressor (39Hatch L.P. Cox G.B. Howitt S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29407-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) would seem to require a slight rearrangement of TMH5 to place the essential arginine at the periphery of the four-helix bundle. The arrangement of TMHs 2-4 in the four-helix bundle shown in Fig. 6A differs significantly from that predicted by Cox and co-workers (37Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 39Hatch L.P. Cox G.B. Howitt S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29407-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) based solely upon genetic experiments. In those earlier models, packing interactions between TMH3 and TMH5 were not predicted. A suggested vertical placement of the five TMHs of subunit a in a lipid bilayer is shown in Fig. 6B, with the positions of the cross-linkable Cys pairs indicated. The general topology with five TMHs was defined by the differences in chemical reactivity of Cys introduced into periplasmic versus cytoplasmic loops to reagents added from the two sides of the membrane (20Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The depth of placement of TMH4 is based upon its cross-linking to TMH2 of subunit c over a span of 19 amino acid residues (23Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the vertical placement of the crystalline I. tartaricus c-ring in the lipid bilayer (14Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 55von Vonck J. Nidda T.K. Meier T. Matthey U. Mills D.J. Kühlbrandt W. Dimroth P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). TMHs 2, 3, and 5 are placed in the bilayer at a depth that minimizes the differences in vertical position of the paired Cys that form cross-links. In this model, the second site mutant/suppressor pairs, 119/245, 145/219, 218/245, 219/245 and 210/252, also locate to nearly identical vertical positions within the lipid bilayer. This model differs significantly from the model of Zhang and Vik (56Zhang D. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 57Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12319-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in the vertical placement of the third TMH. In the Zhang and Vik model, the cross-linkable S144C residue and A145E suppressor to E219C (20Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) would both locate to the periplasmic loop outside of the lipid bilayer. In previous studies from this laboratory, Angevine et al. (25Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Angevine C.M. Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13179-13183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) found that Ag+ inhibited ATP-driven proton pumping in a number of the Cys-substituted mutants in TMHs 2, 4, and 5. Ag+ is know to react covalently with the ionized Cys thiolate (58Lu Q. Miller C. Science. 1995; 268: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and the Ag+-sensitive residues were concluded to be in an aqueous accessible environment where ionization would occur. Cu+2 is thought to ligand with the ionized thiolate of Cys residues while catalyzing O2-mediated cross-linking (51Friedman M. The Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Sulfhydryl Group in Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins, 1st Ed. Pergamon Press, Oxford1973Google Scholar), and the propensity of Cys residues to cross-link may also be a reflection of their aqueous accessibility. Indeed, the function of several of the cross-linkable Cys substitutions identified here was inhibited by Ag+, i.e. with D119C and L120C showing the greatest sensitivity and G218C and I248C showing moderate sensitivity. In the cross-sectional representation of the four-helix bundle shown in Fig. 6A, the Cys residues showing highest Ag+ sensitivity locate to two regions on opposite faces of TMH4. Ag+-sensitive Cys-202, -203, -206. and -214 locate to the same face of TMH4 as the essential Arg-210 residue; this is also the surface that is cross-linkable to the c-ring (23Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The other very Ag+-sensitive Cys residues at positions 119, 120, 215, 249, and 252 locate to the interior of the four-helix bundle. The pattern of cross-linking shown in Fig. 6B, in combination with the pattern of Ag+ sensitivity, suggests that TMHs 2, 3, 4, and 5 must pack closely together toward the periplasmic side of the membrane and that an aqueous access pathway within the four-helix bundle may extend from the periplasm to the center of the membrane. It remains to be proven whether this pathway serves as the route for entry of periplasmic protons to the cAsp-61 protonation site during ATP synthesis. If so, the gating of the halfchannel to provide direct access of the proton to cAsp-61 would appear to require changes in helical orientation. In summary, the cross-linking of helices described here provides a model for the packing of TMHs 2-5 of subunit a that is consistent with most of the biochemical and genetic information pertaining to helical-helical interactions. This model and other experiments suggest that there may be two independent aqueous pathways from the center of subunit a to the periplasmic and cytoplasmic surfaces. These pathways may be gated from the region of Asn-214 and Met-215 to the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1989607850,"The expression of many cyanobacterial genes is regulated by the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. However, factors involved in this regulation have not been identified. In this study, we demonstrate that a small LuxR-type regulator in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, PedR (Ssl0564), senses the activity of photosynthetic electron transport to achieve the photon flux density-dependent transcriptional regulation. PedR is constitutively expressed in <i>Synechocystis</i> cells and exists as a dimer bridged by intermolecular disulfide bond(s). It activates the expression of <i>chlL</i>, <i>chlN</i>, <i>chlB</i>, and slr1957 and represses that of <i>ndhD2</i>, <i>rpe</i>, and the <i>pedR</i> (ssl0564)-sll0296 operon under conditions where the activity of photosynthetic electron transport is low. When the supply of reducing equivalents from photosynthetic electron transport chain increases upon the elevation of photon flux density, PedR is inactivated through its conformational change within 5 min. This mechanism enables transient induction or repression of the target genes in response to sudden changes in light environment. The fact that orthologs of PedR are conserved among all the cyanobacterial genomes sequenced so far indicates that this type of transcriptional regulation is essential for cyanobacteria to acclimate to changing environments."
https://openalex.org/W2035688397,"Integration host factor (IHF) is a bacterial histone-like protein whose primary biological role is to condense the bacterial nucleoid and to constrain DNA supercoils. It does so by binding in a sequence-independent manner throughout the genome. However, unlike other structurally related bacterial histone-like proteins, IHF has evolved a sequence-dependent, high affinity DNA-binding motif. The high affinity binding sites are important for the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes. A remarkable feature of IHF is that it employs an indirect readout mechanism to bind and wrap DNA at both the nonspecific and high affinity (sequence-dependent) DNA sites. In this study we assessed the contributions of pre-formed and protein-induced DNA conformations to the energetics of IHF binding. Binding energies determined experimentally were compared with energies predicted for the IHF-induced deformation of the DNA helix (DNA deformation energy) in the IHF-DNA complex. Combinatorial sets of de novo DNA sequences were designed to systematically evaluate the influence of sequence-dependent structural characteristics of the conserved IHF recognition elements of the consensus DNA sequence. We show that IHF recognizes pre-formed conformational characteristics of the consensus DNA sequence at high affinity sites, whereas at all other sites relative affinity is determined by the deformational energy required for nearest-neighbor base pairs to adopt the DNA structure of the bound DNA-IHF complex.

Site-specific DNA binding by regulatory proteins is a feature of the regulatory processes that maintain, expand, and express genetic information such as replication, recombination, transposition, and transcription. The chemical and physical mechanisms that underlie sequence-specific recognition of regulatory elements by cognate DNA-binding proteins are typically classified as direct versus indirect readout. The former refers primarily to hydrogen bonds between proteins and the unique extra-cyclic substituents at C-4 of pyrimidines, C-6 of purines, and N-7 of purines. These groups provide a base pair-specific pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the major groove of DNA that can be directly read by a complementary pattern of amino acid side chain donors and acceptors. Indirect readout refers to recognition of aspects of DNA structure such as intrinsic curvature, topology of major and minor grooves, ordered water structures, local geometry of backbone phosphates, and flexibility or deformability. Because both the local DNA structure and energy to deform DNA are themselves intrinsic sequence-dependent properties, the conserved sequences that distinguish binding sites necessarily include contributions from both direct and indirect mechanisms. Consequently, although the contribution from indirect mechanisms is expected to be significant in protein-DNA complexes that feature substantial DNA deformation, it has proven difficult to evaluate these contributions quantitatively. A protein that relies exclusively, or primarily, on indirect readout would clearly be advantageous for this purpose.The Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF) 4The abbreviations used are: IHF, E. coli integration host factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 4The abbreviations used are: IHF, E. coli integration host factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. is one such example of a DNA-binding protein that relies on indirect readout for sequence-specific recognition. IHF is a small, basic (22 kDa) heterodimeric protein that belongs to a general class of histone-like DNA minor groove-binding proteins present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Bewley C.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 105-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Friedman D.I. Cell. 1988; 55: 545-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Like other members of its class, IHF forms a complex in which the DNA is wrapped around the protein, producing a bend of 180°. Bending plays an architectural role in the primary role for IHF in chromosome condensation (3Ali B.M. Amit R. Braslavsky I. Oppenheim A.B. Gileadi O. Stavans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10658-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, unlike other class members that exhibit no sequence specificity in DNA binding, IHF also binds in a sequence-specific manner to sites at which bending aids in the formation of higher order structures required for a variety of cellular functions such as site-specific recombination (4Gardner J.F. Nash H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), transposition of mobile genetic elements (5Sewitz S. Crellin P. Chalmers R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5868-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), gene regulation (6Freundlich M. Ramani N. Mathew E. Sirko A. Tsui P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2557-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and DNA replication (7Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Evaluation of known IHF-binding sites, of which over 170 have been identified (8Tolleri, L. (2002) An Interdisciplinary Approach Employing Computational, Biochemical, and Genomic Methods to Examine the Effects of Chromosome Organization on the Regulation of Gene Expression. Ph.D. dissertation, Universita degli Studi di Pavia e Frenze, Florence, ItalyGoogle Scholar), has revealed a consensus DNA-binding motif consisting of several small clusters of conserved bases (9Goodrich J.A. Schwartz M.L. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Engelhorn M. Boccard F. Murtin C. Prentki P. Geiselmann J.

Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These are located primarily in the 3′-half of the site. The two most highly conserved elements are the sequence WATCAA starting near the center of the site and the second sequence TTR located 4 bp in the 3′ direction from WATCAA (9Goodrich J.A. Schwartz M.L. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Some IHF sites also contain a poly(A)-tract containing 4-6 adenines and located 8-9 bp in the 5′ direction from the WATCAA element (12Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1780-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite a nonrandom distribution of bases throughout the sites, sequence consensus is limited to just these few elements. Sites that contain all of these elements bind IHF with affinities on the order 1 nm and are preferred over random sequences by a factor of ∼2,500-fold (see Refs. 14Yang S.W. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6292-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Wang S. Cosstick R. Gardner J.F. Gumport R.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13082-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Mengeritsky G. Goldenberg D. Mendelson I. Giladi H. Oppenheim A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and see below).A crystallographic model of IHF bound to a 34-bp DNA fragment containing the H′ site of bacteriophage λ shows that IHF contacts DNA over the entire 34 bp because of the wrapping of the DNA (17Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). This structure highlights contacts with 26 backbone phosphate groups and extensive interactions in the minor groove. There are direct hydrogen bonds made to only 3 bp (indicated in red in Fig. 1); none involves a donor or acceptor that is unique to a particular base. Even recognition of the conserved elements can be explained based on sequence-dependent structural characteristics rather than as a consequence of direct readout interactions (17Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 18Travers A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R252-R254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dearth of base pair-specific interactions in the major groove supports the widely held view that sequence recognition by IHF is entirely via indirect readout.Much of the bend is centered on two positions 9 bp apart at which proline side chains at the tip of the β-ribbon arm of each subunit are intercalated between a pair of bases in the minor groove of the DNA. These steps show a strong preference for the sequence ApA. Proline intercalation wedges these bases apart to generate sharp kinks at these individual steps. These steps can be considered to include a fourth consensus element. Combined, these consensus elements include only 15-16 bp. Thus, although a slight majority of the base pairs in IHF sites are not conserved, the entire sequence must conform to the wrapped topology of the DNA in the bound complex. The nonconserved sequence accounts for a still quite substantial DNA bend. A recent investigation relied on systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment to identify preferred sequences in the 5′-half of the site, which is more lacking in consensus elements (19Goodman S.D. Velten N.J. Gao Q. Robinson S. Segall A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3246-3255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this failed to define new preferred sequence elements, it did find 100-fold effects of sequence on affinity. These considerations suggest that flexibility, a whole system property, contributes to indirect recognition in IHF-DNA binding.Previously, we applied a bioinformatics approach to explore the relationship between DNA flexibility and IHF binding. DNA sequences were threaded onto the structure of the H′ site in the bound complex (17Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), and the energy difference between these DNA sequences in the bound conformation and the same sequences in their native, unbound conformations was estimated using the harmonic conformational potentials of Olson et al. (20Olson W.K. Gorin A.A. Lu X.J. Hock L.M. Zhurkin V.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Results indicated lower average deformation energy and a narrower distribution for known IHF sites as compared with either sequences selected at random from the E. coli genome, or generated as random sequences matching the E. coli base composition (21Steffen N.R. Murphy S.D. Tolleri L. Hatfield G.W. Lathrop R.H. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Deformation energy calculated in this manner was used to seed classifiers that could be trained to identify IHF-binding sites (22Steffen N.R. Murphy S.D. Lathrop R.H. Opel M.L. Tolleri L. Hatfield G.W. Genome Inform. 2002; 13: 153-162PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, this result was extended to four other DNA-binding proteins, which feature highly degenerate consensus DNA-binding sequences and substantial DNA deformation in the bound complexes, and for which high resolution structures are available (23Aeling K.A. Steffen N.R. Johnson M. Hatfield G.W. Lathrop R.H. Senear D.F. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar).In this work, we have analyzed experimentally the connection between the free energy change for specific IHF binding and the deformation energy. The goal was to assess quantitatively the contribution from DNA flexibility to indirect readout recognition of specific IHF-binding sites. Initial analysis of data taken from the literature for 32 IHF sites that have been carefully characterized quantitatively suggested both the need and an approach to separate effects of DNA flexibility from sequence-specific, albeit still indirect, recognition mechanisms that pertain to the conserved elements. A subsequent analysis was carried out on de novo sequences designed either to maintain particular combinations of consensus elements while varying the remaining sequence to generate the widest possible range of deformation energies, or designed as control sequences in which consensus elements and nonconsensus sequences were varied interchangeably. An additional set of E. coli genomic sequences was also analyzed. These sequences were selected as putative, but as yet uncharacterized, IHF regulatory sites based on classifiers described previously (21Steffen N.R. Murphy S.D. Tolleri L. Hatfield G.W. Lathrop R.H. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Steffen N.R. Murphy S.D. Lathrop R.H. Opel M.L. Tolleri L. Hatfield G.W.

(2003) Computational Methods Using Structure and Sequence for Identifying Protein-binding Sites in DNA, Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Computer Science, University of California, IrvineGoogle Scholar). Like the control sequences and other natural IHF regulatory sites, these exhibit variation in both consensus elements and nonconserved sequences. Results obtained from this analysis detail a significant effect of DNA flexibility that is of increasing significance when fewer consensus elements are conserved.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Buffer components and reagents were electrophoresis grade if available and reagent grade otherwise.IHF Purification and Activity—IHF was purified according to Nash et al. (25Nash H.A. Robertson C.A. Flamm E. Weisberg R.A. Miller H.I. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4124-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Aliquots were stored at -70 °C. The specific DNA binding activity was determined by conducting site titrations of IHF binding to a high affinity IHF-binding site (Kd ≈ 1 × 10-9 m). Binding assays were conducted using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described below. Separate reaction mixtures were prepared that contained 1 × 10-7m 32P-end-labeled duplex DNA oligomer and either no IHF or aliquots from serial dilutions of an IHF stock solution. The volume integrated intensities of the bands corresponding to bound and free DNA were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis as described below. IHF activity was assessed from the concentration necessary to shift 50% of the DNA to the bound complex. The more common approach is to assess activity from the lowest concentration that shifts 100% of the DNA to the bound complex. However, significant nonspecific binding by IHF at this higher concentration complicates the analysis (26Holbrook J.A. Tsodikov O.V. Saecker R.M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 379-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).IHF-binding DNA Fragments—Double-stranded oligonucleotides used in IHF binding assays were generated by annealing complementary single strand oligonucleotides. The double strand DNA oligomers were end-labeled with 32P at both 5′ ends using T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA sequences were 50 bp in length and conformed to the sequence template, 5′-GTTGGCAT(X34)GAACAGGT-3′. X34 denotes a variable sequence corresponding to either different natural IHF-binding sites or selected based on adherence to different combinations of IHF consensus elements (11Ussery D. Larsen T.S. Wilkes K.T. Friis C. Worning P. Krogh A. Brunak S. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and to otherwise maximize variation in deformation energy. The 8-bp flanking sequences are from the λ H′ IHF-binding site; these were held constant. Only the central 34 bp were considered in calculation of deformation energy, as described by Steffan et al. (21Steffen N.R. Murphy S.D. Tolleri L. Hatfield G.W. Lathrop R.H. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Steffen N.R. Murphy S.D. Lathrop R.H. Opel M.L. Tolleri L. Hatfield G.W. Genome Inform. 2002; 13: 153-162PubMed Google Scholar).IHF Binding Assays—Equilibrium binding of IHF was monitored by using the EMSA or gel shift assay. Reaction mixtures were prepared containing 1 × 10-10 m duplex DNA oligomer and either no IHF or concentrations ranging from 4 × 10-11 to 3 × 10-7 m in binding buffer consisting of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 70 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the full reaction mixture volumes (20 μl) were loaded with the current running on 16 × 20 cm, 8% polyacrylamide gels (7.73% acrylamide, 0.26% N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide) in TAE buffer (0.04 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 0.001 m EDTA). Bound and free DNA species were separated by electrophoresis at constant 140 V for 2.5 h at room temperature. Typically, four independent titrations were conducted for each DNA sequence. The de novo sequences were investigated in groups of several at a time, together with the λ H′ sequence, which was used as a reference for these studies.Dried gels were used to expose PhosphorImager screens, which were subsequently scanned using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX. Fractions of bound and free DNA were determined by volume integration of the corresponding electrophoretic bands using the Bio-Rad Quantity One software, version 4.2.1. DNA present in each lane was divided into three fractions. Specifically bound DNA was identified as the distinct mobility-shifted band. A smear of DNA present only at IHF high concentration was interpreted as nonspecifically bound (26Holbrook J.A. Tsodikov O.V. Saecker R.M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 379-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Background exposure was determined by analyzing the regions in the lane with no IHF that would correspond to where bound species would migrate. These background values were subtracted from the pixel values used in the volume integration.Numerical Analysis—IHF binding was analyzed according to the competitive specific and nonspecific finite lattice model developed for IHF binding by Tsodikov et al. (27Tsodikov O.V. Holbrook J.A. Shkel I.A. Record Jr., M.T. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1960-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Application of this model to mobility shift assays, for which the experimental observables are fractions of DNA free, of DNA bound specifically, and of DNA bound nonspecifically, yields the partition function given by Equation 1, where ΔGspec and ΔGnonspec are the free energy changes for intrinsic specific and nonspecific IHF binding, respectively. In the third term, which accounts for nonspecifically bound species, N is the size of the oligonucleotide in base pairs (here 50), n is the number of base pairs occluded by a nonspecifically bound IHF dimer, and j indexes species by stoichiometry of bound IHF.

Both forward, or ligand to lattice, and also reverse, or lattice to ligand, titrations are needed to evaluate this term empirically. The mobility shift assay provides only the former. Holbrook et al. (26Holbrook J.A. Tsodikov O.V. Saecker R.M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 379-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) report n = 9 and n = 16, respectively, at 60 and at 100 mm KCl, ionic strengths that bracket our conditions. We found fitted values of ΔGspec and ΔGnonspec to be insensitive to the value of n over this range. Consequently, the data were analyzed with an intermediate value, fixed as n = 12.The closed form expression for the conditional probability embedded in Equation 2 is an approximation of the exact numerical finite lattice isotherm derived by Epstein (29Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Tsodikov et al. (27Tsodikov O.V. Holbrook J.A. Shkel I.A. Record Jr., M.T. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1960-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) find the difference to be within the limits of reasonable experimental uncertainty when the lattice size is at least severalfold larger than the site size, particularly at the low binding densities to which the mobility shift assay is sensitive. Nevertheless, we also analyzed the mobility shift data using a second formulation for nonspecific binding to assess whether this approximation in the nonspecific binding isotherm might affect fitted values of ΔGspec. For this purpose, we applied a Hill model as a purely phenomenological description of nonspecific binding, leading to Equations 5, 6, 7, 8.(Eq. 5)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)(Eq. 6)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)(Eq. 7)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)(Eq. 8)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In this model, Nave accounts for both the average number of IHF dimers bound in the mobility-shifted bands obtained in the gel shifts and the lattice binding statistics. Nave is not restricted to an integer value. Although incorrect chemically and so of little value to explain actual molecular behavior, this model does yield a reasonable phenomenological alternative to the competitive specific and nonspecific finite lattice model, i.e. one that conforms to the nonspecific binding phase well, and so yields a precise estimate of ΔGspec, the parameter of interest.Nonlinear least squares analysis was conducted using the Origin 7 software (OriginLab Corp.). The Origin software estimates parameter values corresponding to a minimum in the variance. Joint confidence limits that account for correlation between parameters are estimated by adjusting each parameter individually while refitting the others to search for a variance ratio as predicted by the F statistic (30Box G.D.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1960; 86: 792-816Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Confidence limits reported correspond to the 95% interval. When global analysis of multiple experiments was conducted, normalized weights were calculated for the individual data from the square roots of the variances of separate fits to each of the individual experiments.RESULTSAnalysis of Naturally Occurring IHF-binding Sites—Fig. 1 shows an atomic model based on the crystallographic structure of IHF bound to the 34-bp DNA fragment containing the H′ site of bacteriophage λ (17Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Consensus elements are color-coded as described in the figure legend for ease of identification and discussion. The dominant features contributing to the DNA deformation are the sharp kinks at the ApA steps of the two proline intercalation sites, as shown in orange. Although the DNA flanking these sites returns to a canonical B-form structure, within half a helical turn in either direction, the different base pair steps are deformed to varying extents; bending is anisotropic both with respect to degree and direction. Approaches based on general DNA flexibility, even at individual steps, are inadequate to describe the energetic consequences of this situation. For this reason, we have applied the harmonic spring model of Olson et al. (20Olson W.K. Gorin A.A. Lu X.J. Hock L.M. Zhurkin V.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) to capture the molecular level detail of the structural model in estimating deformation energies. The reference structure for these calculations is the structure shown in Fig. 1. All other sequences were threaded onto this structure.As a starting point for the analysis, we compared the free energy change for IHF binding to the deformation energy in a series of naturally occurring, specific binding sites. The sites included in this analysis meet three criteria. First, each site is involved in a specific regulatory process, such as described in the Introduction, thereby confirming the location-specific nature of binding. Second, the evidence for DNA binding was derived from direct DNA binding assays. Third, titrations were conducted as necessary to provide quantitative estimation of the binding free energy. Table 1 presents the results compiled for 32 IHF-binding sites, the complete list for which reliable binding energies were obtained according to these criteria.TABLE 1Binding and deformation energies for IHF binding to natural sites in E. coli IHF binding to regulatory sequences are as shown in E. coli genes. The consensus elements are shown in the first line for reference. W denotes A or T, and R denotes purine. Consensus elements are colored to match the structural model shown in Fig. 1. Values of the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) are as reported by the authors when available or as estimated from the half-titration points of complete titrations. The free energy change for the binding reaction (ΔGb) was calculated from ΔGb = RTlnKd.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab A concern in comparing literature values is the effect of different reaction conditions that were employed in the various studies. In general, variations in monovalent and divalent salt concentration, temperature, and pH would be expected to contribute significantly to apparent differences in DNA binding affinity. However, these IHF binding affinities are particularly advantageous in this regard. First,"

CD4 interaction with the chemokine receptor is suggested to play a critical role in this process but to what extent such a mechanism takes place at the surface of target cells remains elusive. To address this issue, we used a confocal microspectrofluorimetric approach to monitor fluorescence resonance energy transfer at the cell plasma membrane between enhanced blue and green fluorescent proteins fused to CD4 and CCR5 receptors. We developed an efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis from experiments carried out on individual cells, revealing that receptors constitutively interact at the plasma membrane.

Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Following binding to the co-receptor, conformational changes in Env are thought to expose its transmembrane subunit gp41, which inserts into the host cell plasma membrane and to initiate fusion and the infection processes (2Doms R.W. Trono D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Triggering of an efficient fusion between viral and host cell membranes is thought to be a cooperative process that requires multiple engagements between Env and its receptors (3Kuhmann S.E.

Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virus entry thus depends on membrane density of CD4 and chemokine receptors, which is expected to be influenced by their sequestration into delimited membrane domains. In support of this view, high-resolution electron microscopy-based approaches have demonstrated that CCR5, CXCR4, and CD4 form homogeneous microclusters on cell surface microvilli in primary macrophages and T cells (6Singer I.I. Scott S. Kawka D.W. Chin J. Daugherty B.L. DeMartino J.A. DiSalvo J. Gould S.L. Lineberger J.E. Malkowitz L. Miller M.D. Mitnaul L. Siciliano S.J. Staruch M.J. Williams H.R. Zweerink H.J.

Nonetheless, the observations that co-receptors barely associate with rafts (8Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C.

Clustering within domains is also likely to favor interaction between receptors, which is consistent with the proposed existence and functioning of CCR5 and CXCR4 as oligomers (13Babcock G.J. Farzan M. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3378-3385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Percherancier Y. Berchiche Y.A. Slight I. Volkmer-Engert R. Tamamura H.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In early co-immunoprecipitation studies performed in primary T cells and macrophages, Xiao et al. (19Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) also proposed that CD4 and CCR5 were sufficiently close enough to oligomerize and interact constitutively. Such interactions are likely to favor the association rate of gp120 with CCR5, recently proposed as being strictly dependent upon a close vicinity of CD4 and CCR5 in living cells (20Chang M.I. Panorchan P. Dobrowsky T.M. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14748-14755Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observation that CD4 poorly co-immunoprecipitated with CXCR4 (19Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S.

Virology. 2006; 353: 52-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) supports the attractive hypothesis that preferential interactions between CCR5 and CD4 may be relevant to the predominance of R5-tropic HIV isolates in the course of viral infection. Nevertheless, this possibility remains debated, as it was recently inferred using co-precipitation, high-resolution deconvolution microscopy and resonance energy transfer techniques, that CD4 and CCR5 do not exist in a stable complex at the cell membrane (23Furuta R.A. Nishikawa M. Fujisawa J. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24Steffens C.M. Hope T.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4985-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the reasons for these differences are not yet clear, it is noteworthy that in primary cells, the amount of CD4 that co-immunoprecipitated with CCR5 correlated with the efficiency of fusion with cells expressing R5-tropic HIV Env (19Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This suggests that part of CD4 and co-receptors associate at the plasma membrane of target cells, which may be of prime importance in the course of viral entry. To gain further insight into this issue, we set up a non-invasive approach to investigate interactions between CD4 and CCR5 selectively at the plasma membrane of living cells. We used a confocal microspectrofluorimeter to detect fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) at a single cell level between enhanced blue and green fluorescent proteins (eBFP and eGFP) fused to CD4 and CCR5 receptors. We developed an effective method for fluorescence spectrum analysis that reveals constitutive associations between the two tagged receptors at the surface of cells. We found that binding of R5-tropic HIV gp120 stabilized associations between receptors, which makes it likely that ternary complexes form between Env, CD4, and co-receptors before the virus-to-cell fusion process begins, as previously proposed (25Mkrtchyan S.R. Markosyan R.M. Eadon M.T. Moore J.P. Melikyan G.B. Cohen F.S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11161-11169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CCR5 ligands CCL4 and TAK779, which inhibit virus entry, displaced the co-receptor from its association with CD4. Finally, based on experiments using CD4 mutants, we propose that these associations engage extracellular parts of the receptors, and take place in non-raft domains of the plasma membrane. Cell Culture, Transfections, Chemicals, and Reagents—The HEK 293T cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Stable expression of tagged receptors in these cells was achieved using a previously described lentivirus-based strategy, which permits efficient and long term transgene expression without clone selection (26Amara A. Vidy A. Boulla G. Mollier K. Garcia-Perez J. Alcami J. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Virelizier J.L. Charneau P. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the transient transfections performed in this study, cells were plated onto serum-coated 35-mm circular microscope coverslips and transfected 1 day later using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method at DNA concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2 μg. The chemokine CCL4/MIP-1β was provided by Dr. F. Baleux (Institut Pasteur, Paris). TAK779 and gp120 from the R5-tropic BaL and X4-tropic LAI HIV-1 strains were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program catalog of National Institute of Health (Bethesda, MD). CD4 and CCR5 Constructs—Briefly, fragments corresponding to the CCR5 and CD4 open reading frames lacking the initiation and stop codons were inserted upstream of the eGFP or eBFP cDNAs and downstream of an epitope tag from the bacteriophage T7 fused to the cDNA encoding for the cleavable α7 subunit of acetylcholine-nicotinic signal peptide (PS) (27Peng X. Katz M. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 546-554PubMed Google Scholar) to target the chimeric receptor to the plasma membrane. The fragments, named PS-T7-CCR5-eGFP and PS-T7-CD4-eBFP, were then cloned into Prc/cMV (Invitrogen) or HIV-1-based lentiviral pTRIP vectors (a gift from Dr. P. Charneau, Institut Pasteur, Paris). CD4-derived mutants were cloned into pcDNA3. CD4wt and CD4P-L- expression vectors were previously described (8Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3153-3161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutagenesis by PCR of the wild-type CD4 cDNA was performed to substitute Cys residues at positions 419, 422, 445, and 447 with Ala residues using overlap extension with T7, Sp6, and primers containing the mutations. The CD4 deletion mutants, CD4ΔD1 and CD4ΔCt, were obtained using a PCR strategy. Both were deleted in the first 125 residues, corresponding to the first extracellular domain D1. The CD4ΔCt mutant was also deleted of the last 40 amino acids that correspond to the C-terminal intracytoplasmic domain. cDNAs were then inserted in-frame into pcDNA3 vectors (Invitrogen) downstream of the rhodopsin C9 tag (28MacKenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J.H. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) fused to the mouse Igκ-chain signal peptide. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cell surface expression of receptors was determined as described previously (29Lagane B. Ballet S. Planchenault T. Balabanian K. Le Poul E. Blanpain C. Percherancier Y. Staropoli I. Vassart G. Oppermann M. Parmentier M. Bachelerie F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using a BD Biosciences FACS-Calibur. Staining of receptors was performed using the phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CCR5 2D7 or anti-CD4 SK3 mAbs (BD Biosciences). Sorting of poly-clonal cell populations homogeneously expressing tagged receptors was performed using a FACSTARPLUS cytometer (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence Imaging—HEK 293T cells (105) expressing CD4 or its derivative mutants were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum on polylysine-coated glass coverslips overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and then fixed in phosphate-buffered saline, 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were stained for 30 min at room temperature with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb targeting the D4 domain (CD4v4, BD Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After 3 washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, cells were mounted in Vectashield medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Plated cells expressing either CCR5- or CD4-GFP were mounted in Vectashield medium. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) using a Plan Apochromat ×63/1.4-oil immersion objective. Images were collected with a cooled CCD camera (Axiocam MRm), using Axiovision imaging software (Zeiss). Optical sectioning was performed according to the structured illumination principle using the ApoTome system (Zeiss). Functional Analysis of Chimeric Receptors—For [35S]GTPγS binding experiments, crude membranes from wt- or GFP-CCR5-expressing HEK 293T cells were prepared as previously reported (29Lagane B. Ballet S. Planchenault T. Balabanian K. Le Poul E. Blanpain C. Percherancier Y. Staropoli I. Vassart G. Oppermann M. Parmentier M. Bachelerie F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Membranes (10 μg of protein) were incubated in 96-well microplates for 15 min at 30 °C in assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml saponin, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 μm GDP), in the presence or absence (basal [35S]GTPγS binding) of CCL4 at the indicated concentrations. [35S]GTPγS (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.1 nm was subsequently added to membranes, which were further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Incubation was stopped by centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min) at 4 °C, and removal of supernatants. Microplates were counted in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux and data were analyzed with the GraphPad Prism software. For assessment of cell surface expression of receptor variants, saturation binding experiments on intact cells using 35S-labeled gp120 from the Bx08 R5-tropic HIV-1 strain were carried out as described previously (29Lagane B. Ballet S. Planchenault T. Balabanian K. Le Poul E. Blanpain C. Percherancier Y. Staropoli I. Vassart G. Oppermann M. Parmentier M. Bachelerie F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). HIV-1 infections of cells expressing the chimeric receptors were carried out using pseudotyped cell-free virions that were generated as follows. HEK 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with an HIV-1pNL4-3-Luc envelope-deficient (Env(-)), proviral DNA carrying the luc reporter gene in place of the HIV-1 nef gene and the R5-HIV-1-BaL Env-expressing vector. Viruses were harvested at 48 h after infection and quantitated by HIV-1 Gag P24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For infection, cells (2 × 105/well) in 24-well plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with viruses at the indicated Gag P24 concentrations, washed, and cultured for 2 days. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined as previously described (8Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3153-3161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—For immunodetection we used antibodies against CD4 (1f6, Novocastra) and CD28 (C-20, Santa-Cruz). Immobilized antigen-antibody complexes were detected with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-species IgG (Amersham Biosciences), developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+, Amersham Biosciences), and quantified using a LAS-1000 CCD camera (Image Gauge 3.4 software, Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—48 h after transfection, cells were washed in assay buffer (137.5 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 6 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h in assay buffer with or without the ligands sCD4, CCL4, or gp120 at the indicated concentrations. For measurements, cells were mounted on a homemade sealed microcell onto an epifluorescence microspectrofluorimeter (Zeiss, Axioplan) previously described (30Mazères S. Rodriguez F. Tocanne J.F. Lopez A. Analusis. 1996; 24: 20-22Google Scholar). Quantification and analysis of resonance energy transfer between fluorescent receptors were carried out as described under “Results and Discussion.” Functional Characterization of the Tagged Receptors—For FRET experiments to visualize interactions between CD4 and CCR5, N-terminal-tagged receptors with the T7-tag epitope were fused in-frame at their C-tail with GFP derivatives (eBFP or eGFP, Fig. 1A). To assess whether the chimeric receptors were properly addressed to the cell surface, we stably expressed eGFP-labeled CCR5 or CD4 in HEK 293T cells using a lentiviral-based strategy, which relies on integration of the transgene into the host DNA, thereby resulting in a polyclonal cell population. Imaging of these cells revealed that tagged CCR5 (Fig. 2A) and CD4 (Fig. 2B) localize mainly at the plasma membrane. This was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis using the 2D7 anti-CCR5 mAb (CCR5-GFP, Fig. 2C) that recognizes a conformational epitope within the second extracellular loop of the co-receptor (31Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Price K. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Moreover the use of an anti-CD4 mAb (clone SK3) known to prevent the HIV envelope glycoprotein from binding to the D1 domain of CD4 (32Martin-Garcia J. Cocklin S. Chaiken I.M. Gonzalez-Scarano F. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6703-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) indicated that the eBFP-labeled CD4 (CD4-BFP, Fig. 2E) localized at the cell surface similarly to its eGFP-labeled counterpart (Fig. 2B). We then used populations of HEK 293T cells stably expressing either the tagged receptors or their wild-type counterparts for subsequent comparative studies of their functional properties. As a common hallmark of chemokine receptor function is to mediate G-protein-mediated signaling, we first assessed the ability of CCR5-GFP to activate G-proteins in response to chemokines using a [35S]GTPγS binding-based assay (33Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). When expressed at similar levels in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2C), the fluorescent receptor was as efficient as the wild-type receptor in activating G-proteins in response to the CC-chemokine CCL4 (Fig. 2D). This indicates that CCR5-GFP preserves its ability to interact with, and to signal to, its natural ligands. In contrast, membranes from untransfected parental cells were consistently unresponsive to CCL4 stimulation (data not shown and Ref. 29Lagane B. Ballet S. Planchenault T. Balabanian K. Le Poul E. Blanpain C. Percherancier Y. Staropoli I. Vassart G. Oppermann M. Parmentier M. Bachelerie F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Dose-response curves of chemokine-induced [35S]GTPγS binding revealed, however, that the fluorescent receptor displayed a slightly decreased potency to activate G-proteins (EC50 = 9.6 ± 1.9 nm), as compared with the wild-type receptor (EC50 = 2.3 ± 0.6 nm) (Fig. 2D). In line with this, we have previously described that expression of wild-type CCR5 in HEK 293T cells resulted in a fraction of receptors spontaneously activating G-proteins (29Lagane B. Ballet S. Planchenault T. Balabanian K. Le Poul E. Blanpain C. Percherancier Y. Staropoli I. Vassart G. Oppermann M. Parmentier M. Bachelerie F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a process that we show here to be somewhat reduced for CCR5-GFP (Fig. 2D). CCR5-GFP or the wild-type receptor-expressing HEK 293T cells were then transiently transfected with either CD4 or its eBFP-tagged version (Fig. 2E) and assessed for infection by R5-tropic strains. Fig. 2F shows the results from inoculations of cells with pseudotyped cell-free virions generated by trans-complementation of a luciferase reporter HIV-1 provirus (Env-) with an R5-HIV-1 BaL Env. As compared with the wild-type receptor-expressing cells, roughly similar yields of viral replication were measured in cells with the fluorescent receptors. This indicates that N- and C-terminal tagging of CCR5 and CD4 with the T7-tag epitope and fluorescent proteins, respectively, does not impair either their ability to interact with Env or to trigger virus-to-cell fusion. This is further emphasized as specifically blocking the interaction between Env and CCR5-GFP with the CCR5 ligand TAK779 strongly reduced virus entry and replication (Fig. 2F). Saturation binding experiments also showed that binding of 35S-labeled Env to CCR5-GFP-expressing cells occurred with an affinity (Kd = 18 nm) similar to that described for the wild-type receptor (data not shown and Ref. 34Doranz B.J. Baik S.S. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10346-10358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Cell surface expression and functional properties of fluorescent receptors.

D, CCL4-induced [35S]GTPγS binding to crude membranes derived from HEK 293T cells stably expressing CCR5wt (solid circles) or CCR5-GFP (open circles) at similar levels. Membranes were incubated in assay buffer containing 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS, 1 μm GDP, and 3 mm MgCl2 at the indicated concentrations of CCL4. Results are representative of two independent experiments performed in triplicate.E, cell surface expression of wild-type CD4 (CD4wt, red line) and CD4-BFP (blue line) were determined using the PE-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb SK3 by flow cytometry. The filled peak represents the isotype control mAb (PE-conjugated IgG1). F, HEK 293T cells (105 cells) stably expressing tagged receptors with or without their wild-type counterpart were subjected to infection with R5-HIV-1-BaL (7.2 ng of Gag P24) in 24-well plates for 4 h. Luciferase activity was analyzed 48 h after infection and normalized for protein content assessed by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent. The inhibitory effect of the CCR5 antagonist TAK779 at 1 μm on infection of cells co-expressing CD4-BFP and CCR5-GFP is also shown.

The eBFP/eGFP pair is particularly suited for FRET measurements as both chromophores have excitation spectra sufficiently separated so that excitation of the acceptor eGFP is marginal when the donor eBFP is excited (35Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Overlap between the emission spectrum of the donor eBFP and the excitation spectrum of the acceptor eGFP allows obtaining sufficient energy transfer upon excitation of the donor, which results in decrease of eBFP fluorescence (35Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Moreover, according to the Förster equation, resonance energy transfer is expected to occur when tagged proteins are positioned with correct relative orientations (36Berney C. Danuser G. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3992-4010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and in sufficiently close physical proximity (Ro ∼ 45 Å for the eBFP/eGFP couple), so that FRET could be best accounted for by formation of specific molecular interactions. Single-cell analysis of FRET was carried out using a confocal microspectrofluorimeter previously described (30Mazères S. Rodriguez F. Tocanne J.F. Lopez A. Analusis. 1996; 24: 20-22Google Scholar). This approach, which directly monitors the resonance energy transfer originating mainly from cell plasma membranes is particularly suited to study the organization of receptors at the cell surface. Fig. 3A represents fluorescence spectra from 52 distinct HEK 293T cells co-expressing CD4-BFP and CCR5-GFP acquired in a typical FRET experiment. It is apparent that fluorescence spectra greatly differ from one cell to another. This likely arises from different levels of receptor expression as well as the contribution of cell autofluorescence, and renders collective analysis from cell suspensions not relevant. To look at the diversity of fluorescence spectra, we classified them according to the CIE 1931 standard XYZ Colorimetric system (37Baranger R. Martinez L. Pittion J.L. Pouleau J. Org. Geochem. 1991; 17: 467-475Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 38Wright W.D. Trans. Optical Soc. 1928; 30: 141-164Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar), from which it is possible to represent the spectral density of a given spectrum Lλ by three tristimulus values X, Y, and Z defined as follows, X=∑λminλmax=(Rλ×Lλ) Y=∑λminλmax=(Gλ×Lλ) Z=∑λminλmax=(Bλ×Lλ) where Rλ, Gλ, and Bλ are the amounts, at a wavelength λ, of three-reference colors (set arbitrarily as red, green, and blue in what it follows) needed to match the spectrum. It can then be deduced from Equations 1-3 the relative contributions x, y, and z of X, Y, and Z. x=X/(X+Y+Z) y=Y/(X+Y+Z) z=Z/(X+Y+Z) The x, y, and z values are named trichromatic coordinates (TCC), with [x+y+z]=1 so that only two of three coordinates need to be specified in a two-dimensional diagram to account for a spectral distribution. TCC, which define spectrum shapes, are independent of fluorescence intensities. Red TCC (x values) from independent fluorescence spectra (with excitation wavelengths λ ranging between 334 nm to 364 nm) acquired using untransfected or CD4-BFP- and/or CCR5-GFP-expressing HEK 293T cells are plotted as a function of blue TCC (z values) in Fig. 3B. It is apparent that the use of TCC allows discrimination between cell populations with different spectral featu"

https://openalex.org/W1983648433,"Negative feedback is among the key mechanisms for regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. Human Sef, a recently identified inhibitor of RTK signaling, encodes different isoforms, including a membrane spanning (hSef-a) and a cytosolic (hSef-b) isoform. Previously, we reported that hSef-b inhibited fibroblast proliferation and prevented the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), without affecting protein kinase B/Akt or p38 MAPK. Conflicting results were reported concerning hSef-a inhibition of MAPK activation, and the effect of hSef-a on other RTK-induced signaling pathways is unknown. Here we show that, in fibroblasts, similar to hSef-b, ectopic expression of hSef-a inhibited fibroblast growth factor-induced cell proliferation. Unlike hSef-b, however, the growth arrest was mediated via a MAPK-independent mechanism, and was accompanied by elevated p38 MAPK phosphorylation and inhibition of protein kinase B/Akt. In addition, hSef-a, but not hSef-b, mediated apoptosis in fibroblast growth factor-stimulated cells. Chemical inhibitor of p38 MAPK abrogated the effect of hSef-a on apoptosis. In epithelial cells, ectopic expression of hSef-a inhibited the activation of MAPK, whereas down-regulation of endogenous hSef-a significantly increased MAPK activation and accelerated growth factor-dependent cell proliferation. These results indicate that hSef-a is a multifunctional negative modulator of RTK signaling and clearly demonstrate that hSef-a can inhibit the activation of MAPK, although in a cell type-specific manner. Moreover, the differences between the activities of hSef-a and hSef-b suggest that hSef isoforms can control signal specificity and subsequent cell fate by utilizing different mechanisms to modulate RTK signaling.

Growth factors represent a large group of ligands that bind and activate specific cell surface receptors endowed with tyrosine kinase activity (designated RTK) 5The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CO-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; tet, tetracycline; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; PKB, protein kinase B. 5The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CO-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; tet, tetracycline; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; PKB, protein kinase B. (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3481) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to RTK induces receptor dimerization and subsequent activation of the receptor tyrosine-kinase domain by autophosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of RTKs is crucial in recruiting and activating a variety of signaling molecules possessing intrinsic enzymatic activities or adapter proteins that link different proteins involved in signal transduction (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3481) Google Scholar). These interactions then trigger a number of signaling cascades, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) cascades, which are primary components of this intracellular signaling machinery (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3481) Google Scholar). All eukaryotic cells possess multiple MAPK pathways, of which the ERK/MAPK, the p38 MAPK, and the Jun kinase (JNK) have been extensively studied (2Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). ERK/MAPKs are preferably activated by growth factors, whereas p38 MAPK and JNK are more responsive to environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines, but can be activated by growth factors as well (2Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). The PI3K pathway transduces signals from a number of external stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and stress (3Downward J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar).Growth factor signaling by RTKs is essential for controlling fundamental biological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, cell migration, and survival. Deregulated RTK signaling has been associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and skeletal disorders, implying that RTKs activities must be tightly constrained under physiological conditions (4Bennasroune A. Gardin A. Aunis D. Cremel G. Hubert P. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2004; 50: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 5Niehrs C. Meinhardt H.

Several mechanisms collectively known as “negative signaling” have evolved to attenuate signaling by RTKs (8Christofori G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One such mode of regulation involves negative feedback loops that restrict the duration or intensity of RTK signals. Studies in the past decade have identified a number of feedback inhibitors for the Ras/MAPK pathway, including the Sproutys, the SPREDs (Sprouty-related EVH1-domain-containing), and Sef (similar expression to FGF genes) proteins. These proteins belong to a class of pathway-specific antagonists whose expression and activity are induced by the pathway they inhibit (8Christofori G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10Tsang M. Dawid I.B.

Cell. 2004; 7: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Unlike the Sproutys and the SPREDs that represent gene families, a single Sef gene exists in vertebrates. The prototypical Sef (designated zfSef, mSef, hSef-a, and cSef for zebrafish, mouse, human, and chicken Sef, respectively) encodes a membrane-spanning protein that is highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution (17Harduf H. Halperin E. Reshef R. Ron D. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Its extracellular portion contains a single immunoglobulin-like domain and several potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. The intracellular portion has an interleukin 17 receptor-like domain and an invariant site for tyrosine phosphorylation. It has not been demonstrated whether this tyrosine residue undergoes phosphorylation. It is considered of functional importance, because its mutation in zfSef abrogated zfSef inhibitory activity (12Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that an alternative splicing mechanism generates a cytosolic hSef isoform. In this isoform, termed hSef-b, the signal for secretion and nine N-terminal residues in hSef-a were substituted with a short stretch of new N-terminal residues (14Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A. Sher I. Tsang M. Dawid I.B. Altuvia Y. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). hSef-b prevented FGF and platelet derived growth factor-induced cell proliferation by inhibiting the activation of ERK/MAPK (14Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A. Sher I. Tsang M. Dawid I.B. Altuvia Y. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of the prototypical Sef to inhibit the activation of MAPK and its action point along the Ras/MAPK cascade are controversial. Several reports indicated that zfSef and hSef-a act at the level of, or downstream from, MEK, to inhibit the activation of MAPK (11Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 15Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Komuves L.G. Gerritsen M.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33232-33238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, other reports argued that mSef and hSef-a act upstream or at the level of Ras (13Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14087-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Xiong S. Zhao Q. Rong Z. Huang G. Huang Y. Chen P. Zhang S. Liu L. Chang Z. J. Biol.

Commun. 2006; 347: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that Sef does not inhibit the activation of MAPK but acts by preventing nuclear translocation of activated MAPK (18Torii S. Kusakabe M. Yamamoto T. Maekawa M. Nishida E. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).In the present study, we employed ectopic hSef expression as well as RNA silencing to analyze the modulatory activities and mode of action of hSef-a. In addition, we investigated whether hSef variants can be phosphorylated on tyrosine as predicted from their sequence. Our results revealed that hSef-a, unlike hSef-b, is a multifunctional protein that modulates cell cycle progression and cell survival. Both hSef variants are phosphorylated on tyrosine in the presence of activated FGF receptor and most likely on several tyrosine residues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes, Growth Factors, Reagents, and Chemicals—Restriction enzymes and enzymes used for cDNA cloning and plasmid construction were from New England Biolabs, Roche Applied Science, and Amersham Biosciences. Purified recombinant FGF-2 was produced as previously described (20Reich-Slotky R. Shaoul E. Berman B. Graziani G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29813-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bovine brain FGF1, recombinant human FGF4, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were from R&D Systems. [3H]Thymidine (25 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences HVD Biotech. Fibronectin, fetal and newborn calf serum, and media were from Biological Industries or from Invitrogen. Fluoromount-GTM was from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Bovine serum albumin was from ICN. Lipofectamine and Dreamfect transfection reagents were from Invitrogen and Ozbioscience, respectively. Insulin and other materials were from Sigma.Construction of Mutants and Expression Vectors—Isolation and cloning of hSef-a into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+)B vector (Invitrogen) was described elsewhere (14Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A. Sher I. Tsang M. Dawid I.B. Altuvia Y. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For the Tet-off hSef expression system, hSef-a coding region was subcloned into the pTet-splice vector (Invitrogen). Human FGFR1 (21Eisemann A. Ahn J.A. Graziani G. Tronick S.R. Ron D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1195-1202PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. Mutated (kinase dead) FGFR1 (Y653F/Y654F) was kindly provided by J. Schlessinger (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) (22Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by M. Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA). Plasmids encoding hSef-a and hSef-b mutated in the conserved tyrosine (Y330F and Y298F, respectively) were prepared each by a two-step PCR process. In the first step, two fragments were generated utilizing two separate PCR reactions with pcDNA3.1/Hygro-hSef-a as the template and primer sets p1/p2 and p3/p4, respectively (p1, 5′-AGAAAATATATTTTCACATTTAGATG-3′ and p2 reverse primer: 5′-ATTTCTCCAAGACTGGCTCC-3′, p3: 5′-TCACTACAAGCTCAAGCACGA-3′ and reverse primer p4: 5′-CATCTAAATGTGAAAATATATTTTCT-3′). The corresponding base change that replaces Tyr with Phe is underlined. The products of these two PCR reactions were used as the template for the second step PCR using primers p2 and p3. Following sequencing, the fragment with the mutation was liberated by PpuM1 and BstB1 digestion and used to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment in pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector containing the cDNA of parental hSef-a or hSef-b digested with the same enzymes.Generation of hSef-silencing Constructs—Three test small interference RNA sequences were identified according to the Whitehead siRNA Selection Web Server (24Yuan B. Latek R. Hossbach M. Tuschl T. Lewitter F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W130-W134Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and Oligoengine shockwave program as follows. shRNA 1: 5′-gatccccGTCGGAGGGAAGACAGTGCttcaagagaGCACTGTCTTCCCTCCGACttttta-3′, and complementary strand, 5′-agcttaaaaaGTCGGAGGGAAGACAGTGCtctcttgaaGCACTGTCTTCCCTCCGACggg-3′; shRNA 2: 5′-gatccccGCATGTGATTGCTGACGCCttcaagagaGGCGTCAGCAATCACATGCttttta-3′, and complementary strand, 5′-agcttaaaaaGCATGTGATTGCTGACGCCtctcttgaaGGCGTCAGCAATCACATGCggg-3′; and shRNA 3: 5′-gatccccAGCAGGAGCAAACTACAGAttcaagagaTCTGTAGTTTGCTCCTGCTttttta-3′; and complementary strand, 5′-agcttaaaaaAGCAGGAGCAAACTACAGAtctcttgaaTCTGTAGTTTGCTCCTGCTggg-3′. The control shRNA is the reverse orientation of shRNA 1. The 3′- and 5′-ends of the oligonucleotide primers were adapted for cloning into the BglII and HindIII site of the pSUPER vector (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of oligonucleotide pairs were annealed and ligated into pSUPER digested with BglII and HindIII. Positive clones were sequenced to ensure accuracy of RNA interference. The efficiency of RNA interference was initially tested by co-transfecting an hSef expression vector with each shRNA construct into HEK 293 cells using previously described transfection protocol (14Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A. Sher I. Tsang M. Dawid I.B. Altuvia Y. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each Sef shRNA, but not the control shRNA or empty pSUPER vector, reduced hSef protein levels when compared with cells transfected with hSef construct alone (data not shown).Cell Culture and Transfection Methods—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. Transient transfections in HEK 293 cells were performed with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). The total amounts of DNA in each transfection were normalized with the pcDNA3 plasmid. For co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), cells in 6-cm dishes were transfected with 3 μg of receptor and hSef-a plasmids. For hSef-b, we used 10-cm dishes and higher plasmid concentrations (12 μg of hSef-b and 4 μg of receptor) to compensate for hSef-b low translation efficiency (14Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A. Sher I.

Stable transfections in NIH 3T3 were carried out with the calcium phosphate method as previously described (26Ron D. Tronick S.R. Aaronson S.A. Eva A.

Colonies of resistant cells were isolated 3 weeks post transfection. The generation of hSef-b Tet off NIH 3T3 cells was previously described (14Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A. Sher I. Tsang M. Dawid I.B.

The experiments described here were carried out with two to three individual clones and were repeated at least three times. To generate HeLa cells stably expressing hSef shRNA, subconfluent cultures were transfected with a combination of the three hSef shRNA constructs (1.5 μg of each/plate) or the control shRNA construct (4.5 μg/plate), together with pCDNA 3.1 for selection. Transfection was performed with DreamFect reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (OZ Biosciences). Following selection with 0.5 mg/ml G418, mass cultures were tested for the reduction of endogenous hSef RNA. The most efficient reduction was observed with cells transfected with the combination of constructs. These cells were subsequently used for future studies.RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR—For detection of hSef transcripts in HeLa cells, total RNA was extracted as described previously (21Eisemann A. Ahn J.A. Graziani G. Tronick S.R. Ron D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1195-1202PubMed Google Scholar), and 1 μg of total RNA was used for first-strand synthesis with random hexamer primers. Where indicated, amplification was performed with a reverse primer common to both hSef isoforms (5′-TGAAGCTACTGTTGAGCTGCTTCG-3′) and isoform-specific forward primers (hSef-a, 5′-GAGGATCCTGACGGCCATGGCCCCGTGGCTGCAGCTC-3′ or hSef-b, 5′-GCGTGCCAGACAGAGTGCTAGGCAT-3′) or with primers common to both hSef isoforms as previously described (14Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A. Sher I. Tsang M. Dawid I.B. Altuvia Y. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplification was used for monitoring RNA quantity and amplification efficiency.Mitogenic, Proliferation, and Apoptosis Assays—[3H]Thymidine incorporation assay was performed in 96-well microtiter plates essentially as described (20Reich-Slotky R. Shaoul E. Berman B. Graziani G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29813-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures were growth arrested in 0.3% serum for 24 h, and, where indicated, tetracycline was removed 24 h before stimulation with serum (10%) or growth factors. For apoptosis, NIH 3T3/hSef-a or hSef-b cells were grown for 48 h in the presence or absence of tetracycline, with 10% newborn calf serum or with FGF2 (0.25 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. Apoptosis was examined with a Leica DM IRE2 inverted fluorescence microscope, using the In Situ Cell Death detection kit (TUNEL staining, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nuclear staining was done with 5 μg/ml Hoechst (Calbiochem). Proliferation assay was performed as previously described (28Shaoul E. Reich-Slotky R. Berman B. Ron D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1553-1561PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells stably expressing hSef shRNA or control shRNA were seeded into 35-mm plates (2.5 × 104 cells/plate) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The following day, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone or in the presence of desired concentrations of growth factors. Fresh growth factors were added every other day, and viable cells were counted on day 5 of incubation. Each data point was performed in duplicates or triplicates, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.Protein Detection, Co-immunoprecipitations, and Immunofluorescence—Polyclonal antibodies against hSef were generated as described (14Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A. Sher I. Tsang M. Dawid I.B. Altuvia Y. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CO-IP, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were done essentially as described (28Shaoul E. Reich-Slotky R. Berman B. Ron D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1553-1561PubMed Google Scholar, 29Graziani G. Ron D. Eva A. Srivastava S.K. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 823-829PubMed Google Scholar). For CO-IP of hSef-FGFR complexes, cells were lysed 24 h post transfection in HTNG buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1%Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitors. For immunoprecipitation of hSef, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitors. Extracts clarified by centrifugation were incubated with antibodies. Immunocomplexes were captured on Protein G Dynabeads (Dynal) and washed with the corresponding buffer used for preparation of cell lysates. Following SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence. For immunofluorescence, NIH 3T3 stably expressing hSef isoforms were plated on coverslips. The following day, cells were serum-starved (0.2% newborn calf serum) in the presence or the absence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 17 h. Cells were then stimulated for 7 min with FGF2 (10 ng/ml) and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized with ice-cold methanol, blocked with 5% horse serum, and labeled with anti-pErk mouse monoclonal antibodies (Cell signaling) followed by Rhodamine-Red™-x-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Fluorescence microscope analysis was performed with a Leica DM IRE2 inverted fluorescence microscope. Commercial antibodies used were: anti-Myc epitope mouse monoclonal antibodies (9E10), p38, MEK-1, Akt1/2, HA-probe, CDK4, Actin, and FGFR1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (E10), cyclin D1 mouse monoclonal antibodies, phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser-217/221) rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), p-Tyr clone 4G10 mouse monoclonal antibodies (UBI), phospho-Akt (Ser-473) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, diphosphorylated-p38 mouse monoclonal antibodies, goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG Peroxidase Conjugate (Sigma), Rhodamine-Red™-x-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were a gift from Y. Granot (Ben Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel).RESULTSHuman Sef Isoforms Are Phosphorylated on Tyrosine Residues When Expressed with Activated FGFR—To examine the prediction that Sef can be phosphorylated on tyrosine and to study the requirements for such phosphorylation, we employed transient transfection assays in HEK 293 cells. Cells were transfected with Myc-tagged hSef-a or hSef-b constructs, with or without wild-type or kinase-dead FGFR1. Following CO-IP, blots were reacted with anti-pTyr antibodies, FGFR or Sef-specific antibodies. When expressed alone, neither hSef isoform was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Fig. 1A). When co-expressed with FGFR1, both hSef variants formed a complex with the receptor, in agreement with previous studies (14Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A. Sher I. Tsang M. Dawid I.B. Altuvia Y. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two phosphorylated bands were detected following the CO-IP in cells expressing hSef isoforms and FGFR1. The higher molecular mass band (∼130 kDa), common to both samples, was recognized by anti-FGFR1 antibodies. The other phosphorylated band was recognized by hSef or anti-Myc antibodies and had the expected molecular mass of each isoform, ∼115 and 85 kDa for hSef-a and hSef-b, respectively (Fig. 1A). To assess whether the invariant tyrosine is the major site of phosphorylation in hSef-a and to further explore its role in mediating hSef function, we substituted the invariant tyrosine with phenylalanine (Y330F). The mutant was still phosphorylated on tyrosine when co-expressed with wild-type receptor. The mutation, however, did not interfere with hSef/FGFR1 association (Fig. 1B). As hSef-a and FGFR1 proteins migrated very closely, we also performed IP with anti-Myc tag antibodies under conditions that prevented the co-precipitation of the receptor to further confirm hSef tyrosine phosphorylation. Under these experimental conditions, a single phosphorylated band with the expected molecular weight of hSef-a or the hSef-a mutant was detected with the anti pTyr antibody and subsequently with the anti-Sef (data not shown) or anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 1C).To determine whether active FGFR is essential for hSef phosphorylation we co-expressed hSef-a with a kinase-dead FGFR1 mutant. CO-IP was performed with anti-Myc epitope tag antibodies. hSef-a was associated with the kinase-dead FGFR, but it was not phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 1D). Taken together, the results reve"

Yeast Dna2 protein (yDna2) 3The abbreviations used are: yDna2, yeast Dna2 protein; MOI, multiplicity of infection; nt, nucleotide; HA, hemagglutinin. is a helicase/nuclease involved in the maintenance of genome stability (1Budd M.E. Tong A.H. Polaczek P. Peng X. Boone C. Campbell J.L. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: 634-650Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A human ortholog of yDna2, hDna2, has recently been characterized and was found to have biochemical features remarkably similar to its yeast counterpart (2Masuda-Sasa T. Imamura O. Campbell J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Kim J.H. Kim H.D. Ryu G.H. Kim D.H. Hurwitz J. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1854-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When DNA2 is deleted from otherwise wild-type yeast cells, cells are inviable, suggesting that DNA2 is essential. However, the inviability of a dna2Δ strain can be suppressed by deletion of PIF1, encoding another helicase, and therefore, under this condition, DNA2 is not essential (4Budd M.E. Reis C.C. Smith S. Myung K. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2490-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The helicase activity modulates the preference of Dna2 for substrates with specific structures (5Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recessive mutations in the helicase domain are lethal, suggesting that the helicase is essential under most conditions (6Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In some circumstances, however, full helicase activity is not essential for viability (7Formosa T. Nitiss T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations eliminating nuclease activity are lethal but are deleterious even in the presence of wild-type Dna2 (8Lee K.H. Kim D.W. Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Ryu G.H. Kwon Y.N. Kim K.A. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The precise biological role of Dna2 is not clear. The recently described comprehensive genomic integrity network in yeast, derived from a screen for genes synthetically lethal with dna2, points to not just one, but to a variety of cellular processes in which Dna2 may function, including DNA replication, DNA repair, and chromatin dynamics (1Budd M.E. Tong A.H. Polaczek P. Peng X. Boone C. Campbell J.L. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: 634-650Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The proposed role of Dna2 in Okazaki fragment processing has been studied most extensively (10Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As a result of biochemical reconstitution studies one may conclude that Dna2 has an important role in the nucleolytic removal of RNA/DNA primers during the maturation of intermediates in lagging strand DNA synthesis (11Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 12Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this scenario, DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) is proposed to displace a 5′ RNA/DNA flap at the terminus of the previously synthesized Okazaki fragment (11Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The principal nuclease involved in the removal of the flap in preparation for joining of the fragments is FEN1 (11Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the product of the RAD27 gene. Normally, pol δ and FEN1 activity are strictly coordinated to ensure efficient flap removal (12Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, FEN1 is very inefficient in cleaving long flap structures bound tightly to RPA (11Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Such flaps may arise during replication due to excessive strand displacement, which can result either from failure to properly coordinate FEN1 and pol δ, or to other disruptions of the polymerase cycle. Dna2, on the other hand, is well suited to perform the task of long flap cleavage. The helicase activity allows the processing of flaps containing duplex foldbacks that might arise when copying sequences containing repeats (5Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The nuclease activity requires long flaps and is stimulated by RPA (5Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Therefore, the essential function of DNA2 may be the processing of long flap structures and/or structured flaps, providing an optimum substrate for FEN1, and thus preventing replication fork arrest (5Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50840-50849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). While consistent with biochemical reconstitution experiments, this model is also supported by genetic evidence. First, dna2 is synthetically lethal with rad27 (10Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Overproduction of FEN1 leads to suppression of dna2-1 lethality. This may suggest that increase in gene dosage of RAD27 compensates for DNA2 deficiency, likely caused by either increased processing of the long flaps or to decreased strand displacement by pol δ (10Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Second, rad27 pol3-01, and dna2-1 pol3-01 double mutants are both inviable (1Budd M.E. Tong A.H. Polaczek P. Peng X. Boone C. Campbell J.L. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: 634-650Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15Jin Y.H. Ayyagari R. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1626-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This may suggest that the absence of pol δ 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity leads to excessive strand displacement and creation of long flap substrates that would require the cooperative action of FEN1 and Dna2 for processing (14Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Moreover, lethal interactions are observed, not just between DNA2 and RAD27, but between DNA2 and most of the key proteins participating in this process (1Budd M.E. Tong A.H. Polaczek P. Peng X. Boone C. Campbell J.L. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: 634-650Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Deletion of SGS1, which encodes a 3′-5′ helicase of the RecQ family (17Lu J. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Kleff S. Romero A.M. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1996; 383: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), also involved in maintaining genome stability, is synthetically lethal with dna2-2 mutations (1Budd M.E. Tong A.H. Polaczek P. Peng X. Boone C. Campbell J.L. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: 634-650Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 18Weitao T. Budd M. Campbell J.L. Mutation Res. 2003; 532: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interpretation of the dna2-2 sgs1Δ synthetic lethality is more complex than that of dna2 rad27Δ. Sgs1 is not known to be involved in Okazaki fragment processing; instead, it is thought to participate in repair of stalled replication forks (19Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). However, rad27Δ sgs1Δ double mutants are also inviable (20Loeillet S. Palancade B. Cartron M. Thierry A. Fichard G.F. Dujon B. Doye V. Nicolas A. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, Sgs1 may provide functions in DNA metabolism in the absence of Dna2 other than those documented to date. To identify these functions, we searched for suppressors of dna2-1 defects among the RecQ homologs. Overproduction of yeast SGS1 was toxic, even in wild-type strains. However, the human BLM gene, an ortholog of SGS1, rescues the dna2-1 defect (21Imamura O. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8193-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We were unsuccessful in showing suppression by the mouse WRN (21Imamura O. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8193-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), another RecQ family member, but human WRN does suppress dna2-1 (22Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Brosh Jr., R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). This raised the question as to what activity of human BLM or WRN is responsible for the suppression. Both hBLM and hWRN proteins were shown to stimulate FEN1 cleavage (22Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Brosh Jr., R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wang W. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5391-5399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possible explanation for the suppression of dna2-1 is that the increased efficiency of FEN1 cleavage may compensate for the Dna2 defect, correlating well with the in vivo results. Studies in our laboratory have shown that the helicase activity of BLM may be important for the suppression of dna2-1. This is puzzling because Dna2 and hBLM helicases differ in their polarity: 5′-3′ and 3′-5′, respectively. It is hard to envision how two proteins with opposing polarities may achieve the same outcome. Recently, two new activities were reported to be associated with WRN and BLM proteins, namely, strand-annealing and strand exchange activities on short, DNA oligonucleotide duplexes (25Cheok C.F. Bachrati C.Z. Chan K.L. Ralf C. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Machwe A. Lozada E.M. Xiao L. Orren D.K. BMC Mol. Biol. 2006; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The possibility that these activities might be involved in the rescue of dna2-1 mutants by BLM and WRN led us to examine if Dna2 has similar activities. Indeed, we show herein, that both yeast and human Dna2 proteins are proficient in single strand annealing and ATP-independent strand exchange reactions. Based on the shared annealing/exchange properties of Dna2, BLM, and WRN, we propose a model that suggests how the newly discovered activities may contribute to the efficient processing of flap structures in lagging strand replication intermediates. This model may reconcile the apparent paradox that two helicases of opposing polarities may perform redundant tasks leading to indistinguishable products. Recombinant Protein Preparation—Human Dna2 and hDna2D294A, nuclease defective, were tagged with FLAG at the C terminus and His6 at the N terminus, and the tagged proteins were expressed and purified using the pFASTBacHT Bac to Bac system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as described previously (2Masuda-Sasa T. Imamura O. Campbell J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recombinant yDna2 K1080E tagged at the N terminus with one HA tag and at the C terminus with a His6 tag was expressed in yeast and purified as described previously for the wild-type Dna2 expressed in baculovirus, namely using Ni2+ affinity and MonoQ chromatography (9Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Wild-type yDna2 was prepared as described previously (9Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recombinant yDna2 E675A protein with His6 tag at the C terminus was cloned in pFASTBacHT leaving only the C-terminal tag. This protein was purified as follows. 1 liter of Sf9 cells in TNM-FH medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in spinner flasks at 27 °C were infected with recombinant virus at an MOI of 5 and harvested after 50 h. The cell pellet was lysed in 50 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 10% glycerol, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)) for 1 h at 4°C. The lysate was cleared and then bound to Ni-NTA beads for 1 h at 4 °Cand separated by centrifugation. After washing three times with 30 ml of buffer B (buffer A + 10 mm imidazole) the beads were placed in a column and washed with 10 ml of buffer B. The yDna2 was eluted with 5 ml of buffer C (buffer A + 300 mm imidazole) and dialyzed overnight against buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and loaded onto a MonoQ column equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient from 0 to 100% buffer E (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) over 10 ml. The yDna2 was eluted at ∼270 mm NaCl. The yDna2-containing fractions were pooled in two pools and dialyzed against buffer F (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol) for 5 h (2 × 2.5 h), aliquoted, and frozen down. If necessary, enzymes were further diluted to appropriate concentrations prior to use in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. DNA Substrates—All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA technologies (Coralville, IA). Oligonucleotides used for strand annealing, strand exchange, and helicase assays were: D4 (5′-AGGTCTCGACTAACTCTAGTCGTTGTTCCACCCGTCCACCCGACGCCACCTCCTG-3′), T2 (5′-GCAGGAGGTGGCGTCGGGTGGACGGGATTGAAATTTAGGCTGGCACGGTCG-3′) and T4 (5′-GCAGGAGGTGGCGTCGGGTGGACGGGTGGAACAACGACTAGAGTTAGTCGAGACCTATTGAAATTTAGGCTGGCACGGTCG-3′). 5′-Labeling of D4 was performed as described previously (5Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For strand exchange assays, D4 and T2 were annealed at a molar ratio of 1:1 to make fork substrate. D4 and T4 were annealed in the same way to generate the marker that indicates the position of D4:T4 reaction products. Strand Annealing Assay—Strand annealing activity of recombinant Dna2 was measured using a standard reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, the 5′-labeled D4 oligonucleotide (20 fmol), unlabeled T4 oligonucleotide (20 fmol), and various concentrations of MgCl2 and ATP as indicated in figure legends. After incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped with 6× stop solution (30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, and 60 nm unlabeled D4 oligonucleotide). The reaction products ware separated with native PAGE (8-12%, 1× TBE) for 3 h at 4°C, and analyzed using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager. Strand annealing activity of yDna2 with 1.3-kb linear double-stranded DNA was measured using the same buffer conditions as above. The fragment used in these assays was obtained by PCR amplification using pBluescript ll SK (+)-hDna2 (21Imamura O. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8193-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as a template. 5′-ATGCTGCCCAAAATAGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCATCAACCAAGGATTATCAG-3′ primers were used in standard PCR reactions. 5′ labeling of the fragment was performed using T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) (5Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Substrate dissolved in water was denatured by boiling (4 min) and quick cooled on ice. 4 fmol of substrate was incubated with recombinant yDna2 (0-600 fmol, as indicated in the figure legends). After 5 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 6× stop solution (30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol), and products were analyzed by 1% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis using 1× TAE buffer. Gels were dried and bands quantified as described above. Strand Exchange Assays and DNA Helicase Assay—Strand exchange activity of recombinant Dna2 was measured using the same buffer conditions as strand annealing. For DNA substrate, radiolabeled D4:T2 fork substrate (5 fmol), and unlabeled T4 trap oligonucleotide (0-25 fmol, as indicated in figure legends) were used. Reactions were stopped by 6× stop solution, and reaction products were separated using 12% native PAGE. To see the DNA helicase activity of yDna2, T4 trap strand was omitted from the reaction (Fig. 2C). For strand exchange assays on long DNA substrates, linear øX174 double-stranded DNA was treated with exonuclease III (Exolll) (28Reuven N.B. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Weller S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). øX174 RF1 DNA (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was cut with XhoI and then resected with Exolll (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Resection with Exolll was carried out at 37 °C at a ratio of 100 units Exolll per 3 μg of XhoI-cut linear double-stranded DNA. The extent of 3′-strand degradation was monitored on 1% agarose gels, in the presence of ethidium bromide, after 2, 6, 10, and 14-min incubation. After 2 min, the molecules were shortened by ∼500-600 bases, and DNA from this time point was used as the duplex substrate in strand exchange assays. After resection, reaction products were deproteinized by phenol-chloroform treatment and ethanol-precipitated. 5′ Labeling of the fragment was performed using T4 PNK. Strand exchange assays were performed using Exolll-treated linear øX174 double-stranded DNA and øX174 single-stranded circular DNA (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) as described by others (Ref. 29Reuven N.B. Antoku S. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4599-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar for example), with some modifications. Double-stranded DNA (0.1 fmol) was incubated with 0.5 fmol of single-stranded DNA in the strand exchange reaction buffer described above, with or without Mg2+ and ATP as indicated in figure legends. After 20 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 6× stop solution (30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.5μg/μl proteinase K). After 1 h at 55 °C, products were separated by 1% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis using 1× TAE buffer. Gels were dried and analyzed as above. To determine the mobility of expected intermediates, DNA strand exchange and annealing reactions were carried out in the absence of protein by incubating boiled or native Exolll-treated linear øX174 double-stranded DNA (0.1 fmol) with increasing amounts of øX174 single-stranded DNA (0-100 fmol). After overnight incubation at 65 °C, reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA Binding Assay—The DNA binding activity of recombinant Dna2 was measured using a gel shift assay. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 55 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 fmol of radiolabeled DNA substrates, and various concentrations of MgCl2 and ATP as indicated in figure legends. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, reaction mixtures were separated with native PAGE (12%, 1× TBE) for 3 h at 4 °C,and analyzed using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager. Single Strand Annealing Properties of Yeast and Human DNA2—Strand annealing reactions were performed using two complementary oligonucleotides, designated D4 and T4 (see “Experimental Procedures”), as shown in Fig. 1A. Except where otherwise noted, the nuclease-defective forms of yDna2 and hDna2 were used to minimize destruction of the substrates used. As shown in Fig. 1B, both yDna2 and hDna2 strongly stimulate the annealing of the two oligonucleotides. Notably, in the case of the yeast enzyme, the strand annealing is saturated at equimolar levels of the protein and DNA (see lanes 5 and 6). The yeast protein is efficient in strand annealing both in the absence and in the presence of 4 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 1B, lanes 2-11). Promotion of annealing by the human protein, in contrast, is dependent on the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1A, lanes 12-21). Thus, both proteins are efficient in strand annealing, though with different response to divalent cation. In the case of yDna2, in the absence of Mg2+, there seems to be a threshold concentration (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5) at which strand annealing occurs, rather than a gradual increase with increasing enzyme concentration, as is seen with the hDna2. We also examined the effect of NaCl on strand annealing by yDna2. As shown in Fig. 1C, NaCl concentration above 100 mm was inhibitory. Next, we examined the effect of ATP on the strand annealing activity of yDna2. As shown in Fig. 1D, ATP is inhibitory to strand annealing at all concentrations tested, and inhibition is proportional to ATP concentration. hDNA2-promoted strand annealing is also inhibited in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1E). ADP does not inhibit the strand annealing activity of yDna2 (data not shown). We also examined the effect of a point mutation in the yDna2 helicase domain (K1080E, Walker A box) on strand annealing. This mutant protein has no ATPase or helicase activity but retains normal levels of nuclease activity (9Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Notably, the yeast helicase mutant is efficient in promoting strand annealing, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is not important for this activity of yDna2 (and also verifying that strand annealing can occur in the presence of an intact nuclease domain) (Fig. 1D, lanes 17-26). Dispensability of ATPase is not surprising, since, as shown above, strand annealing by yDna2 does not require Mg2+, which would be expected to be an essential cofactor in ATP binding and hydrolysis (Fig. 1B). Unexpectedly, however, ATP (1 mm) inhibits strand annealing even in the K1080E mutant. Thus, the Walker A motif, K1080E mutant protein, though defective in ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 1 and Ref. 9Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), can apparently interact with ATP. In summary, strand annealing is Mg2+-independent for yDna2 but Mg2+-dependent for hDna2. The yeast protein is inhibited by NaCl, and both yeast and human proteins, even in the Walker A box mutant, are inhibited by ATP. Strand annealing does not require either nuclease or helicase activities of Dna2. Strand Exchange Promoted by Yeast and Human DNA2—In the following experiments, we tested if yDna2 and hDna2 are proficient in strand exchange. Oligonucleotides D4 and T2 (see list of oligonucleotides under “Experimental Procedures”) were annealed at a 1:1 ratio. The oligonucleotides form a fork molecule with 5′ and 3′ single-stranded tails adjacent to the duplex region (Fig. 2A). The 5′-tail is the preferred substrate for yDna2 (8Lee K.H. Kim D.W. Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Ryu G.H. Kwon Y.N. Kim K.A. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in the presence or absence of a third oligonucleotide (T4), with sequences complementary to D4. If strand exchange occurs, it will result in the D4:T4 product. As shown in Fig. 2B, yDna2 protein catalyzes strand exchange, and, as with the strand annealing activity, the strand exchange occurs both in the presence and the absence of Mg2+ ion. We do observe a slight reduction in strand exchange product in the presence of Mg2+, but we attribute the reduction in exchanged product (lanes 12-14 compared with lanes 6-8) to the residual nuclease activity of the protein in the presence of Mg2+. We suggest that the Dna2 nuclease acts on the long 5′-tail of the fork, thus reducing the amount of substrate. Furthermore, we suggest that the product of strand exchange is stable and readily detected because the 3′-tailed oligonucleotide is more resistant to the Dna2 nucleolytic cleavage. Additionally, we examined the effect of adding Mg2+/ATP into the reactions. Nuclease activity is known to be inhibited under these conditions (30Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 31Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K. Park J. Lee S. Seo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2B, lanes 18-20, these conditions promote Dna2 helicase and unwinding of the forked substrate. Clearly, there is an increase in the unwound product between 5 and 15 min (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 18 and 19) followed by a decrease in the unwound product (lane 20). Also, the helicase assay in the absence of T4 clearly shows a gradual increase of the unwound product during the course of the experiment (Fig. 2C). In contrast to unwound product, there is no detectable strand exchange product at the 5 min time point in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2B, lane 18). We propose that strand exchange is inhibited under conditions favoring the helicase activity, that is, in the presence of 4 mm ATP and 4 mm Mg2+ and that the band at the position of apparent strand exchange (lane 20) is due to a two step process consisting of an unwinding event followed by spontaneous, protein-independent strand annealing of the unwound D4 and the T4. Consistent with this interpretation, we find that ATP inhibits the strand exchange reaction (Fig. 2D). As also shown above (Fig. 2B), strand exchange is efficient in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2D, lanes 6-8 and 12-14). ATP, however, even in the absence of Mg2+, and thus in the absence of helicase activity, is inhibitory to strand exchange (Fig. 2D, lanes 19-21 and 25-27). EDTA was added to the reactions to chelate any contaminating metals. hDna2 is remarkably similar to yDna2 in the strand exchange reactions. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, like yDna2, hDNA2 promotes strand exchange in the absence, as well as in the presence of Mg2+. Because the strand exchange activity observed is weaker than that in the yeast protein, however, we tried to optimize the conditions for strand exchange by increasing the concentration of the T4 acceptor oligonucleotide. As seen in Fig. 3B, 5-fold molar excess of T4 oligonucleotide clearly enhances the strand exchange reaction. We have reproduced these results in a time course experiment under optimal T4 concentrations (Fig. 3C). Both in the presence and the absence of Mg2+, nearly all of the substrate was converted to the strand exchange product within 60 min (Fig. 3C, lanes 9 and 15). Again, as with yDna2, in the presence of Mg2+, residual nuclease activity reduces the amount of strand exchange product, probably reflecting degradation of the labeled substrate (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 7-9 and 13-15). Addition of Mg2+/ATP to the reaction at concentrations promoting helicase activity of hDNA2 appears to inhibit strand exchange, significantly reducing the D4:T4 product observed (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 7-9 with lanes 19-21). Because of the weak unwinding activity"

Here we show that living rods extracted from a salamander can also accumulate an exogenous chlorophyll derivative, chlorin e6, that renders them as sensitive to red light as they are to green. This vision enhancement by an unbleachable chlorophyll derivative might therefore be a general phenomenon in vertebrate photoreception."

Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of human diseases that range from lethal visceral infection to severely disfiguring mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Leishmania are transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, where they reside extracellularly within the digestive tract. Following infection of mammalian hosts, parasites multiply intracellularly, primarily within macrophage phagolysosomes. No approved vaccines are available against these pathogens and current chemotherapy relies on pentavalent antimony, which cannot be given orally, has significant toxicity, and is facing increasing resistance in the field (1Croft S.L. Coombs G.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 2Ouellette M. Drummelsmith J. Papadopoulou B. Drug Resist. Update. 2004; 7: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). New drugs and new drug targets are therefore urgently needed. Leishmania that infect mammals are methionine auxotrophs (3Steiger R.F. Meshnick S.R. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.

Methionine occupies a central place in metabolism because it is required for protein and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 2The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; THF, tetrahydrofolate; 5-CH3-THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; 5-CHO-THF, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate; WT, wild type; 5,10-CH2-THF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH=THF, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolatereductase; DHFR, dihydrofolatereductase; PTR1, pteridine reductase 1; Ches, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. biosynthesis. AdoMet is particularly important in anabolism as it is the methyl donor in a wide variety of biosynthetic reactions, and decarboxylated AdoMet is used in polyamine biosynthesis. In Trypanosoma brucei, enzymes that consume and recycle AdoMet are well characterized chemotherapeutic targets (5Fairlamb A.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 488-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Bacchi C.J. Sufrin J.R. Nathan H.C. Spiess A.J. Hannan T. Garofalo J. Alecia K. Katz L. Yarlett N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), however, these pathways are less well studied in Leishmania. Homocysteine arising from AdoMet-dependent methylations is released by hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine, the product of methylation reactions. Homocysteine is then remethylated by methionine synthases using 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF) as the methyl donor. The sole route of 5-CH3-THF biosynthesis in eukaryotes is reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF) by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, EC 1.5.1.20) (8Lu S.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 9Matthews R.G. Sheppard C. Goulding C. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S54-S59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus here we focused on MTHFR as a key step leading to subsequent methionine metabolism. MTHFR is either a NADH or NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme in eukaryotes and most prokaryotes (10Sheppard C.A.

In mammals and yeast, NADPH-dependent reduction of 5,10-CH2-THF by MTHFR is physiologically irreversible and is inhibited by AdoMet (9Matthews R.G. Sheppard C. Goulding C. Eur. J.

Two major domains have been identified in the mammalian MTHFR: an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal allosteric regulatory domain that binds AdoMet (Fig. 1B) (9Matthews R.G. Sheppard C. Goulding C. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S54-S59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition by AdoMet may prevent an NADPH-dependent and thus physiologically irreversible MTHFR from depleting 5,10-CH2-THF through the “methyl-trap” effect (9Matthews R.G. Sheppard C. Goulding C.

Under physiological conditions NADPH is strongly preferred by the mammalian enzymes (20Matthews R.G. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6014-6017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although at high phosphate concentrations porcine MTHFR is able to use NADH or NADPH with equal effectiveness. Dual cofactor specificity is unusual as almost all pyridine nucleotide-dependent oxidoreductases are highly specific for one cofactor, with mammalian glutamate dehydrogenase being a well characterized exception (21Olson J.A.

In contrast, reduction of 5,10-CH2-THF by NADH-dependent MTHFR enzymes appears to be physiologically reversible and these proteins either contain a C-terminal domain that does not mediate allosteric regulation, as in plants (12Roje S.

A reversible MTHFR activity may also participate in salvage of host 5-CH3-THF in Plasmodium falciparum (25Asawamahasakda W. Yuthavong Y. Parasitology. 1993; 107: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The metabolism of reduced folate cofactors is of particular interest in drug discovery, because dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is commonly targeted by antimalarials and antibacterials. However, current therapeutic antifolates are ineffective against Leishmania because DHFR inhibition is by-passed by pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1), which is relatively insensitive to classical antifolates (26Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24165-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, a group of compounds derived from diaminopyrimidine, quinazoline, or pteridine scaffolds have been described that inhibit both DHFR and PTR1 and show nanomolar EC50 values in culture. However, these inhibitors appear to additionally possess independent mode(s) of action rendering their toxicity insensitive to deletion or overexpression of PTR1 and/or DHFR-TS (29Hardy L.W. Matthews W. Nare B. Beverley S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 157-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ma D. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Increased methionine adenosyltransferase activity and AdoMet facilitate acquisition of methotrexate resistance in Leishmania major (32Drummelsmith J. Girard I. Trudel N. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33273-33280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and MTHFR has been hypothesized to be involved in this process. This suggests that 5-CH3-THF metabolizing enzymes such as MTHFR or methionine synthase may be additional targets of antifolates. Here we show that L. major MTHFR (LmjMTHFR) is unique among characterized MTHFRs because it is AdoMet-insensitive and does not discriminate between NADH and NADPH. However, deletion of MTHFR and elimination of CH3-THF biosynthesis in L. major had no effect on viability (under conditions where methionine was not limiting), on sensitivity to antifolates, on the ability to salvage 5-CH3-THF, or on virulence.

RPMI medium was also prepared lacking methionine (RPMI-Met) or lacking folic acid and biopterin (RPMI-FA-Biop). Growth inhibition was determined by seeding parasites at 5 × 105 cells ml–1 at various concentrations of drug and counting cells using a model Z1 Coulter counter when control cultures reached late-log phase. The virulence of wild-type (WT) and mthfr– cell lines were determined by infection of metacyclic parasites (purified by negative selection with peanut agglutinin as described (33Sacks D.L. Hieny S.

Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). PCR used the primers 5′-ATCATGTCCAAGCTTATCAG and 5′-TCACTCCACTAGCGCGTTGA. The amplified gene was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), to create pGEM-T.MTHFR (B4775) and then subcloned into the SmaI site of pXGneo (36Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) to create pXG-LmjMTHFR (B5128). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of L. major MTHFR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—The MTHFR coding sequence was amplified from the pGEM-T.MTHFR template using primers 5′-TGCAGGATCCATGTCCAAGCTTATCAGT (forward) and 5′-TGCACTGCAGTCACTCCACTAGCGCGTT (reverse). This amplicon was digested with BamHI and PstI and cloned into the corresponding sites in pVT103-U (37Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains URA3 for selection and an ADH1 promoter driving transgene expression. The construct and the empty pVT103-U vector were introduced into yeast strain RRY3, a met12 met13 double deletant (38Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Control strains (RRY3 containing a cDNA encoding human MTHFR, and WT strain DAY4) were as previously described (12Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol.

Yeast Growth and Preparation of Extracts—Cultures of strain RRY3 expressing LmjMTHFR, human MTHFR, or the corresponding empty vector control were grown as described (12Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D.

Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Radiometric MTHFR Assay—MTHFR activity was measured in the reductive direction by a NAD(P)H-5,10-CH2-THF oxidoreductase radioassay (12Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R.

The total protein content in each reaction mixture was 3 μg. Product formation was proportional to enzyme concentration and time. Expression and Purification of Recombinant LmjMTHFR—An expression construct of LmjMTHFR was kindly provided by the Structural Genomics of Parasitic Protozoa consortium (clone Lmaj006157AAA, B5503). This used the expression vector pAVA0421 (40Alexandrov A. Vignali M. LaCount D.J. Quartley E. de Vries C. De Rosa D. Babulski J. Mitchell S.F. Schoenfeld L.W. Fields S. Hol W.G. Dumont M.E.

Protein was expressed from this vector and purified by metal affinity chromatography, as described under supplemental methods. Spectrophotometric MTHFR Assays—Spectrophotometric assays were carried out using a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer with 1-ml assays maintained at 37 °C. The NAD(P)H-menadione oxidoreductase activity of MTHFR was measured essentially as described (41Matthews R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Assays contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 300 μm EDTA, 10 μm flavin adenine dinucleotide, or the same solution buffered by 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2. MTHFR was preincubated in the cuvette with NAD(P)H for 5 min before initiating reactions by adding menadione to a final concentration of 130 μm. Activity was monitored by following NAD(P)H oxidation at 343 nm (the isosbestic point of menadione), using the extinction coefficient of 6220 m–1 cm–1 (11Daubner S.C. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 140-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of menadione stocks was determined as described (14Vanoni M.A. Ballou D.P. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11510-11514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NADH-5,10-CH2-THF oxidoreductase activity of MTHFR was determined essentially as described (41Matthews R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in deoxygenated phosphate assay buffer containing 10 mm formaldehyde. (6R,6S)-5,10-CH2-THF was produced by anaerobic addition of varying concentrations of THF 10 min before initiation of the reaction by enzyme addition. Formaldehyde stocks were made daily from paraformaldehyde and THF stocks were made directly before use by dissolving THF to 5 mm in 250 mm triethanolamine-Cl, pH 7, containing 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. THF solutions were kept on ice under anaerobic conditions in the dark. Activity was monitored by following NADH oxidation at 340 nm, using the extinction coefficient of 6230 m–1 cm–1. Calculations were based on the assumptions that L. major MTHFR resembles other MTHFRs in using only (6R)-5,10-CH2-THF and that this isomer comprised 50% of the racemic mixture. Folate Analysis—Folates were extracted and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection as described (42Goyer A. Diaz de Collakova E. la Garza R. Quinlivan E.P. Williamson J. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Shachar-Hill Y. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26137-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 44Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Folates were extracted from WT, mthfr–, and mthfr–/+MTHFR L. major grown in M199 media to a density of 2–4 × 107 cells ml–1. Cell pellets (2–4 × 1010 cells per sample) were resuspended in deoxygenated extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm Ches, 2% (w/v) sodium ascorbate, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The suspensions were sparged with nitrogen and then boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation (5,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) the clarified supernatants were decanted, sparged with nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Samples were thawed and treated with 0.5 ml of dialyzed rat plasma at 37 °C for 2 h to deglutamylate folates. The folate-binding column was scaled down from 5 to 1 ml and the volumes of wash and eluting buffers were reduced proportionately (42Goyer A. Diaz de Collakova E. la Garza R. Quinlivan E.P.

The high-performance liquid chromatography column, mobile phase buffers, and elution program were as described (42Goyer A. Diaz de Collakova E. la Garza R. Quinlivan E.P. Williamson J.

Detector response was calibrated using THF, 5-CH3-THF, 5,10-methenyl-THF (5,10-CH=THF), 5-formyl-THF (5-CHO-THF), and folic acid standards. Intracellular folate concentrations were calculated using an intracellular volume for L. major of 1.9 μl per 1 × 108 cells (45Ellenberger T.E. Wright J.E. Rosowsky A. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15960-15966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of Leishmania MTHFR—L. major MTHFR (LmjF36.6390) was identified in searches of the Leishmania genome databases; orthologs were also detected in Leishmania infantum (LinJ36.0220) and Leishmania braziliensis (LbrM35.6090). The L. major gene encoded a predicted protein of 309 residues with a mass of 34.8 kDa, which shows no obvious intracellular targeting sequences. LmjMTHFR was 51 and 50% identical to Zea mays MTHFR and Arabidopsis thaliana MTHFR-2, respectively (12Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36089-36096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but only 36% identical to E. coli (10Sheppard C.A. Trimmer E.E. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 718-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 32% identical to human (46Goyette P. Sumner J.S. Milos R. Duncan A.M. Rosenblatt D.S. Matthews R.G. Rozen R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) MTHFRs. LmjMTHFR is, however, much closer in length to the 296-residue E. coli enzyme than mammalian and plant MTHFRs, due to the absence of the C-terminal extension of ∼300 residues present in these proteins (Fig. 1). LmjMTHFR also lacked an N-terminal extension that is a site of regulatory phosphorylation in the human enzyme (47Yamada K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Reanalysis of the L. major genome sequence data confirmed that these differences did not arise from assembly errors (not shown). That LmjMTHFR indeed has MTHFR activity in vivo was shown by complementation in a yeast methionine auxotroph strain. The met12 met13 double deletant RRY3, which lacks MTHFR activity (38Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), grew in the absence of methionine after transformation with a LmjMTHFR expression plasmid, but not a control plasmid (Fig. 2). The growth rate of these transformants was similar to that of the WT strain DAY4. Characterization of Leishmania MTHFR Activity—LmjMTHFR activity was studied both in crude yeast extracts and using purified enzyme obtained from engineered E. coli, with radiometric (yeast) or spectrophotometric assays (purified enzyme). Yeast expressing LmjMTHFR showed high levels of activity with 5,10-CH2-THF (about 80 nmol min–1 mg–1 protein), whereas none was detected in the mthfr– RRY3 mutant containing vector alone (data not shown). A purification procedure was developed that yielded recombinant enzyme of >95% purity in a single chromatographic step (supplemental data Fig. S1). Purified LmjMTHFR showed an absorbance spectrum typical of a flavoprotein, with prominent peaks at 381 and 454 nm. The 454-nm peak disappeared upon addition of excess NADH or NADPH, indicating reduction of a flavin cofactor (supplemental data Fig. S2). When assayed in crude yeast extracts, LmjMTHFR was found to use either NADH or NADPH as reductant (Fig. 3A), which was unexpected because previously characterized MTHFRs strongly prefer one or the other. In addition, LmjMTHFR was insensitive to AdoMet, consistent with the absence of the C-terminal domain containing the AdoMet-binding site in mammalian and yeast MTHFRs (9Matthews R.G. Sheppard C. Goulding C. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S54-S59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Roje S. Chan S.Y. Kaplan F. Raymond R.K. Horne D.W. Appling D.R. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4056-4061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As a control, extracts of yeast expressing human MTHFR were tested similarly (Fig. 3B). Here, the human enzyme strongly preferred NADPH and was AdoMet-sensitive, as previously reported (12Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36089-36096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), with about 50% inhibition by 1 mm AdoMet. That the activity of human MTHFR was only ∼25% of that of LmjMTHFR may reflect differences in stability or expression levels, because the specific activity of purified LmjMTHFR was comparable with that of mammalian enzymes (see below). Purified LmjMTHFR tended to lose activity upon dilution, which was prevented by addition of flavin-adenine dinucleotide (data not shown), as with the E. coli enzyme (24Guenther B.D. Sheppard C.A. Tran P. Rozen R. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The pyridine nucleotide cofactor specificity of the purified LmjMTHFR was identical to that shown when assayed in yeast extracts. Using menadione as the electron acceptor, kinetic constants were determined for NADH and NADPH in phosphate and Tris buffers (Table 1). The specificity constants for NADH and NADPH were the same in both buffers, showing that LmjMTHFR was efficiently reduced by either nucleotide. 5,10-CH2-THF was also an effective substrate, with a kcat/Km 1.3-fold lower than the NADH/menadione reaction and Km(app) and kcat for 5,10-CH2-THF within the range of previously determined values (10Sheppard C.A. Trimmer E.E. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 718-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Daubner S.C. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 140-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the E. coli and pig liver enzymes (10Sheppard C.A. Trimmer E.E. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 718-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Daubner S.C. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 140-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), substrate inhibition was not seen, up to a maximal concentration tested of 250 μm (6R)-5,10-CH2-THF. In addition, no folic acid, dihydrofolic acid, biopterin, or dihydrobiopterin reductase activities could be detected, in the pH range of 8 to 5 (sensitivity was <0.1 μmol min–1 mg–1).TABLE 1Substrate specificity of LmjMTHFRSubstrateKm(app)kcataCalculated assuming one active site per polypeptide.kcat/Kmμms-1m-1s-1 × 105NAD(P)H-menadione oxidoreductase assayNADH (phosphate buffer)bMeasured with 130 μm menadione as the fixed substrate.53 ± 952 ± 39.8NADPH (phosphate buffer)bMeasured with 130 μm menadione as the fixed substrate.90 ± 1574 ± 68.2NADH (Tris buffer)bMeasured with 130 μm menadione as the fixed substrate.90 ± 1087 ± 59.7NADPH (Tris buffer)bMeasured with 130 μm menadione as the fixed substrate.170 ± 40140 ± 208.2NADH-5,10-CH2-THF oxidoreductase assay 5,10-CH2-THF (phosphate buffer)cMeasured with 150 μm NADH as the fixed substrate.15 ± 2dConcentration of (6R)-5,10-CH2-THF.11.1 ± 0.47.4a Calculated assuming one active site per polypeptide.b Measured with 130 μm menadione as the fixed substrate.c Measured with 150 μm NADH as the fixed substrate.d Concentration of (6R)-5,10-CH2-THF.

None of these compounds significantly inhibited MTHFR activity (supplemental data Fig. S3). Using engineered L. major mutants described below, neither deletion nor overexpression of MTHFR had a significant effect on parasite sensitivity toward methotrexate or three of these pteridine analogues (25 (O/129), 70, or 34, see supplemental data Table S1).

https://openalex.org/W2056188137,"Alterations in the p14ARF tumor suppressor are frequent in many human cancers and are associated with susceptibility to melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and nervous system tumors. In addition to its p53-regulatory functions, p14ARF has been shown to influence ribosome biogenesis and to regulate the endoribonuclease B23, but there remains considerable controversy about its nucleolar role. We sought to clarify the activities of p14ARF by studying its interaction with ribosomes. We show that p14ARF and B23 interact within the nucleolar 60 S preribosomal particle and that this interaction does not require rRNA. In contrast to previous reports, we found that expression of p14ARF does not significantly alter ribosome biogenesis but inhibits polysome formation and protein translation in vivo. These results suggest a ribosome-dependent p14ARF pathway that regulates cell growth and thus complements p53-dependent p14ARF functions."

We studied the effect of GI hormones on c-Met in rat pancreatic acini, which possess both receptors. CCK-8, carbachol, and bombesin, but not VIP/secretin, decreased c-Met. CCK-8 caused rapid and potent c-Met down-regulation and abolished HGF-induced c-Met and Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, while stimulating c-Met serine phosphorylation. The effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) was also seen in intact acini using immunofluorescence, in a biotinylated fraction representing membrane proteins, in single acinar cells, in Panc-1 tumor cells, and in vivo in rats injected with CCK. CCK-8 did not decrease cell viability or overall responsiveness. GF109203X, thapsigargin, or their combination partially reversed the effect of CCK-8. In contrast to HGF-induced c-Met down-regulation, the effect of CCK was decreased by a lysosome inhibitor (concanamycin) but not the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis blocked the effect of CCK. HGF but not CCK-8 caused c-Met ubiquitination.

Growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases are membrane-bound proteins that are involved in multiple growth-related intracellular signaling processes. After activation by their ligand, these receptors promote intracellular signals by phosphorylation of intracellular signaling proteins leading to the activation of intracellular signaling cascades (1Birchmeier C.

Increasing interest is being placed on the regulation of growth factor receptor levels and their signaling because of the growing evidence that receptor tyrosine kinases play an important role in disease, including the development and growth of various malignancies (3Krause D.S. Van Etten R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). c-Met is a membrane-bound growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor, which initially was described as a cellular oncogene (4Cooper C.S.

Although studies report that GI hormone/neurotransmitter receptors can actively regulate the expression and signaling of some growth factor receptors like the EGF receptor (21Kim J. Ahn S. Guo R. Daaka Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2887-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar), it is unknown if GI hormones/neurotransmitters can influence the c-Met receptor. The pancreatic acinar cell model provides an excellent model to address this question because these cells express numerous functional GI hormone/neurotransmitter receptors as well as the c-Met receptor, which has been reported previously to be highly responsive to HGF in pancreatic acini, activating downstream signaling cascades that are linked to growth, anti-apoptosis, and increased cell motility (16Jensen R.T.

Activation of c-Met has been shown to have potent growth effects on all pancreatic tissues, including acini, duct cells, islet cells, as well as cancers derived from pancreatic tissues (20Kiehne K. Herzig K.H. Folsch U.R. Pancreas. 1997; 15: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Vila M.R. Nakamura T. Real F.X. Lab. Investig. 1995; 73: 409-418PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gahr S.

These pancreatic neoplasms frequently overexpress c-Met, and studies show activation of c-Met is important in both the neoplastic progression and growth (20Kiehne K. Herzig K.H. Folsch U.R. Pancreas. 1997; 15: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Di Renzo M.F. Olivero M. Giacomini A. Porte H. Chastre E. Mirossay L. Nordlinger B. Bretti S. Bottardi S. Giordano S. Plebani M.

Furthermore, in pancreatic acinar cells, c-Met plays an important role both in their development as well as in their regenerative response to acute injury as occurs in acute and/or chronic pancreatitis (35Otte J.M. Kiehne K. Schmitz F. Folsch U.R. Herzig K.H. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 35: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, to attempt to examine the possible influence of activated GI hormone/neurotransmitter receptors on c-Met receptor levels and signaling and the mechanisms involved, we used isolated pancreatic acini because of their responsiveness to these agents as well as the fact that HGF has potent effects on these cells in vivo in both physiological and pathological processes.

Tissue Preparation—Pancreatic acini were obtained by collagenase digestion as described previously (36Tapia J.A. Garcia-Marin L.J. Jensen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35220-35230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Single pancreatic acinar cells were isolated as reported previously (37Gardner J.D. Jackson M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1977; 270: 439-454Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Standard incubation solution contained 25.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.45, 98 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm sodium glutamate, 5 mm sodium fumarate, 11.5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm glutamine, 1% (w/v) albumin, 0.01% (w/v) trypsin inhibitor, 1% (v/v) vitamin mixture, and 1% (v/v) amino acid mixture. Acini Stimulation—After collagenase digestion, dispersed acini were preincubated in standard incubation solution for 2 h at 37 °C with or without inhibitors as described. After preincubation, 1-ml aliquots of dispersed acini were incubated at 37 °C with or without stimulants as described. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet per 10 ml). After sonication, lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Analysis of Ubiquitinated c-Met Receptor—After protein measurement, equal amounts of lysates were incubated with 4 μg of mouse anti-c-Met (B-2) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 120 min at 4 °C and then for an additional 60 min with 25 μl of protein G-coupled agarose beads under constant agitation. After incubation, beads were washed twice in ice-cold lysis buffer, then twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using mouse polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (36Tapia J.A. Garcia-Marin L.J. Jensen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35220-35230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates, immunoprecipitates, or lysates of subcellular fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4-20% Tris/glycine gels. After electrophoresis protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween® 20, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) at 4 °C overnight or at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibody under constant agitation at antibody dilutions suggested by the antibody supplier. After primary antibody incubation membranes were washed twice in blocking buffer for 4 min and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-goat) according to the species of the first antibody for 45 min at room temperature under constant agitation. Then membranes were washed again twice in blocking buffer for 4 min, twice in washing buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween® 20) for 4 min, incubated for 4 min with chemiluminescence detection reagents, and finally exposed to Kodak Biomax film (XAR, MR). The intensity of the appearing bands was measured using Kodak ID image analysis. For statistical analysis the unpaired t test was performed, and p values <0.05 were considered significant. When re-probing was necessary, membranes were incubated in stripping buffer (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice for 10 min in washing buffer, blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer at room temperature, and re-probed as described above. Surface Biotinylation Assay—After incubation without additions or with 100 nm CCK for 45 min, cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, and suspended in 1 ml of PBS, pH 8.0, followed by biotinylation in 1 mm of EZ-link Sulfo NHS-SS biotin for 45 min at 4 °C as recommended. Nonreactive biotin was quenched by washing three times in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and cells were lysed in Cell-Lytic-M buffer (Sigma) with additions as described above. A small volume of the lysates was mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer (= total lysates). Equal amounts of protein (800 μg/sample) were submitted to immunoprecipitation with 50 μl of immobilized avidin beads overnight at 4 °C as recommended. The supernatant was removed and mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer (= nonbiotinylated fraction). The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in PBS, pH 8.0, and mixed with SDS sample buffer (= biotinylated fraction). To verify the specificity of avidin immunoprecipitation, controls using nonbiotinylated cells were added to each experiment. Immunocytochemistry and Immunofluorescence Imaging— After treating pancreatic acini with or without CCK, HGF, or a combination of both as indicated, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. A thin layer of cells was deposited onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides by cytocentrifugation (Cytopro cytocentrifuge, Wescor, Logan, UT) at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Slides were air-dried for 24 h, blocked in blocking buffer (10% isotype-matched serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, pH 7.5) for 60 min, and incubated with a polyclonal anti-c-Met antibody (1:50; R & D Systems), a polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Met (Y1234/1235; Cell Signaling) antibody at a dilution of 1:100, or a combination of a polyclonal anti-c-Met antibody (1:50;R&D Systems) and an anti-E-cadherin antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C. Reactivity was demonstrated by incubation with an Alexa 488-conjugated rabbit anti-goat and Alexa 555-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:500, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Control samples were prepared by replacing the primary antibody with an isotype-matched serum. Fluorescent images were collected using a Leica CTR5000 microscope with a ×63 objective in oil immersion. Multiple images using different focal points at 0.1 μm steps to cover the entire thickness of the sample (z-stacking) were acquired using a RetigaExi camera (Qimaging, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada) and Volocity software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). All images of one experiment were acquired using the same settings. Post-image collection restoration was executed using the software's iterative restoration tool. Images were cropped in Adobe Photoshop CS with the same settings being applied to each image of one experiment, and the layout of the final figure was finished in Adobe Illustrator. To analyze c-Met staining intensity, 10 representative cytoplasmic regions of interest of the same size were defined in Volocity, and the mean signal intensity was determined using the measurement tool (this determination is independent from picture settings like contrast or levels). To determine co-localization of c-Met and E-cadherin at the membrane, 10 representative regions of interest of comparable size were selected in the membrane region, and co-localization was determined using the co-localization tool and calculating the co-localization coefficient. Cell Viability Experiments—The viability of pancreatic acinar cells was determined using the LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity kit for animal cells from Molecular Probes following the directions provided by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Briefly, pancreatic acini were incubated with 100 nm CCK for the time indicated, washed twice with PBS at 37 °C, and placed on 22-mm square coverslips, pretreated overnight with poly-l-lysine, and allowed to dry. Cells were then covered with 100-150 μl of LIVE/DEAD assay reagents (1 μm ethidium homodimer-1 and 1 μm calcein-AM) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, samples were examined with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot 200; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Two images were taken under optimal excitation/emission wavelengths for each dye (calcein = 494/517 nm; ethidium homodimer-1 (on DNA) = 528/617 nm) from different regions of the slide randomly chosen. Both images were merged using Confocal Assistant, version 4.02 (Bio-Rad), and the percentage of dead and live cells was objectively quantified on the collected images using Scion Image for Windows, version 4.02 (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). In Vivo Experiments—Adult male Wistar rats (200 and 225 g) were fed a regular rodent diet (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) and were divided into four groups of four rats each. The first group was injected intraperitoneally with sterile saline solution at 37 °C and sacrificed 20 min after the injection. The second group was injected intraperitoneally with one dose of CCK-8 (10 μg/kg, prepared in sterile saline solution at 37 °C as excipient) and sacrificed 20 min after the injection. The third group was injected intraperitoneally with two sequential doses of saline 20 min apart, and sacrificed 20 min after the last injection. The fourth group was injected intraperitoneally with two sequential doses of CCK-8 (10 μg/kg), 20 min apart, and sacrificed 20 min after the last injection. Thus, the total experimental time was 20 min for the first and second groups and 40 min the for third and fourth groups. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation, and pancreatic acini were obtained as described above. Stable Transfection of Panc-1 Cells—Panc-1 cells were stably transfected with the human CCKA receptor using Lipofectamine. Clones expressing human CCKA receptor were selected using geneticin (G418). Expression of CCKA receptor was verified by binding studies using I125-CCK-8. Four clones expressing human CCKA receptor were isolated. Effect of GI Hormones/Neurotransmitters on c-Met Protein Levels in Rat Pancreatic Acini—To explore whether GI hormones/neurotransmitters can alter c-Met protein levels, we studied their effects in rat pancreatic acini, which are reported to possess receptors for c-Met as well as numerous GI hormone/neurotransmitters (16Jensen R.T. Johnson L.R. Jacobson E.D. Christensen J. Alpers D.H. Walsh J.H. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1377-1446Google Scholar, 38Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Fed. Proc. 1981; 40: 2486-2496PubMed Google Scholar). Pancreatic acini were stimulated by various GI hormones/neurotransmitters at concentrations known to activate pancreatic acinar cells (38Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Fed. Proc. 1981; 40: 2486-2496PubMed Google Scholar, 39Williams J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and c-Met protein levels were analyzed using Western blotting (Fig. 1). CCK-8, carbachol, and bombesin, which activate PKC and increase intracellular calcium, but not secretin or VIP, which activate protein kinase A (16Jensen R.T. Johnson L.R. Jacobson E.D. Christensen J. Alpers D.H. Walsh J.H. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1377-1446Google Scholar), caused down-regulation of c-Met levels (Fig. 1). Specifically, stimulating pancreatic acini with CCK-8 (100 nm), carbachol (100 μm), or bombesin (1 μm) for 45 min (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 4, and 5) resulted in an 85 ± 5% (p < 0.0001), 32 ± 9% (p < 0.05), and 26 ± 10% (p < 0.05) decrease of c-Met levels compared with control, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table 1). CCK-JMV (1 μm), which is an antagonist of the low affinity state and agonist of the high affinity state of the CCK receptor (40Stark H.A. Sharp C.M. Sutliff V.E. Martinez J. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), had no effect on c-Met receptor levels (Fig. 1, lane 3). These results demonstrate for the first time that c-Met protein levels can be negatively regulated by activation of some GI hormone/neurotransmitter GPCRs.TABLE 1Characteristics of c-Met receptor protein level down-regulation by GI hormones/neurotransmitters and ability of inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways, protein degradation, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis to reverse CCK-8 effects on c-Met level in rat pancreatic acinic-Met levels after GI hormone/neurotransmitter treatment (% of control)aIncubation time was 45 min.

https://openalex.org/W2103756446,"A critical aspect of E3 ubiquitin ligase function is the selection of a particular E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to accomplish ubiquitination of a substrate. We examined the requirements for correct E2-E3 specificity in the RING-H2 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p, an ER-localized protein known to use primarily Ubc7p for its function. Versions of Hrd1p containing the RING motif from homologous E3s were unable to carry out Hrd1p function, revealing a requirement for the specific Hrd1p RING motif in vivo. An in vitro assay revealed that these RING motifs were sufficient to function as ubiquitin ligases, but that they did not display the E2 specificity predicted from in vivo results. We further refined the in vitro assay of Hrd1p function by demanding not only ubiquitin ligase activity, but also specific activity that recapitulated both the E2 specificity and RING selectivity observed in vivo. Doing so revealed that correct E2 engagement by Hrd1p required the presence of portions of the Hrd1p soluble cytoplasmic domain outside the RING motif, the placement of the Hrd1p ubiquitin ligase in the ER membrane, and presentation of Ubc7p in the cytosolic context. We confirmed that these conditions supported the ubiquitination of Hrd1p itself, and the transfer of ubiquitin to the prototype substrate Hmg2p-GFP, validating Hrd1p self-ubiquitination as a viable assay of ligase function.

The E1 next passes its ubiquitin to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), again as a thioester-linked intermediate. Finally, ubiquitination of the target protein is brokered by a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that facilitates transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to a lysine on the target protein (or a previously added ubiquitin) to form an isopeptide bond. In vivo the ubiquitin ligase activity of a given E3 is not universally supported by all E2s (5Hochstrasser M. Annu Rev.

Thus, the compatibility between E3 and E2 is a critical aspect of this enzyme cascade. Many E3s share a zinc-binding sequence called the RING motif (12Fang S. Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This characteristic sequence, along with several variants (13Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I.

A. 2006; 103: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Unlike the HECT domain ligases, the RING ligases and their variants do not form a covalent adduct with ubiquitin during catalysis (18Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 19Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Despite the prevalence of RING motifs among the growing number of ubiquitin ligases, and their necessity for ligase function in these proteins, the role of the RING motif in promoting E2 specificity and ubiquitin transfer is not fully understood. Structural analyses suggest that residues in the RING motif make contact with E2s, but so too do some residues outside the RING motif (20Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P.

It is not clear whether the RING motif alone is sufficient to specifically engage an E2 and stimulate ubiquitination activity, or whether other in cis determinants outside the RING motif contribute to E2 selectivity. We have addressed these questions for the case of the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p. A significant component of protein degradation in eukaryotes occurs at the surface of the ER and is generally referred to as ERAD, for ER-associated degradation. ERAD is responsible for degradation of a variety of integral membrane and luminal proteins in the ER (24Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The Hrd1p ubiquitin ligase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of several E3s that mediate ERAD (9Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 10Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M.

Hrd1p is responsible for the degradation of the yeast HMG-CoA reductase isozyme Hmg2p (28Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and a variety of misfolded ER proteins (29Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 30Plemper R.K. Egner R. Kuchler K. Wolf D.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Hrd1p consists of an N-terminal multi-spanning membrane anchor and a cytoplasmic C-terminal region bearing a RING-H2 motif. The cytoplasmic portion is required for Hrd1p-dependent ERAD in vivo (16Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and functions autonomously as a ubiquitin ligase in vitro (9Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Hrd1p is complexed with the ER integral membrane protein Hrd3p. One function of Hrd3p is to promote Hrd1p stability. In the absence of Hrd3p, Hrd1p undergoes rapid degradation mediated by the Hrd1p RING-H2 motif resulting in Hrd1p levels too low to sustain ERAD (16Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). If Hrd1p levels are elevated in the absence of Hrd3p, ERAD will proceed, indicating that Hrd1p is a key protein of HRD pathway ubiquitination (16Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic C-terminal RING-H2 domain of Hrd1p is exposed to numerous ubiquitin E2s; yet, Hrd1p only employs Ubc7p, and to a much lesser extent Ubc1p, in the execution of its function (9Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This same E2 specificity is observed for Hrd1p self-ubiquitination in the absence of Hrd3p (16Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, the Hrd1p RING domain will function in vitro with E2s that are not used in vivo (9Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), leading us to wonder which features of Hrd1p contribute to its high selectivity for Ubc7p in vivo. In particular, we were interested in developing biochemical approaches for studying Hrd1p action that would faithfully recapitulate this selectivity in biochemically tractable conditions. We have determined that cis-acting portions of Hrd1p, the membrane anchoring protein Cue1p, and the placement of Hrd1p in the ER membrane bilayer are all critical to reconstituting in vitro the function of Ubc7p with Hrd1p. Recombinant DNA—Detailed plasmid information is available in supplemental data. PCR primer information will be provided upon request. All DNA segments synthesized by PCR were verified by sequencing. The production of coding regions was described for Hrd1p-3HA and C399S Hrd1p-3HA (16Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), as well as Ubc7p-2HA (32Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). gp78, hsHrd1, and Praja1 RING motifs were amplified by PCR from published template plasmids (15Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar), and subcloned into plasmids containing Hrd1p-3HA to yield gp78, hsHrd1, or Praja1 RING chimera in otherwise full-length Hrd1p-3HA. These were then subcloned into yeast expression plasmids with either the native HRD1 promoter or the strong TDH3 promoter. Hrd1p-Δpro was made using PCR SOEing to join the sequences of Hrd1p on either side of the proline-flanked deletion (see Fig. 1), and subcloned into appropriate Hrd1p-3HA plasmids. C399A-Hrd1p was made by PCR SOEing, and was found to be as potent a RING mutant as C399S-Hrd1p (data not shown). All GST fusions were expressed from the pET42b(+) bacterial expression plasmid (Novagen). The isolated RING motifs were amplified by PCR from plasmids above and subcloned into pET42b(+). pRH1466, the plasmid expressing GST-R-C, was previously described (9Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). GST-N-R and GST-N-R-C were made by PCR of the appropriate sequence from Hrd1p plasmid and subcloning into pRH1466. GST-N-c399s-C and GST-N-gp78-C were made by PCR of sequence encoding the mutant C399S-Hrd1p or chimeric gp78-RING-Hrd1p. The c399 refers to the last cysteine of the Hrd1p RING that normally occupies position 399 of full-length Hrd1p. The Ubc7p or Ubc7p-2HA coding region was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pTYB2 (New England Biolabs) to produce the Ubc7p-Chitin Binding Domain/Intein fusion vector pRH1946. ΔtmCue1p, which lacks amino acids 2–22 of Cue1p (and thus the included transmembrane span) was amplified by PCR from pTX129 (36Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and cloned into a pET bacterial expression vector. Then, the ribosomal binding site and ΔtmCue1p were amplified by PCR and cloned behind Ubc7p-CBD/Intein in pRH1946 to produce pRH2061, with a polycistronic message encoding both Ubc7p-CBD/Intein and ΔtmCue1p proteins in one inducible operon. His6-tagged mouse UBA1 (E1) and HUBC4 were purified from bacterial lysates as described previously (9Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat.

Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 39Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), in minimal media with 2% glucose and amino acid supplements. Detailed strain information is presented in supplemental data. All yeast strains were derived from the same genetic background used in our previous work (28Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 39Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Strains for evaluating the in vivo degradation of Hmg2p-GFP were derived from the previously described RHY853 (16Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), expressing Hmg2-GFP and the independently expressed catalytic domain of Hmg2p as its sole source of HMG-CoA reductase. HRD1 was replaced in RHY853 with the G418-resistance marker kanMX (40Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar) to produce RHY2814. The various HA epitope-tagged Hrd1p chimeric RING plasmids or controls were integrated into this hrd1Δ strain at the TRP1 locus. To evaluate Hrd1p degradation, HRD3 was deleted in RHY2814 with the selectable LEU2 marker to produce RHY3005. Into this hrd1Δhrd3Δ strain, the various Hrd1p RING replaced plasmids or controls were also integrated at the TRP1 locus. To evaluate Ubc7p dependence of Hrd1p degradation, UBC7 was deleted in RHY3005 with the nourseothricin-(ClonNat) resistance marker natMX (41Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar) to produce RHY3559, into which Hrd1p RING replaced plasmids or controls were integrated at the TRP1 locus. Strains used to produce microsomal membranes for the in vitro assay were pep4Δ ubc7Δ hrd1Δ, and expressed Hmg2p-GFP. The full-length Hrd1p-3HA chimeras tested in microsomes were expressed in these strains from the strong TDH3 promoter by integration of the appropriate plasmid at the TRP1 locus. cue1Δ nulls were generated from these strains by deletion of CUE1 with the nourseothricin (ClonNat) resistance marker natMX (41Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Strains for the production of cytosol were also pep4Δ hrd1Δ ubc7Δ and included either empty vector or Ubc7p-2HA expressed from the TDH3 promoter. Flow Cytometry—Log phase cultures (A600 <0.5) grown in minimal medium at 30 °C were transferred to flow cytometer sample tubes and measured with a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur instrument. Flow microfluorimetric data were analyzed and histograms were generated using CellQuest flow cytometry software. In all cases, histograms represented 20,000 individual cells. Cycloheximide Chase Degradation Assay—This assay was performed as described (39Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, log phase cultures of cells expressing HA epitope-tagged Hrd1p or RING variants were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide to arrest protein synthesis. At indicated times, 1 OD of log phase cells were harvested, lysed, and 0.1 OD equivalents were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for epitope-tagged protein. Protein Purification—All recombinant proteins were expressed in Rosetta(DE3) Escherichia coli (Novagen) grown in LB with appropriate antibiotics. 0.6 OD/ml cultures were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12–16 h at 15 °C. Bacterial pellets were harvested, washed in normal saline (0.9 m NaCl), and frozen at –80 °C. Pellets were thawed and resuspended in extraction buffers as described below, and lysed using a Branson Sonifier 450 (VWR) with six rounds of 30 s sonication/30 s ice incubation. After affinity column purification, elution, and concentration, proteins were dialyzed into buffer HDB containing 10% glycerol. Single use aliquots were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Recombinant protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE resolved samples and comparison to bovine serum albumin. His Tag Purification of E1 and HUBC4—Bacterial pellets from 2-liter cultures expressing His6 mouse UBA1 or HUBC4 were resuspended in 40 ml of His-Extraction Buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (13 μm AEBSF, 3.6 μm TPCK, 2.6 μm leupeptin, 1.8 μm pepstatin, 0.56 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 0.56 mm benzamidine, and 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), sonicated as above, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min in an SS34 rotor. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube with 0.5 ml of Talon Cell-Thru resin (BD Biosciences) equilibrated in His-Extraction Buffer, and gently nutated for 20 min at room temperature. The resin was centrifuged (3000 × g) and washed with 10 ml of His-Extraction Buffer and protease inhibitors above for 10 min at room temperature two times. The washed resin was then transferred to a 1-cm diameter column and washed with 30 ml of His-Wash Buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). His-tagged E1 was eluted from the resin with 3 ml of His-Wash Buffer + 150 mm imidazole, and was collected in 500-μl fractions and analyzed by Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin standard. Fractions with more than 0.1 mg/ml protein were pooled and concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 5,000 MWCO filters (Millipore). Concentrated protein was dialyzed over 24 h with 3 × 1 liter HDBG (25 mm HEPES, 0.7 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol) in a 3-ml 10,000 MWCO Slide-A-Lyser cassette (Pierce). GST Protein Purification—Each bacterial pellet from 1 liter of culture expressing a GST protein was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer HDB (25 mm HEPES, 0.7 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4) + protease inhibitors (7.5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, 7 μm pepstatin, 28 μm TPCK, 130 μm AEBSF, 2.5 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 2.5 mm benzamidine, and 7.5 mm DTT), and sonicated as above. To this was added 6 ml of 2.5 m NaCl, 600 μl1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 1.2 ml of 25% Triton X-100. This was nutated 20 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 1 h at 40,000 × g in SS34 rotor. Buffer HDBW (HDB + 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100.) was added to the supernatant to a final volume of 50 ml along with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose-4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) and nutated for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was transferred to a 1-cm diameter column and washed with 10 ml of each of the following buffers: HDBW with 1.25 mm PMSF and 5 mm EDTA; HDBW with 1.25 mm PMSF, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m NaCl; HDBW with 0.5% deoxycholate; HDBW with 0.5 m NaCl; and Final Wash (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Protein was eluted in 1-ml fractions of Elution Buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm reduced glutathione) incubated with column resin for 10 min before recovery. Fractions were analyzed by Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin standard. Fractions with more than 0.1 mg/ml protein were pooled and concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 5,000 MWCO filters (Millipore). Concentrated protein was dialyzed for 24 h with 3 × 1 liter HDBG (25 mm HEPES, 0.7 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol) in a 0.5 ml 3,000 MWCO Slide-A-Lyser cassette (Pierce). Intein/Chitin Binding Domain Fusion Purification—Each bacterial pellet from 1 liter of culture expressing an Intein/CBD fusion was resuspended in 25 ml of Intein Lysis Buffer (ILB: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors (260 μm AEBSF, 105 μm leupeptin, 73 μm pepstatin, 142 μm TPCK), and sonicated as above. Lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min in an SS34 rotor. Supernatant was filtered through 0.45-μm and 0.2-μm filters, and added to 15 ml of chitin beads (New England Biolabs) equilibrated in ILB, and nutated for 90 min at 4 °C. The adsorbed resin was placed in a 2.5-cm column and washed with 350–400 mls of ILB. Next, the resin was nutated in 10 ml of ILB + 50 mm DTT for 20 h at 4 °C to promote intein cleavage, and chitin beads were washed with ILB to collect intein-cleaved proteins. 40 ml of fluid were collected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 5,000 MWCO filters (Millipore). Concentrated protein was dialyzed against 3 × 1 liter HDBG (25 mm HEPES, 0.7 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol) for 24 h in a 0.5 ml 3,000 MWCO Slide-a-Lyser cassette (Pierce). Proteins were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g to remove any aggregates, and supernatant was aliquoted as above. In Vitro Ubiquitination—Ubiquitin was resuspended from lyophilized powder in Ubiquitin Storage Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) and frozen. Reactions were performed in 1× ubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT) with 3 mm ATP, 80 μg/ml ubiquitin, 6 μg/ml E1, 20 μg/ml E2, in a total volume of 15 μl. Reactions mixtures were prepared on ice, then incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, and stopped with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (4% SDS (w/v), 8 m urea, 75 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 200 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting. Microsome Preparation and Ubiquitination—20 A600 units of log phase cells grown in minimal media were harvested and resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold Membrane Fractionation Buffer (MFB: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.3 m sorbitol) with protease inhibitors (260 μm AEBSF, 105 μm leupeptin, 73 μm pepstatin, 142 μm TPCK). Glass beads were added to just below the liquid level. Lysis was performed at 4 °C with six cycles of 1 m in vortexing (max speed) and 1 min incubation on ice. Lysate was harvested by removing supernatant from beads, and washing beads twice with 400 μl of MFB, pooling the washes and lysate. The resulting pooled lysate was cleared by repeated 10-s microcentrifuge pulses to remove unlysed cells and large debris. The cleared supernatant contains microsome membranes, which were harvested by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min. Microsome pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of Ubiquitination Buffer, and the yield from 5 OD of cells (15 μl) was added to each reaction. Reactions were performed in Ubiquitination Buffer with 6 μg/ml E1, 40 μg/ml E2 (except as noted in E2 dilution experiments), 160 μg/ml ubiquitin, and 3 mm ATP in 60-μl reactions. Reaction mixes were prepared on ice, then incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Reactions were stopped with 200 ml of SUME (1%w/v SDS, 8 m urea, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors above and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, followed by addition of 600 μl of IP buffer (15 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate), immunoprecipitation of Hrd1p as described (9Bays N.W.

https://openalex.org/W2139594642,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors bind their ErbB receptors in a highly selective manner, but the molecular basis for this specificity is poorly understood. We have previously shown that certain residues in human EGF (Ser2-Asp3) and TGFα (Glu26) are not essential for their binding to ErbB1 but prevent binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4. In the present study, we have used a phage display approach to affinity-optimize the C-terminal linear region of EGF-like growth factors for binding to each ErbB receptor and thereby shown that Arg45 in EGF impairs binding to both ErbB3 and ErbB4. By omitting all these so-called negative constraints from EGF, we designed a ligand designated panerbin that binds ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 with similarly high affinity as their wild-type ligands. Homology models, based on the known crystal structure of TGFα-bound ErbB1, showed that panerbin is able to bind ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 in a highly similar manner with respect to position and number of interaction sites. Upon in silico introduction of the experimentally known negative constraints into panerbin, we found that Arg45 induced local charge repulsion and Glu26 induced steric hindrance in a receptor-specific manner, whereas Ser2-Asp3 impaired binding due to a disordered conformation. Furthermore, radiolabeled panerbin was used to quantify the level of all three receptors on human breast cancer cells in a single radioreceptor assay. It is concluded that the ErbB specificity of EGF-like growth factors primarily results from the presence of a limited number of residues that impair the unintended interaction with other ErbB receptors.

The human genome encodes four ErbB tyrosine kinase receptors, designated ErbB1 (HER1 or EGF 3The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; BTC, betacellulin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. receptor), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. They are activated by a total of 11 different EGF-like growth factors, and in combination this set of receptors and ligands plays a crucial role in the growth control of mammalian cells and the development of multicellular organisms (1Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5659) Google Scholar). Particularly, ErbB1 and ErbB2 are frequently overexpressed in many epithelial tumors, and as a consequence the ErbB signaling network is currently one of the main targets for the development of anti-tumor drugs (2Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayes E.L. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H.

ErbB receptors show a highly pronounced ligand specificity, but the molecular basis for this binding specificity is still poorly understood. ErbB1 binds seven distinct ligands (EGF, TGFα, amphiregulin, epigen, BTC, epiregulin, and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor), ErbB3 binds only NRG1 (neuregulin 1) and NRG2, and ErbB4 interacts with NRG1, NRG2, NRG3, NRG4, BTC, epiregulin, and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor. ErbB2 does not bind ligand but is the preferred heterodimerization partner of all liganded ErbB receptors. It has so far been anticipated that the ErbB specificity of EGF-like growth factors results from the presence or absence of specific residues that are directly involved in receptor binding. However, a large number of site-directed mutagenesis studies, particularly on EGF, TGFα, and NRG1, have identified numerous residues that upon mutation reduce the binding affinity for their respective ErbB receptor, but in general these mutations do not affect receptor specificity. This agrees with crystal structure data, which have shown that many residues in both EGF and TGFα interact directly with ErbB1 (6Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. Jorissen R.N. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Ward C.W. Cell. 2002; 110: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 7Ogiso H.

No such data are available yet for ErbB3 and ErbB4, since the relevant crystal structures are still lacking, but based on the strong homology of the different ErbB receptors and the high structural similarity between the various EGF-like growth factors, it seems unlikely that for binding to these receptors a fully different set of ligand residues is involved. Moreover, phylogenetic tree analysis has indicated that TGFα and BTC are closely related and may have arisen from a common ancestor gene (8Stein R.A. Staros J.V. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but still TGFα is an ErbB1-specific ligand, whereas BTC interacts with both ErbB1 and ErbB4. AR and HB-EGF are similarly related but also show distinct receptor specificity. This suggests that during evolution, specific strategies have been developed to obtain the desired receptor specificity. Previous studies have indicated that the receptor binding specificity of EGF-like growth factors can be compromised by making chimeras of different ligands. Barbacci et al. (9Barbacci E.G. Guarino B.C. Stroh J.G. Singleton D.H. Rosnack K.J. Moyer J.D. Andrews G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9585-9589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have shown that a chimera between EGF and NRG1β, designated biregulin, not only binds with high affinity to ErbB1 but also shows low affinity competition with NRG1β for receptor binding. Our previous studies (10Stortelers C. van De Pollqq M.L. Lenferink A.E. Gadellaa M.M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have shown that this is similarly true for various chimeras of the ErbB1-specific ligands EGF and TGFα. In particular, T1E, which is composed of EGF sequences with the N-terminal linear region of TGFα, is not only a high affinity ligand for ErbB1 but also a low affinity ligand for ErbB3 and ErbB4. Subsequent analysis showed that EGF is unable to bind ErbB3, because it lacks the His2-Phe3 sequence of TGFα in its N-terminal linear region, whereas TGFα is unable to bind ErbB3 because of the bulky, negatively charged Glu26 (EGF numbering) in the so-called B-loop (10Stortelers C. van De Pollqq M.L. Lenferink A.E. Gadellaa M.M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, T1E, which contains the His2-Phe3 sequence but lacks Glu26, is able to interact with ErbB3. Intriguingly, both crystal structure and mutational analysis revealed that these specific residues are not essential for high affinity binding to ErbB1. In a more recent study (11Wingens M. Jacobs-Oomen S. van der Woning S.P. Stortelers C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4703-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we have further optimized the amino acid sequence of T1E in its N- and C-terminal linear region to derive a mutant, designated WVR/EGF/IADIQ, that binds ErbB1 with similarly high affinity as EGF and ErbB3 with similarly high affinity as NRG1β but shows only low affinity for ErbB4. Based on the above observations, we have postulated that EGF-like growth factors do not only contain residues that are directly involved in ErbB binding (positive constraints) but in addition residues that are not essential for binding to their cognate receptor but that prevent their unintended interaction with other ErbB receptors (negative constraints). In the present study, we provide evidence that such negative constraints in ligand molecules form the primary basis for their ErbB specificity. Using a phage display approach in which the C-terminal linear region of T1E has been randomized, we have established the optimal sequences for ligand binding to ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Our data show that each of these three receptors has unique requirements for ligand binding, but that a consensus sequence can be derived that permits high affinity binding to all three receptors. From the data obtained, we conclude that T1E is a low affinity ligand for ErbB3 and ErbB4, because Arg45 forms a negative constraint for binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 but not to ErbB1. Removal of this arginine from T1E resulted in the generation of a ligand, designated panerbin, that binds all three receptors with similarly high affinity as their wild-type ligands. Homology modeling studies showed that panerbin binds ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 in an almost identical manner, indicating that ErbB receptors recognize similar positive constraints in their ligand molecules. However, introduction of the identified negative constraints into panerbin resulted in local charge repulsion, conformational impairment, or steric hindrance for binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 but not for ErbB1, thereby providing a molecular basis for their role in receptor specificity. Cell Lines—Interleukin 3-dependent murine 32D hematopoietic progenitor cells transfected with distinct human ErbB-encoding plasmids were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 0.25 ng/ml murine interleukin-3 (Promega, Madison, WI) and subsequently kept under continuous selection using 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem).

Immunoabsorbent 24-well plates were precoated overnight at 4 °C with 0.2 μg of goat anti-human Fc-specific IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in 0.2 ml of PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Wells were washed with PBS plus 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and subsequently blocked with 0.2 ml of PBS plus 0.2% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at room temperature to prevent nonspecific binding. The wells were then coated with 100 ng of ErbB-Fc for 2 h in PBS plus 0.2% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (binding buffer). Wells were subsequently washed twice with PBS/Tween and incubated with 3 × 108 T1E (residues 44-48) phages in 0.1 ml of binding buffer. After incubation for 2 h, unbound phages were removed by rinsing the wells 12 times with PBS/Tween. In the first selection round, phages were eluted by adding 0.1 ml of glycine buffer (50 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.7) for 10 min, and the eluate was neutralized by the addition of 25 μl of 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. In subsequent selection rounds, the bound phages were eluted specifically with 1 μg of murine EGF (for ErbB1) or 1 μg of NRG1β (for ErbB3 and ErbB4) in 1 ml of binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The eluate was used for phage titration and infection of logarithmic cultures of Escherichia coli TG-1 cells.

Next, wells were coated for 2 h with 100 ng of ErbB-Fc in binding buffer, subsequently washed twice, and incubated with phages in 0.1 ml of binding buffer. After incubation for 2 h, unbound phages were removed by rinsing three times with PBS/Tween. For detection of bound phages, wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS/BSA. To remove unbound phages, wells were washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, 0.1 ml of substrate, consisting of 0.4 mm 3,3′5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine (Sigma) and 0.03% H2O2 in 0.11 m citrate buffer, pH 5.5, was added to the wells.

Construction of T1E/YYDLL—Mutations in the C-terminal linear region were made using mutagenic oligonucleotide primers with pEZZ/FX T1E as template. Mutant gene products were subsequently introduced with the pEZZ vector using the BamHI/SalI sites, and the constructs were verified by automated cycle sequencing. Recombinant T1E/YYDLL was expressed as a protein A-tagged fusion protein in the protease K-deficient E. coli strain KS474. T1E/YYDLL was purified by affinity chromatography using IgG-Sepharose, followed by Factor X cleavage of the protein A tag, an additional round of affinity chromatography to remove the tag, and a final reverse-phase HPLC purification step (10Stortelers C. van De Pollqq M.L.

Coordinate files of the final models are available from the authors upon request. Selection of Optimal C-terminal Sequences for ErbB1, ErbB3, or ErbB4 Binding—We have previously shown that T1E, obtained by introducing TGFα sequences into the N-terminal linear region of EGF, is a broad ErbB-activating ligand with high affinity for ErbB1 and low affinity for ErbB3 and ErbB4 (10Stortelers C. van De Pollqq M.L. Lenferink A.E. Gadellaa M.M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additional studies have indicated that the affinity of T1E for ErbB3 can be further enhanced by altering the C-terminal linear region (11Wingens M. Jacobs-Oomen S. van der Woning S.P. Stortelers C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4703-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 13Stortelers C. van der Woning S.P. Jacobs-Oomen S. Wingens M. van Zoelen E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12055-12063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To identify C-terminal sequences that are optimal for binding of T1E to each of these three ErbB receptors, we expressed T1E on phage whereby the DNA sequence encoding residues 44-48 was randomly mutated (residue numbering according to EGF; see Fig. 1 for sequences). To select ErbB-specific high affinity binders, the resulting phage library was incubated with Fc-ErbB fragments of ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4, respectively, during three rounds of selection. ErbB2 with its permanent open conformation cannot bind ligand (16Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Kofler M. Jorissen R.N. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Ward C.W. Mol.

Supplemental Table 1 summarizes the phage input/output ratios during the various selection rounds. Fig. 2 shows that in the case of ErbB1, a phage pool with similarly high affinity as T1E was already obtained after a single round of selection, whereas a phage pool with strongly enhanced affinity for both ErbB3 and ErbB4 compared with T1E was obtained after 2-3 rounds of selection. From each of the receptor-specific phage pools obtained after three rounds of selection, multiple clones were sequenced (see supplemental Table 2, a-c). T1E variants with distinct amino acid sequences were obtained, indicating that multiple C-terminal sequences facilitate ErbB-specific high affinity binding. Fig. 3, a-c, show the frequency distribution of individual amino acids in the selected variants. Based on these frequencies, consensus sequences (occurrence >50%) for optimal receptor binding of T1E (residues 44-48) selectants could be assigned, as follows: for ErbB1, XXDLX; for ErbB3, I(F/Y)D(Ar/Hp)X (where Ar represents an aromatic and Hp represents a hydrophobic residue); and for ErbB4, YN(D/E)(L/V/I)X. These data show that within the context of a T1E background, all three ErbB receptors display distinct requirements for high affinity ligand binding.FIGURE 2Binding characteristics of T1E (residues 44-48) phage pools after the indicated rounds of selection on Fc-ErbB-1 (a), Fc-ErbB3 (b), or Fc-ErbB4 (c).

Sequences of individual selectants are depicted in supplemental Table 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Selection of a Pan-ErbB Ligand—To test if the requirements for ligand binding to ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 are mutually exclusive, the phage pool obtained after two rounds of selection on Fc-ErbB3 was subsequently selected for high affinity binders to Fc-ErbB4 and Fc-ErbB1. Binding analysis indicated that the phage pool obtained after two selection rounds on ErbB3 already showed high affinity for both ErbB3 and ErbB1 but only intermediate affinity for ErbB4 (see supplemental Fig. 1). However, after an additional selection round on ErbB4, a phage pool with high affinity for all three ErbB receptors was obtained, although no deliberate selection on ErbB1 had been carried out. The amino acid sequences of the variants selected after binding to both ErbB3 and ErbB4 are listed in supplemental Table 2d, whereas the corresponding frequency distribution of residues at each position is presented in Fig. 3d. Based on these frequencies a consensus sequence of YYDLX was obtained for the C-terminal linear region of the T1E (residues 44-48) selectants that bind with high affinity to ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4. This consensus sequence thus reflects a unique combination of residues for binding to all three receptors. Phage display mutational analysis will favor residues that provide a positive constraint for receptor binding, whereas negative constraints will be eliminated. According to the data presented in Fig. 3, residue Leu47 appears to be a major positive constraint in the linear C-terminal region for binding to ErbB1, Asp46 for ErbB3, and Tyr44 for ErbB4 (all >80% occurrence). The main difference between T1E/YYDLX and T1E itself is the mutation R45Y, since the residue at position 48 appears less important according to the pan-ErbB consensus sequence. This suggests that Arg45 forms a negative constraint for binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 but not for interaction with ErbB1. Characterization of the Recombinant Pan-ErbB Ligand T1E/YYDLL on Living Cells—The sequence T1E/YYDLL was found twice within the phage clones characterized, and since it fully corresponds with the obtained consensus sequence for a ligand that binds all three ErbB receptors, we subsequently tested T1E with YYDLL at positions 44-48 (see Fig. 1) as a purified recombinant protein for its ErbB affinity on living cells. Fig. 4a shows that recombinant T1E/YYDLL binds with similarly high affinity as T1E and EGF to ErbB1 on HER14 cells (IC50 = 40 ng/ml). On 32D cells transfected with ErbB3, the affinity of T1E/YYDLL (IC50 = 15 ng/ml) was increased 60-fold compared with T1E (IC50 = 900 ng/ml) and reached almost the same level as the endogenous ligand NRG1β (IC50 = 7 ng/ml). The binding affinity of T1E/YYDLL (IC50 = 20 ng/ml) to ErbB4 on T47-14 cells was even higher than that of NRG1β (IC50 = 50 ng/ml). This shows that, despite the fact that ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 have distinct binding requirements, T1E/YYDLL can bind all three receptors, with an affinity for ErbB3 and ErbB4 similar to NRG1β and an affinity for ErbB1 similar to EGF. Fig. 4b shows that T1E/YYDLL has a similar ability as EGF and T1E to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1. Since ErbB3 has a defective tyrosine kinase domain, the ability of T1E/YYDLL to induce ErbB3 phosphorylation was tested on 32D23 cells expressing both ErbB2 and ErbB3. The data show that T1E/YYDLL induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 to the same extent as NRG1β, whereas T1E was much less active. On ErbB4, T1E/YYDLL was as least as potent as NRG1β in inducing receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, again much more so than T1E. Thus, T1E/YYDLL is a pan-ErbB ligand that is capable of high affinity binding to all three receptors and a potent activator of ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4. We propose to designate this ligand panerbin, because it facilitates high affinity binding and activation of all three receptors. Homology Modeling of T1E/YYDLL in Complex with ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 Explains the Pan-ErbB Character—The availability of a ligand that binds ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 with high affinity allows a structural comparison of three different receptors in complex with the same ligand. In order to do so, homology models were constructed for the receptor-ligand complexes, based on the published crystal structure of the ErbB1-TGFα complex. Crystal structures of ErbB3 and ErbB4 are only available in the unliganded, autoinhibited conformation. A comparison showed that the L1 and L2 domains of ErbB3 and ErbB4 had similar conformations in the obtained homology models as in the crystal structures of the autoinhibited conformation (data not shown). When considering the amino acids in T1E/YYDLL that directly interact with residues in the receptor, only minor differences were observed between ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (see Fig. 1, colored residues). These differences mainly resulted from the lack of a hydrogen bridge or a salt bridge partner in the receptor. These results indicate that these three receptors bind T1E/YYDLL in a highly comparable manner, by providing similar positive constraints for binding. In order to understand the mechanisms whereby negative constraints in EGF-like growth factors induce ErbB specificity, we subsequently compared the existing crystal structures of EGF and TGFα in complex with ErbB1, with the homology models of T1E/YYDLL bound to ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4. We particularly focused on the receptor environment of the ligand residues Arg45, Glu26, and Ser2-Asp3, which are negative constraints for binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 but not to ErbB1. Fig. 5 (top) shows that in the ErbB1-EGF complex Arg45 of EGF comes within 4 Å of Ser418 of ErbB1, whereas the corresponding Tyr45 of T1E/YYDLL comes close to Ser418 of ErbB1, Lys415 of ErbB3, and Lys418 of ErbB4. This implies that when Arg45 is reintroduced into T1E/YYDLL, it would result in considerable charge repulsion with the lysines in ErbB3 and ErbB4 but not with the serine in ErbB1. This most likely explains why T1E is a high affinity ligand for ErbB1 but only a low affinity ligand for ErbB3 and ErbB4. In fact, Tyr45 in T1E/YYDLL may well contribute to hydrophobic interactions and thereby enhance the binding affinity for ErbB3 and ErbB4 as a positive constraint. From mutant studies, it is known tha"

Recently we determined structures of the smallpox virus topoisomerase bound to DNA in covalent and non-covalent DNA complexes using x-ray crystallography. Here we analyzed the effects of twenty-two amino acid substitutions on the topoisomerase activity in vitro in assays of DNA relaxation, single cycle cleavage, and equilibrium cleavage-religation. Alanine substitutions at 14 positions impaired topoisomerase function, marking a channel of functionally important contacts along the protein-DNA interface. Unexpectedly, alanine substitutions at two positions (D168A and E124A) accelerated the forward rate of cleavage. These findings and further analysis indicate that Asp168 is a key regulator of the active site that maintains an optimal balance among the DNA cleavage, religation, and product release steps. Finally, we report that high level expression of the D168A topoisomerase in Escherichia coli, but not other alanine-substituted enzymes, prevented cell growth. These findings help elucidate the amino acid side chains involved in DNA binding and catalysis and provide guidance for designing topoisomerase poisons for use as smallpox antivirals.

All poxviruses encode topoisomerases of the type IB family (1Gubser C. Hue S. Kellam P. Smith G.L. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 2Upton C. Slack S.

These enzymes release DNA supercoils via a mechanism involving a 3′-phosphotyrosine covalent protein-DNA intermediate (Fig. 1A). In this reaction, the topoisomerase first binds to DNA, then catalyzes nucleophilic attack of an enzyme tyrosine residue on one DNA strand, forming a 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage. This resulting DNA strand break allows rotation of the continuous DNA strand around the nick, thereby releasing supercoils (3Stivers J.T. Harris T.K. Mildvan A.

Nature. 2005; 434: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The reaction cycle is completed by religation, in which the hydroxyl group of the free DNA 5′-end at the nick attacks the phosphotyrosine linkage, rejoining the DNA, followed by product release (5Champoux J.J.

Topoisomerases are the targets of several classes of drugs that are important in anti-cancer and anti-microbial chemotherapy. These “topoisomerase poisons” act by trapping the covalent protein-DNA complex, thereby stabilizing toxic DNA breaks. Accumulation of DNA breaks then poisons cancer cells or infecting microbes. The poxvirus topoisomerases are thus attractive drug targets for poxvirus-specific topoisomerase poisons (7Harrison S.C. Alberts B. Ehrenfeld E. Enquist L. Fineberg H. Mc-Knight S.L. Moss B.

The N-terminal domain binds to DNA essentially as a rigid body, but the C-terminal catalytic domain undergoes a considerable structural reorganization upon binding (22Perry K. Hwang Y. Bushman F.D. Van Duyne G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Multiple protein side chains along the DNA interface make contacts that are positioned to stabilize the active conformation. Particularly notable is the formation of α-helix 5. This segment of the protein is disordered in the absence of DNA (23Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), but upon binding to the favored 5′-(T/C)CCTT-3′ site, forms an α-helix that inserts into the DNA major groove (22Perry K. Hwang Y. Bushman F.D. Van Duyne G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Amino acid side chains projecting from helix 5 make specific contacts to base pairs +3 to +6 (for numbering of the DNA base pairs in the recognition site see Fig. 1B). Formation of helix 5 allows nearby segments of the amino acid chain to bind DNA and deliver one of the catalytic residues (Arg130) to the vicinity of the scissile phosphate, thereby activating covalent chemistry. Other notable topoisomerase-DNA interactions involve: 1) β-strand 5, which inserts into the DNA major groove and makes sequence-specific interactions to base-pairs +2to +4, 2) Arg206, which makes an upstream contact to a base pair edge at +9, and 3) the active site residues (Arg130, Lys167, Arg223, His265, Tyr274), which make a network of contacts involving residue +1 and the scissile phosphate (22Perry K. Hwang Y. Bushman F.D. Van Duyne G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The topoisomerase/DNA complex structures, together with extensive previous work, have led to a detailed picture of the catalytic chemistry. The reaction is catalyzed by a combination of acid-base catalysis, in which the attacking nucleophile is deprotonated and the leaving group protonated, and electrostatic stabilization, in which the developing negative charge at the scissile phosphate is stabilized by basic side chains at the active site (Refs. 4Koster D.A.

A study of the topoisomerase enzyme of Leishmania bound to DNA and containing vanadate, a transition state analog, at the position of the scissile phosphate has yielded a view of the probable transition state (28Davies D.R. Mushtaq A. Interthal H. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), confirming and extending the models developed in the poxvirus and human topoisomerase systems. Here we present a study of amino acid side chains of the smallpox topoisomerase that were suggested by the structural analysis to have a functional role. We focused particularly on amino-acids at the protein-DNA interface that were not thoroughly studied in previous work in the vaccinia system. The effects of amino acid substitutions were analyzed in vitro in assays for full DNA relaxation or the individual steps in the topoisomerase reaction cycle. This work revealed a network of new contacts important for enzyme function, and unexpectedly also disclosed amino acid substitutions that increased the apparent rate of cleavage of suicide substrates in vitro. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced into the variola double cysteine mutant topoisomerase gene by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid pET29a double cysteine mutant VAR-TOPO was the template for the mutagenesis reaction. All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing method. Topoisomerase Expression and Purification—pET29-based plasmids containing mutant topoisomerase genes were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Codon-Plus RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were induced by adding IPTG. Double cysteine and mutant topoisomerases were purified from soluble bacterial lysates using SP-Sepharose column chromatography. The protein concentrations of the SP-Sepharose preparations were determined by using the dye binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. DNA Relaxation Assay—Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μg of pUC19 plasmid DNA and 4.6 ng of double cysteine or mutant topoisomerases (4-fold molar excess of plasmid molecules over topoisomerase molecules) were incubated at 25 °C for appropriate time. The reactions were stopped by the addition of a solution containing SDS (2% final concentration), glycerol, and bromphenol blue. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 1.0% horizontal agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA). The gels were stained in 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide solution and photographed. The density of bands was measured by scanning the photograph using a STORM Phospho-Imaging Analyzer. All assays in this study were repeated at least twice to estimate error. Forward Cleavage Assays—A 16-mer CCCTT-containing DNA oligonucleotide was 5′ end-labeled by enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to a complementary 18-mer bottom strand. Cleavage reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 8 pmol of 16-mer/18-mer DNA, and topoisomerase were incubated at 25 °C. Covalent complexes were denatured by addition of SDS to 2%. The samples were electrophoresed through a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. The extent of covalent adduct formation was quantitated by scanning the gel using a STORM PhosphoImaging Analyzer. A plot of the percent of input DNA cleaved versus time established end point values for cleavage. kobs was determined by fitting the data to the equation (100 - % cleaved product) = 100e-kt using the GraphPad PRISM version 4. Equilibrium Cleavage Assays—A 36-mer oligonucleotide containing CCCTT was 5′ end-labeled and annealed to a complementary 36-mer strand. Cleavage reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 pmol of 36-mer DNA duplex, and topoisomerase were incubated at 25 °C. Covalent complexes were denatured by the addition of SDS to 2%. The samples were electrophoresed through a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. The cleavage product, a 32P-labeled 12-mer covalently linked to topoisomerase, was well resolved from the input 36-mer substrate. The extent of strand cleavage was quantitated by scanning the gel with a STORM Phospho-Imaging Analyzer. Selection of Amino Acids for Analysis—The amino acid substitutions studied in this work are listed in Table 1. All mutants were generated in a gene encoding the smallpox virus topoisomerase that also contained the substitutions C100S and C211S (termed “CSCS” below). These substitutions were required for formation of diffraction quality crystals of the smallpox topoisomerase with DNA (22Perry K. Hwang Y. Bushman F.D. Van Duyne G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and so were included here to allow direct comparison with structural data. The C211S substitution diminished the activity of the enzyme slightly (Table 1), which had the advantage of slowing the reaction rates and simplifying some of the kinetic studies.TABLE 1Summary of the activities of topoisomerase mutantsName of mutantRelaxation (time to 50% conversion)Cleavage (kcl) (suicide substrate)Proportion of covalent complex formation (Kcl) (equilibrium substrate)Religation rate (krel) (calculated)min1/s(×10−2)1/s(×10−2)Wild type5 ± 117 ± 6C100S6 ± 017 ± 1C211S9 ± 11.8 ± 0.1C100S C211S10.4 ± 2.7aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).1.9 ± 1.00.13 ± 0.0114.61CSCS H39A12 ± 00.023 ± 0.0180.08 ± 0.010.29CSCS Q69A37 ± 5aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).0.029 ± 0.0230.02 ± 0.001.45CSCS R80A36 ± 40.087 ± 0.0620.04 ± 0.012.18CSCS E124A11.2 ± 5aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).9.7 ± 1.600.16 ± 0.1160.63CSCS E124Q6 ± 2aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).1.05 ± 0.070.06 ± 0.0117.50CSCS R130A>1440aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).0.0041Did not reach equilibriumCSCS R130M>1440CSCS K133A38 ± 6aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).0.113 ± 0.1090.02 ± 0.005.65CSCS K135A21 ± 10aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).1.40 ± 0.570.07 ± 0.0120.00CSCS K167A>1440aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).UndetectableDid not reach equilibriumCSCS K167M>1440CSCS D168A641 ± 59aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).24.7 ± 5.50.36 ± 0.0568.61CSCS R206A8 ± 0aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).0.044 ± 0.0120.05 ± 0.020.88CSCS Y209A9.6 ± 3.5aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).0.047 ± 0.0260.02 ± 0.002.35CSCS R223A>1440aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).UndetectableDid not reach equilibriumCSCS R223M>1440CSCS H265A325 ± 25aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).0.00086 ± 0.000410.350.0025CSCS T266A9 ± 10.079 ± 0.0640.08 ± 0.000.98CSCS Y274F>1440aIndicates previously tested (Ref. 22).UndetectableUndetectablea Indicates previously tested (Ref. 22Perry K.

Open table in a new tab The DNA-contacting residues (Fig. 1B) were typically substituted with alanine to allow the effects of selective truncation of the side chain to be studied. Residue His39 projects off the N-terminal domain and makes a contact to the T at position -1. Gln69 projects off β-5 of the N-terminal domain, and makes a sequence-specific contact to the major groove at position +2. Arg80 projects from α-helix 3, which connects the N- and C-terminal domains, and contacts the Thy at +1. Lys133 and Lys135 extend from helix 5 and make major groove contacts at positions +5 and +6. Arg206 makes the most upstream contact, extending to the +9 position. Tyr209 contacts +6 and Thr266 is positioned to contact -1 (though this part of the DNA is missing in the structures). The active site residues (Arg130, Lys167, Arg223, His265, and Tyr274) have all been studied previously in the vaccinia topoisomerase background (4Koster D.A. Croquette V. Dekker C. Shuman S.

Catalytic site residues Arg130, Lys167, and Arg223 were also substituted with methionine in order to maintain similar hydrophobic contacts along the length of the side chain, while selectively eliminating the charged functional group, a type of substitution not previously studied. The Tyr274 catalytic tyrosine was substituted with Phe to remove the hydroxyl group that serves as the nucleophile in the transesterification reaction mediating initial cleavage, a type of substitution also studied previously (16Wittschieben J. Petersen B.O. Shuman S. Nuc. Acids Res. 1998; 26: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Shuman S. Kane E.M. Morham S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9793-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Residue Asp168 was implicated as potentially important because it lies on the outer rim of the active site, positioned to interact with the 5′-hydroxyl group at the scissile phosphate, and well positioned to participate in the religation reaction. In the structures, the main chain NH of Asp168 contacts the DNA phosphate on the 3′-side of +2. The Asp168 side chain is available to contact the cleaved DNA strand in the vicinity of -1or -2, but this portion of the DNA is missing in the available structures so detailed interactions are uncertain. An initial study of a D168A topoisomerase derivative indicated that this side chain was important for DNA relaxation (22Perry K. Hwang Y. Bushman F.D. Van Duyne G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but did not specify the step involved. Residue Glu124 is an unusual buried acidic residue. The side chain is in a generally hydrophobic environment in the protein interior, but it does have the potential to exchange protons through a series of relays to the active site. Possibly the relay system involves an imidic acid tautomer of the peptide backbone (22Perry K. Hwang Y. Bushman F.D. Van Duyne G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Previous studies of the effects of E124A on DNA relaxation in the vaccinia (21Krogh B.O. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Topoisomerase derivatives containing each of these substitutions were analyzed for their effects on DNA relaxation, the forward rate of DNA cleavage, and the position of the equilibrium between cleavage and religation. In what follows, mutant derivatives are referred to as “CSCS” followed by specifying the substitution (e.g. CSCS D168A). Effects of Amino Acid Substitutions on DNA Relaxation—DNA relaxation was analyzed using supercoiled bacterial plasmids as substrates. Following incubation with topoisomerase protein, supercoiled and relaxed topoisomers were separated by electrophoresis and quantified. In these reactions, 0.13 pmol of topoisomerase were added to 0.57 pmol of plasmid, so that relaxation of the substrate required that each protein molecule carry out several cycles of DNA relaxation, product release, and rebinding to new DNAs. Sample reactions are shown in Fig. 2A for the CSCS reference enzyme and CSCS K167M. Results are quantified in Fig. 2B and summarized in Table 1. For some of the mutants, relaxation half-times have been previously reported (denoted by the asterisks in Table 1 and Ref. 22Perry K. Hwang Y. Bushman F.D. Van Duyne G. Mol.

Substitutions in the previously identified active site residues (R130A, K167A, R223A, H265A, and Y274F) severely impaired relaxation, paralleling previous studies in the vaccinia system (4Koster D.A.

The CSCS topoisomerase derivatives containing methionine substitutions R130M, K167M, and R223M were also severely reduced in activity, implicating the terminal basic charge of the side chain as important for catalysis, and arguing against the idea that creation of a cavity in the active site by the alanine substitution was the main deficit. CSCS D168A was also severely impaired. The CSCS E124A and CSCS E124Q substitutions both carried out relaxation with rates similar to the CSCS enzyme. Of the DNA contact residues, the Q69A, R80A, K133A, and K135A substitutions all showed notably longer half-times for DNA relaxation. Effects of Amino Acid Substitutions on Cleavage of Suicide Substrates—The forward rate of DNA cleavage (kcl) can be monitored in isolation using “suicide substrates” (Fig. 3A). In these reactions, formation of the phosphotyrosine intermediate generates a short oligonucleotide that is released after cleavage, trapping the covalent complex. Sample time course studies comparing the CSCS enzyme and CSCS D168A and CSCS R206A are shown in Fig. 3B. To analyze the forward rate of cleavage, it is important to carry out reactions in the presence of saturating enzyme, so titration reactions were carried out initially to identify saturating conditions (data not shown). Examples of quantitation of time course reactions are shown in Fig. 3, C and D, and rates are summarized in Table 1. Topoisomerase derivatives with substitutions in the N-terminal domain and connecting α-three helix (H39A, Q69A, and R80A) were reduced in rate 10-100-fold. Some of the catalytic domain contact residues were also strongly affected (CSCS with K133A, R206A, Y209A, and T266A), while CSCS K135A was nearly equal to CSCS. All of the catalytic site residues (CSCS with R130A K167A, R223A, H265A, and Y274F) were severely reduced in activity as expected from previous work. Residue Arg206 was the only side chain contacting position +9 in the structure, allowing the basis of sequence specific recognition at this DNA position to be studied in more detail (Fig. 3D and Table 2). We found that substituting the +9 Gua residue with each of the other three bases reduced the forward rate of cleavage by the CSCS enzyme about 10-50-fold, indicating that this DNA position is recognized in a sequence specific fashion by the topoisomerase. When the Arg206 side chain was truncated by alanine substitution, the reaction rate with the standard DNA substrate was reduced about 50-fold. Thus disrupting the +9 contact with either a DNA mutation or the R206A side chain truncation had quantitatively similar effects. However, when the CSCS R206A enzyme was tested on DNA substrates with substitutions at +9, no further reduction in rate was observed. Changes at +10 or +8 had little or no effect on the CSCS enzyme (<3-fold), and CSCS R206A was similarly unaffected. Both the CSCS topoisomerase and CSCS R206A were strongly reduced in activity by an Ade substitution at position +2 within the 5′-CCCTT-3′ pentamer. This indicates that truncating the Arg206 side chain resulted in a loss of ability to discriminate the base pair at position +9, but this was not a general loss of discrimination because CSCS R206A responded similarly to the CSCS topoisomerase to changes at positions +10, +8, and +2. Thus the functional analysis indicates that the Arg206 contact is the basis of sequence discrimination at position +9.TABLE 2Loss of discrimination at position +9 with the R206A substitutionSubstrateRateVAR-TOPO CSCSVAR-TOPO CSCS R206A1/S × 10−2WT1.93 ± 1.00 (100%)0.044 ± 0.012 (2.3%)+10 SubstitutionsG0.52 ± 0.19 (26.9%)0.026 ± 0.013 (1.4%)+9 SubstitutionsA0.22 ± 0.07 (11.4%)0.047 ± 0.020 (2.4%)T0.17 ± 0.04 (8.8%)0.082 ± 0.042 (4.2%)C0.04 ± 0.01 (2.1%)0.046 ± 0.004 (2.4%)+8 SubstitutionsG1.20 ± 0.14 (62.2%)0.055 ± 0.0042 (2.8%)+2 SubstitutionA0.013 ± 0.003 (0.67%)<10−5 Open table in a new tab Surprisingly, alanine substitutions at both Glu124 and Asp168 substantially increased the measured kcl, a mutant phenotype not previously reported despite the wealth of mutagenesis studies for the related vaccinia enzyme. For CSCS D168A, the apparent forward rate of cleavage was increased by more than 10-fold. The E124A substitution increased the forward cleavage rate 5-fold. Curiously, the E124Q substitution slightly slowed the cleavage rate. We discuss the possible explanations for these observations below. Effects of Mutants Assayed on Equilibrium Cleavage Substrates—The position of the equilibrium defined by the rates of covalent complex formation and religation (kcl) can be measured on equilibrium oligonucleotide substrates. These substrates contain the 5′-CCCTT-3′ core pentamer in the center of a 36-mer oligonucleotide. After transesterification to form the 3′-phosphotyrosine intermediate, all the strands remain annealed because of the longer DNA lengths (Fig. 4A). This is in contrast to the suicide substrate, where the free portion of the cleaved strand is released (Fig. 3A). Consequently, in the equilibrium substrate, the 5′-hydroxyl of the cleaved strand is available for religation. The cleavage and religation reactions are quite fast on these substrates, achieving equilibrium in most cases within 4 s (data not shown). Thus the fraction of the DNA in the covalent complex at times >4 s reports the position of the cleavage-religation equilibrium. In addition, the religation rates (krel) can be calculated from the measured forward rates of cleavage (kcl) and the position of the cleavage religation equilibrium (Kcl) using the relationship Kcl = kcl/krel. These values are shown in the right column in Table 1. The amounts of enzym"
