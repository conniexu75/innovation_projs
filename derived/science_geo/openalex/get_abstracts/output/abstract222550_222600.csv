https://openalex.org/W2097705657,"Inhibition of γ-secretase, one of the enzymes responsible for the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce the pathogenic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, is an attractive approach to the treatment of Alzheimer disease. In addition to APP, however, several other γ-secretase substrates have been identified (e.g. Notch), and altered processing of these substrates by γ-secretase inhibitors could lead to unintended biological consequences. To study the in vivo consequences of γ-secretase inhibition, the γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411,575 was administered to C57BL/6 and TgCRND8 APP transgenic mice for 15 days. Although most tissues were unaffected, doses of LY-411,575 that inhibited Aβ production had marked effects on lymphocyte development and on the intestine. LY-411,575 decreased overall thymic cellularity and impaired intrathymic differentiation at the CD4-CD8-CD44+CD25+ precursor stage. No effects on peripheral T cell populations were noted following LY-411,575 treatment, but evidence for the altered maturation of peripheral B cells was observed. In the intestine, LY-411,575 treatment increased goblet cell number and drastically altered tissue morphology. These effects of LY-411,575 were not seen in mice that were administered LY-D, a diastereoisomer of LY-411,575, which is a very weak γ-secretase inhibitor. These studies show that inhibition of γ-secretase has the expected benefit of reducing Aβ in a murine model of Alzheimer disease but has potentially undesirable biological effects as well, most likely because of the inhibition of Notch processing.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; APP, amyloid precursor protein; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; DN, double negative; Aβ, β-amyloid peptide; LY-D, inactive diastereoisomer of LY-411,575. is the third most common cause of death and the leading cause of dementia in the United States (1Ewbank D.C. Am. J. Public Health. 1999; 89: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the exact cause of AD is still unknown, the etiology of the disease is almost certainly linked to several neuropathological hallmarks observed in the brains of AD victims, particularly extracellular neuritic amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (2Arnold S.E. Hyman B.T. Flory J. Damasio A.R. Van Hoesen G.W. Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 3Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R. Berthelette P. Blackwell C.

Aging. 1995; 16: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Although both of these neuropathological lesions probably contribute to progressive neuronal cell death in AD, the proximal lesion appears to be the amyloid plaques and their principal component, the Aβ peptides. A large body of evidence strongly suggests that overproduction, aggregation, and/or plaque deposition of the Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ42, are central to the pathogenesis of AD (reviewed in Ref. 5Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11018) Google Scholar). In fact, two recent studies of patients immunized against the Aβ42 peptide have provided the first preliminary clinical evidence that Aβ does indeed contribute to the cognitive decline in AD patients (6Nicoll J.A.

Neuron. 2003; 38: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The Aβ peptides are produced by the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretase. γ-Secretase is a complex composed of at least four proteins, namely presenilins (presenilin 1 or -2), nicastrin, PEN-2, and APH-1 (8De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Presenilin 1 and -2 have been proposed to be the novel aspartyl proteases responsible for the catalytic activity of γ-secretase (9Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Because of the essential role of γ-secretase in the generation of Aβ peptides, γ-secretase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of AD. To date, several γ-secretase inhibitors have been identified that lower Aβ production in intact cells and cell-free systems (reviewed in Ref. 11Josien H. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2002; 5: 513-525PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two potent γ-secretase inhibitors, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine tert-butyl ester (DAPT) and LY-411,575, have also been shown to decrease Aβ production after administration to transgenic mice overexpressing human APP (12Dovey H.F.

Other proteins that have been shown to be substrates for γ-secretase cleavage include Notch (16De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V.

Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The cleavage of Notch by γ-secretase has been studied most extensively. Notch plays an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating cell growth and lineage specification particularly during embryonic development (21Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 22Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J.

Notch is activated by several ligands (Delta, Jagged, and Serrate) and is then proteolytically processed by a series of ligand-dependent and -independent cleavages. γ-Secretase catalyzes the terminal cleavage event (S3 cleavage), which releases a fragment known as the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD fragment then translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a nuclear transcription factor (15Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 24Struhl G. Adachi A. Cell. 1998; 93: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). As expected from its role in Notch S3 cleavage, γ-secretase inhibitors have been shown to block NICD production in vitro (25Lewis H.D. Perez Revuelta B.I. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Harrison T. Pollack S.J. Shearman M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7580-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In vivo, Notch function appears to be critical for the proper differentiation of T and B lymphocytes (reviewed in Ref. 26Allman D. Punt J.A. Izon D.J. Aster J.C. Pear W.S. Cell. 2002; 109: S1-S11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and γ-secretase inhibitors reduce the thymocyte number and block thymocyte differentiation at an early stage in fetal thymic organ cultures (27Hadland B.K. Manley N.R. Su D. Longmore G.D. Moore C.L. Wolfe M.S. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7481-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 28Doerfler P. Shearman M.S. Perlmutter R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9312-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These data suggest that in addition to their potential therapeutic benefit in AD, γ-secretase inhibitors may have liabilities because of inhibition of the proteolytic processing of Notch (and other signaling molecules) that are critical for a variety of cellular functions. Despite data clearly suggesting both the potential benefits and the liabilities of γ-secretase inhibition, there are no published reports identifying the in vivo biological consequences of γ-secretase inhibitors apart from the inhibition of APP processing and Aβ production. Such data are necessary to fully assess the strengths and liabilities of γ-secretase inhibition as an approach to the treatment of AD. In this study, chronic treatment of mice with the potent γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411,575 (13May P.C. Altstiel L. Bender M.H. Boggs L.N. Calligaro D.O. Fuson K.S. Gitter B.D. Hyslop P.A. Jordan W.H.

A structurally related analogue that is a weak γ-secretase inhibitor was used to distinguish effects of LY-411,575 that are due to γ-secretase inhibition from the nonspecific effects of the compound. Animals and Dosing—LY-411,575 and a diastereoisomer hereafter referred to as LY-D (see Fig. 1) were synthesized according to Wu et al. (29Wu J. Tung J.S. Thorsett E.D. Pleiss M.A. Nissen J.S. Neitz J. Latimer L.H. John V. Freedman S. Patent Application WO-09828268. 1998; Google Scholar). During synthesis, racemic 5-amino-7-methyl-5,7-dihydro-6H-dibenz[b,d]azepin-6-one was coupled with tert-butoxycarbonyl-alanine, and the two diastereoisomers were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Each diastereoisomer was then deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid and subsequently condensed with the appropriate chiral 3,5-difluoromandelic acid to provide the expected products (see Fig. 1). The structures of LY-411,575 and LY-D were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both compounds were formulated as 10 mg/ml solutions in 50% polyethylene glycol, 30% propylene glycol, 10% ethanol and diluted in 0.4% methylcellulose for dosing. TgCRND8 mice overexpress human APP with both the Swedish and Indiana familial AD mutations under the control of the Syrian hamster prion promoter (30Chishti M.A. Yang D.S. Janus C. Phinney A.L.

TgCRND8 mice on a C57BL/6 × C3H/He mixed genetic background were weaned, genotyped, and single-housed by the age of 4-5 weeks. Six-week-old female TgCRND8 or male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were dosed orally once/day for 5 or 15 days with 0.4% methylcellulose vehicle, 1-10 mg/kg LY-411,575, or 1-10 mg/kg LY-D. At the end of the dosing period, mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, total blood was collected from the posterior vena cava in EDTA Microtainer® tubes (BD Biosciences), and plasma was isolated. Cortices were surgically isolated from 1 hemibrain/mouse. Each cortex was homogenized in sucrose, extracted with guanidine, and sonicated (31Sawamura N. Morishima-Kawashima M. Waki H Kobayashi K. Kuramochi T. Frosch M.P. Ding K. Ito M. Kim T.W. Tanzi R.E. Oyama F. Tabira T. Ando S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27901-27908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). All in vivo studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Schering-Plough Research Institute. Cell Lines—HEK293 cells expressing human APP carrying both the Swedish and London mutations have been described previously (32Zhang L. Song L. Terracina G. Liu Y. Pramanik B. Parker E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5049-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Human Notch1 was cloned from human fetal brain cDNA (Clontech), and a truncated Notch1 construct lacking the extracellular EGF repeat domain was prepared (referred to as NΔE) (15Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). NΔE was also stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Assays for Aβ and NICD—Procedures for measuring γ-secretase activity in membranes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing APP have been described previously (32Zhang L. Song L. Terracina G. Liu Y. Pramanik B. Parker E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5049-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Intact HEK293 cells expressing either APP or NΔE were treated with various concentrations of LY-411,575 or LY-D for 4 h at 37 °C. In the case of cells expressing NΔE, cells were lysed, the cell lysates were separated on a 4-12% NuPAGE gel, and the processed NICD fragment was detected via Western blot with a cleavage site-specific antibody. The inhibition of NICD production was quantified by spot densitometric analysis using FluorChem (Alpha Innotech Corp.). In the case of cells expressing APP, the conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and stored at -20 °C prior to the determination of Aβ levels. Aβ40 and -42 produced in HEK293 membrane- and cell-based assays, as well as plasma Aβ40 and cortex Aβ40 from TgCRND8 mice, were analyzed without pretreatment using an electrochemiluminescence detection-based immunoassay (32Zhang L. Song L. Terracina G. Liu Y. Pramanik B. Parker E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5049-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Plasma Aβ42 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (33Zhang L. Song L. Parker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8966-8972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BioSource International) was used to measure cortex Aβ42 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flow Cytometry—Single cell suspensions from the thymus and spleen were prepared from individual tissues in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) by passage through a 100-μm nylon cell strainer (Falcon-BD Biosciences). Peripheral blood was collected as described above, and erythrocytes were lysed (erythrocyte lysis buffer, Sigma). Cells from the thymus, spleen, or blood were enumerated by trypan blue exclusion and then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark with 5 μg/ml Fc block (Pharmingen) and 300 μg/ml purified mouse IgG in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide to minimize nonspecific antibody binding. Fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to the following mouse surface markers were then added, and the incubation was continued for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark: CD4 (GK1.5), CD8α (53-6.7), CD44 (IM7), CD25 (PC61), CD3 (145-2C11), αβ-TcR (H57-597), γδ-TcR (GL3), B220 (RA3-6B2), and IgM (R6-60.2) (all obtained from Pharmingen). Matched fluorochrome-conjugated isotype control antibodies were used to determine nonspecific binding. To determine viability, samples were stained subsequently with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Calbiochem). Events were acquired on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Stanford University). The number of cells of each phenotype was determined by multiplying the percentage of cells in the population by the total number of thymus or spleen cells, as appropriate. Histology—At the end of the dosing period the brain, thymus, spleen, liver, kidney, heart, stomach, adrenal glands, small intestine, large intestine, and lungs were collected in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopic examination. In addition, small and large intestine were stained with periodic acid-Schiff stain to highlight mucin-containing goblet cells. Comprehensive bone marrow smear cytologic examinations were also performed. LY-411,575 Is a Potent γ-Secretase Inhibitor in Vitro and in Vivo—As reported previously (13May P.C. Altstiel L. Bender M.H. Boggs L.N. Calligaro D.O. Fuson K.S. Gitter B.D. Hyslop P.A. Jordan W.H. Li W.Y. Mabry T.E. Mark R.J. Ni B. Nissen J.S. Porter W.J. Sorgen S.G. Su Y. Audia J.E. Dovey H.F. Games D. John V. Freedman S.B. Guido T. Johnson-Wood K.L. Khan K. Latimer L.H. Lieberburg I.M. Seubert P.A. Soriano F. Thorsett E.D. Schenk D.B. Abstracts of the Society for Neuroscience 31st Annual Meeting, San Diego, CA, November 10-15, 2001. 2001; : 681Google Scholar), LY-411,575 is a very potent γ-secretase inhibitor in vitro as assessed by inhibition of Aβ production (IC50, 0.078 and 0.082 nm in membrane- and cell-based γ-secretase assays, respectively (Fig. 1)). LY-411,575 is also a potent inhibitor of Notch S3 cleavage (Fig. 1, IC50, 0.39 nm). A diastereoisomer of LY-411,575, LY-D, was also synthesized (Fig. 1). Depending on the assay, LY-D is 180-2000-fold less potent than LY-411,575 as an inhibitor of γ-secretase (Fig. 1). In vivo studies demonstrated that both 1 and 10 mg/kg oral doses of LY-411,575 decreased brain and plasma Aβ40 and -42 robustly when chronically administered to TgCRND8 mice (Fig. 2). In contrast, the administration of the less active diastereoisomer LY-D to TgCRND8 mice had no effect on Aβ levels in either the brain or plasma (Fig. 2). The different in vivo activities of LY-411,575 and LY-D are not because of different pharmacokinetic properties, because the two compounds achieved similar plasma levels after oral administration (data not shown). These in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that LY-411,575 and LY-D are excellent tools to distinguish the mechanism-based effects of γ-secretase inhibition from the compound-related effects that are not due to γ-secretase inhibition. The time course of the effects of LY-411,575 on plasma and brain Aβ40 levels is shown in Fig. 3. A single oral dose of 10 mg/kg LY-411,575 rapidly decreased plasma Aβ40 with the maximal effect being observed by 1 h after administration (Fig. 3A). The reduction of plasma Aβ was still evident 24 h after the administration of LY-411,575 but returned to base-line levels by 48 h after administration (Fig. 3A). LY-411,575 also substantially decreased guanidine-soluble brain Aβ levels, although the maximal effect was less pronounced, the time required to reach the maximal effect was longer, and the duration of the effect was longer than that seen for reduction of plasma Aβ (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that dosing of LY-411,575 once/day is sufficient to maintain continual inhibition of γ-secretase. General in Vivo Effects of Chronic γ-Secretase Inhibition—LY-411,575 and LY-D (1 and 10 mg/kg) were administered to TgCRND8 mice once/day for either 5 or 15 consecutive days. In other experiments, LY-411,575 (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) was administered to C57BL/6 mice once/day for 15 consecutive days. Similar results were observed in all three experiments. Unless indicated otherwise, therefore, data are presented only for the experiment in which LY-411,575 and LY-D were administered to TgCRND8 mice for 15 days. Mice receiving 10 mg/kg LY-411,575 for 15 days lost weight (-2 g) compared with mice treated with vehicle (+1.4 g), 1 mg/kg LY-411,575 (+1.4 g), 1 mg/kg LY-D (+2 g), or 10 mg/kg LY-D (+1.5 g). In addition, 20% of the mice dosed with 1 mg/kg LY-411,575 and 40% of the mice dosed with 10 mg/kg LY-411,575 died by day 15 of dosing. In contrast, there was no mortality for mice dosed with vehicle or with either dose of LY-D. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that neither LY-411,575 nor LY-D had any effect on the majority of the tissues examined, including the brain, liver, kidney, lungs, heart, adrenal glands, and stomach. Bone marrow smears also revealed no abnormalities (data not shown). In contrast, effects of LY-411,575 were observed in the thymus, spleen, and intestine. These observations are discussed individually below. Chronic γ-Secretase Inhibition Alters Lymphocyte Development—Chronic treatment of TgCRND8 mice with LY-411,575 induced a marked atrophy of the cortical zone of the thymus (Fig. 4, compare A with B). This effect was dose-dependent and was consistent with the dose-dependent reduction in the absolute thymocyte cell number caused by LY-411,575 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, LY-D had no effect on thymus histology (Fig. 4, compare A with C) or the absolute number of thymocytes (Fig. 5A). Flow cytometric analysis of intrathymic populations revealed that the number and proportion of thymocytes defined by CD4/CD8 expression was altered by treatment with LY-411,575 but not by treatment with LY-D. Consistent with the overall decrease in thymocyte number (Fig. 5A), the absolute number of CD4+CD8+ double positive, CD4-CD8- double negative (DN), CD4+ single positive, and CD8+ single positive cells also decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). However, the proportion of DN and single positive cells increased, whereas the proportion of double positive cells decreased (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5Effect of LY-411,575 treatment on intrathymic populations. LY-411,575 (1 and 10 mg/kg), LY-D (1 and 10 mg/kg), or vehicle were orally administered once/day to TgCRND8 mice for 15 consecutive days, and various thymocyte populations were analyzed by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the total number of cells in the thymus. B, the absolute number of cells in each of the four major populations defined by CD4 and -8. The inset illustrates the CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) population on a separate scale. C, the percentage of total thymocytes in each of the four major populations defined by CD4 and -8. The inset depicts the CD4+CD8+ double positive population on a separate scale.

(5-6 mice/group) and were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 all as compared with vehicle-treated animals). SP, single positive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A detailed examination of the DN cell population demonstrated that LY-411,575 administration increased the relative percentage of the CD44+CD25- and CD44+CD25+ DN thymocytes while causing a commensurate decrease in the proportion of CD44-CD25+ and CD44-CD25- DN thymocytes (Fig. 5D) indicating a block at a very early stage of intrathymic T cell development. Once again, these effects were not observed in LY-D-treated animals (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, no differences in CD44 mean fluorescence intensity were observed across treatment groups implying that processing of this putative γ-secretase substrate was unaffected by LY-411,575 treatment. The percentage of thymocytes expressing intermediate or high levels of CD3/αβ-TcR was significantly reduced in accord with the inhibition of CD4/CD8 populations, although no consistent alterations in the percentage or number of γδ-TcR cells were noted. A slight increase in the proportion of thymic B220+ B cells was observed in LY-411,575-treated animals, although this did not reach statistical significance (data not shown). The effect of LY-411,575 treatment on peripheral leukocyte compartments was also examined. In contrast to the observations made in the thymus, neither LY-411,575 nor LY-D treatment significantly altered T cell populations in the peripheral blood or spleen (data not shown). However, LY-411,575 administration did cause a statistically significant elevation in the percentage and number of immature surface IgM- B220+ B cells and a corresponding reduction in the percentage and number of mature surface IgM+ B220+ B cells in the spleen (Fig. 6). These observations suggest that LY-411,575 treatment results in a developmental blockade of splenic B cell differentiation. Modest elevations in the number of immature B cells were observed in the blood as well. No remarkable findings on bone marrow cytology, myeloid populations in the blood, or complete blood count analysis were noted (data not shown). Chronic γ-Secretase Inhibition Increases Goblet Cell Number and Drastically Changes Tissue Architecture in the Gastrointestinal Tract—Treatment of TgCRND8 mice with 10 mg/kg LY-411,575 produced profound changes in the gastrointestinal tract. At this dose, LY-411,575 caused a significant increase in the number of mucin-containing goblet cells throughout the small and large intestine and an increased accumulation of mucin secreted into the intestinal lumen (Fig. 7, B, E, and H). In one mouse that was sacrificed in a moribund condition, LY-411,575 treatment (10 mg/kg) also caused epithelial erosion with underlying infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (Fig. 7B, circled areas), the accumulation of necrotic cell debris, and dilation of crypts (Fig. 7B, arrowheads). In contrast, chronic treatment of TgCRND8 mice with 1 mg/kg LY-411,575 or with either dose of LY-D had no effect on the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 7, C and F). Several recent reports (12Dovey H.F.

An important regulator of energy supply and demand in eukaryotic cells is the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The rate of peptide chain elongation can be modulated through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 2, which inhibits its activity and is catalyzed by a specific calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase termed eEF2 kinase. Here we show that AMPK directly phosphorylates eEF2 kinase, and we identify the major site of phosphorylation as Ser-398 in a regulatory domain of eEF2 kinase. AMPK also phosphorylates two other sites (Ser-78 and Ser-366) in eEF2 kinase in vitro. We develop appropriate phosphospecific antisera and show that phosphorylation of Ser-398 in eEF2 kinase is enhanced in intact cells under a range of conditions that activate AMPK and increase the phosphorylation of eEF2. Ser-78 and Ser-366 do not appear to be phosphorylated by AMPK within cells. Although cardiomyocytes appear to contain a distinct isoform of eEF2 kinase, it also contains a site corresponding to Ser-398 that is phosphorylated by AMPK in vitro. Stimuli that activate AMPK and increase eEF2 phosphorylation within cells increase the activity of eEF2 kinase. Thus, AMPK and eEF2 kinase may provide a key link between cellular energy status and the inhibition of protein synthesis, a major consumer of metabolic energy.

Thus, AMPK and eEF2 kinase may provide a key link between cellular energy status and the inhibition of protein synthesis, a major consumer of metabolic energy. Protein synthesis is a process of fundamental importance for all living cells. It also places substantial demands on the cell in terms of requirements for precursors, viz. amino acids and metabolic energy. Recent work (1Proud C.G. Eur. J.

Protein synthesis is a major consumer of cellular energy with estimates of 30–50% of total energy being used in this process. The vast majority of this is consumed by peptide elongation, either directly as GTP (two are hydrolyzed for each amino acid added) or indirectly during aminoacyl-tRNA charging, one ATP being hydrolyzed to AMP for each amino acid charging event. Despite this, little is known of the mechanisms by which cells couple the rate of protein synthesis to the availability of energy, i.e. ATP. In mammalian cells, peptide chain elongation requires two main elongation factors, eEF1A and eEF2. The latter mediates the translocation step of elongation in which the ribosome moves by the equivalent of one codon relative to the mRNA, and the peptidyl-tRNA shifts from the A- into the P-site on the ribosome (4Merrick W.C. Nyborg J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 59-125Google Scholar). eEF2 is a phosphoprotein, and phosphorylation at a single site, Thr-56, renders it unable to bind ribosomes, thereby inactivating it (5Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 6Carlberg U. Nilsson A. Nygård O. Eur. J.

Phosphorylation is catalyzed by a specific and very unusual kinase, eEF2 kinase (8Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17299-17303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ryazanov A.G. Ward M.D. Mendola C.E. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Wiedmann M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Parmer T.G. Prostko C.R. Germino F.J. Hait W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eEF2 is decreased by insulin and certain other stimuli through signaling events that require the mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR (reviewed in Ref. 7Browne G.J. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5360-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and involves inactivation of eEF2 kinase. One link in the regulation of eEF2 kinase by mTOR is the phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase by the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase, S6K1. S6K1 is regulated through mTOR and phosphorylates eEF2 kinase at Ser-366, which decreases its activity at low Ca2+ concentrations (10Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). We recently observed that, in cardiomyocytes and other cell types, conditions that cause depletion of ATP lead to increased phosphorylation of eEF2 (11Horman S. Browne G.J. Krause U. Patel J.V.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is associated with inhibition of protein synthesis and increased activity of eEF2 kinase (11Horman S. Browne G.J. Krause U. Patel J.V. Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Lavoinne A. Hue L. Proud C.G. Rider M.H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1419-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Furthermore, eEF2 phosphorylation is also increased following treatment of cells with a compound that activates the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK (5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR)). Yan et al. (13Yan L. Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. Brady M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18177-18183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown recently that AICAR increases the phosphorylation of eEF2 in pancreatic islets or β-cell lines. AMPK is a key player in cellular energy homeostasis (14Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 15Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar); depletion of ATP leads to a rise in AMP levels (through the action of adenylate kinase), which activates AMPK. AMPK is known to phosphorylate a range of target proteins to decrease energy consumption and increase energy supply. In this report, we show that AMPK directly phosphorylates eEF2 kinase, and we identify the major site where this occurs as Ser-398. We show that phosphorylation of Ser-398 is enhanced by treating cells with agents that deplete cellular ATP levels and/or activate AMPK. We also show that these effects are not exerted through impairment of mTOR signaling, which has been reported to occur when ATP levels are severely depleted (16Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Finally, we show that agents or treatments that activate AMPK and increase eEF2 phosphorylation also increase the phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase at Ser-398 and stimulate its activity. These data provide important new insights into the ways in which cells coordinate the rate of protein synthesis, a major consumer of energy, with the metabolic status of the cell. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP and materials for protein purification were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled ATP was from Roche Applied Science; cell culture media were from Invitrogen; microcystin LR and rapamycin from Calbiochem, and Immobilon P membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, UK). Other chemicals were of the highest purity available and were purchased from Merck or Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP and ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free) was from Roche Applied Science. The AMARA peptide was a gift from Professor D. G. Hardie, University of Dundee. AICAR was obtained from Sigma (this product has now been discontinued) or Toronto Research Chemicals. Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Merck. Antisera—Antibodies for eEF2 kinase phosphorylated at Ser-359, Ser-366, Ser-377, and Ser-396 have been described previously (17Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 18Knebel A. Haydon C.E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. Jane Leitch, Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, University of Dundee. Antibodies to the α1 and α2 subunits of AMPK and to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylated at Ser-79 were kindly provided by Professor D. G. Hardie, University of Dundee. Antisera for eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, S6K1, eEF2 phosphorylated at Thr-56, eEF2 and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylated at Ser-235 were as described previously (19Beugnet A. Tee A.R. Taylor P.M. Proud C.G. . 2002; 372: 555-566Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-sheep IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, both conjugated to peroxidase, were obtained from Perbio Science Ltd. (Tattenhall, UK). Antisera for the Ser-78- and Ser-398-phosphorylated forms of eEF2 kinase were raised in rabbits using the peptides GSPANpSFHFKEC and LPSSPpSSATPHC (where pS indicates phosphoserine), respectively. Peptides were synthesized by Dr. Graham Bloomberg (University of Bristol, UK), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into rabbits at Diagnostics Scotland (Edinburgh, UK). Antibodies were affinity-purified on phosphopeptide antigen-Sepharose columns and were used at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in the presence of 10 μg/ml of the unphosphorylated peptide antigen. Antibodies against total eEF2 kinase were raised against bacterially expressed GST-eEF2 kinase in rabbits at Diagnostics Scotland (Edinburgh, UK) and then affinity-purified on maltose-binding protein-eEF2 kinase-Sepharose to eliminate anti-GST antibodies. Pre-immune IgG was purified from serum from the pre-immune bleed of the rabbit used to raise the anti-Ser(P)-398 eEF2 kinase antibody using protein G-Sepharose. Isolation, Culture, Treatment and Lysis of Cells—Adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (ARVC) were isolated and cultured overnight exactly as described (20Wang L. Wang X. Proud C.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1056-H1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KB cells (human oral epidermoid carcinoma cells) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. When they had reached 60% confluence, KB cells were placed in low glucose medium before the experiment (see legends for details). The medium used for the ARVC (M199 medium) contains a low concentration of glucose (5.6 mm) so no change of medium was necessary. Cells were then treated with AICAR, CCCP, 2-deoxyglucose, or rapamycin at the final concentrations, and for the times indicated in the figures. Control cells received an appropriate dose of the relevant vehicle. For Western blot analyzes, cells were extracted into buffer consisting of 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5; 1 mm EGTA; 1 mm EDTA; 1% (v/v) Triton X-100; 1 mm Na3VO4; 100 nm microcystin-LR; 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol; protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin and antipain, each 1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (200 μm). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm to remove debris. Protein concentrations in the resulting supernatants were determined as described (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 77: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, supernatants were removed to fresh tubes and then rotated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of protein G-Sepharose pre-bound with anti-FLAG or anti-total eEF2 kinase antibody. Immune complexes were washed three times with extraction buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer or in eEF2 kinase assay buffer. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and Western (immuno) blotting were performed as described earlier (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 77: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. AMP-activated Protein Kinase Assay—To determine the activity of AMPK from KB cell lysates, the AMPK was immunoprecipitated using 10 μl of antibody-coupled beads (0.2 μg of anti-α1/α2 AMPK per μl of protein G-Sepharose beads) from 100 μg of lysate protein. Immune complexes were then washed three times with lysis buffer and once with AMPK assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; 0.02% (w/v) Brij-35; 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) and then incubated with AMPK assay buffer plus 200 μm ATP (1000 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP) and 15 nm MgCl2 plus 200 μm AMARA substrate peptide (AMARAASAAALARRR). After 10 min, the reactions were terminated by spotting 0.02-ml aliquots onto 2 × 2 cm squares of Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper, followed by immersion in 75 mm phosphoric acid. After washing four times with 75 mm phosphoric acid and then once with acetone, the papers were dried and analyzed by Èerenkov counting. One unit of kinase activity is the amount of enzyme that phosphorylates 1 nmol of peptide in 1 min. Phosphorylation of eEF2 Kinase by AMPK and Protein Chemical Analyses—The AMPK used was an extensively purified preparation (5 units/ml) from rat liver, purified through five steps as far as the gel filtration column, and was kindly provided by Professor D. G. Hardie, University of Dundee (22Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This material was then further immunopurified as indicated using antibodies raised against the α1 and α2 catalytic subunits of AMPK coupled to protein G-Sepharose and used to phosphorylate GST-eEF2 kinase as described below. Phosphorylation of bacterially expressed GST-eEF2 kinase (1 μg of fusion protein per reaction) was carried out using 5 milliunits of immunopurified AMPK in AMPK assay buffer plus 200 μm ATP (1000 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP), where indicated, 200 μm AMP (where indicated), and 15 nm MgCl2. For eEF2 kinase autophosphorylation reactions, the immunopurified AMPK and AMP were omitted from the reaction, and 0.5 μg/ml calmodulin plus 1 mm CaCl2 was added to the reaction mixture. Incubations were at 30 °C for 15 min and were stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heating to 96 °C for 5 min. Incorporation of phosphate into GST-eEF2 kinase was determined following electrophoresis of samples on an SDS-PAGE gel by autoradiography or following Western transfer to Immobilon-P membrane by immunoblotting using phosphorylated residue-specific antibodies. To map the sites on eEF2 kinase phosphorylated by AMPK, GST-eEF2 kinase was incubated with immunopurified AMPK as described above except that the reaction was performed for 60 min and a 10-fold higher specific radioactivity of [γ-32P]ATP was used. Reactions were terminated by adding 1% (w/v) SDS and 1% mm β-mercaptoethanol and heating at 100 °C for 1 min. The sample was subjected to electrophoresis on an SDS-PAGE gel, and the 32P-labeled band corresponding to GST-eEF2 kinase was excised and cut into smaller pieces. For analysis of polypeptides resolved on SDS-PAGE, fragments of gel chip were washed sequentially for 15 min on a vibrating platform with 1 ml of the following: water, a 1:1 mixture of water and CH3CN; 0.1 m NH4HCO3, a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m NH4HCO3 and CH3CN; and finally CH3CN. The gel pieces were dried by rotary evaporation and incubated in 0.3 ml of 50 mm NH4HCO3, 0.05% (w/v) Zwittergent 3-16 containing 2 μg of alkylated trypsin. After 16 h the supernatant was removed; the gel pieces were washed for 10 min in a further 0.3 ml of 50 mm NH4HCO3, 0.05% (w/v) Zwittergent 3-16, and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid; the combined supernatants containing >90% of the 32P-radioactivity were then analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The tryptic peptides contained in peaks P1 and P2 were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry on a PerSeptive Biosystems Elite-STR mass spectrometer using α-cyanocinnamic acid as the matrix. Spectra were obtained in both the linear and reflector mode. The mass spectrum was acquired and was internally mass-calibrated. The tryptic peptide ions obtained were scanned against the SwissProt and Genpep data bases using the MS-FIT program of Protein Prospector. The sequence of these peptides was also confirmed by solid-phase Edman sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 476A sequenator. Tryptic peptide P2 was subjected to additional Asp-N cleavage prior to Edman sequencing. The site of phosphorylation was determined by solid-phase Edman degradation of the peptide coupled to Sequelon-AA membrane (Milligen) as described previously (23Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis was used to confirm the type of residue phosphorylated in each tryptic peptide. Two-dimensional Peptide Mapping—GST-(WT) eEF2 kinase or GST-(S398A)eEF2 kinase were phosphorylated by AMPK and then digested with trypsin and Asp-N. Phosphopeptide samples were analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping, as described previously (24Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) at pH 1.9 (electrophoresis) and 3.5 (chromatography). The thin layer cellulose plates were allowed to dry and then subjected to autoradiography. Expression and Mutagenesis of GST-eEF2 Kinase—A modified cDNA encoding human eEF2 kinase with an N-terminal FLAG tag cloned between the BamHI sites of the vector pGEX-4T was kindly provided by Dr. Maria Deak of the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, University of Dundee. For expression of GST-eEF2 kinase in Escherichia coli, BL21 cells were transformed with this vector and induced with isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside (100 μm) for 3 h at 26 °C. Cells were lysed (by sonication) into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.03% Brij-35, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and proteinase inhibitors (1 mm each of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, benzamidine, and pepstatin), and extracts were prepared. GST-eEF2 kinase was isolated by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose and eluted using 100 mm glutathione. Purified protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and then stored at –20 °C. For expression as a maltose-binding protein fusion, human eEF2 kinase was subcloned into the modified pMal-HA vector (kindly provided by Dr. Jane Leitch, Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, University of Dundee) using the BamHI restriction sites. Expression and purification were as described above except that chromatography was on amylose resin and elution with 20 mm maltose. Mutagenesis of the Ser-78 phosphorylation site in human eEF2 kinase to alanine was performed by PCR using “QuikChange” (Stratagene). The forward primer was 5′-CGGCAAACGCCTTCCACTTCAAGGAAGCC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GGCTTCCTTGAAGTGGAAGGCGTTTGCCG-3′. For the mutation of serine 398 of human eEF2 kinase to alanine, the forward primer was 5′-CTCTCCCTTCTTCCCCAGCTAGCGCCACACCACACAGCC-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-GGCTGTGTGGTGTGGCGCTAGCTGGGGAAGAAGGGAGAG-3′. In both cases the template used was the pGEX-4T-eEF2 kinase vector. For transfection of KB cells, wild type or mutant FLAG-tagged human eEF2 kinase was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 using the BamHI sites, and transfection was carried out using the GenePORTER™ 2 transfection system (Cambridge BioSciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 10 μg of plasmid DNA per 10-cm cell culture dish. Reproducibility—All experiments were performed at least three times, with similar outcomes. In the case of Western blots, data from a typical experiment are shown. Assays for eEF2 Kinase—eEF2 kinase was assayed as described earlier (25Redpath N.T. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cells were harvested in high Ca2+ buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4; 50 mm NaCl; 50 mm β-glycerophosphate; 0.3% (w/v) CHAPS; and 1 mm CaCl2). Immunoprecipitation of eEF2 kinase was performed as above. Immunoprecipitated eEF2 kinase was washed three times with 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0; containing 5 mm MgCl2; 2 mm EDTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 2% (v/v) glycerol; 4.14 mm CaCl2/5 mm EGTA (free Ca2+ = 1 μm at pH 7). The washed immunoprecipitated eEF2 kinase was assayed for activity for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of purified eEF2 (2 μg) and (where added) 0.1 μg of CaM in a final volume of 30 μl.

We therefore studied whether eEF2 kinase was a substrate for AMPK in vitro. Recombinant human eEF2 kinase was made as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. It was then incubated with a highly purified preparation of AMPK and [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1A, this resulted in the incorporation of radiolabel into eEF2 kinase that was markedly stimulated by addition of AMP to the reaction, confirming that phosphorylation is indeed due to AMPK. As an alternative, we used immunopurified AMPK, which also catalyzed efficient incorporation of radiolabel into GST-eEF2 kinase. However, no such incorporation was seen when we tested the pellet from a mock immunopurification in which pre-immune serum rather than anti-AMPK was used (Fig. 1A). To identify the site(s) phosphorylated by AMPK, eEF2 kinase was radiolabeled by AMPK and then subjected to tryptic digestion. The resulting peptides were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC; two main peaks of radioactive material were observed (Fig. 1B). Further analysis by MALDI-mass spectrometry revealed that they corresponded to the peptides containing residues 69–82 (peak 1) or 364–406 of eEF2 kinase (Fig. 1, C and D, peak 2). Solid-phase Edman degradation revealed that the peptide in peak 1 was phosphorylated at position 10, indicating that it is YSSSGSPANpSFHFK, where the phosphorylated residue is Ser-78 of eEF2 kinase (Fig. 1C). Peak 2 contains a very large peptide, and to facilitate further analysis, it was subdigested with Asp-N prior to Edman sequencing. This sample showed release of label at three cycles, 1, 3, and 8 (Fig. 1D). Inspection of the sequences of the predicted products of Asp-N digestion shows that the release at cycle 3 could be due to Ser-366 or Thr-389. However, because phosphoamino acid analysis revealed only Ser(P) and no Thr(P) (data not shown), Thr-389 can be ruled out. The only possible explanation for release at cycle 8 is that it corresponds to Ser-398 in the most C-terminal of the Asp-N fragments derived from the original tryptic peptide. The radioactivity at cycle 1 is likely due to leaching from the matrix of some of this peptide that is coupled via the side chain of its N-terminal Asp residue rather than the C-terminal α-carboxyl group. Each Edman sequencing run proceeded through sufficient cycles to go beyond the end of the peptide; thus, there can be no further sites of phosphorylation within these peptides. These data indicate that, in vitro, AMPK phosphorylates three sites, Ser-78, Ser-366, and Ser-398, in eEF2 kinase. Other data suggest that Ser-398 is the major site phosphorylated by AMPK (see below). Ser-366 and Ser-398 lie C-terminal to the catalytic domain of eEF2 kinase (Fig. 1E) in a region that contains several known sites of phosphorylation (12McLeod L.E. Wang L. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 18Knebel A. Haydon C.E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Ser-398 has not been identified previously as a phosphorylation site in eEF2 kinase. Ser-78 is also a novel site; it lies N-terminal to the catalytic domain, immediately adjacent to the CaM-binding site (26Diggle T.A. Seehra C.K. Hase S. Redpath N.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Pavur K.S. Petrov A.N. Ryazanov A.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12216-12224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). To confirm the identity of the three major sites of in vitro AMPK phosphorylation in eEF2 kinase and for use as tools for investigating the regulation of the in vivo phosphorylation of these sites, we generated phosphospecific antisera for each of the two novel sites (Ser-78 and Ser-398) by immunizing rabbits with appropriate phosphopeptides. Antibodies were purified as described under the “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2, A–C, shows data for their characterization. When GST-eEF2 kinase was incubated with AMPK and cold ATP and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, clear signals were seen using the anti-Ser(P)-78 and anti-Ser(P)-398 antisera, as well as for a phosphospecific antiserum for Ser-366 that had been developed by us previously (10Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A–C). No signal was observed for the anti-(P)Ser-78 and (P)Ser-398 antisera when mutants of eEF2 kinase were used in which these sites had been individually mutated to alanines, thus demonstrating the specificity of the phosphospecific antisera for their intended epitopes. eEF2 kinase undergoes extensive autophosphorylation in the presence of its activators, Ca2+ ions and CaM (28Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2A also show that neither Ser-78 nor Ser-366 is a site of autophosphorylation, because neither becomes phosphorylated when eEF2 kinase is incubated with Ca2+ ions and CaM in the absence of AMPK. Although the AMPK used here was obtained by specific immunoprecipitation from an already highly purified preparation of enzyme, it was theoretically possible that co-immunoprecipitating kinases might contribute to the observed phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase. To confirm that these three sites are indeed phosphorylated by AMPK rather than any possible co-immunoprecipitating kinases, we performed phosphorylation reactions using the immunopurified AMPK in the absence or presence of AMP. As shown in Fig. 2D, AMP very markedly increased the phosphorylation of all three sites. This strongly suggests that their phosphorylation is indeed catalyzed by AMPK.

Here we generated a library of octasaccharides by semienzymatic methods by using recombinant HS 2-O-sulfotransferase and HS 6-O-sulfotransferase, and we have made a systematic investigation of the specific binding structures for various heparin-binding growth factors. An octasaccharide (Octa-I, ΔHexA-GlcNSO3-(HexA-GlcNSO3)3) was prepared by partial heparitinase digestion from completely desulfated N-resulfated heparin. 2-O- and 6-O-sulfated Octa-I were prepared by enzymatically transferring one to three 2-O-sulfate groups and one to three 6-O-sulfate groups per molecule, respectively, to Octa-I. Another octasaccharide containing 3 units of HexA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3(6SO4) was prepared also from heparin. This octasaccharide library was subjected to affinity chromatography for interactions with fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, -4, -7, -8, -10, and -18, hepatocyte growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein 6, and vascular endothelial growth factor, respectively. Based upon differences in the affinity to those octasaccharides, the growth factors could be classified roughly into five groups: group 1 needed 2-O-sulfate but not 6-O-sulfate (FGF-2); group 2 needed 6-O-sulfate but not 2-O-sulfate (FGF-10); group 3 had the affinity to both 2-O-sulfate and 6-O-sulfate but preferred 2-O-sulfate (FGF-18, hepatocyte growth factor); group 4 required both 2-O-sulfate and 6-O-sulfate (FGF-4, FGF-7); and group 5 hardly bound to any octasaccharides (FGF-8, bone morphogenetic protein 6, and vascular endothelial growth factor). The approach using the oligosaccharide library may be useful to define specific structures required for binding to various heparin-binding proteins. Octasaccharides with the high affinity to FGF-2 and FGF-10 had the activity to release them, respectively, from their complexes with HS.

The expression patterns of the individual modification enzymes have been shown to differ from tissue to tissue, and as a result different functional structures of HS may be generated in the different tissues. Such structural diversity introduced to HS may result in the different response of each tissue to various heparin-binding proteins. So far, the sequences in HS that interact with FGF-1 or FGF-2 have been studied by biochemical and x-ray crystallographic analysis. It became apparent that the FGF-1-binding region was distinct from the minimal FGF-2-binding region (23Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

These studies on the binding structures in HS appear to support the idea that each heparin-binding growth factor may recognize the respective unique structure. However, our knowledge about the heparin/HS structures involved in the interaction with a variety of HBGFs is still limited, and the greater part of the interactions between HS and the heparin-binding proteins remains to be studied. Furthermore, structural analyses of HS with binding activity for HBGFs often give different results when HS is isolated from different sources (29Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T.

In the present study, we prepared an octasaccharide library consisting of well defined sulfated octasaccharides. The library comprised 2-O-sulfated or 6-O-sulfated octasaccharides generated from CDSNS-heparin-derived octasaccharide (Octa-I) by in vitro reactions with HS2ST or HS6ST. By using this library, we examined the structures that were specifically bound to the various HBGFs including FGF-2, FGF-4, FGF-7, FGF-8, FGF-10, FGF-18, HGF, BMP-6, and VEGF. Our results show that these HBGFs could be classified roughly into five groups on the basis of the difference in affinity with the oligosaccharides, and offer further evidence for specific interactions between heparin-binding growth factors and the corresponding domain structures in HS. Furthermore, for a physiological relevance of this study, we demonstrated specific release of FGF-10 and FGF-2 from HS by the addition of 6-O-sulfated Octa-I and 2-O-sulfated Octa-I, respectively.

Preparation of Octasaccharide Fractions from CDSNS-heparin and Heparin—One octasaccharide composed of HexA-GlcNSO3 (Octa-I) and another composed of HexA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3(6SO4) (Octa-II) were prepared from CDSNS-heparin and heparin, respectively, as follows. One hundred milligrams of CDSNS-heparin was digested with 0.1 unit of heparitinase I, which is known to preferentially cleave glucosaminidic linkages to nonsulfated HexA residues in heparin/HS, at 37 °C for 2 h. The unsaturated oligosaccharide products were separated by Superdex 30 chromatography based on size. Octasaccharide fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The lyophilized materials were applied to a Mono Q column. The Mono Q column was developed by using a linear gradient from 0.2 to 1.2 m NaCl in 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0. The fractions eluted around 0.34 to 0.38 m NaCl were pooled and desalted by PD-10 column chromatography. The purified octasaccharide thus obtained was designated Octa-I. About 250 nmol (as HexA) of Octa-I was obtained. One hundred milligrams of heparin was digested with 0.1 unit of heparinase, which is known to cleave preferentially glucosaminidic linkages to 2-O-sulfated IdoUA in heparin/HS, at 37 °C for 2 h. Octa-II was purified from the heparin digests by the methods described above except that the fractions eluted over 1.0 m NaCl were pooled in the Mono Q chromatography. About 2.4 μmol (as HexA) of Octa-II was obtained. Aliquots of Octa-I and Octa-II were reduced with [3H]NaBH4 as described by Shively and Conrad (33Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The specific activities of 3H-labeled Octa-I and Octa-II were 1.5 × 104 and 1.2 × 104 dpm/nmol, respectively. Preparation of O-Sulfated CDSNS-Heparin Octasaccharide with Recombinant HS2ST and HS6ST-1—The recombinant hHS2ST and hHS6ST-1 were prepared and purified as described previously (19Habuchi H. Kobayashi M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9208-9213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, FLAG-CMV2-hHS2ST or hHS6ST-1 was transfected into COS-7 cells. After 72 h, the recombinant fusion proteins were extracted from the cell layer with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2 and purified with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated affinity column. 2-O-Sulfated Octa-I and 6-O-sulfated Octa-I were prepared as follows. For 2-O-sulfation of Octa-I, the reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 1.0 μmol of acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 3.75 μg of protamine chloride, 0.5 nmol of Octa-I, 1 μCi/2 nmol of [35S]PAPS, and 2.7 units of hHS2ST. For 6-O-sulfation, the reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 3.75 μg of protamine chloride, 0.5 nmol of Octa-I, 2 nmol of [35S]PAPS (1 μCi), and 5.5 units of hHS6ST-1. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the reactions were stopped by heating at 100 °C for 1 min. 2-O-35S-Sulfated Octa-I and 6-O-35S-sulfated Octa-I were precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and 0.5 mm EDTA in the presence of the carrier chondroitin 4-sulfate (0.1 μmol as glucuronic acid). The precipitates were dissolved in a small volume of distilled water and subjected to Mono Q chromatography. The Mono Q chromatography was developed with a linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.8 m in 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0. Preparation of Growth and Differentiation Factor (HBGF)-conjugated Sepharose Gel—The growth and differentiation factor-conjugated Sepharose gel was prepared as described previously (30Ashikari S.

Briefly, each of FGF-2 (50 μg), FGF-4 (50 μg), FGF-7 (100 μg), FGF-8 (50 μg), FGF-10 (100 μg), FGF-18 (100 μg), HGF (100 μg), BMP-6 (100 μg), and VEGF (50 μg) was coupled to 0.3 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B gel according to the method recommended by the manufacturer. Acetylated heparin (10 μg) was added to the coupling reaction mixture to protect the heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site of these growth factors. HBGF Affinity Chromatography of Various Octasaccharides—0.1 nmol of 35S-labeled octasaccharide was dissolved in 0.5 ml of PBST, 0.9 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml chondroitin 4-sulfate (Binding buffer) and applied to a syringe column of GF-Sepharose (0.3 ml) equilibrated with Binding buffer at 4 °C. The column was shaken gently for 1 h and then washed with 2.5 ml of PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST(+)). The column was eluted stepwise with 1 ml of 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, and 0.50 m NaCl in PBST(+) and 2 ml of 2 m NaCl in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) (Elution buffer). In some cases, the octasaccharides were eluted with 2 ml of Elution buffer after the wash with 2.5 ml of PBST(+). The elution profiles were monitored by measuring the radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter (30Ashikari S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29586-29593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Real time analysis of the interaction of growth factors and heparin/modified heparin was performed with a BIAcore 2000 SPR biosensor. Streptavidin-conjugated Sensor Chip SA was used to immobilize various glycosaminoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans were biotinylated according to the method recommended by the manufacturer. Two hundred micrograms of heparin, 2ODS-heparin, 6ODS-heparin, or chondroitin 4-sulfate was incubated with 74 μg of NHS-LS-Biotin (Pierce) in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, for 30 min at room temperature. Biotinylated glycosaminoglycans were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 95% (v/v) ethanol containing 1.3% (w/v) potassium acetate, and the process was repeated three times. In order to immobilize GAGs on the sensor chip SA, 0.5–2 μg/ml biotinylated GAGs in PBST were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The injection of biotinylated GAGs produced 10–200 response units of immobilized GAG on the biosensor surface. The amount of bound material on the biosensor chips was measured in arbitrary response units. All measurements were carried out at room temperature, and refractive index errors due to bulk solvent effects were corrected by subtracting away responses on the non-coated sensor chip for GF concentrations used. Each GF stock solutions were diluted with PBST. Various concentrations of growth factors were injected across the GAG-coated surface at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The steady state binding level was monitored for 300 s. Sensorgrams were evaluated using BIAevaluation software. Dissociation constants (KD) for binding could be extracted from the dependence of steady state binding levels on GF concentration. In a steady state, this model calculates KD from a plot of Req against C according to the equation, KD = Req(Rmax – Req)/C, where Req is the steady state response level for the growth factor; Rmax is the maximal capacity of the sensor chip to bind growth factors expressed in response units; and C is the molar concentration of growth factor. HBGF-releasing Activity of Octasaccharides from HS—The releasing activity was measured by ELISA as described previously with a minor modification (30Ashikari S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29586-29593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A 96-well streptavidin-coated plate (Thermo Lab-systems, Finland) was coated with 0.1 nmol (as hexuronic acid) of biotinylated pig aorta HS for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with 200 μl of PBS and then blocked with 200 μl of PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA for 1 h with gentle shaking. Wells were washed three times with PBS. Then 100 μl of Binding buffer (see above) containing 40 ng/ml digoxigenin-conjugated HBGF and 10 mg/ml BSA was added into each well. After 1 h at room temperature, unbound digoxigenin-conjugated HBGF was removed by three washes with PBST(+). Then 100 μl of Binding buffer containing 10 mg/ml BSA and 1 pmol to 1 nmol of each octasaccharide were added into the wells. After 1 h at room temperature, wells were washed, and then alkaline phosphatase-conjugated Fab fragments of anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:1000 dilution) were added. After 1 h at room temperature, unbound Fab fragments were removed by three washes with PBST, and the alkaline phosphatase substrate (1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8) was added into each well. The enzyme activity in each well was measured by using a microplate reader. The experiments were independently repeated three times, and statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. The criterion of significance was shown by p values. Compositional Analysis of Octasaccharides—About 0.3 nmol of octasaccharides was digested with a mixture of 1 milliunit of heparitinase I, 0.1 milliunit of heparitinase II, and 1 milliunit of heparinase in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 μg of BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. Unsaturated disaccharide products were analyzed by fluorometric postcolumn high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as reported previously (35Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Preparation of an Octasaccharide Library—Octa-I, an oligosaccharide composed of HexA-GlcNSO3, and Octa-II, an oligosaccharide composed of HexA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3(6SO4), were prepared from CDSNS-heparin and heparin, respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The structures of these oligosaccharides were confirmed by digestion with a mixture of heparitinase and heparinase followed by HPLC analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Table I, ΔHexA-GlcNSO3 was exclusively obtained from Octa-I, indicating that the structure of Octa-I was ΔHexA-GlcNSO3-(HexA-GlcNSO3)3. On the other hand, 3 mol of HexA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3(6SO4), 0.5 mol of HexA-GlcNSO3(6SO4), and 0.5 mol of other disaccharide components were released from 1 mol of Octa-II. Octa-II was thus a mixture containing 3 units of HexA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3(6SO4) per molecule.Table IDisaccharide compositions of octasaccharidesOctasaccharide libraryOcta-IOcta-II2S-12S-22S-36S-16S-26S-3units/octasaccharideDisaccharide component HexA-GlcNAcND0.1NDNDNDNDNDND HexA-GlcNS4.00.12.91.91.12.91.91.2 HexA-GlcNAc(6S)ND0.1NDNDNDNDNDND HexA(2S)-GlcNSND0.31.12.12.9NDNDND HexA-GlcNS(6S)ND0.5NDNDND1.12.12.8 HexA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)ND2.9NDNDNDNDNDNDYield (%)4016638208 Open table in a new tab 2-O-Sulfated and 6-O-sulfated Octa-I were prepared by incubating Octa-I with the recombinant HS2ST and HS6ST-1, respectively, together with PAPS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The in vitro sulfated products were separated with Mono Q chromatography (Fig. 1). Both 2-O-sulfated Octa-I and 6-O-sulfated Octa-I were separated into three peaks: 2S-1, 2S-2, and 2S-3 for 2-O-sulfated Octa-I; and 6S-1, 6S-2, and 6S-3 for 6-O-sulfated Octa-I. All of these peaks were eluted at higher NaCl concentration than Octa-I and at lower NaCl concentration than Octa-II. Each peak was pooled separately. To examine the structure of these products, aliquots of these sulfated octasaccharides were digested extensively with the mixture of heparitinase and heparinase and subjected to HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From the disaccharide compositions shown in Table I, it is evident that 2S-1, 2S-2, and 2S-3 contained 1, 2, and 3 units, respectively, of the HexA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3 component; and 6S-1, 6S-2, and 6S-3 have 1, 2, and 3 units, respectively, of HexA-GlcNSO3(6SO4) component. Under the maximum reaction conditions used, more than 60% of Octa-I was sulfated by each sulfotransferase. The yields of these sulfated Octa-I were decreased as the content of 2-O-sulfated or 6-O-sulfate units was increased (Table I). Binding Abilities of Octa-I and Octa-II to Various HBGFs— Before determining the binding activity of oligosaccharides, we examined the binding ability and capacity of the growth and differentiation factor-conjugated Sepharose 4B affinity columns using 3H-labeled heparin (2 nmol as HexA). Every affinity column conjugated with FGF-2, FGF-4, FGF-7, FGF-8, FGF-10, FGF-18, HGF, VEGF, or BMP-6 bound more than 80% of the applied 3H-labeled heparin (data not shown). To examine the binding activity of the oligosaccharide libraries synthesized enzymatically, we first applied [3H]NaBH4-reduced Octa-II (0.5 nmol as octasaccharide) to the growth factor-conjugated columns. The amounts of Octa-II bound to various growth factor-conjugated columns are shown in Fig. 2. FGF-2, FGF-4, FGF-18, and HGF bound Octa-II strongly. FGF-10 and FGF-7 also bound Octa-II slightly weaker than FGF-2. In contrast, FGF-8, BMP-6, and VEGF hardly bound Octa-II (less than 15% of the applied). These results indicate that FGF-2, FGF-4, FGF-7, FGF-10, FGF-18, and HGF have high affinity to Octa-II as observed for heparin, but FGF-8, BMP-6, and VEGF have very weak or no affinity to Octa-II, although these proteins showed high affinity to heparin. The results suggest that oligosaccharides longer than octasaccharides may be required for the binding of FGF-8, BMP-6, or VEGF. Octa-II contains both O-sulfate and N-sulfate. To address which sulfate groups are necessary for the binding to these growth factors, we examined the binding of Octa-I which is devoid of O-sulfate but has N-sulfate. As shown in Fig. 2, Octa-I hardly bound at all to the growth factor-conjugated affinity columns (open bars in Fig. 2). These results clearly indicate that the O-sulfate groups in Octa-II are essential for the binding to these growth factors. Affinity of the Octasaccharide Library to Various HBGFs— Octa-II is composed of 3 units of HexA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3(6SO4). To determine whether either or both of the 2-O-sulfate and 6-O-sulfate groups interact with the growth factors, we examined the binding of 2-O-sulfated or 6-O-sulfated Octa-I to the growth factor-conjugated columns that could retain Octa-II. In Fig. 3, the binding of 2S-3 and 6S-3 to FGF-2, FGF-4, FGF-7, FGF-10, FGF-18, or HGF-conjugated columns is shown. FGF-2 bound 2S-3 strongly but did not bind 6S-3. These results are consistent with studies showing that the presence of 1 unit of the HexA(2SO4)-GlcNSO3 component in oligosaccharides is sufficient for the binding to FGF-2 (26Ishihara M.

https://openalex.org/W1989855380,"The role of endosomal acidification and retrograde transport for the uptake of the highly basic cell-penetrating peptides penetratin, Tat, and oligoarginine was investigated. The effect of a panel of drugs that interfere with discrete steps of endocytosis or Golgi-mediated transport on uptake and cellular distribution of fluorescein-labeled peptide analogues was probed by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and fluorescence spectroscopy of whole cell lysates. The analyses were carried out in MC57 fibrosarcoma cells and in HeLa cells. While MC57 fibrosarcoma cells showed some vesicular fluorescence and a pronounced cytoplasmic fluorescence, in HeLa cells little cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed. In MC57 cells the inhibitors of endosomal acidification chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 abolished the release of the peptides into the cytoplasm. Release into the cytosol preserved endosomal integrity. In addition, cellular uptake of the peptides was inhibited by brefeldin A, a compound interfering with trafficking in the trans-Golgi network. In contrast, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a drug that stimulates the rapid retrograde movement of both Golgi stacks and trans-Golgi network to the endoplasmic reticulum, promoted a cytoplasmic localization of Tat peptides in peptide-pulsed HeLa cells. The effects of these drugs on trafficking shared characteristics with those reported for the trafficking of plant and bacterial toxins, such as cholera toxin, which reach the cytoplasm by means of retrograde transport. A sequence comparison revealed a common stretch of 8–10 amino acids with high sequence homology to the Tat peptide. The structural and functional data therefore strongly suggest a common mechanism of import for cationic cell-penetrating peptides and the toxins.

Structure-function relationships of intracellular interaction domains have been analyzed by testing a series of different peptides fused to cell-penetrating peptides (19Liu X.-Y. Timmons S. Lin Y.-Z.

Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CPPs therefore have the promise to represent a widely applicable means to enhance immune responses against cancer and infectious diseases. A total of about 20 different peptide delivery vectors have been described so far, the majority of which were identified as structural determinants mediating cellular internalization of proteins (3Fischer P.M. Krausz E. Lane D.P. Bioconjug. Chem. 2001; 12: 825-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). While some of these peptides are purely cationic, others are amphipathic with a large fraction of basic residues, and again others are fully hydrophobic. These peptides vary in length from about 9 to more than 30 amino acids (3Fischer P.M. Krausz E. Lane D.P. Bioconjug. Chem. 2001; 12: 825-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Three highly basic import peptides, the Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain-derived penetratin peptide (21Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the HIV-1 Tat-derived peptide (22Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol.

Pharm. 2002; 245: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have been used widely in many of the applications described above. The penetratin peptide and the HIV-1 Tat peptide have been identified as protein transduction domains of their respective proteins, while the oligoarginine peptides (among them the nona-arginine peptide R9) have been developed based on structure-activity relationships of the HIV-1 Tat peptide. Despite their broad acceptance as molecular carriers, the mechanism of internalization of CPPs and CPP-cargo constructs is not well understood. The uptake of the penetratin and the HIV-1 Tat peptide had originally been described to be insensitive to low temperature (21Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol.

Karlsson M. Norden B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) without forming pores (26Thoren P.E.G. Persson D. Karlsson M. Norden B.

In summary, these results were consistent with the theory of a direct translocation of the cationic peptides through the plasma membrane (21Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol.

Recent data demonstrated, however, that earlier interpretations of cell biological experiments may have suffered from artifactual uptake of CPPs caused by fixation of cells. Endocytosis is clearly involved in the internalization of the HIV-1 Tat peptide (29Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). For Tat fusion proteins it was demonstrated that cellular internalization occurs through a temperature-dependent endocytic pathway that originates from lipid rafts and follows caveolar endocytosis (30Fittipaldi A.

Inhibitors of metabolism or endocytosis, such as cytochalasin D, were demonstrated to impair uptake of penetratin (31Drin G. Cottin S. Blanc E. Rees A.R. Temsamani J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31192-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Recently the penetratin and the Tat peptide were shown to promote endocytosis of high molecular weight cargo upon binding to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (32Console S. Marty C.

With a picture of an endocytic uptake mechanism emerging, the implications of the endosomal pathway for functional cell biological studies using CPPs need to be readdressed. The biological activity exhibited by CPPs in cell biological applications (6Prochiantz A. Curr. Opin.

A rational design of more effective CPPs can only be achieved if the mechanism of uptake is fully understood. In this study we addressed these questions by investigating the effect of drugs that interfere with distinct steps of the endosomal pathway and Golgi trafficking. To study a potential cell type dependence of the peptide trafficking, adherently growing MC57 fibrosarcoma cells and HeLa cells were examined. Both cell lines showed marked differences in the intracellular distribution of fluorescein-labeled CPPs. Materials—Standard chemicals for peptide chemistry were obtained from Fluka (Deisenhofen, Germany) and Merck; solvents were pure analytical grade. Fmoc-protected amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem, Senn Chemicals (Dielsdorf, Switzerland), and Orpegen Pharma (Heidelberg, Germany). The isomeric mixture of (5)6-carboxyfluorescein was from Fluka, and AlexaFluor 647-dextran (anionic; molecular mass, 10,000 Da) and Bodipy TR ceramide were obtained from Mobitech (Göttingen, Germany). Bafilomycin A1 was from Tocris Biotrend (Bristol, UK), chloroquine diphosphate was from Fluka, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) was from Alexis Biochemicals (Grünberg, Germany), wortmannin was from Calbiochem, and brefeldin A was from Sigma. Peptide Synthesis—Automated peptide synthesis was performed by solid phase Fmoc/tert-butyl chemistry using an automated peptide synthesizer for multiple peptide synthesis (RSP5032, Tecan, Hombrechtlikon, Switzerland) in 2-ml syringes according to the following protocol. Fmoc-protected amino acids (12-fold excess) were coupled by in situ activation using N,N′-diisopropyl carbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazol for 90 min followed by removal of the Fmoc protecting group by treatment with piperidine/DMF (1:4, v/v) twice for 8 min. The resin was washed with DMF (six times) after each coupling and deprotection step. The side chain of Tyr was tert-butyl-protected, the side chain of Arg was 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl-protected, the side chains of Gln and Asn were trityl-protected, and the side chains of Lys and Trp were tert-butyloxycarbonyl-protected. Peptide amides were synthesized on Rink amide resin (Rapp Polymere, Tübingen, Germany). Peptides were cleaved off the resin by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/ethanedithiol/H2O (92.5:2.5:2.5:2.5, v/v/v/v) for 4 h. Crude peptides were precipitated by adding cold diethyl ether (-20 °C). The precipitated peptides were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in cold diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated twice. Finally peptides were dissolved in tert-butyl alcohol/H2O (4:1, v/v) and lyophilized. Labeling of Peptides with Carboxyfluorescein—Amino-terminal labeling of peptides with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was essentially performed as described previously (33Fischer R. Mader O. Jung G. Brock R. Bioconjug. Chem. 2003; 14: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fmoc-deprotected, resin-bound peptides were reacted with 5 eq of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, N,N′-diisopropyl carbodiimide, and 1-hydroxybenzotriazol, each in DMF for 16 h in 2-ml syringes on a shaker at RT. Reactions were stopped by washing the resins three times each with DMF, methanol, dichloromethane, and diethyl ether. Subsequently peptides were treated with piperidine/DMF (1:4, v/v) to remove ester-bound carboxyfluorescein (33Fischer R. Mader O. Jung G. Brock R. Bioconjug. Chem. 2003; 14: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Completeness of amine acylation was confirmed using the Kaiser test (34Sarin V.K. Kent S.B. Tam J.P. Merrifield R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). HPLC—Peptides and conjugates were analyzed by analytical reversed phase HPLC using a water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) (solvent A)/acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) (solvent B) gradient on a Waters 600 system (Eschborn, Germany) with detection at 214 nm. The samples were analyzed on an analytical column (Nucleosil 100, 250 × 2 mm, C18 column, 5-μm particle diameter; Grom, Herrenberg, Germany) using a linear gradient from 10% B to 100% B within 30 min (flow rate, 0.3 ml/min). Peptides were purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC (Nucleosil 300, 250 × 20 mm, C18 column, 10-μm particle diameter; Grom) on a Waters 600 multisolvent delivery system (flow rate, 10 ml/min). Gradients were adjusted according to the elution profiles and peak profiles obtained from the analytical HPLC chromatograms. MALDI-TOF MS of Synthetic Peptides—1 μl of 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone matrix (20 mg of 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone, 5 mg of ammonium citrate in 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol/H2O (4:1, v/v)) was mixed with 1 μl of each sample (dissolved in acetonitrile/water (1:1) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml) on a gold target. Measurements were performed using a MALDI time-of-flight system (G2025A, Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany). For signal generation 20–50 laser shots were added up in the single shot mode. Peptide Stock Solutions—Carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptides were dissolved in Me2SO at concentrations of 10 mm. These stock solutions were further diluted 1:20 in double distilled H2O. Peptide concentrations were determined by UV/visible spectroscopy of a further 1:100 dilution in 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.8) with absorptions measured at 492 nm and assuming a molar extinction coefficient of 75,000 liters/(mol·cm). Cell Culture—The adherent MC57 fibrosarcoma cell line (35Hosaka Y. Yasuda Y. Seriburi O. Moran M.G. Fukai K. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HeLa cells were grown in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with stabilized glutamine and 2.0 g/liter NaHCO3 (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Biotech), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Both cell lines were passaged by trypsinization with trypsin/EDTA (0.05%:0.02%, w/v) (Biochrom) in PBS every 3rd–4th day. Flow Cytometry—MC57 or HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 50,000/well in 24-well plates (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) in serum-containing RPMI 1640 medium. One day later, the cells were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated in 200 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing the appropriate inhibitors. After the indicated periods of time, peptides were added as described under “Results.” Each condition was tested in duplicate. After a 2-h incubation, cells were washed with PBS, detached by trypsinization for 10 min, suspended in ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and measured immediately by flow cytometry. The fluorescence of 5000 vital cells was acquired. Vital cells were gated based on sideward scatter and forward scatter. For pulse/chase experiments, MC57 cells were washed three times with PBS after 2 h of peptide incubation and then incubated with 500 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for an additional 3 h. Cells were then washed with PBS, detached by trypsinization for 10 min, suspended in ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and measured by flow cytometry as described above. To compare the pulse and the pulse/chase values, fluorescence intensities of fluorescent calibration beads (Mobitech) were also acquired for each series of measurements. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on an inverted LSM510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) fitted with a Plan-Apochromat 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture lens. All measurements were performed with living, non-fixed cells. MC57 cells were seeded at a density of 10,000/well in 8-well chambered cover glasses (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Two days later, before addition of inhibitors or peptides, cells were washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Bafilomycin A1 was added at a concentration of 300 nm in 200 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium 30 min before addition of peptides. After 2 h of incubation with peptides, images were acquired immediately at RT with excess peptide in the medium. For double detection of fluorescein-labeled peptides and AlexaFluor 647-dextran the 488 nm line of an argon ion laser and the light of a 633 nm helium/neon laser were directed over an HFT UV/488/633 beam splitter, and fluorescence was detected using an NFT 545 beam splitter in combination with a BP 505–530 band pass filter for fluorescein detection and an LP 650 long pass filter for AlexaFluor 647 detection. Peptides and AlexaFluor 647-dextran were added as indicated under “Results.” After 2 h cells were washed three times with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium followed immediately by confocal microscopy at RT. For the induction of retrograde transport, after 2 h of incubation with peptide and dextran, cells were washed three times with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium followed by incubation with 25 μm NDGA for 3 h in RPMI 1640 medium. For double detection of fluorescein-labeled peptides and Bodipy TR ceramide the 488 nm line of an argon ion laser and the light of a 543 nm helium/neon laser were directed over an HFT UV/488/543 beam splitter, and fluorescence was detected using an NFT 545 beam splitter in combination with a BP 505–530 band pass filter for fluorescein detection and an LP 560 long pass filter for Bodipy detection. Staining of the Golgi complex in living cells with fluorescent ceramide was essentially performed as described by the supplier. Briefly MC57 and HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 10,000/well in 8-well chambered cover glasses. Two days later, cells were washed once with ice-cold Hank's buffered salt solution + 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (HBSS/HEPES) and then incubated with HBSS/HEPES (containing 5 μm sphingolipid and 5 μm bovine serum albumin prepared as described by the supplier) for 30 min on ice and in the dark. Cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold HBSS/HEPES and incubated with the indicated peptide in serum-free medium for1hat37 °C in the incubator. Confocal images were then acquired immediately at RT with excess peptide in the medium. MALDI-TOF MS of Peptide-containing Cell Culture Supernatant—A confluent cell layer of MC57 cells in a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask was washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 30 μm Fluo-Tat. After 2 h the cells were detached using 5 mm EDTA/PBS; transferred into a fresh tube; and washed twice with 10 ml of PBS. EDTA/PBS was used instead of trypsin/EDTA/PBS to exclude that peptide fragments were generated by residual amounts of trypsin during the chase period. Cells were then suspended in 500 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the incubator. The cells were centrifuged, and the cell-free supernatant was acidified using 100 μl of 0.1% HCl. The yellow sample (the yellow color originated from phenol red) was immediately desalted on a G1001A sample prep station (Hewlett-Packard) and concentrated to a volume of about 10 μl in a Speed-Vac concentrator. MS analysis was performed using a “Future” MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (GSG, Mess-und Analysengeräte GmbH, Bruchsal, Germany). 1 μl of 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone matrix was mixed with 1 μl of the sample on a gold target. For signal generation 35–50 laser shots were added up in the single shot mode (positive ion mode). Instrument calibration was performed using two synthetic peptides (calculated [M + H]+, 1156.7 and 2859.4 Da). Intracellular Peptide Stability—Intracellular peptide stability was investigated essentially as described elsewhere (36Elmquist A. Langel Ü. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A confluent cell layer of MC57 cells in a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask was washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 15 μm Fluo-Antp. After 2 h the cells were washed twice with PBS, detached by trypsinization for 10 min at 37 °C, transferred into a fresh tube, and washed three times with 10 ml of PBS (to remove trypsin and extracellular trypsinized peptide). Cells were then lysed in 200 μl of 0.1% HCl for 10 min at RT. The cell lysate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 14,000 rpm. The peptide-containing supernatant was immediately desalted and concentrated to a volume of about 10 μl as described above. MS analysis of the sample was performed using a (Future) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer as described above. Co-incubation of MC57 and HeLa Cells—For co-incubation experiments 5,000 each of MC57 and HeLa cells/well were seeded in an 8-well chambered cover glass. Two days later, cells were washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and 200 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium was added. Peptides were added as indicated under “Results.” After 2 h of peptide incubation, pictures were immediately acquired at RT, leaving excess peptide in the medium. Quantification of Cellular Internalization of Fluorescein-labeled CPPs by Fluorescence Emission Spectroscopy in Whole Cell Lysates— MC57 and HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Sarstedt) in serum-containing RPMI 1640 medium. Two days later, the confluent cell layer was washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with 500 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium ± bafilomycin A1 for 30 min. Then Fluo-Antp was added, and after 2 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS, detached by trypsinization for 15 min, transferred into a fresh tube, and washed twice with 10 ml of PBS (to remove trypsin and trypsinized peptide). Cells were then lysed in 200 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). The lysates were then sonicated and centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 14,000 rpm. Fluorescein concentrations were determined in the supernatant using an LS50B spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 492 nm and detection of emission at 520 nm. The protein content of the lysates was determined using a commercially available Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Each condition was tested in duplicate. Cellular Uptake of Penetratin, R9, and Tat Peptides—Considering two recent studies demonstrating the involvement of endocytosis in the uptake of the R9 peptide, the HIV-1 Tat peptide (29Richard J.P.

The long time period (up to 30 years) between primary infection and the onset of HCC implies that HCV is not directly oncogenic but in some way predisposes patients to develop tumors, though the mechanism for this is unclear as yet. We report here that NS5A binds directly to the Src homology 3 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and this interaction is mediated by a novel (non-proline-rich) motif within NS5A. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NS5A bound native heterodimeric PI3K and enhanced the phosphotransferase activity of the catalytic (p110) subunit both in vitro and in human cell lines harboring a subgenomic HCV replicon or expressing NS5A alone. NS5A-mediated activation of PI3K resulted in increased phosphorylation and activity of Akt/protein kinase B and concomitantly provided protection against the induction of apoptosis in both replicon-harboring cells and cells stably expressing NS5A alone. These data suggest that stimulation of PI3K by NS5A may represent an indirect mechanism for development of HCC in HCV-infected patients and further suggests potential therapeutic strategies to counteract the occurrence of HCV-related HCC.

Hepatology. 2002; 36: 30-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genome of the virus is a single-strand positive sense RNA molecule of ∼9.5 kb in length with a single large open reading frame encoding for a polyprotein of ∼3,000 amino acids (2Choo Q.L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6271) Google Scholar). The open reading frame is flanked by 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, which have been shown to be involved in initiation of translation and viral replication (3Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1631-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Processing of the precursor polyprotein requires both host and viral proteases to produce the structural (core, E1, E2, and p7) and nonstructural (NS2, NS3/4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins of the virion (4Bartenschlager R. J. Viral Hepatitis. 1999; 6: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The nonstructural NS5A protein is generated as a mature protein by the action of the NS3/4A serine protease. NS5A is localized to cytoplasmic and perinuclear regions of the cell and exists as phosphoproteins (p56 and p58) with the degree of serine/threonine phosphorylation accounting for the difference in size (5Tanji Y. Kaneko T. Satoh S. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3980-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS5A has generated a large amount of interest because of the observation that it can interact with a wide variety of host signaling proteins and as such may play a role in immune evasion and carcinogenesis. One clue that NS5A may have a potential role in cell signaling is the presence of polyproline motifs with the consensus sequence Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Pro, which are highly conserved throughout most HCV isolates. Such motifs are found in a number of viral and cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and form extended helices that bind to Src homology 3 (SH3) domains found within a diverse group of signal-transducing proteins (6Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that NS5A interacts directly with the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) (7Tan S.L. Nakao H. He Y.P. Vijaysri S. Neddermann P. Jacobs B.L. Mayer B.J. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5533-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (8Macdonald A. Crowder K. Street A. McCormick C. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) via these highly conserved proline motifs, in the latter case resulting in the modulation of kinase activity. The implications of these interactions are unclear, although they suggest that NS5A may play a role in the modulation of mitogenic signaling pathways in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Recently it has been reported that NS5A is also able to bind to phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) (9He Y.P. Nakao H.H. Tan S.L. Polyak P.J. Neddermann P. Vijaysri S. Jacobs B.L. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9207-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). PI3K is a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit; the latter phosphorylates the inositol ring of membrane phosphatidylinositol lipids at the 3′-carbon position to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) (10Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4657) Google Scholar). These lipid products act as second messengers, regulating cellular growth and proliferation (10Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4657) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K is associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. NS5A was shown to interact with the p85 subunit in vitro and in HeLa cells stably expressing NS5A or infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing NS5A (9He Y.P. Nakao H.H. Tan S.L. Polyak P.J. Neddermann P. Vijaysri S. Jacobs B.L. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9207-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). PI3K products activate a number of downstream pathway components. One of these is the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, recruited to the membrane by binding of its pleckstrin homology domain to PI(3,4,5)P3, where it becomes phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (10Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4657) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt leads to changes in glucose transport and synthesis as well as translation initiation and elongation. Akt has also been shown to control apoptosis within cells through a number of means including phosphorylation and subsequent deactivation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 homolog Bad and inhibition of caspase 9. An increase in the phosphorylation of p85, Akt, and Bad was demonstrated in NS5A-expressing HeLa cells (9He Y.P. Nakao H.H. Tan S.L. Polyak P.J. Neddermann P. Vijaysri S. Jacobs B.L. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9207-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of PI3K, by either overexpression or constitutive activation, has been linked with the malignant transformation of cells (11Djordjevic S. Driscoll P.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 426-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Additionally, a number of viruses that establish chronic infections express proteins that interact with and activate PI3K to promote cell survival and block apoptosis thus enhancing viral replication. Examples include the hepatitis B virus X protein (12Lee Y.I. Kang-Park S. Do S.I. Lee Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16969-16977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (13Dawson C.W. Tramountanis G. Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3694-3704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef (14Linnemann T. Zheng Y.H. Mandic R. Peterlin B.M. Virology. 2002; 294: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Wolf D. Witte V. Laffert B. Blume K. Stromer E. Trapp S. d'Aloja P. Schurmann A. Baur A.S. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1217-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Given that HCV establishes a chronic infection and is increasingly associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma we set out to define more precisely the interaction between NS5A and PI3K and to investigate the potential functional consequences in a relevant cellular context: the human hepatoma Huh7 cell line harboring a subgenomic HCV replicon (3Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1631-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that NS5A is able to interact with the SH3 domain of the p85 subunit via a novel, non-polyproline-containing motif located in the center of NS5A. This interaction mediates association of NS5A with the native p85-p110 complex in mammalian cells, and this interaction results in stimulation of the lipid kinase activity of PI3K both in vitro and in vivo. In Huh7 cells harboring a subgenomic replicon, or stably expressing NS5A alone, phosphorylation and activation of Akt are stimulated, and this correlates with a reduction in the levels of apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Our data are consistent with a role for NS5A in blocking apoptosis in HCV-infected cells by activation of PI3K and imply that NS5A contributes not only to the persistence of HCV but also to the propensity for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in HCV-infected patients.

PCR products were ligated as blunt ended fragments, using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) into the pCRBlunt vector (Invitrogen) before verification by dideoxy sequencing and subcloning into either pSG5 (19Green S.

Huh7 and HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Mammalian cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells were cultured in TC100 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 26 °C in an unhumidified incubator. For the generation of stable Huh7 cells expressing neomycin phosphotransferase alone or with the HCV genotype 1b isolate of NS5A, cells were transfected with pcDNA3 alone or pcDNA3.NS5A, and polyclonal cell populations were selected with 250 μg/ml G418. Replicon cell lines were derived as described previously (20Macdonald A. Crowder K. Street A. McCormick C. Saksela K. Harris M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17775-17784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of replicon transcript was electroporated into Huh-7 cells, and transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before the addition of 1 mg/ml G418 to the culture medium. G418-resistant colonies formed were maintained as a polyclonal cell line in medium supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418. COS-7 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 2 μg of the appropriate expression vectors using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). At 24 h post-transfection cells were washed thoroughly in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in Glasgow lysis buffer (10 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C then aliquoted and stored at –80 °C before use. The pGEX vectors for bacterial expression of GST-N-SH2(p85), GST-C-SH2(p85), GST-SH3-N-SH2(p85), and GST-SH3(p85) were obtained from Dr. Yves Collette (INSERM U119, Marseilles, France). Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli XL-1 blue or BL21 cells were carried out by standard methods (21Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial cultures were grown to mid-log phase, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and sonicated briefly to release soluble proteins. GST fusion proteins were bound to pre-equilibrated glutathione-agarose (GA) beads for 1 h at 4 °C, beads were washed extensively prior to elution in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. After dialysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, overnight at 4 °C the concentration and integrity of the proteins were verified by BCA micro™ assay (Pierce), SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting with a GST-specific antibody. The appropriate GST fusion proteins were bound to GA beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Aliquots of lysates from pSG5.NS5A-transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with beads in lysis buffer. After a 3-h incubation, beads were washed extensively in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using NS5A-specific antiserum. GST alone was used as a negative control. For coimmunoprecipitations, magnetic protein G beads (Dynal Biotech) were utilized according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the beads were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 μg of antibody was bound to the beads for 2 h followed by washing and resuspension in Glasgow lysis buffer. Cell lysates from transfected cells containing 500 μg of protein were added to the bead-antibody complex, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C on a blood mixer for 3–4 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with appropriate antiserum. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 10% (w/v) lowfat dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20 (Merck) in Tris-buffered saline and probed with either an in-house polyclonal antiserum to NS5A, anti-PI3K p85 or p110 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Akt (New England Biolabs), anti-phospho-Akt (New England Biolabs), anti-Bad (New England Biolabs), and anti-HA (Santa Cruz) antibodies according the manufacturers' recommendations. Bound antibody was detected with the appropriate conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). PI3K activity was measured using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay. Briefly 1 × 107 cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm CHAPS containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and immunoprecipitated using an anti-p85 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and protein A beads (Sigma). After formation of the immune complexes, the beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in Nonidet P-40 PAN (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and resuspended in 500 μl of PAN buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl). The reactions were started by the addition of 1 mm phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine (Sigma), 10 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and were performed at 37 °C. After 30 min the reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2.4 m HCl and the lipids extracted using a chloroform/methanol mix. The labeled phosphatidylinositol was separated using thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. Quantification was performed using a phosphorimager (Fuji, UK). Cells were grown in either 0.5% reduced serum medium or growth medium supplemented with 10% serum until 90% confluent. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (20Macdonald A. Crowder K. Street A. McCormick C. Saksela K. Harris M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17775-17784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) containing 100 nm calyculin, 500 nm cantharidin, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 plus a protease inhibitor mixture. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were quantified using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For each assay, cell lysates (1 mg of total protein) were immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of an anti-pleckstrin homology domain Akt antibody conjugated to protein G beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 90 min at 4 °C. After washing, samples were resuspended in Akt kinase reaction buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1.33 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 500 nm cantharidin, 100 nm calyculin, 15 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm ATP. To this reaction buffer 3 μg of purified recombinant Bad fusion protein was added (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) together with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer, and samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Levels of Akt kinase activity were determined by detection of [32P]-labeled Bad substrate by autoradiography. Equal loading of recombinant Bad fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblot with a rabbit anti-Bad antibody (New England Biolabs). Levels of Akt phosphorylation were determined by immunoblot analysis of Akt immunoprecipitates with an antibody specific for Ser-473-phosphorylated Akt (New England Biolabs). Overall levels of Akt were confirmed by immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-Akt antibody (New England Biolabs). Caspase 3 Activity Assay—Caspase 3 activity was determined using the ApoAlert fluorescent assay kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, lysates from 2 × 106 cells were incubated with the caspase 3 substrate DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin for 1 h at 37 °C. Cleavage of the substrate was measured using a fluorometer with a 400 nm excitation filter and 505 nm emission filter. DNA Fragmentation—The number of cells undergoing nuclear fragmentation was quantitated after staining with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were seeded into 12-well plates containing glass coverslips and allowed to settle for 24 h. To induce apoptosis cells were treated with 1 μg/ml etoposide for 36 h. Cell monolayers were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline before staining with Hoechst 33342. Randomly chosen fields were observed under fluorescence microscopy for cells with fragmented nuclei, which were considered to be apoptotic. Data were expressed as a percentage of apoptotic cells. DNA Laddering—Analysis of DNA laddering was performed using a modification of a method described previously (22Yeung M.C. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 4 days in serum-free medium prior to lysis in 500 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm EDTA). Cell debris and intact nuclei of non-apoptotic cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,600 × g for 5 min. Apoptotic DNA fragments were isolated by extraction of the supernatant with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) followed by precipitation with 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and ethanol. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of molecular grade water containing 1 mg/ml RNase A and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Apoptotic DNA fragments were resolved by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis at 50 volts for 3 h followed by staining with ethidium bromide and visualization under UV light. NS5A Binds to the SH3 Domain of the p85 Subunit of PI3K via a Novel Motif—Recent findings have shown that NS5A is capable of interacting with the mitogenic adaptor protein Grb2 (7Tan S.L. Nakao H. He Y.P. Vijaysri S. Neddermann P. Jacobs B.L. Mayer B.J. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5533-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (8Macdonald A. Crowder K. Street A. McCormick C. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) via a highly conserved class II polyproline motif situated within the C terminus of NS5A. It has also been reported that NS5A interacts with the p85 subunit of PI3K (9He Y.P. Nakao H.H. Tan S.L. Polyak P.J. Neddermann P. Vijaysri S. Jacobs B.L. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9207-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); however, although that report speculated about the involvement of an N-terminal polyproline motif in NS5A and the p85 SH3 domain, the sites of interaction within both NS5A and p85 have not been formally identified. The p85 subunit contains two SH2 domains and a SH3 domain, as well as other protein interaction domains and a region involved in binding to p110 (Fig. 1a). To map more precisely the site of interaction within p85 we obtained a panel of GST fusion proteins containing either of the two p85 SH2 domains, the p85 SH3 domain and a fragment spanning the SH3 domain and the N-terminal SH2 domain. These were used as affinity matrices to precipitate lysates from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a pSG5.NS5A(1a) vector. Precipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with a sheep polyclonal NS5A antiserum. As shown in Fig. 1b, NS5A interacted with the p85 SH3 domain of PI3K (lane 5) but failed to bind either of the two SH2 domains (lanes 2 and 3). NS5A also interacted with the p85 SH3-SH2 fragment with approximately equal efficiency of binding compared with the SH3 domain alone (lane 4). Coomassie staining verified the equal loading and integrity of the various fusion proteins. To determine whether the ability to bind the p85 SH3 domain was conserved among different genotypes of HCV, we confirmed that NS5A from genotypes 1b and 2a bound GST-SH3(p85) at levels comparable with NS5A(1a) (Fig. 1c). All three NS5A proteins were expressed at equal levels, and equal loading and integrity of the GST-SH3(p85) were confirmed by Coomassie staining. SH3 domains bind to polyproline motifs with the consensus sequence Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Pro (23Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, NS5A(1a) contains three such motifs, an N-terminal class I polyproline motif and two class II polyproline motifs near the C terminus (Fig. 2a), referred to as PP1 (class I), PP2.1 (class II motif only present in HCV genotypes 1a and 1b), and PP2.2 (a highly conserved motif shown previously to bind Grb2). To define the role played by each of these motifs in binding to the p85 SH3 domain, three NS5A(1a) mutants were generated in which specific proline residues were replaced by alanine: PA1 (P29A/P32A), PA2.1 (P343A/P345A/P346A), and PA2.2 (P350A/P353A/P354A) (Fig. 2a). Somewhat surprisingly, none of these mutations had any effect on the ability of NS5A to interact with GST-SH3(p85) (Fig. 2b), suggesting that NS5A was able to interact with the SH3 domain of the PI3K p85 subunit via a novel binding site. To map the p85 SH3 domain binding site within NS5A we generated a series of N- and C-terminal truncations of NS5A(1a) (Fig. 2c). Deletion of the C-terminal 28 (Δc420) or 108 (Δc340) residues of NS5A had no effect on the binding to GST-SH3(p85) (Fig. 2d). The Δc340 mutant removes both the PP2.1 and PP2.2 motifs and abolished binding to all other SH3 domains tested, including those of Grb2 and Src-like kinases (data not shown). In contrast, a deletion of 178 residues from the C terminus (Δc270) abrogated binding to GST-SH3(p85). Analysis of deletions from the N terminus demonstrated that it was possible to delete the N-terminal 270 residues of NS5A (Δn270, lane 5) without abrogating binding to GST-SH3(p85). As expected, the Δn270 mutant bound to all other SH3 domains tested, including those of Grb2 and Src-like kinases (data not shown). Equal loading of GST-SH3(p85) was confirmed by Coomassie staining (data not shown). These data suggested that the p85 SH3 domain binding site lay between residues 270 and 340 of NS5A; to map this site more precisely, two further truncations from the C terminus were generated. As shown in Fig. 2e a deletion of the C-terminal 148 residues (Δc300) retained the ability to bind to GST-SH3(p85). When this deletion was extended to 163 residues (Δc285), a significant reduction in the binding efficiency was observed. These data suggest that the critical region required for binding to the p85 SH3 domain lies between residues 270 and 285, and binding is enhanced by the presence of residues between 285 and 300. The region from 270 to 300 does not contain a polyproline motif (Fig. 2f), and we conclude therefore that NS5A binds to the PI3K p85 SH3 domain via a novel, non-proline-rich, motif. NS5A Interacts with the Native Heterodimeric p85-p110 PI3K Complex in Vivo—To ascertain the physiological relevance of the observed in vitro interaction between NS5A and the p85 SH3 domain we set out to determine whether NS5A was also capable of interacting with native PI3K. As a first stage in this process we transfected COS-7 cells with pSG5.NS5A and/or a vector expressing an N-terminal HA-tagged version of p85. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal NS5A antibody and the precipitates analyzed by immunoblotting with either an anti-HA tag antibody or a sheep polyclonal anti-NS5A serum. Fig. 3a(i) demonstrates that HA-p85 coprecipitated with NS5A. To confirm this observation we performed the reciprocal experiment and demonstrated that NS5A could be detected in anti-HA tag precipitates (Fig. 3a(iii)). To verify that this result was not the result of overexpression of HA-p85 we performed a further experiment to investigate the interaction of NS5A with the endogenous p85-p110 heterodimeric complex. Lysates from COS-7 cells either mock-transfected or transfected with pSG5.NS5A were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the p110 subunit. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to p110, p85, or NS5A. As expected, p85 coprecipitated with p110 (Fig. 3b); in addition, NS5A could be clearly detected in the p110 precipitate, confirming that NS5A is able to associate with the native PI3K complex in mammalian cells. NS5A Up-regulates PI3-kinase Activity in Vitro and in Vivo—To confirm further the physiological significance of the NS5A-PI3K interaction we next examined whether NS5A was able to modulate the activity of PI3K in vitro. PI3K was immunoprecipitated from the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and phosphatidylinositol as a substrate. His6-tagged NS5A, NS3/4A (24Aoubala M. Holt J. Clegg R.A. Rowlands D.J. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or Nef (25Harris M. Coates K. J. Gen.

However, the cascade responsible of mGluR to activate p38 MAPK and the signaling pathway immediately downstream from it to induce synaptic depression is poorly understood. Here, we show that transient activation of group I mGluR with the selective agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) activates p38 MAPK through G protein βγ-subunit, small GTPase Rap1, and MAPK kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6), thus resulting in mGluR5-dependent LTD. Furthermore, our data clearly show that an accelerating AMPA receptor endocytosis by stimulating the formation of guanyl nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-Rab5 complex is a potential downstream processing of p38 MAPK activation to mediate DHPG-LTD. These results suggest an important role for Rap1-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK pathway in the induction of mGluR-dependent LTD by directly coupling to receptor trafficking machineries to facilitate the loss of synaptic AMPA receptors.

Kandel E.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 2Katz L.C. Shatz C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). In the hippocampus, LTD is divided into three categories: homosynaptic, heterosynaptic, and associative LTD (3Linden D.J. Connor J.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 319-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The best-characterized form of homosynaptic LTD is induced in the CA1 region of the hippocampus by prolonged low frequency synaptic stimulation via a NMDA receptor-dependent rise in postsynaptic [Ca2+]i and the activation of serine/threonine protein phosphatases (4Bear M.F. Abraham W.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 437-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that mechanistically distinct type of LTD can be induced in the CA1 region by other types of synaptic stimulation or brief pharmacological treatments. For example, a prolonged period of paired-pulse stimulation or a direct application of the selective group I mGluR agonists, such as DHPG, can induce a robust mGluR-dependent form of LTD that is independent of NMDA receptor activation (5Kemp N. Bashir Z.I. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mechanisms of NMDA receptor-dependent LTD, which are fairly well established, the mechanisms of induction and the site of expression of mGluR-dependent LTD are still a matter of some considerable debate. Current studies have reported that the induction of mGluR-dependent LTD does not require extracellular Ca2+ (6Fitzjohn S.M. Palmer M.J. May J.E. Neeson A. Morris S.A. Collingridge G.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 421-430Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar), Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (7Schnabel R. Kilpatrick I.C. Collingridge G.L.

Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, this form of LTD requires activation of Gq-type G proteins (10Kleppisch T. Voigt V. Allmann R. Offermanns S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4943-4948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a local translation of dendritic mRNA (5Kemp N. Bashir Z.I.

Collingridge G.L. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, more recent studies suggest that p38 MAPK signaling also serves as a signal mediator in the induction of mGluR-dependent LTD (15Bolshakov V.Y. Carboni L. Cobb M.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Belardetti F. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16Rush A.M. Wu J. Rowan M.J. Anwyl R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how mGluR activation leads to activate p38 MAPK and the signaling downstream of p38 MAPK to mediate mGluR-dependent LTD induction. In an attempt to address these questions, in this study we have investigated the mechanisms involved in the induction of DHPG-LTD in hippocampal CA1 neurons. We confirm the previously described the role for p38 MAPK in the induction of DHPG-LTD. We show that by releasing Gβγ-subunits, the mGluR5 may activate Rap1 to mediate DHPG-induced p38 MAPK activation and an accelerating loss of surface AMPA receptor by stimulating the formation of GDI·Rab5 complex is a potential downstream processing of p38 MAPK activation to mediate DHPG-LTD. Electrophysiology—Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from 21–28-day-old young male Sprague-Dawley rats using standard procedures (17Huang C.C. Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9728-9738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zho W.M. You J.L. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8838-8849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowed to recover for a minimum of 1 h, and then transferred to a submersion-type recording chamber continually perfused with 30–32 °C oxygenated ACSF solution (in mm: 117 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 11 glucose). Area CA3 was surgically removed after sectioning. Extracellular and whole cell recordings were carried out with Axoclamp-2B or Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The responses were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz, digitally sampled at 5–10 kHz, and analyzed using pCLAMP software (Version 8.0, Axon Instruments). In whole cell recordings, cells were held at –70 mV while series and input resistances were monitored throughout each experiment. The evoked postsynaptic responses were induced in CA1 stratum radiatum by stimulation (0.02-ms duration) of Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents at 0.033 Hz with a bipolar stainless steel-stimulating electrode. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded with a glass pipette filled with 1 m NaCl (2–3-megohm resistance), and the initial slope was measured. Whole cell recording of EPSCs was made from CA1 pyramidal cells, which were identified under a differential interference contrast microscope. Patch pipettes (3–5 megohms) filled with the following internal solution were used (in mm: 110 potassium gluconate, 30 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 4 Na2ATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 7 phosphocreatine, 5 lidocaine N-ethyl bromide quaternary (QX-314), pH 7.3, 290–295 mosmol). The amplitude of evoked EPSCs was measured. To ensure stability of the whole cell recordings, electrical stimulation was initiated before the cell was patched. We waited for ∼5 min in the cell-attached configuration before break-in to wash off any residual internal solution spilled from the approaching pipette. Application of Drugs and Proteins—When experiments were performed in the presence of inhibitors, slices were preincubated in the inhibitors for a minimum of 1 h before and then transferred to the recording chamber where they were continually perfused with a solution containing the inhibitors. Drugs were diluted from stock solutions just before application. Stock solutions of PD98059, SP600125, GGTI-298, and FTI-277 were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C. The final Me2SO concentration in the superfusate was <0.1%. At this concentration, Me2SO had no effect on fEPSPs (17Huang C.C. Liang Y.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9728-9738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zho W.M. You J.L. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8838-8849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LY341495 and LY367385 were prepared by first dissolving them into an equimolar amount of NaOH as a concentrated stock solution and then diluting to their final concentration in ACSF. Purified bovine brain Gβγ was dissolved at 50 μg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (1.25 μm) Lubrol, pH 7.6, and stored at –80 °C. To inactivate the protein, the stock solution was boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. Boiled or nontreated Gβγ was diluted with the internal solution added with 0.05% CHAPS for the final Gβγ concentration to 100 nm. DHPG, MPEP, LY341495, LY367385, PD98059, SB203580 hydrochloride, and SP600125 were purchased from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, United Kingdom). Guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPβS) was from Sigma. GGTI-298, FTI-277, and bovine brain Gβγ were obtained from Calbiochem. Western Blotting—For each experimental group, homogenates from at least three slices were pooled. The microdissected subregions were lysed in ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer solution, pH 7.4, containing a mixture of protein phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 μm okadaic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm benzamidine, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, 60 μg/ml leupeptin) to avoid dephosphorylation and degradation of proteins and ground with a pellet pestle (Kontes Glassware, Vineland, NJ). Samples were sonicated and spun down at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was then assayed for total protein concentration using Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay kit (Hercules, CA). Each sample was separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gel for p38 MAP kinase and MKK3/6 detection and in 12.5% gel for Rap1 detection. Following the transfer on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blots were blocked in buffer solution containing 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (124 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) for 1 h and then blotted for 2 h at room temperature with antibodies that recognize phosphorylated p38 MAPK (1:1000, New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) or phosphorylated MKK3/6 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). It was then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and developed using the ECL immunoblotting detection system. The immunoblots using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were subsequently stripped and reprobed with an antibody that recognizes p38 MAPK (1:500) or MKK3/6 (1:500). For immunoprecipitation of Rab5·GDI complex, homogenates (∼500-μg protein) was incubated with anti-Rab5 antibody (1:50, BD Transduction Laboratories) for 4 h at 4 °C. The antibody-protein complexes were then pelleted with protein A-Sepharose beads. Proteins eluted from the beads were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotting for anti-GDI antibody (1:500, Synaptic Systems). Immunoblots were analyzed by densitometry. Measurement of Rap1 and Ras Activity—The activity of Rap1 and Ras was determined using Rap1 and Ras activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), respectively, following manufacturer's instructions. Rap1-GTP and Ras-GTP from various treated lysates were pulled down using the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to human Rap1-binding domain of RalGDS or human Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 bound to agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with ice-cold lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Western blotting (see above) was performed with anti-Rap1 or anti-Ras antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) to detect the presence of Rap-1-GTP and Ras-GTP. Biochemical Measurements of Surface-expressed AMPA Receptors—Biotinylation experiments were performed as described previous (18Zho W.M. You J.L. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8838-8849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The microdissected subregions were then incubated with ACSF containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. Unreacted biotinylation reagent was washed once with ice-cold ACSF and quenched by two successive 20-min washes in ACSF containing 100 mm glycine followed by two washes in ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer solution. The microdissected subregions were lysed and ground with a pellet pestle. Samples were sonicated and spun down at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. 30-μg lysates of the resulting supernatant were removed to measure total GluR1, and 90-μg lysates of the supernatant were incubated with 100 μl of 50% neutravidin-agarose (Pierce) for 3 h at 4 °C to measure the isolated biotinylated proteins. After the neutravidin-agarose was washed five times with homogenate buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer by boiling for 5 min. Total protein and isolated biotinylated proteins were analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-GluR1 C terminus (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology). Data Analysis—All of the values reported are means ± S.E. The significance of the difference between the mean was calculated by a paired or unpaired Student's t test as appropriate. Probability values of p < 0.05 were considered to represent significant differences. DHPG-induced an mGluR5-dependent LTD—Using field potential recordings, we first tested for the existence of an mGluR-dependent form of LTD in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. As reported previously (19Fitzjohn S.M. Kingston A.E. Lodge D. Collingridge G.L. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1577-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Palmer M.J. Irving A.J. Seabrook G.R. Jane D.E. Collingridge G.L. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1517-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), application of DHPG (50 μm) for 5 min resulted in a substantial LTD of fEPSPs (DHPG-LTD). The synaptic responses were depressed to 63.5 ± 5.1% (n = 8; p < 0.05) measured at 40 min after washout of DHPG (Fig. 1A). This LTD was completely blocked by bath application of the broad-spectrum mGluR antagonist LY341495 (10 μm; 94.9 ± 5.3%, n = 5; p < 0.05) (21Kingston A.E. Ornstein P.L. Wright R.A. Johnson B.G. Mayne N.G. Burnett J.P. Belagaje R. Wu S. Schoepp D.D. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is mediated by mGluR (Fig. 1B). To further investigate which subtype of group I mGluR underlies this LTD, we next examined the effect of specific antagonists for mGluR1 and mGluR5 on this LTD induction. Application of the highly selective mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (10 μm) (22Gasparini F. Lingenhohl K. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Heinrich M. Vranesic I. Biollaz M. Allgeier H. Heckendorn R. Urwyler S. Varney M.A. Johnson E.C. Hess S.D. Rao S.P. Sacaan A.I. Santori E.M. Velicelebi G. Kuhn R. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) completely blocked the DHPG-LTD (96.3 ± 3.8%, n = 5; p < 0.05, Fig. 1C), whereas the highly selective mGluR1 antagonist LY367385 (100 μm) (23Clark B.P. Baker S.R. Goldsworthy J. Harris J.R. Kingston A.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 2777-2780Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) had no effect (58.9 ± 4.5%, n = 5; p > 0.05, Fig. 1D). These results, which are similar to previous findings in juvenile rat hippocampal slices (19Fitzjohn S.M. Kingston A.E. Lodge D. Collingridge G.L. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1577-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Palmer M.J. Irving A.J. Seabrook G.R. Jane D.E. Collingridge G.L. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1517-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), confirm that activation of mGluR5 is required for the induction of DHPG-LTD. p38 MAPK Inhibitor blocks DHPG-LTD—To assess the involvement of p38 MAPK signaling pathway, DHPG-LTD was attempted in the presence of selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (1 μm) (24Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). As expected, SB203580 fully prevented the induction of DHPG-LTD (104.3 ± 5.3%, n = 8; p < 0.05, Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained using an antibody that selectively recognizes phosphorylated, activated p38 MAPK (25Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, phospho-p38 MAPK was readily detected in untreated control slices, and levels were increased to 138.7 ± 5.7% (n = 6) of control in DHPG-treated slices. MPEP (10 μm) but not LY367385 (100 μm) completely blocked the increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation induced by DHPG (Fig. 2B). Neither MPEP nor LY367385 alone had obvious effect on basal levels of phospho-p38 MAPK. In contrast, inhibition of p42/p44 MAPK signaling pathway with PD98059 (50 μm) (26Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar) or c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 (20 μm) (27Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar) failed to affect the induction of DHPG-LTD (PD98059, 62.4 ± 5.6%, n = 6; SP600125, 57.3 ± 6.7%, n = 6; p > 0.05) (Fig. 2, C and D). These results strongly support the view that the p38 MAPK is an obligatory component of the biochemical bases that serves the induction of mGluR-dependent LTD (15Bolshakov V.Y. Carboni L. Cobb M.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Belardetti F. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16Rush A.M. Wu J. Rowan M.J. Anwyl R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p38 MAPK Activation by mGluR5 Is Mediated by Gβγ—Mice lacking Gq exhibit impaired DHPG-LTD in the CA1 region (10Kleppisch T. Voigt V. Allmann R. Offermanns S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4943-4948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further determine whether postsynaptic G protein activation mediated DHPG-LTD, we performed whole cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells using a potassium gluconate-based pipette solution where GTP was replaced with 1 mm GDPβS to inhibit the activation of postsynaptic G proteins. Whereas DHPG induced a robust LTD of EPSCs in control recordings with GTP-containing solution (62.3 ± 4.9%, n = 7), only a small initial depression and no persistent depression were observed in recordings where GDPβS was used in the pipette solution (106.9 ± 5.4%, n = 7; p < 0.05) (Fig. 3, A and B). As previously reported, after rupture with pipette solution containing GDPβS, EPSCs gradually grew during the first 5–15 min and were stable for the remainder of the experiments. The initial “run-up” effects of GDPβS might in part be attributed to the effects on GDPβS on AMPA receptor endocytosis (28Luscher C. Xia H. Beattie E.C. Carroll R.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 29Watabe A.M. Carlisle H.J. O'Dell T.J. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although these results indicate that DHPG-LTD is dependent on the activation of postsynaptic Gq, no role has been found for the common Gqα-stimulated signals (i.e. phospholipase C and protein kinase C) following mGluR5 activation in this form of LTD (30Bashir Z.I. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 45: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consequently, another mechanism-unrelated Gαq must underlie the mGluR-dependent LTD. Because Gβγ released by G protein-coupled receptor activation has important role in the G protein-mediated signaling and there is growing evidence demonstrating that several G protein-coupled receptors induce p38 MAPK activation through Gβγ (31Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32Sellers L.A. Alderton F. Carruthers A.M. Schindler M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24197-24203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we next investigated the role of Gβγ in the induction of DHPG-LTD. To address it, we loaded Gβγ (100 nm) directly into the cells. After establishing the whole cell configurations, EPSCs began to decrease and this “run-down” stabilized after ∼20 min at ∼40% reduction (Fig. 3C1). This manipulation completely blocked the induction of DHPG-LTD (102.9 ± 4.6%, n = 6; p < 0.05), whereas interleaved cells recorded from a similar period of time with the heat-inactivated Gβγ exhibited stable LTD (63.5 ± 4.8%, n = 5; p > 0.05) (Fig. 3C2). Thus, Gβγ seems to contribute the induction of DHPG-LTD. Rap1 Mediates DHPG-induced p38 MAPK Activation—Having confirmed the role of Gβγ and p38 MAPK in DHPG-LTD, we next identified the signaling components involved in Gβγ-mediated p38 MAPK activation. Among many potential intracellular factors involved in p38 MAPK activation, we investigated the potential role of two small GTPases, Rap1 and Ras. In several experimental models, the family of small GTPase plays a key role in the activation of MAPK. Recently, it has been reported that Rap1, a Ras-like small GTPase, contributes to the induction of activity-induced LTD via phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, whereas Ras mediates the signaling activated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II that is responsible for long term potentiation (34Zhu J.J. Qin Y. Zhao M. van Aelst L. Malinow R. Cell. 2002; 110: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 35Morozov A. Muzzio I.A. Bourtchouladze R. Van-Strien N. Lapidus K. Yin D. Winder D.G. Adams J.P. Sweatt J.D. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 2003; 39: 309-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rap1 plays any role in mediating DHPG-LTD, we examined the induction of DHPG-LTD in the presence of membrane-permeable geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor, GGTI-298, which blocks Rap1 activation (IC50 = 3 μm) by preventing its recruitment to plasma membrane (36Coxon F.P. Helfrich M.H. Larijani B. Muzylak M. Dunford J.E. Marshall D. McKinnon A.D. Nesbitt S.A. Horton M.A. Seabra M.C. Ebetino F.H. Rogers M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48213-48222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, GGTI-298 (10 μm) abolished the ability of DHPG to induce LTD (97.8 ± 3.6%, n = 6; p < 0.05). In contrast, pretreatment of the slices with Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 (10 μm) (IC50 = 0.1 μm) (37Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) failed to affect the induction of DHPG-LTD (66.3 ± 4.5%, n = 6, p > 0.05, Fig. 4B). Similarly, GGTI-298 (10 μm) largely blocked the increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation following the DHPG application (Fig. 4C). In contrast, FTI-277 (10 μm) had no effect on the DHPG-induced increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation. To directly demonstrate that Rap1 participates in the signaling pathway responsible for DHPG-induced activation of p38 MAPK, we investigated the activation of Rap1 by means of a pull-down assay using the glutathione S-transferase-RalRBD fusion protein. Application of DHPG (50 μm) for 5 min induced a large increase in the amount of Rap1-GTP (62.8 ± 5.7%, n = 5, p < 0.05, Fig. 4D). This DHPG-induced Rap1 activation was blocked by the MPEP (10 μm) but not by the LY367385 (100 μm). In contrast to Rap1, we found that the level of GTP-Ras was not changed following DHPG application (105.3 ± 4.9%, n = 4; p > 0.05) (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that p38 MAPK acts as a downstream target of Rap1 to induce DHPG-LTD. DHPG-induced Activation of p38 MAPK by Gβγ and Rap1 Occurs at the level of MKK3/6 —In vivo, p38 MAPK can be activated by upstream MKK3 and MKK6 (38Yamauchi J. Tsujimoto G. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23362-23372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, any changes in MKK3/6 phosphorylation should result in changes in p38 MAPK activity. As shown in Fig. 4F, phospho-MKK3/6 was readily detected in untreated control slices and levels were increased to 136.3 ± 6.5% (n = 6) of control following DHPG application. This DHPG-induced increase in phospho-MKK3/6 was fully prevented by pretreatment of the slices with GGTI-298 (10 μm) but not by FTI-277 (10 μm). Thus, MKK3/6 seems to be an immediate upstream signaling component of p38 MAPK to underlie DHPG-LTD. Involvement of p38 MAPK-stimulated AMPA Receptor Endocytotic Trafficking in the DHPG-LTD—What is the mechanism that couples an activation of p38 MAPK to synaptic depression? It has recently been demonstrated that DHPG-LTD appears to require loss of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane surface (12Snyder E.M. Philpot B.D. Huber K.M. Dong X. Fallon J.R. Bear M.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 13Xiao M.Y. Zhou Q. Nicoll R.A. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 664-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and p38 MAPK has been identified to have the ability to accelerate the endocytosis trafficking by stimulating the activity of GDI in extracting Rab5 from endosomal membranes and forming a GDI·Rab5 complex (39Cavalli V. Vilbois F. Corti M. Marcote M.J. Tamura K. Karin M. Arkinstall S. Gruenberg J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This complex is required for ligand sequestration into clathrin-coated pits. The potential involvement of p38 MAPK in DHPG-induced loss of surface AMPA receptors was first investigated. In agreement with previous reports (12Snyder E.M. Philpot B.D. Huber K.M. Dong X. Fallon J.R. Bear M.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 13Xiao M.Y. Zhou Q. Nicoll R.A. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 664-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), application of DHPG (50 μm) caused a significant reduction in surface expression of AMPA receptors (GluR1: 65.6 ± 6.9% of control slices, n = 5; p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A). This DHPG-induced loss of surface AMPA receptors was completely blocked by SB203580 (1 μm) and GGTI-298 (10 μm). We finally assessed whether p38 MAPK contributes to regulate of endoc"
https://openalex.org/W2012960469,"The role of lipoproteins secreted by cortical glial cells in axon growth of central nervous system (CNS) neurons was investigated. We first established compartmented cultures of CNS neurons (retinal ganglion cells). Addition of glial cell-conditioned medium (GCM) to distal axons increased the rate of axon extension by ∼50%. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in glial cells diminished the secretion of cholesterol and apolipoprotein E, and prevented the growth stimulatory effect of GCM. When glia-derived lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein E were provided to distal axons, axon extension was stimulated to the same extent as by GCM. In contrast, addition of lipoproteins to cell bodies failed to enhance growth. The growth stimulatory effect of glial lipoproteins was abrogated in the presence of receptor-associated protein, RAP, indicating involvement of receptor(s) of the low density lipoprotein receptor family in stimulation of axonal extension.

In intact animals, neuronal cell bodies and axon terminals often reside far apart in distinct environments. The issue of spatial separation of cell bodies and axons was addressed for peripheral neurons by the establishment of sympathetic neuron cultures in which cell bodies were plated in one compartment and axons extended into adjacent compartments (1Campenot R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4516-4518Google Scholar). Consequently, cell bodies and distal axons could be exposed to independent fluid environments and the rate of axon extension accurately measured. Our objective was to culture CNS neurons in compartmented cultures and identify factors that stimulated axon growth. The most numerous cell types in the brain are glial cells: oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Glial cells interact with neurons and are associated with neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission (2Vernadakis A. Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 49: 185-214Google Scholar) (3Barres B.A. Barde Y.

Cerebrospinal fluid, which is separated from the plasma compartment by the blood-brain barrier, contains a population of lipoproteins distinct from those in plasma (12LaDu M.J. Shah J.A. Reardon C.A.

Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Google Scholar). For example, apoE synthesis in glial cells dramatically increases after injury to the central (20Snipes G.J. McGuire C.B. Norden J.J. Freeman J.A. Proc.

ApoE is also a ligand for receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) superfamily, several of which (e.g. LDLr, LDLr-related protein, very low density lipoprotein receptor and apoE2 receptor) are expressed in CNS neurons (23Herz J. Beffert U. Nature Neuroscience. 2000; 1: 51-58Google Scholar). The three most common apoE alleles in humans are E2, E3, and E4 (24Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Google Scholar). Inheritance of the apoE4 allele is the strongest known risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (25Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D.

In addition, in various neuronal cell lines, apoE3 either stimulates axon growth or is neutral, whereas apoE4 is either neutral or inhibits growth (28Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Google Scholar, 29Bellosta S. Nathan B. Orth M. Dong L.-M. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol.

We have successfully established compartmented cultures of CNS neurons for the first time and have demonstrated that apoE-containing lipoproteins secreted by glial cells enhance axon growth of CNS neurons. Isolation and Culture of Rat Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC)—RGC were isolated from rats by the method of Barres et al. (32Barres B.A. Silverstein B.E. Corey D.P. Chun L.L.Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 791-803Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, retinal tissue was dissected from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Twelve retina were combined and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 16.5 units/ml papain (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). Tissues were triturated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.15% trypsin inhibitor (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), 0.15% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and rabbit anti-macrophage antiserum (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) until retinas were dissociated. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 200 × g then suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% trypsin inhibitor and 1% bovine serum albumin. The retinal cell suspension was centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in panning buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin and 5 μg/ml insulin). Macrophages and microglia were removed by incubation of the cell suspension for 40 min at room temperature on a panning plate (150-mm Petri dish) coated with goat anti-rabbit IgG. Medium containing the non-adherent cells was filtered through a 15-μm Nitex filter (SEFAR America Ltd., Kansas City, MO) to remove cell aggregates. The filtrate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a second panning plate (100-mm Petri dish) coated with goat anti-mouse IgM μ-chain-specific antibody (Pierce) and mouse anti-Thy1.1 antibody (specific for RGC) generated from T11D7e2 cells (American Type Culture Collection). The panning plate was washed 8–10 times with phosphate-buffered saline. Adherent cells were released from the panning plate by incubation with 0.125% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline for 8 min at 37 °C. Fetal bovine serum (30%) in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) was added to the suspension, and RGC were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min. The pellet was then resuspended in base medium (Neurobasal medium containing glutamine (2 mm), insulin (5 μg/ml), N-acetylcysteine (60 μg/ml), progesterone (62 ng/ml), putrescine (16 μg/ml), sodium selenite (40 ng/ml), bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml), triiodothyronine (40 ng/ml), transferrin (0.1 mg/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm) and 10 μm forskolin (Sigma)) to which was added 25 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), 50 ng/ml ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor (PeproTech Inc.), 50 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (PeproTech Inc.), 2% B27 (Invitrogen) (32Barres B.A. Silverstein B.E. Corey D.P. Chun L.L.Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 791-803Google Scholar), as well as 0.2% methylcellulose (33Campenot R.B. Martin G. Federoff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 49-57Google Scholar). Culture dishes (35 mm) were coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and laminin (Sigma) (32Barres B.A. Silverstein B.E. Corey D.P. Chun L.L.Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 791-803Google Scholar). Twenty parallel tracks were made by scratching the surface substratum of the dishes (33Campenot R.B. Martin G. Federoff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 49-57Google Scholar). The scratched area was wetted with base medium containing the growth factors listed above. A Teflon divider (width ∼ 0.5 mm), which creates 3 compartments (33Campenot R.B. Martin G. Federoff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 49-57Google Scholar), was sealed to the dish with silicone grease applied from a 20-gauge needle. Isolated RGC were plated in the center chamber of the compartmented dishes at a density of 10,000–12,000 cells/dish in base medium containing the growth factors listed above. The side compartments contained the same medium as the center compartment except that basic fibroblast growth factor was omitted and the concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was increased to 75 ng/ml. Within 5–7 days, axons crossed under the silicone grease barriers into the left and right side compartments. Medium was changed every 3 days, and neurons remained viable for at least 3 weeks. Measurement of Axon Extension—Distal axons were mechanically removed (axotomized) from the side compartments of 10-day-old RGC with a jet of sterile water delivered with a syringe through a 22-gauge needle. The wash was repeated three times after which fresh medium was added. Extension of axons was measured as the length of the farthest extending axon using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped with a MD2 microscope digitizer (Accustage Corp. Minneapolis, MN) (33Campenot R.B. Martin G. Federoff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 49-57Google Scholar). Culture of Glial Cells—Glial cells were isolated from 1-day-old rats (14Gong J.S. Kobayashi M. Hayashi H. Zou K. Sawamura N. Fujita S.C. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29919-29926Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebral cortex was digested by trituration in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% trypsin. Dissociated glial cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks (Falcon, BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 7–9 days, glial cells were harvested from the dish by treatment with 0.125% trypsin, then replated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum until use (< one month). The glial cell preparation was highly enriched in astrocytes (90.3%; total number of cells = 865) as determined by staining the cell preparation with antibodies directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) as a marker of astrocytes, and with Hoechst dye as a stain for nuclei. Isolation of Lipoproteins from Glial-conditioned Medium—The culture medium was removed from the glial cells, which were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, after which base medium (BM) was added. Conditioned medium was collected from glial cells that had been cultured in BM for 3 days (34Nagler K. Mauch D.H. Pfrieger F.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 533: 665-679Google Scholar). The medium was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g to remove cell debris. The supernatant was designated glial cell-conditioned medium (GCM). Lipoproteins were isolated from GCM on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (14Gong J.S. Kobayashi M. Hayashi H. Zou K. Sawamura N. Fujita S.C. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29919-29926Google Scholar) consisting of the following layers of sucrose solutions: 2 ml of density 1.30 g/ml; 3 ml of density 1.20 g/ml; 3 ml of density 1.10 g/ml; 4 ml of culture medium of density 1.006 g/ml. The gradient was centrifuged in a SW40-Ti rotor (Beckmann) at 4 °C for 48 h at 160,000 × g. Twelve 1.0-ml fractions were removed from the top of the tube and subjected to immunoblotting as described below. The density of each fraction was determined as the weight of 1.0 ml. Fractions containing apoE were identified (typically fractions 5–8), then combined, washed three times, and concentrated in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) using an Amicon Ultra filter (100-kDa molecular weight cutoff; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The cholesterol concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/ml with base medium. For measurement of the cholesterol content, the concentrated lipoprotein fraction was extracted twice with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v). The solvents were evaporated, and bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide was added for 20 min at 50 °C to generate the trimethylsilyl derivative of cholesterol. The solvent was evaporated, and the sample was resuspended in hexane for analysis by gas-liquid chromatography (35Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1154-1163Google Scholar). For some experiments, lipoprotein-depleted GCM was prepared. GCM (5.0 ml) was gently mixed for 30 min with 50 mg of Cab-o-sil (colloidal silica that avidly binds lipoproteins, purchased from Sigma, Ref. 36Vance D.E. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 792: 39-47Google Scholar). The Cab-o-sil, which contained bound lipoproteins, was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g. The Cab-o-sil-treated GCM contained no detectable apoE or apoJ according to immunoblotting with anti-apoE antibodies and anti-apoJ antibodies, as described below. In some experiments, recombinant rat receptor-associated protein (RAP; from PROGEN (Heidelberg, Germany)) was added to the lipoprotein preparation. Immunocytochemistry—The Teflon divider was removed from compartmented cultures of RGC, and cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The RGC were then fixed by treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The neurons were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-bovine tau-1 antibody (dilution 1:750; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and rabbit polyclonal anti-rat MAP2 antibody (dilution 1:1,000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The RGC were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:200, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:200, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted with anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Photographs were taken using a Leica DMIRE2 microscope. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were dissolved in sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with goat polyclonal anti-human apoE antibody (dilution 1:1,500, from Biodesign, Saco, ME) for 16 h at 4 °C, and subsequently with peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-goat IgG antibody (dilution 1:5,000, from Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Rat Sympathetic Neurons—Neurons were dissociated from the superior cervical ganglia of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured in compartmented culture dishes (37Campenot R.B. Stevenson B.R. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1992: 275-298Google Scholar, 38Vance J.E. Pan D. Campenot R.B. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 329-337Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison, unless otherwise noted. Establishment of Compartmented Cultures of Retinal Ganglion Cells—We selected retinal ganglion cells (RGC) as suitable CNS neurons for compartmented cultures because these neurons produce long axons in vivo and are a well-characterized type of CNS neuron. RGC were isolated from retinas of 1-day-old rats using the “panning” method of Barres et al. (32Barres B.A. Silverstein B.E. Corey D.P. Chun L.L.Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 791-803Google Scholar). Culture dishes (35 mm) were coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin and were divided into 3 compartments by a Teflon divider that was sealed to the dish with silicone grease (33Campenot R.B. Martin G. Federoff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 49-57Google Scholar). The neurons (10,000–12,000 cells/dish) were plated in the center compartment and produced abundant axon growth into distal compartments within 5–7 days, providing the opportunity to measure the rate of axon extension and perform biochemical analyses in studies analogous to those using compartmented cultures of sympathetic neurons (33Campenot R.B. Martin G. Federoff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 49-57Google Scholar, 35Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J.

The axons extended at a rate of ∼0.5 mm/day into side compartments that contained medium supplemented with growth factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor) (Fig. 1). The center compartment housed cell bodies and proximal axons (stained with anti-Tau-1 antibody, red), as well as dendrites (stained with anti-MAP2 antibody, green), whereas the two side compartments contained distal axons alone (stained with anti-tau-1 antibody, red) without cell bodies or dendrites. The neurons, which can be maintained under defined conditions for several weeks, were usually cultured for ∼10 days prior to the start of the experiments. Glial Cell-conditioned Medium Promotes Axon Extension— To determine if factors released by glial cells stimulate axon growth of RGC we cultured glial cells from the cerebral cortex of 1-day-old rats (14Gong J.S. Kobayashi M. Hayashi H. Zou K. Sawamura N. Fujita S.C. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29919-29926Google Scholar) for 3 days and collected the glial cell-conditioned medium (GCM) (34Nagler K. Mauch D.H. Pfrieger F.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 533: 665-679Google Scholar). Distal axons were removed (axotomized) from side compartments of the RGC cultures then GCM, or base medium with or without growth factors, was added to the side compartments. Axon extension was measured each day for 4 days. Addition of GCM to regenerating axons increased the rate of axon extension by ∼50% compared with that of base medium with or without growth factors (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when GCM was added to the center compartment that contained cell bodies with proximal axons, the rate of extension of distal axons was the same as when base medium, with or without growth factors, was added (data not shown). Furthermore, when base medium was supplemented with rat serum (1 μg of cholesterol/ml) or fetal bovine serum (1 μg of cholesterol/ml), and supplied to distal axons of RGC, axon extension was the same as that of cells cultured in base medium alone (Fig. 2B). Inhibition of Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase in Glial Cells Abrogates the Ability of GCM to Stimulate Axon Extension—Since glial cells secrete cholesterol-containing lipoproteins, we investigated whether or not lipids and/or lipoproteins released by glial cells were responsible for the observed stimulation of axon growth. Glial cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations (0–1,000 nm) of compactin, which inhibits the biosynthesis of cholesterol and non-sterol metabolites of mevalonate at the step catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (41Yoshino G. Kazumi T. Iwai M. Iwatani I. Matsuba K. Kasama T. Matsushita M. Otsuki M. Baba S. Atherosclerosis. 1988; 71: 95-101Google Scholar). The culture medium was collected and the amount of apoE and apoJ in the medium determined by immunoblotting. The cholesterol concentration of the medium was measured by gas-liquid chromatography. Compactin inhibited the secretion of apoE (Fig. 3A) and cholesterol (Fig. 3B) from glial cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but did not inhibit apoJ secretion (Fig. 3A). Because lipoprotein particles containing apoJ are relatively lipid-poor compared with those containing apoE (12LaDu M.J. Shah J.A. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Bu G. Hu J. Guo L. van Eldick L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33974-33980Google Scholar, 42DeMattos R.B. Rudel L.L. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 976-987Google Scholar) we speculate that the secretion of apoJ from glial cells might not be sensitive to inhibition of the synthesis of cholesterol and/or non-serol metabolites of mevalonate. Incubation of glial cells with various concentrations of compactin attenuated the ability of GCM derived from the compactin-treated cells to stimulate axon extension, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). However, neither cholesterol nor apoE3 alone, supplied at concentrations equivalent to those in GCM, enhanced axon extension (Fig. 4). Furthermore, fetal bovine serum and rat serum, which contained cholesterol and apoE, failed to stimulate axon growth (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the results of our previous studies in rat sympathetic neurons (43Posse de Chaves E.I. Rusiñol A.E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30766-30773Google Scholar), the addition of 1,000 nm compactin in base medium to distal axons alone did not inhibit axon extension (data not shown). These data suggested that lipoproteins containing cholesterol and apoE might have been the component of GCM that stimulated axon extension.Fig. 4Cholesterol or apoE alone does not enhance axon extension. Compartmented cultures of retinal ganglion cells were axotomized and human apoE3 (1 or 10 μg/ml from PanVera, Madison, WI) or cholesterol (1 or 10 μg/ml in ethanolic solution) was added to distal axons in base medium. Axon extension was measured after 4 days. Data are means ± S.E. (n = 90) of 30 tracks/dish from triplicate dishes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ApoE-containing Lipoproteins Promote Axon Extension of RGC—The CNS contains a spectrum of apoE-containing lipoprotein particles of density in the range of high density lipoproteins (density: 1.06–1.21 g/ml). These lipoproteins are distinct from the population of lipoproteins in plasma (18Koch S. Donarski N. Goetze K. Kreckel M. Stuerenburg H.J. Buhmann C. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1143-1151Google Scholar, 30Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y. Daugherty A. Holtzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Google Scholar, 44Beisiegel U. Spector A.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 243-244Google Scholar). Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of GCM and subsequent immunoblotting revealed that apoE was primarily present in lipoprotein fractions of density 1.07–1.12 g/ml (Fig. 5). The apoE-containing fractions were combined, and the cholesterol concentration was measured by gas-liquid chromatography. The cholesterol concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/ml (this preparation was designated LP-E), which was the same as that in GCM. When BM was supplemented with LP-E and added to distal axons of RGC, axon extension was stimulated to the same extent (i.e. by ∼50% after 4 days) as with GCM (Fig. 6A). However, when cell bodies were incubated with the same concentration of LP-E, axon extension was not increased (Fig. 6B). Moreover, provision of LP-E to distal axons of compartmented cultures of peripheral neurons (rat sympathetic neurons) failed to stimulate axon extension (Fig. 7).Fig. 6LP-E promote axon growth of RGC. A, RGC were axotomized and base medium (BM, open circles), GCM (cholesterol content = 1 μg/ml; filled circles) or base medium with LP-E (LP-E, final cholesterol concentration = 1 μg/ml; filled triangles) was added to the side compartments. B, center compartment alone, containing cell bodies with proximal axons, was incubated in base medium containing B-27 and growth factors without (-LP-E) or with (+LP-E) glial cell lipoproteins (1 μg/ml cholesterol). Axon extension was measured. In panels A and B data are means ± S.E. (n = 90) of 30 tracks/dish in triplicate dishes.

https://openalex.org/W2036860085,"We report on the synthesis, biological function, and a plausible mode of action of a new group of lipopeptides with potent antifungal and antibacterial activities. These lipopeptides are derived from positively charged peptides containing d- and l-amino acids (diastereomers) that are palmitoylated (PA) at their N terminus. The peptides investigated have the sequence K4X7W, where X designates Gly, Ala, Val, or Leu (designated d-X peptides). The data revealed that PA-d-G and PA-d-A gained potent antibacterial and antifungal activity despite the fact that both parental peptides were completely devoid of any activity toward microorganisms and model phospholipid membranes. In contrast, PA-d-L lost the potent antibacterial activity of the parental peptide but gained and preserved partial antifungal activity. Interestingly, both d-V and its palmitoylated analog were inactive toward bacteria, and only the palmitoylated peptide was highly potent toward yeast. Both PA-d-L and PA-d-V lipopeptides were also endowed with hemolytic activity. Mode of action studies were performed by using tryptophan fluorescence and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as transmembrane depolarization assays with bacteria and fungi. The data suggest that the lipopeptides act by increasing the permeability of the cell membrane and that differences in their potency and target specificity are the result of differences in their oligomeric state and ability to dissociate and insert into the cytoplasmic membrane. These results provide insight regarding a new approach of modulating hydrophobicity and the self-assembly of non-membrane interacting peptides in order to endow them with both antibacterial and antifungal activities urgently needed to combat bacterial and fungal infections. We report on the synthesis, biological function, and a plausible mode of action of a new group of lipopeptides with potent antifungal and antibacterial activities. These lipopeptides are derived from positively charged peptides containing d- and l-amino acids (diastereomers) that are palmitoylated (PA) at their N terminus. The peptides investigated have the sequence K4X7W, where X designates Gly, Ala, Val, or Leu (designated d-X peptides). The data revealed that PA-d-G and PA-d-A gained potent antibacterial and antifungal activity despite the fact that both parental peptides were completely devoid of any activity toward microorganisms and model phospholipid membranes. In contrast, PA-d-L lost the potent antibacterial activity of the parental peptide but gained and preserved partial antifungal activity. Interestingly, both d-V and its palmitoylated analog were inactive toward bacteria, and only the palmitoylated peptide was highly potent toward yeast. Both PA-d-L and PA-d-V lipopeptides were also endowed with hemolytic activity. Mode of action studies were performed by using tryptophan fluorescence and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as transmembrane depolarization assays with bacteria and fungi. The data suggest that the lipopeptides act by increasing the permeability of the cell membrane and that differences in their potency and target specificity are the result of differences in their oligomeric state and ability to dissociate and insert into the cytoplasmic membrane. These results provide insight regarding a new approach of modulating hydrophobicity and the self-assembly of non-membrane interacting peptides in order to endow them with both antibacterial and antifungal activities urgently needed to combat bacterial and fungal infections. Together with the growing number of individuals with impaired host defenses, invasive mycoses have emerged as major causes of morbidity and mortality in the last decade (1Groll A.H. Shah P.M.

Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 272-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Although the spectrum of fungal pathogens has changed, the vast majority of invasive fungal infections are still due to Aspergillus and Candida species (4Ellis M. Richardson M. de Pauw B. Hosp. Med. 2000; 61: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Odds F.C. Brown A.J. Gow N.A.

Because of their eukaryotic nature fungal cells have only a restricted set of unique targets. This makes it difficult to selectively target fungal cells. Two major families have been used for more than two decades to combat fungi; these include azoles, which inhibit sterol formation, and polyenes, which bind to mature membrane sterols. However, the development of fluconazole resistance among different pathogenic strains and the high toxicity of amphotericin B (7Alexander B.D. Perfect J.R. Drugs. 1997; 54: 657-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Mukherjee P.K. Chandra J. Kuhn D.M. Ghannoum M.A. Infect.

Infect. 2003; 53: 243-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have prompted the studies of new antifungal agents with new modes of actions. The investigation of antimicrobial peptides, from a wide range of biological sources, and their synthetic derivatives is a novel inroad to new antifungal agents. Antimicrobial peptides are gene-encoded and are part of the innate immunity to the microbial invasion of microorganisms of all types. The most studied group are short (<40 amino acids), positively charged, linear peptides whose possible mechanisms have been reviewed in detail (10Bechinger B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 157-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 11Blondelle S.E. Perez-Paya E. Houghten R.A. Antimicrob.

It is believed that most of these peptides are targeted to biological membranes, increase their permeability, and kill the cells. However, other additional mechanisms were proposed for some of them (17Hancock R.E. Rozek A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 206: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies that investigated the mode of action of native antimicrobial peptides that are also endowed with antifungal activity are limited and included, for example, LL-37 and dermaseptines (18Oren Z. Lerman J.C. Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 19Ghosh J.K. Shaool D. Guillaud P. Ciceron L. Mazier D. Kustanovich I.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10951-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These studies showed that they self-associate in solution and reach the membrane as oligomers (18Oren Z. Lerman J.C. Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 19Ghosh J.K. Shaool D. Guillaud P. Ciceron L. Mazier D. Kustanovich I. Shai Y. Mor A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10951-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported on a new approach for increasing the hydrophobicity and self-assembly in a solution of antibacterial peptides that are not active on fungi (21Avrahami D. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2254-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We showed that peptide oligomerization in solution is crucial for the peptide to endow antifungal activity. In another study we examined the effect of multiple substitutions of different amino acids regarding the structure, binding, and biological function of positively charged diastereomers (include both d- and l-amino acids) of linear lytic peptides (22Avrahami D. Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12591-12603Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For this purpose, a group of diastereomeric peptides with the sequence K4X7W were synthesized, where X designates one of the aliphatic amino acids, Gly, Ala, Val, or Leu. The results revealed that the peptides containing Ala and Gly are not active against microorganisms, concomitant with their inability to bind membranes. This is in agreement with the notion that a threshold of hydrophobicity along with a defined structure is required for antimicrobial activity. Here, we conjugated palmitic acid to this series of diastereomers and investigated their biological function and mode of action. Very interestingly, we found that the most potent antibacterial and antifungal lipopeptides are those derived from the peptides containing Ala and Gly. Studies on the function and structure of the peptides together with their interaction with bacteria, fungi, and model membranes shed light on their mode of action. Furthermore, these studies demonstrated that a lipophilic tail can compensate for the hydrophobicity and amphipathic structure of the peptidic chain previously shown to be a prerequisite for antimicrobial activity. Materials—4-Methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) Rink amide resin was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem AG (Switzerland). Other reagents used for peptide synthesis include trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), piperidine (Merck), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Sigma), N-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (Aldrich), and 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and dimethylformamide (peptide synthesis grade, Bio-lab Ltd.). Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; Fmoc, fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; ATR-FTIR, attenuated total reflectance Fouriertransform infrared; CD, circular dichroism; hRBC, human red blood cells; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; diS-C3-5, 3-3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide; PA, palmitoylated. phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ergosterol were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, UK). 3-3′-Dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (diS-C3-5) and calcein were purchased from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared in double-distilled water. Amphotericin B and trypsin (bovine pancreas) were purchased from Sigma. RPMI 1640 was purchased from Biological Industries (Beit Haemek, Israel). Proteinase K (fungal) was purchased from Beckman Instruments. Peptide Synthesis, Acylation, and Purification—Peptides were synthesized by a Fmoc solid phase method on Rink amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin using an ABI 433A automatic peptide synthesizer. The lipophilic acid was attached to the N terminus of a resin-bound peptide using standard Fmoc chemistry. Briefly, after removal of the Fmoc from the N terminus of the peptide with a solution of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide, the fatty acid (7 eq, 1 m in dimethylformamide)) was coupled to the resin under similar conditions used for the coupling of an amino acid. The peptides were cleaved from the resin by 95% trifluoroacetic acid and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 (for non-lipidic peptides) or C4 (for the lipopeptides) Bio-Rad semi-preparative column (250 × 10 mm, 300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size). The purified peptides were shown to be homogeneous (>99%) by analytical reverse phase HPLC. The elution time of the lipopeptides increased by ∼20 min, indicating an increase in hydrophobicity owing to the attachment of the fatty acid. Electrospray mass spectroscopy was used to confirm their molecular weight, and amino acid analysis was used to confirm the composition of the peptidic moiety. Antifungal Activity—The antifungal activity of the peptides and their lipophilic acid conjugated analogs was preformed according to the conditions of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards document M27-A. The peptides were examined in sterile 96-well plates (Nunc F96 microtiter plates) in a final volume of 200 μl as follows. 100 μl of a suspension containing fungi at a concentration of 2 × 103 colony-forming units/ml in culture medium (RPMI 1640, 0.165 m MOPS, pH 7.0, with l-glutamine, without NaHCO3 medium) was added to 100 μl of water containing the peptide in serial 2-fold dilutions. The fungi were incubated for 24 h for opportunistic fungi or 48–72 h for Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans at 35 °C using a Binder KB115 incubator. Growth inhibition was determined by measuring the absorbance at 620 nm in a microplate autoreader El309 (Bio-tek Instruments). Antifungal activity is expressed as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), the concentration at which no growth was observed. The fungi used were Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 26430, Aspergillus flavus ATCC 9643, Aspergillus niger ATCC 9642, C. albicans ATCC 10231, and C. neoformans ATCC MYA-422. Antibacterial Activity—The antibacterial activity of the peptides was examined in sterile 96-well plates (Nunc F96 microtiter plates) in a final volume of 100 μl as follows. Aliquots (50 μl) of a suspension containing bacteria at a concentration of 106 colony-forming units/ml in culture medium (LB medium) were added to 50 μl of water containing the peptide in serial 2-fold dilutions in water (prepared from a stock solution of 1 mg/ml peptide in water). Inhibition of growth was determined by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm with a Microplate autoreader El309 (Bio-tek Instruments) after an incubation of 18–20 h at 37 °C. Antibacterial activities were expressed as the MIC, the concentration at which no growth was observed after 18–20 h of incubation. The bacteria used were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P. Hemolysis of Human Red Blood Cells (hRBC)—Fresh hRBC with EDTA were rinsed 3 times with PBS (35 mm phosphate buffer/0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.3) by centrifugation for 10 min at 800 × g and resuspended in PBS. Lipopeptides dissolved in PBS were then added to 50 μl of a solution of the stock hRBC in PBS to reach a final volume of 100 μl (final erythrocyte concentration, 4% v/v). The resulting suspension was incubated with agitation for 60 min at 37 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The release of hemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 540 nm. Controls for 0 hemolysis (blank) and 100% hemolysis consisted of hRBC suspended in PBS and Triton 1%, respectively. Preparation of Liposomes—Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by sonication as described earlier (23Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dry lipids were dissolved in CHCl3:MeOH (2:1 v/v). The solvents were then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and then lyophilized overnight. The lipids were resuspended in the appropriate buffer (7 mg/ml) with vortexing, and the resulting lipid dispersions were sonicated (10–30 min) in a bath-type sonicator (G1125SP1 sonicator, Laboratory Supplies Company Inc.), until the turbidity had cleared. The vesicles were visualized using a JEOL JEM 100B electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Tokyo, Japan). Lipid films were prepared from a mixture of zwitterionic phospholipids and ergosterol (PC/PE/PI/ergosterol, 5:2.5: 2.5:1 w/w), a lipid composition used to mimic the major components of the outer leaflet of C. albicans (24Schneiter R. Brugger B. Sandhoff R. Zellnig G. Leber A. Lampl M. Athenstaedt K. Hrastnik C. Eder S. Daum G. Paltauf F. Wieland F.T. Kohlwein S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—The CD spectra of the lipopeptides were measured with a Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter. The spectra were scanned with a thermostatic quartz optical cell with a path length of 1 mm. Each spectrum was recorded in an average time of 5 s at steps of 0.2 nm at a wavelength range of 260 to 190 nm. The lipopeptides were scanned at a concentration of 10–100 μm in PBS (35 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.3) and 100 μm in the presence of 1% lysophosphatidylcholine micelles. Fractional helicities (25Wu C.S. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar) were calculated as, [θ]222-[θ]2220[θ]222100-[θ]2220(Eq. 1) where [θ]222 is the experimentally observed mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, and values for [θ]2220 and [θ]222100, corresponding to 0 and 100% helix content at 222 nm, are estimated to be –2,000 and –32,000 deg·cm2/dmol, respectively (25Wu C.S. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In Vivo Transmembrane Potential Depolarization Assay in Bacteria and Yeast—Membrane destabilization, which results in the collapse of transmembrane potential, was detected fluorimetrically by using a fluorescence dye (27Sims P.J. Waggoner A.S. Wang C.H. Hoffmann J.R. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3315-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) (see details below for bacteria and yeasts). The dye binds the plasma membrane owing to the cell transmembrane potential, resulting in a quenching of the dye fluorescence. Peptide-induced membrane permeation caused a dissipation of the transmembrane potential that was monitored by an increase in fluorescence due to release of the dye. Experiments were performed in sterile 96-well plates (Nunc F96 microtiter plates) in a final volume of 100 μl as follows. 50 μl of the cell suspensions and the dye were added to 50 μl of water containing the peptide in serial 2-fold dilutions. Membrane depolarization was monitored by an increase in the fluorescence of diS-C3-5 (excitation wavelength λex = 622 nm, emission wavelength λem = 670 nm). Transmembrane Potential Depolarization on the yeast C. neoformans—The assay was performed with intact yeast. More specifically, cells were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C in a SS-34 rotor after incubation at 35 °C with agitation for 24 h in RPMI buffer (RPMI 1640, 0.165 m MOPS, pH 7.0, with l-glutamine and without NaHCO3). The cells were resuspended in PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) to an inoculum of 4 × 103 colony-forming units/ml. Cells were incubated with 1 μm diS-C3-5 followed by fluorescence dequenching until a stable base line was achieved (∼50 min), indicating the incorporation of the dye onto the yeast membrane. Transmembrane Potential Depolarization in E. coli—Spheroplasts of the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli D21 were prepared by the osmotic shock procedure (28Frate M.C. Lietz E.J. Santos J. Rossi J.P. Fink A.L. Ermacora M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3836-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C with agitation to the mid-log phase. Cells from cultures grown (A600 = 0.8) were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with 10 mm Tris/H2SO4, 25% sucrose, pH 7.5. Cells were resuspended in the washing buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. After 10 min of incubation at 20 °C with rotary mixing, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended immediately in cold (0 °C) water. After 10 min of incubation at 4 °C with rotary mixing, the spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation. The spheroplasts were then resuspended to A600 of 0.05 in a buffer containing 20 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, 1 m KCl, pH 7.3. The cells were incubated with 1 μm diS-C3-5 followed by fluorescence dequenching until a stable base line was achieved (∼2 h), indicating the incorporation of the dye into the bacteria membrane. ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy—Spectra were obtained with a Bruker equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a deuterated triglyceride sulfate detector and coupled with an ATR device after removing the trifluoroacetate (CF3COO–) counterions, as has been described in detail in other studies (21Avrahami D. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2254-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The sample was hydrated by exposure of the samples to an excess of deuterium oxide (D2O). The H/D exchange was considered complete due to the complete shift of the amide II band. Any contribution of D2O vapor to the absorbance spectra near the amide I peak region was eliminated by subtraction of the spectra of pure lipids equilibrated with D2O under the same conditions. ATR-FTIR Data Analysis—To resolve overlapping bands, we processed the spectra using PEAKFIT™ (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) software. Second-derivative spectra were calculated to identify the positions of the component bands in the spectra. These wave numbers were used as initial parameters for curve fitting with gaussian component peaks. Positions, bandwidths, and amplitudes of the peaks were varied until a good agreement between the calculated sum of all components and the experimental spectra was achieved (r2 > 0.999). The relative amounts of different secondary structure elements were estimated by dividing the areas of individual peaks assigned to a particular secondary structure by the whole area of the resulting amide I band. Analysis of the Polarized ATR-FTIR Spectra—The ATR electric fields of incident light were calculated (29Ishiguro R. Kimura N. Takahashi S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9792-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Harrick N.J. Internal Reflection Spectroscopy. Inter-science, New York1967Google Scholar) as follows. Ex=2cosθsin2θ-n212(1-n212)[(1+n212)sin2θ-n212](Eq. 2) Ey=2cosθ1-n212(Eq. 3) Ez=2sinθcosθ(1-n212)[(1+n212)sin2θ-n212](Eq. 4) where θ is the angle of a light beam to the prism normal at the point of reflection (45°), and n21 = n2/n1 (n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of ZnSe, taken as 2.4, and the membrane sample, taken as 1.5, respectively). Under these conditions, Ex, Ey, and Ez are 1.09, 1.81, and 2.32, respectively. The electric field components together with the dichroic ratio (defined as the ratio between absorption of parallel (to a membrane plane), Ap, and perpendicularly polarized incident light, As) are used to calculate the orientation order parameter, f, by the formula f=2(Ex2-RATREy2+Ez2)(3cos2α-1)(Ex2RATREy2-2Ez2)(Eq. 5) where α is the angle between the transition moment of the amide I vibration of an α-helix and the helix axis. Several values ranging from 27° to 40° were reported in the literature for α (31Tamm L.K. Tatulian S.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 365-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). We used the values of 27° (29Ishiguro R. Kimura N. Takahashi S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9792-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Rothschild K.J. Clark N.A. Science. 1979; 204: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and 39° (33Bradbury E.M. Brown L. Downie A.R. Elliott A. Fraser R.D.B. Hanby W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 5: 230-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) for α. Lipid order parameters were obtained from the symmetric (∼2853 cm–1) and antisymmetric (∼2922 cm–1) lipid stretching modes using the same equations, setting α = 90° (29Ishiguro R. Kimura N. Takahashi S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9792-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—To determine the environment of the peptides we measured changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in PBS and upon binding to vesicles. A peptide (1 μm) was added to PBS or PBS containing 1 mm PC/PE/PI/ergosterol (5:2.5:2.5:1) small unilamellar vesicles. Emission spectra were measured on a SLM-Aminco Series 2 Spectrofluorimeter with the excitation set at 280 nm using a 4-nm slit and recorded in the range of 300–400 nm (4-nm slit). In these studies small unilamellar vesicles were used to minimize differential light-scattering effects, (34Mao D. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2667-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and the lipid/peptide molar ratio was kept high (1000:1) so spectral contributions of free peptide would be negligible. Four diastereomeric peptides were synthesized corresponding to the sequence KX3KWX2KX2K (X = Gly, Ala, Val, or Leu). They were designed to create a perfect amphipathic α-helical structure in their l form, as revealed by the Schiffer and Edmundson wheel projection (35Vogel H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Each diastereomer contained four d-amino acids at positions 3, 4, 8,10, when X = Ala, Val, or Leu, or alternatively at positions 1, 5, 9, 12, when X = Gly. A Trp was introduced in each peptide to serve as an intrinsic fluorescent probe. All four peptides were amidated at their C termini and conjugated at their N termini to palmitic acid (PA), a linear saturated chain of 16 carbons (CH3(CH2)14COOH). Table I shows the sequence of the peptides and their designations and molecular weights.Table IPeptide sequences and designationsPeptide designationPeptide formulaSequenceMolecular weightPA-d-GPA-d-K1,5,9,12-K4G7W(CH3(CH2)14CO)-KGGGKWGGKGGK-NH21353PA-d-APA-d-A3,4,8,10-K4A7W(CH3(CH2)14CO)-KAAAKWAAKAAK-NH21451PA-d-VPA-d-V3,4,8,10-K4V7W(CH3(CH2)14CO)-KVVVKWVVKVVK-NH21647PA-d-LPA-d-L3,4,8,10-K4L7W(CH3(CH2)14CO)-KLLLKWLLKLLK-NH21746 Open table in a new tab Antibacterial activity was assayed against three strains of Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and E. coli) and two strains of Gram-positive (S. aureus, B. subtilis) bacteria. Table II presents the MIC of the peptides against the tested bacteria. The data revealed that both d-V and its palmitoylated analog were devoid of antibacterial activity. However, in contrast to d-V, d-L was highly active toward all bacteria tested, but its palmitoylated analog was also devoid of antibacterial activity. Most interestingly, whereas both d-G and d-A were devoid of antibacterial activity, their palmitoylated analogs PA-d-G and PA-d-A were highly active toward all the bacteria tested.Table IIMIC of the peptides against bacteriaMIC (μm)Peptide designationGram-positive bacteriaGram-negative bacteriaS. aureus (ATCC 6538P)B. subtilis (ATCC 6051)P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853)A. baumannii (ATCC 19606)E. coli (ATCC 25922)d-G>100>100>100>100>100PA-d-G12.53.126.252525d-A>100>100>100>100>100PA-d-A12.53.126.256.256.25d-V>10060>100>100>100PA-d-V>100>100>100>100>100d-L301.257.51515PA-d-L>100ND>100>100>100 Open table in a new tab We further tested the antifungal activity of the peptides against representative pathogenic yeasts and fungi.

The data revealed that in all cases palmitoylation significantly increased the antifungal activity. Similar to the antibacterial activity, the lipopeptides PA-d-G and PA-d-A were the most active toward all the tested fungi and yeast, whereas the hydrophobic lipopeptides, PA-d-V and PA-d-L, are only partially active.Table IIIMIC of the peptides against yeasts and fungiMIC (μm)Peptide designationYeastFungiC. albicans (ATCC 10231)C. neoformans (ATCC MYA-422)A. fumigatus (ATCC 26430)A. flavus (ATCC 9643)A. niger (ATCC 9642)d-G>100>100>100>100>100PA-d-G3.1256.2512.51006.25d-A>100>100>100>100>100PA-d-A12.51.561008010d-V>10050>100>100>100PA-d-V3.1253.125>100>100>100d-L253.125>100>100>100PA-d-L>1003.1256.25>10025 Open table in a new tab The hemolytic activity of the lipopeptides against a highly diluted solution of human erythrocytes (4%) is shown in Fig. 1. The data revealed that PA-d-G and PA-d-A, which were highly active against bacteria, yeasts, and fungi showed low hemolytic activity. In contrast, PA-d-V and PA-d-L, which were practically devoid of antibacterial activity and only partially killed yeasts and fungi, were highly hemolytic. We monitored the fluorescence emission spectrum of the intrinsic tryptophan in aqueous solution. We found that the signal of the Trp emission in PA-d-V was fully quenched (Table IV), possibly because of close proximity between the tryptophans, which causes self-quenching. Because tryptophan is located along the peptide chain, we can assume that the peptidic moiety exists as an oligomer in solution, as suggested previously for the non-lipidic form (22Avr"
https://openalex.org/W2034718856,"Living organisms respond to phosphate limitation by expressing various genes whose products maintain an appropriate range of phosphate concentrations within each cell. We identified previously a two component system, which consists of histidine kinase SphS and its cognate response regulator SphR, which regulates the expression of the phoA gene for alkaline phosphatase under phosphate-limiting conditions in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In the present study, we used DNA microarrays to investigate the role of SphS and SphR in the regulation of the genome-wide expression of genes in response to phosphate limitation. In wild-type cells, phosphate limitation strongly induced the expression of 12 genes with induction factors greater than 7. These genes were included in three clusters of genes, namely, the pst1 and pst2 clusters that encode phosphate transporters; the phoA gene and the nucH gene for the extracellular nuclease. Phosphate limitation strongly repressed the expression of only the urtA gene with induction factors below 0.2. Inactivation of either of SphS or SphR completely eliminated the phosphate limitation-inducible expression of the 12 genes and the phosphate limitation-repressible expression of the urtA gene. These results suggest that the SphS-SphR two component system in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is the dominant sensory system that controls gene expression in response to phosphate limitation.

Phosphate is an essential nutrient, and it is required, for example, for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, ATP, DNA, and RNA, and for the functional regulation of proteins by phosphorylation. However, phosphate is one of the least available nutrients in the environment. Therefore, regulatory mechanisms have developed for the acquisition, storage, and metabolism of phosphate. One such regulatory mechanism involves the induction of the expression of genes for proteins that participate in the uptake of phosphate and/or increase the availability of phosphate under phosphate-limiting conditions. The induced expression of such genes has been observed under phosphate-limiting conditions in Eubacteria, such as Escherichia coli (1Wanner B.L. Escherichia coli Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1357-1381Google Scholar) and Bacillus subtilis (2Hulett F.M. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: from Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 193-201Google Scholar); in Cyanobacteria, such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter, Synechocystis; Ref. 3Hirani T.A. Suzuki I. Murata N. Hayashi H. Eaton-Rye J.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and Synechococcus sp.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The primary event under such conditions is the perception of phosphate-limiting conditions and transduction of the signal. This system has been studied in prokaryotes and appears to be a two component signal transduction system, consisting of a histidine kinase and a response regulator. In E. coli, a histidine residue of a specific histidine kinase, PhoR, is phosphorylated in response to phosphate limitation. The phosphate group is then transferred to a specific aspartate residue on the cognate response regulator PhoB, which regulates the expression of genes in the Pho regulon that encode alkaline phosphatase, phosphate transporters, and other relevant proteins (1Wanner B.L. Escherichia coli Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1357-1381Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, the expression of genes in the Pho regulon is regulated by a two component signal transduction system that consists of a histidine kinase, PhoR, and a response regulator, PhoP (2Hulett F.M. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: from Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 193-201Google Scholar). In a previous study, we identified two genes in Synechocystis, namely, sll0337 (sphS; hik7) and slr0081 (sphR; rre29), which encode proteins that are homologous, respectively, to PhoR and PhoB of E. coli, to PhoR and PhoP of B. subtilis, and to SphS and SphR of Synechococcus (3Hirani T.A. Suzuki I. Murata N. Hayashi H. Eaton-Rye J.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We found that the SphS-SphR two component system induced the expression of alkaline phosphatase in response to phosphate limitation. However, we did not determine whether this two component system regulates only some or all aspects of phosphate limitation-inducible gene expression in Synechocystis. In the present study, we used DNA microarrays to analyze the genome-wide expression of genes in Synechocystis that occurs in response to phosphate limitation. We found that the expression of 12 genes was strongly induced while that of only one gene was strongly repressed by phosphate limitation. We also found that the expression of all the phosphate limitation-inducible genes was completely eliminated upon inactivation of either SphS or SphR. In addition, we found that SphR bound to the upstream flanking regions of three genes at repetitive PyTTAAPyPy(T/A)-like sequences. Our observations suggest that the SphS-SphR two component system in Synechocystis might be the only system for the perception and transduction of the phosphate limitation signal in Synechocystis. Strains and Mutants—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was provided by Dr. J. G. K. Williams (Dupont de Nemours Co., Inc., Wilmington, DE). The ΔsphS mutant was constructed by insertional mutagenesis of the sphS gene using a spectinomycin-resistance gene cassette, as described previously (Ref. 8Suzuki I. Los D.A. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Murata N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar; the terminology is that recommended on the CyanoBase website www.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/Synechocystis/mutants/cgi-bin/comshow.cgi?id=sll0337). The ΔsphR mutant was generated by insertional mutagenesis of the sphR gene using a kanamycin-resistance gene cassette, as follows. The complete sphR gene was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from wild-type cells of Synechocystis with ISOPLANT II (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) as the template, the forward primer 5′-GGATCCATGTTGGTTAAATACCATCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGCTAACCAAAACGATAGCCAA-3′. The 801-bp product of PCR was cloned into pT7Blue (Novagen, Madison, WI), to generate pT7sphR. This plasmid was sequenced with an automated DNA sequencer (ABI310; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to confirm the sequence of the product of PCR. A kanamycin-resistance gene cassette was transposed into sphR using the Tn5 transposition system of an EZ::TN™ <KAN-2> Insertion Kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The site at which the kanamycin-resistance gene cassette had been inserted was determined by sequencing the regions flanking the kanamycin-resistance gene cassette, and it was found to be 384-bp downstream of the site of the initiation of translation. The resultant plasmid was designated pT7sphR::Kmr and used for transformation of Synechocystis as described previously (9Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar). To examine the extent of replacement of the sphS and the sphR genes by the corresponding mutated gene in mutant cells, we amplified the genes using the chromosomal DNA from wild-type, ΔsphS, and ΔsphR cells and pairs of synthetic primers for the sphS and sphR genes, respectively. Culture Conditions—Wild-type and mutant cells were grown at 34 °C in BG-11 medium (10Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (11Wada H. Murata N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1989; 30: 971-978Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Phosphate-limiting conditions were established by centrifugation and gel filtration as follows. A culture of Synechocystis cells in BG-11 medium was centrifuged at 25 °C at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of phosphate-free BG-11 medium, in which K2HPO4 (0.18 mm) had been replaced by an equimolar solution of KCl (0.18 mm) to give a concentration of Cl- ions of 0.31 mm. To remove phosphate completely, the suspension was passed through a desalting column (PD-10; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ; bed volume, 8.3 ml; radius, 0.73 cm; height, 5.0 cm) that had been filled with Sephadex G-25 and had been equilibrated with phosphate-free BG-11 medium. The flow-through fraction that contained Synechocystis cells was collected and inoculated into phosphate-free BG-11 medium. Then cells were cultured as described above. DNA Microarray Analysis—An aliquot of culture was withdrawn rapidly, and cells were killed immediately by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol that contained 10% (w/v) phenol. Total RNA was extracted as described previously (12Suzuki I. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and then cDNAs, labeled with fluorescent dyes (Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP; Amersham Biosciences), were prepared from 5 μg of total RNA with an RNA fluorescence labeling core kit (Moloney murine leukemia virus version 2.0; TAKARA Biomedicals, Kyoto, Japan). DNA microarrays (CyanoCHIP Version 1.6) were purchased from TAKARA Biomedicals. After hybridization, each microarray was rinsed and scanned as described previously (12Suzuki I. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi K. Suzuki I. Yamamoto H. Lyukevich A. Bodrova I. Los D.A. Piven I. Zinchenko V. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2901-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Overproduction of His-tagged SphR in E. coli and Its Purification—We digested plasmid pT7sphR with BamHI and XhoI, and cloned the resultant fragment into the plasmid vector pET28a (Novagen) for subsequent expression of a fusion protein with a His tag at the N terminus. The product was designated pETsphR and used for the transformation of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of LB medium (1.0% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 171 mm NaCl) supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When the absorbance at 600 nm of the culture reached 0.8, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the culture was incubated for an additional 12 h at 20 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at -80 °C prior to use. All procedures for purification of the fusion protein were performed at 4 °C. The transformed and pelleted E. coli cells were suspended in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) that contained 0.3 m NaCl and then they were disrupted with a French press (SLM Instruments, Inc., Rochester, NY) at 8.3 MPa. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant supernatant was loaded onto a column (Poly-Prep Chromatography column; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA; bed volume, 1 ml) that had been filled with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) that contained 0.3 m NaCl. The matrix was washed with 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) that contained 0.3 m NaCl and 50 mm imidazole and then with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) that contained 50 mm NaCl and 50 mm imidazole. Finally, the fusion protein was eluted, in 0.5-ml fractions, in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) that contained 50 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. Fractions that contained the fusion protein were combined and desalted by passage through a desalting column (PD-10; Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) that contained 5 mm EDTA (disodium salt), 50 mm KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The eluate was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C prior to use. The concentration of proteins was determined with a BD protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The purity of the fusion protein was examined by SDS-PAGE (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Gel Mobility Shift Assay—A 294-bp DNA fragment that corresponded to positions -294 to -1 upstream of the site of the initiation of translation of the phoA gene of Synechocystis was amplified by PCR with the genomic DNA from wild-type cells of Synechocystis as template, the forward primer 5′-TTTTAAGCTTTCCCGCCGAGGATTTTTCGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTTTAAGCTTAATTGCTTTAGAAATTTCTC-3′. Each primer contained a HindIII restriction site. The resultant fragment of DNA was digested with HindIII and was then end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (6,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (TAKARA Biochemicals). Unincorporated radioisotope was removed by gel-filtration chromatography on a Centri-Sep spin column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Approximately 10 ng (0.05 pmol) of the end-labeled DNA fragment (∼2,600 cpm) were mixed with 0.5 μg (30 pmol) of His-tagged SphR, which had previously been incubated in the presence of 10 mm acetyl phosphate or in its absence in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) that contained 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and various nonlabeled DNA fragments, such as the region upstream of the site of initiation of translation of the phoA, sphX, pstS2, and mntC genes, and a DNA fragment of 30 bp that had been synthesized by reference to the sequence of the Pho box of the sphX gene of Synechocystis and a similar but base-substituted fragment (see “Results”). DNA fragments of 302, 500, and 135 bp, corresponding to positions -299 to +3,-500 to-1, and -135 to -1 upstream of the site of the initiation of translation of the sphX, pstS2, and mntC genes, respectively, were synthesized by PCR with the genomic DNA from wild-type cells of Synechocystis as template, and following primers: the forward primer 5′-AAAAAAGCTTGTTAATCGGGGCAAAAAGTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAAAAAGCTTCATTTTTACTTCTCCGCCCC-3′ for sphX; forward primer 5′-TTTTAAGCTTAGCCAAATCGGTCTGCGATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGGGAAGCTTAGGAATTTGCAATCTAAATTG-3′ for pstS2; and forward primer 5′-GGGGCTCGAGCAGAAAGTTTTAGTGGTCAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTTTAAGCTTAGTGATAATGGTCTTTCAT-3′ for mntC. The DNA fragments of 30 bp that corresponded to the Pho box and the base-substituted Pho box were synthesized by annealing the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-TTTAACCAAACCTTTACTAGGGCTTAACCT-3′ and 5′-TCCGGTGAAACCCCGGTGAGGGCCCGGTGT-3′, respectively, to their complementary oligonucleotides. Each reaction mixture for the gel mobility shift assay was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and then loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA). Then the gel was dried and analyzed with a Bio-imaging analyzer (BAS2000; Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Complementation of ΔsphS and ΔsphR Mutants—The sphS gene was amplified with the genomic DNA from wild-type cells of Synechocystis as template, the forward primer 5′-GTCGACAGTATCTACTGATGGCGATTCAGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCCGGGGCCACCATTTTAAAATTATCGCTC-3′. These sequences were located 277-bp upstream of the initiation codon and 167-bp downstream of the termination codon, respectively. The forward and reverse primers contained restriction sites for SalI and SmaI, respectively. The sphR gene was amplified similarly with the forward primer 5′-GTCGACGGGGCAAAACTTAACCAATTTCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGTCCAGCAATAGATAGAAATATGGC-3′. These sequences were located 182-bp upstream of the initiation codon and 100-bp downstream of the termination codon, respectively. The primers contained restriction sites for SalI and XhoI, respectively. The resultant fragments were cloned into the TA cloning site of plasmid pT7Blue, as noted above, yielding plasmids pT7sphSC and pT7sphRC, which were sequenced with the automated DNA sequencer to confirm the sequences of the products of PCR. For the construction of complementation vectors, we excised sphS and sphR genes that included the flanking regions from pT7sphSC and pT7sphRC with SalI plus SmaI and SalI plus XhoI, respectively. Each fragment was inserted into the cyanobacterial autonomous replication plasmid pVZ321 (15Zinchenko V.V. Piven I.V. Melnik V.A. Shestakov S.V. Russian J. Genet. 1999; 35: 228-232Google Scholar), which had been digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes. The resultant complementation vectors, namely, pVZ321::sphSC and pVZ321::sphRC, were introduced into ΔsphS and ΔsphR cells, respectively, by triparental gene transfer (15Zinchenko V.V. Piven I.V. Melnik V.A. Shestakov S.V. Russian J. Genet. 1999; 35: 228-232Google Scholar). Genome-wide Analysis with DNA Microarrays of Gene Expression in Response to Phosphate Limitation—Preliminary control experiments with DNA microarrays, using Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs derived from a single sample of RNA extracted from wild-type cells grown in normal medium, indicated that the limit of experimental deviation corresponded to as much as a 2-fold difference in relative levels of expression (12Suzuki I. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Kanesaki Y. Suzuki I. Allakhverdiev S.I. Mikami K. Murata N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, genes demonstrating more than 2-fold induction or repression were defined as phosphate limitation-inducible or -repressible genes, respectively, in subsequent analyses. Genes whose expression, over time, was induced or repressed more than 7-fold in wild-type cells under phosphate-limiting conditions are listed in Table I (20 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h). Phosphate limitation strongly induced the expression of the Pho regulon, which includes genes for two types of phosphate transporter, alkaline phosphatase, and an extracellular nuclease. There are two sets of genes for putative phosphate-specific transport (Pst) 1The abbreviations used are: Pst, phosphate-specific transport; ORF, open reading frame; WT, wild type. systems in the genome of Synechocystis (17Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). Both Pst systems, designated Pst1 and Pst2, are encoded by similar clusters of genes (Fig. 1A). The pst1 system includes six open reading frames (ORFs) (sll0679-sll0684) in the following order: sphX-pstS1-pstC1-pstA1-pstB1-pstB1′. The pst2 system includes four ORFs (slr1247-slr1250) as follows: pstS2-pstC2-pstA2-pstB2. The phoA gene for alkaline phosphatase and the nucH gene for the extracellular nuclease, both of which are involved in increasing the availability of phosphate in the extracellular environment, are located in tandem on the genome of Synechocystis (Fig. 1A).Table IIdentification by DNA microarray analysis of genes whose expression is affected by phosphate limitation in wild-type SynechocystisORFGeneProductPhosphate-limited BG-11/BG-1120 min1 h2 h4 h8 h-foldGenes showing more than 7-fold inductionsll0679sphXABC-type phosphate transporter phosphate-binding protein2.33.83.57.014.8sll0680pstS1ABC-type phosphate transporter phosphate-binding protein4.78.810.911.216.8sll0681pstC1ABC-type phosphate transporter permease protein3.66.36.57.39.8sll0682pstA1ABC-type phosphate transporter permease protein2.84.94.36.49.1sll0683pstB1ABC-type phosphate transporter ATP-binding protein2.33.84.14.97.0sll0684pstB1'ABC-type phosphate transporter ATP-binding protein2.44.34.05.76.9sll0654phoAAlkaline phosphatase1.316.814.242.869.0sll0656nucHExtracellular nuclease1.18.58.835.727.1slr1247pstS2ABC-type phosphate transporter phosphate-binding protein1.110.412.155.4101.9slr1248pstC2ABC-type phosphate transporter permease protein1.04.94.017.643.6slr1249pstA2ABC-type phosphate transporter permease protein1.02.83.112.321.1slr1250pstB2ABC-type phosphate transporter ATP-binding protein0.91.71.95.38.6Gene showing more than 5-fold repressionslr0447urtAPeriplasmic protein0.930.340.300.260.17 Open table in a new tab Phosphate limitation also repressed the expression of a number of genes. The expression of the urtA gene for a periplasmic protein of unknown function was strongly repressed in response to phosphate limitation. This gene is located at a different site from the phosphate limitation-inducible genes on the genome of Synechocystis (Fig. 1B). Rapid and Slow Responses—As noted above, both pst systems were induced by phosphate limitation in Synechocystis. However, induction of the expression of the six genes in pst1 occurred within 20 min of exposure to phosphate-limited conditions and the levels of expression of these genes remained high for 8 h (Table I). By contrast, the responses of the four genes in pst2 occurred much more slowly. Induction became apparent at 1 h and transcripts reached a maximum level at 8 h. The expression of the phoA gene and the nucH gene occurred only slowly (Table I) and the phosphate limitation-repressible gene, urtA, responded slowly too. A total of 8 h was required before the level fell to a minimum value. Effects of Inactivation of SphS or SphR on the Phosphate Limitation-regulated Expression of Genes—We previously identified histidine kinase SphS and the corresponding response regulator SphR as a two component system that regulates the expression of the phoA gene for alkaline phosphatase under phosphate-limiting conditions in Synechocystis (3Hirani T.A. Suzuki I. Murata N. Hayashi H. Eaton-Rye J.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the positions at which the spectinomycin-resistance gene cassette and the kanamycin-resistance gene cassette were inserted in the sphS and sphR genes by targeted mutagenesis. Synechocystis contains approximately ten copies of the chromosome per cell (18Mann N. Carr N.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 83: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine whether the sphS and sphR genes had been disrupted in every copy, we extracted the genomic DNA from the mutant cells and used it as template for the amplification of each gene by PCR. Fig. 2B shows that no copies of the parental genes were present in the mutant cells, suggesting that the replacement of sphS and sphR genes by mutated genes was complete in each respective mutant. We examined first the effects of these mutations on gene expression when cells were grown with sufficient phosphate, namely, in normal BG-11 medium. We observed that the expression of the cysS gene, which encodes cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, was repressed 2-fold upon inactivation of either SphS or SphR. The expression of slr0915, which encodes an endonuclease, and the expression of the pstS1 gene were enhanced and repressed, respectively, 2-fold upon the inactivation of SphR. Although the expression of these genes was affected by mutations in SphS and/or SphR, the changes in levels of expression were only minor or close to the extent of experimental deviations. Table II shows the effects of phosphate limitation during incubation for 8 h on gene expression in wild-type, ΔsphS, and ΔsphR cells. Inactivation of SphS or SphR completely eliminated the phosphate limitation-regulated expression of genes both at 20 min and at 8 h, indicating that both the rapid and the slow responses to phosphate limitation were regulated by the SphS-SphR two component system.Table IIDNA microarray analysis of the effects of a mutation in SphS or SphR on the phosphate limitation-regulated expression of genes in SynechocystisORFGeneProductPhosphate-limited BG-11/BG-11WTΔsphSΔsphR20 min8 h20 min8 h20 min8 h-foldPhosphate limitation-inducible genessll0679sphXABC-type phosphate transporter phosphate-binding protein2.314.81.01.40.60.9sll0680pstS1ABC-type phosphate transporter phosphate-binding protein4.716.81.01.80.61.3sll0681pstC1ABC-type phosphate transporter permease protein3.69.81.01.21.11.1sll0682pstA1ABC-type phosphate transporter permease protein2.89.10.91.11.11.2sll0683pstB1ABC-type phosphate transporter ATP-binding protein2.37.01.01.10.61.2sll0684pstB1'ABC-type phosphate transporter ATP-binding protein2.46.91.01.11.11.0sll0654phoAAlkaline phosphatase1.369.00.70.81.00.8sll0656nucHExtracellular nuclease1.127.11.01.31.11.1slr1247pstS2ABC-type phosphate transporter phosphate-binding protein1.1101.91.01.00.91.0slr1248pstC2ABC-type phosphate transporter permease protein1.043.60.71.00.71.4slr1249pstA2ABC-type phosphate transporter permease protein1.021.10.90.91.01.1slr1250pstB2ABC-type phosphate transporter ATP-binding protein0.98.61.01.00.91.3Phosphate limitation-repressible geneslr0447urtAPeriplasmic protein0.930.171.111.020.471.11 Open table in a new tab Binding of SphR to the Upstream Flanking Region of Phosphate Limitation-inducible Genes via Recognition of Specific Sequences—The response regulators PhoB in E. coli and PhoP in B. subtilis bind specifically to conserved sequences, known as Pho boxes (19Makino K. Amemura M. Kim S.-K. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Phosphate in Microorganisms: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1994: 5-12Google Scholar, 20Qi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hulett F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2534-2539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the conserved sequences and spacings of the Pho boxes are different in E. coli and B. subtilis, the general structure is conserved in these microorganisms. The Pho box of E. coli consists of 7-bp direct repeats of CTGTCAT-like sequences that are separated by 4 bp (19Makino K. Amemura M. Kim S.-K. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Phosphate in Microorganisms: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1994: 5-12Google Scholar), whereas the Pho box of B. subtilis consists of 6-bp direct repeats of TTAACA-like sequences that are separated by 5 bp (20Qi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hulett F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2534-2539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to investigate the possibility that Synechocystis might also have a Pho box, we examined the sequences of the upstream flanking regions of the phosphate limitation-inducible genes. Although we did not find a sequence that was identical to those of the Pho boxes of E. coli and B. subtilis, we did find repetitive 8-bp sequences, namely, PyTTAAPyPy(T/A), that corresponded to a consensus sequence in the upstream flanking regions of the phoA, sphX, and pstS2 genes. In Synechocystis, these sequences were separated by 3 bp (Fig. 3A). To determine whether SphR can bind to the upstream flanking regions of the various genes, we overexpressed SphR in E. coli as a soluble fusion protein with a His tag at its N terminus. The relative molecular mass of the His-tagged SphR (His-SphR), after purification by affinity chromatography, was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 33.4 kDa, which was the same as that deduced from the amino acid sequence of the fusion protein. We examined the DNA binding activity of His-SphR in gel mobility shift assays with a 32P-labeled fragment of DNA that corresponded to the flanking region from positions -294 to -1 upstream of the codon for the initiation of translation of the phoA gene (Fig. 3A). We detected a band that was due to formation of a complex between His-SphR and the upstream flanking region of the phoA gene (Fig. 3B, lane 2, arrow c). In the presence of a 10- or 100-fold excess of the nonlabeled fragment of the DNA that corresponded to the upstream flanking regions of the phoA, sphX, and pstS2 genes, the extent of the binding of His-SphR to the labeled fragment of DNA was reduced significantly (Fig. 3B, lanes 3-8). By contrast, the presence of a 10- or 100-fold excess of a nonlabeled fragment of DNA that corresponded to the upstream flanking region of the mntC gene, which encodes a subunit of the ABC-type manganese transporter and is not a phosphate limitation-responsible gene, did not affect the binding of His-SphR to the labeled DNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 9 and 10). These results suggest that SphR was able to bind specifically to the upstream flanking regions of the phoA, sphX, and pstS2 genes. In order to confirm that the consensus sequence PyTTAAPyPy(T/A) corresponded to the Pho box of Synechocystis, we examined the ability of His-SphR to bind to a 30-bp synthetic fragment of DNA that contained three such repeats and to a 30-bp fragment that contained three repeats in which the conserved sequence had been replaced by a different sequence. Fig. 4A shows the sequences of the two 30-bp fragments. In the base-substituted fragment, PyTTAAPyPy(T/A) was changed to PyCCGGTG(T/A). In gel motility shift assays, we detected a band that was due to the binding of His-SphR to the upstream flanking region of the phoA gene (Fig. 4B, lane 2, arrow c). In the presence of a 10- or 100-fold excess of the nonlabeled “wild-type” fragment of 30 bp, the extent of the binding of His-SphR to the labeled DNA was reduced (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). By contrast, the presence of a 10- or 100-fold excess of the nonlabeled base-substituted 30-bp fragment did not affect the binding of His-SphR to the labeled DNA (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). These results indicated that SphR was able to bind specifically to PyTTAAPyPy(T/A) repeats. We examined the effects of incubation of SphR with 10 mm acetyl phosphate, conditions for phosphorylation of the Asp residue in SphR, on its DNA binding activity. However, this treatment did not affect the DNA binding activity of SphR (data not shown). Complementation of ΔsphS and ΔsphR Mutants—In order to confirm that the SphS-SphR two component system serves as the only system for sensing phosphate limitation, we introduced wild-type sphS and sphR genes into ΔsphS and ΔsphR mutant cells using pVZ321::sphSC and pVZ321::sphRC, respectively. DNA microarray analysis confirmed that the expression of the wild-type genes in the respective mutant cells restored the capacity for phosphate limitation-inducible expression of genes in response to phosphate-limiting conditions (data not shown). These results confirmed that the effects on the phosphate limitation-induced expression of genes shown in Table II were caused by the mutations in the sphS and sphR genes. Rapid and Slow Responses to Phosphate Limitation in Synechocystis—DNA microarray analysis revealed that the expression of 12 genes was strongly enhanced under phosphate-limiting conditions (Table I). These genes encode proteins that are involved in phosphate transport and increases in phosphate availability (Table I). In B. subtilis, both the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated forms of PhoP are able to bind to promoters of the Pho regulon but only the phosphorylated form stimulates the initiation of transcription (21Liu W. Hulett F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6302-6310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the initiation of transcription requires a certain level of phosphorylated PhoP, and the level is specific to each individual promoter. For example, the initiation of transcription of the phoA gene requires a 3-fold higher level of phosphorylated PhoP than does that of the pstSCAB operon (22Qi Y. Hulett F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The rapid response of the sphX promoter and the slower responses of other promoters in Synechocystis to phosphate limitation might be explained in a similar way, namely, by requirements for different levels of phosphorylated SphR for the initiation of transcription. It is possible that the level of phosphorylated SphR 20 min after the transfer of cells to phosphate-limited conditions was low but sufficient for the initiation of transcription of the pst1 genes, even though it was insufficient for the initiation of transcription of the pst2 genes and of the other phosphate limitation-inducible genes in Synechocystis. The region upstream of the site of initiation of translation, which might include the promoters of phoA, sphX, and pstS2, contained repeats of the PyTTAAPyPy(T/A) consensus sequence (Fig. 3A). Gel mobility shift assays indicated that SphR was able to bind to DNA fragments that corresponded to the putative promoter regions of the phoA, sphX, and pstS genes (Fig. 3B). These fragments contained direct repeats of PyTTAAPyPy(T/A) that were separated by 3 bp (Fig. 3A). Moreover, SphR was also able to bind to a synthetic DNA fragment of 30 bp that contained three such repeats (Fig. 4), a result that suggests that this repetitive PyTTAAPyPy(T/A) sequence might be a putative Pho box in Synechocystis. In Synechococcus, the binding sites of the promoters of the phoA and sphX genes to the response regulator SphR do, in fact, contain four repeats similar to the putative Pho box of Synechocystis (4Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, we found repetitive PyTTAAPyPy(T/A)-like sequences in the upstream flanking regions of gene clusters that correspond to the Pst systems in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1. While we found four such repeats in the upstream flanking regions of the phoA gene and the pstS2 gene, there are only three repeats in the upstream flanking region of the sphX gene (Fig. 3A). Our DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that the extent of induction of the expression of both the phoA and pst2 genes was much higher than that of pst1 genes (Table I). Four repeats of TTAACA-like sequences are required for efficient binding of PhoP to the pstS promoter in B. subtilis (23Liu W. Qi Y. Hulett F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the extent of induction of phosphate limitation-inducible genes in Synechocystis depends on the number of repeated PyTTAAPyPy(T/A) sequences. Phosphate Limitation-repressible Gene in Synechocystis—DNA microarray analysis revealed that phosphate limitation strongly repressed the expression of the urtA gene (Table I). This repression was regulated by the SphS-SphR two component system in Synechocystis (Table II). In B. subtilis, the tagAB, tagDEF, and resDE operons are repressed by the PhoPR two component system in response to phosphate limitation (2Hulett F.M. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: from Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 193-201Google Scholar). The expression of these operons is repressed by the phosphorylated form of PhoP, which binds to regions that overlap the sites of initiation of transcription and extend further into the coding regions of these genes. However, we found no PyTTAAPyPy(T/A)- like sequences in these regions of the urtA gene. Furthermore, SphR did not bind to DNA fragments that corresponded to the upstream flanking region and coding region of the urtA gene. Further studies are necessary to identify the molecular mechanism by which SphR represses the expression of the urtA gene under phosphate-limiting conditions. A Hypothetical Pathway for the Perception and Transduction of Phosphate-limitation Signals in Synechocystis—Computational analysis predicts that SphS has neither a hydrophobic domain nor a periplasm-targeting signal sequence, suggesting that it is a soluble protein located in the cytoplasm. This protein has a strongly conserved hisitidine kinase domain in its C-terminal region and a PAS domain near its N terminus. The PAS domain is involved in the sensing of a variety of stimuli, such as oxygen (24Gong W. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Chan M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15177-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), light (25Yeh K.C. Wu S.H. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and redox potential (26Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the PAS domain might be involved in protein-protein interactions that mediate signal transduction and in the determination of the specificity of such interactions (27Huang Z.J. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). SphR belongs to the OmpR family of response regulators. It consists of a strongly conserved receiver domain in the N-terminal region and a DNA binding domain, with a helix-turn-helix motif, in the C-terminal region. Fig. 5 shows a hypothetical scheme for the perception and transduction of phosphate-limitation signals. In this hypothetical scheme, when the N-terminal input module of SphS senses an intracellular decrease in the level of phosphate, the conserved histidine residue in the histidine kinase domain is phosphorylated. The phosphate group is then transferred to the aspartate residue in the receiver domain of SphR. As the result of this phosphorylation, SphR is activated and is able to regulate the expression of genes. A two component system homologous to SphS-SphR is conserved in six of the eight cyanobacterial species whose genomes have been sequenced, namely, Synechocystis, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, T. elongatus BP-1, Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, Prochlorococcus marinus MED4, and Synechococcus sp. WH 8102. It has not been found in P. marinus SS120 and P. marinus MIT9312. A Blast search of all non-redundant protein data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) indicated that this system is conserved in ∼80 of 125 bacterial strains whose genomes have been sequenced. These findings indicate that this two component system is rather widely distributed in the prokaryotic kingdom. The molecular mechanism by which SphS perceives the phosphate-limitation signal is still unclear. Further studies are necessary to identify the sensing domain of SphS and to characterize the phosphorous moiety or moieties that are sensed by the sensory kinase."

In a Japanese patient with distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles, we identified pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, which catalyzes the initial two steps in the biosynthesis of sialic acid. In this study, we demonstrated the relationship between the genetic mutations and enzymatic activities using an in vitro expression assay system. Furthermore, we also showed that the levels of sialic acid in muscle and primary cultured cells from DMRV patients were reduced to 60–75% of control. The reactivities to lectins were also variable in some myofibers, suggesting that hyposialylation and abnormal glycosylation in muscles may contribute to the focal accumulations of autophagic vacuoles, amyloid deposits, or both in patient muscle tissue. The addition of ManNAc and NeuAc to primary cultured cells normalized sialylation levels, thus demonstrating the therapeutic potential of these compounds for this disease.

Sunohara N. Ishiura S. Satoyoshi E. J. Neurol. Sci. 1981; 51: 141-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 2Nonaka I. Murakami N. Suzuki Y. Kawai M. Neuromuscul. Disord. 1998; 8: 333-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The age at onset is relatively late with a mean of 26 years. Muscle biopsy of this disorder is characterized by many rimmed vacuoles, which are particularly abundant in atrophic fibers. Necrotic and regenerating fibers are rarely seen (3Nonaka I. Sunohara N. Satoyoshi E. Terasawa K. Yonemoto K. Ann. Neurol. 1985; 17: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The nucleus occasionally contains tubulofilamentous inclusions of 15–20 nm in diameter.Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is an autosomal recessive disorder that presents with adult-onset slowly progressive distal and proximal weakness and has characteristic pathological features in muscle tissue, including rimmed vacuoles and filamentous inclusions, that are similar to those seen in DMRV (4Griggs R.C. Askanas V. DiMauro S. Engel A. Karpati G. Mendell J.R. Rowland L.P. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Gene loci of both diseases have been mapped to chromosome 9 (5Eisenberg I. Avidan N. Potikha T. Hochner H. Chen M. Olender T. Barash M. Shemesh M. Sadeh M. Grabov-Nardini G. Shmilevich I. Friedmann A. Karpati G. Bradley W.G. Baumbach L. Lancet D. Asher E.B. Beckmann J.S. Argov Z. Mitrani-Rosenbaum S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 6Ikeuchi T. Asaka T. Saito M. Tanaka H. Higuchi S. Tanaka K. Saida K. Uyama E. Mizusawa H. Fukuhara N. Nonaka I. Takamori M. Tsuji S. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). HIBM is caused by mutations in the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase gene (GNE gene) (7Eisenberg I. Thiel C. Levi T. Tiram E. Argov Z. Sadeh M. Jackson C.L. Thierfelder L. Mitrani-Rosenbaum S. Genomics. 1999; 55: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Previously we identified homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the GNE gene in 27 DMRV patients (8Nishino I. Noguchi S. Murayama K. Driss A. Sugie K. Oya Y. Nagata T. Chida K. Takahashi T. Takusa Y Ohi T. Nishimiya J. Sunohara N. Ciafaloni E. Kawai M. Aoki M. Nonaka I. Neurology. 2002; 59: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the two diseases are allelic.UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase is a dual functional enzyme catalyzing two initial steps in the biosynthesis of sialic acid (9Hinderlich S. Stasche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the conversions of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc and ManNAc to ManNAc 6-phosphate. Despite the identification of the GNE gene mutations, we still do not fully understand how these mutations contribute to the pathophysiology in DMRV/HIBM. Several questions remain unanswered. 1) What is the status of sialylation activity in the patients with GNE mutations? One would expect sialylation to be impaired but not completely absent in DMRV/HIBM patients, because sialic acid is essential for embryonic development (10Schwarzkopf M. Knobeloch K.P. Rohde E. Hinderlich S. Wiechens N. Lucka L. Horak I. Reutter W. Horstkorte R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5267-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In fact, homozygous null mutations have never been identified in patients (8Nishino I. Noguchi S. Murayama K. Driss A. Sugie K. Oya Y. Nagata T. Chida K. Takahashi T. Takusa Y Ohi T. Nishimiya J. Sunohara N. Ciafaloni E. Kawai M. Aoki M. Nonaka I. Neurology. 2002; 59: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 11Eisenberg I. Grabov-Nardini G. Hochner H. Korner M. Sadeh M.

Mutat. 2003; 21: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 2) Why are symptoms restricted to the skeletal muscles? GNE transcripts are expressed in various tissues and are especially predominant in the liver (12Lucka L. Krause M. Danker K. Reutter W. Horstkorte R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 3) Why do mutant proteins not complement each other in patients who have heterozygous mutations in each of the two domains? The two domains in GNE protein have been reported to catalyze the enzymatic reactions separately and independently (13Effertz K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To address these questions, we studied the relationships between mutations and enzymatic activity using in vitro expression and enzymatic assay systems. We also determined the levels of sialylation in sera, muscles, and primary cultured cells from DMRV patients and normal individuals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutation and Sialic Acid Analyses of Patients—All of the patients were Japanese. The patients were diagnosed as having DMRV based on both clinical features and muscle pathology. Numbering of the patients followed the protocol presented in our previous report (8Nishino I. Noguchi S. Murayama K. Driss A. Sugie K. Oya Y. Nagata T. Chida K. Takahashi T. Takusa Y Ohi T. Nishimiya J. Sunohara N. Ciafaloni E. Kawai M. Aoki M. Nonaka I. Neurology. 2002; 59: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Gene analyses of DMRV patients were performed as described previously (8Nishino I. Noguchi S. Murayama K. Driss A. Sugie K. Oya Y. Nagata T. Chida K. Takahashi T. Takusa Y Ohi T. Nishimiya J. Sunohara N. Ciafaloni E. Kawai M. Aoki M. Nonaka I. Neurology. 2002; 59: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Primary fibroblasts were obtained from patient 18 and patient 19, whose mutations were reported previously. Primary skeletal myocytes were obtained from patient 5 as reported previously. Sialic acid contents in sera were measured with a SIALIZYME-550 kit (Fujirevio, Tokyo, Japan), and those in muscle and cells were determined by the thiobarbituric acid method. Informed consents were obtained from all subjects using a form approved by the Ethical Review Board at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (Tokyo, Japan).Expression of Recombinant GNE Proteins—The cDNA for wild-type GNE was obtained by reverse transcribed-PCR from normal muscle RNA and cloned into pCR-blunt vector (Invitrogen). The cDNAs for GNE mutants were obtained by reverse transcribed-PCR from skeletal muscle RNA of DMRV patients or by site-directed mutagenesis from wild-type cDNA. All cloned muscle cDNAs were sequenced by ABI cycle-sequencing procedures using an ABI 3100 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequenced and inserted cDNAs were cut out with EcoRI and blunted, and the purified cDNA fragments were inserted in-frame into the expression vector, pCMV-Myc (Invitrogen). The expression constructs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, the Myc-tagged wild-type GNE and the mutant proteins were extracted from transfected cells. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity was measured as described previously. The ManNAc kinase assay was performed with slight modification according the previous report (13Effertz K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Cross-linking of GNE Mutant Proteins—To analyze the oligomer structure of wild-type and mutant GNE, cell lysates were subjected to a reaction with 10 mm MBS for 30 min at room temperature for cross-linking. The Myc-tagged cross-linked products were purified with anti-Myc-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and eluted by boiling in 2% SDS solution. The products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-Myc 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Lectin Staining and Protein Analysis of Skeletal Muscles from Patients—Biotin-labeled Maackia amurensis (MAM), soybean agglutinin (SBA), and Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin (SSA) (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were used for the staining of muscle sections. Unfixed 10-μm-thick muscle sections were blocked in 2% casein/phosphate-buffered saline and stained with lectin solution for 2 h at room temperature. The proteins were extracted from the skeletal muscle sections using 8.5 m urea, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE. Monoclonal antibodies, H4A3 (for LAMP-1), 43DAG1/8D5 (for β-dystroglycan), and VIA4-I (for α-dystroglycan) were used for Western blotting. Laminin binding to α-dystroglycan was examined as described previously (14Michele D.E. Barresi R. Kanagawa M. Saito F. Cohn R.D. Satz J.S. Dollar J. Nishino I. Kelley R.I. Somer H. Straub V. Mathews K.D. Moore S.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2002; 418: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar).Cell Cultures—COS-7 cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 5% CO2. Primary fibroblasts and myoblasts from DMRV patients and normal individuals were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Ham's F-12 medium in 5% CO2. The myoblasts were induced to myogenic differentiation by switching the medium to 5% horse serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Ham's F-12 medium. At 24 h before lectin staining or sialic acid determination, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium with or without 5 mm GlcNAc, ManNAc, or NeuAc. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (15Noguchi S. Wakabayashi E. Imamura M. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled SBA, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (Seikagaku Kogyo), an antibody against desmin (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA), and Alexa Fluo 594-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used for staining the cells.RESULTSNovel Mutations in GNE Gene in DMRV Patients—In the previous study, we identified 12 different GNE mutations in either homozygous or compound heterozygous states in 27 DMRV patients (8Nishino I.

Subsequently, we identified six patients harboring five different mutations, of which three were novel mutations: 1622C→T, 89G→C, and 2173G→A (Table I). These novel mutations were absent in 100 control chromosomes from normal Japanese individuals.Table IIdentified mutations The mutations were identified in patients diagnosed as having DMRV based on both clinical features and muscle pathology. Numbering of patients followed that in our previous report (8Nishino I. Noguchi S. Murayama K. Driss A. Sugie K. Oya Y. Nagata T. Chida K. Takahashi T. Takusa Y Ohi T. Nishimiya J. Sunohara N.

Hinderlich S. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported reductions in UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activities in leukocytes from the patients with mutations in the GNE gene (8Nishino I. Noguchi S. Murayama K. Driss A. Sugie K. Oya Y. Nagata T. Chida K. Takahashi T. Takusa Y Ohi T. Nishimiya J. Sunohara N. Ciafaloni E. Kawai M. Aoki M. Nonaka I. Neurology. 2002; 59: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme activity was too weak in leukocytes to clearly demonstrate correlations between gene mutations and the enzymatic activities. To clarify this relationship, we generated recombinant proteins with each of the 13 species of mutations that we identified. All but one of the mutant and wild-type recombinant GNE proteins were expressed in COS cells and migrated at 75 kDa in SDS-PAGE. The single exception was a recombinant protein with a deletion of amino acids 206–256 (Δ206–256) caused by exon 4 skipping. The abnormal protein was degraded in COS cells (Fig. 1A). We determined the specific activities of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase of the mutant proteins relative to wild type (Fig. 1B). The endogenous activities in mock transfected COS cells were determined to correct for the background enzyme activity. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activities in mutants C13S, H132Q, D176V, D177C, V331A, and D378Y were reduced to less than 20% of the control. In contrast, the I472T and G708S mutants each revealed an ∼50% reduction, and V572L, A630T, and A631V each showed only a 20–30% reduction in activity as compared with wild-type cells. ManNAc kinase activity was retained in the N-terminal mutants C13S, H132Q, D176V, D177C, V331A, and D378Y, whereas the C-terminal mutants I472T, V572L, A630T, A631V, and G703S showed dramatic reductions in activities. These data were essentially compatible with a prior report (13Effertz K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the A524V mutant preferentially affected UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity, although the mutation is in the kinase domain. None of the DMRV mutants showed complete loss of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase or ManNAc kinase activities.Oligomerization of GNE Mutants—GNE protein forms a homohexamer by oligomerization (13Effertz K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We examined whether the mutations affect the oligomerization of GNE molecules, because homohexamer structure of GNE protein was reported to be essential for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity (13Effertz K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The recombinant mutant proteins were subjected to the cross-linking with MBS. Fig. 1C shows the electrophoretic tracing patterns of cross-linked products of wild-type and mutant GNE proteins. The product of wild-type GNE predominantly migrated at >400 kDa, which corresponds to homohexamer. C13S, V572L, A630T, and A631V gave cross-linked products similar to that of wild-type GNE, whereas the mutants H132Q and D176V mainly generated a 200-kDa product, and D177C, V331A, D378Y, and A524V produced 98-kDa proteins. These data indicate that the hexameric oligomerization is necessary for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity and that N-terminal mutants generally fail to form large oligomers although the molecular region responsible for the oligomerization is not clearly related to the predicted oligomerization domains based on the primary structure.Sialic Acid Contents in Skeletal Muscles and Primary Cells from DMRV Patients—GNE gene mutations reduced the enzymatic activity of GNE protein. These results led us to hypothesize that sialylation should be affected in the tissues of DMRV patients. We measured the sialic acid content in sera and muscles from DMRV patients (Fig. 2A). In sera, no difference was detected between patients and normal controls, whereas in skeletal muscle, a 25% reduction of sialic acid was observed in DMRV muscles. We also assessed the status of sialylation in DMRV muscles by lectin staining. We used three lectins: SSA for detection of Siaα2–6Gal/GalNAc, MAM for Siaα2–3Gal, and SBA for GalNAcα1–3Gal (16Shibuya N. Tazaki K. Song Z.W. Tarr G.E. Goldstein I.J. Peumans W.J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 1098-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Yamamoto K. Konami Y. Irimura T. J. Biochem.

The results of lectin staining are summarized in Table II. SSA uniformly stained sarcolemma in control muscle, whereas it faintly stained sarcolemma and strongly stained interstitial tissues in DMRV muscle (Fig. 2B, panels d–f). MAM strongly stained sarcolemma and interstitial tissues in both the control and patient muscles. We did not observe any reduction in MAM staining in patients, which may be attributed to the strong intensity in our staining condition (data not shown). In contrast, SBA strongly highlighted the rimmed vacuoles containing fibers and the surrounding atrophic fibers in the patients both in sarcolemma and cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, panels h and i; see arrows), whereas it did not stain myofibers in the control (Fig. 2B, panel g). These data suggest that sialylation, other glycosylation, or both are at least partly disturbed in some myofibers in DMRV. Furthermore, we examined the expression of glycosylated α-dystroglycan in DMRV muscles using an antibody (VIA4-I) that recognizes a carbohydrate epitope. The α-dystroglycan staining was negative in rimmed vacuoles containing fibers and the surrounding atrophic fibers in one DMRV patient (Fig. 2B, panel l). However, positive staining in another patient demonstrated that α-dystroglycan expression varies among patients (Fig. 2B, panel k). Therefore, we concluded that the loss of α-dystroglycan staining is an extreme down-stream phenomenon in DMRV muscles. We also analyzed muscle sialylated glycoproteins (LAMP-1, and α- and β-dystroglycans) by one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but when they were extracted in whole amounts, there was no significant change in the electrophoretic patterns of these proteins between control and patients (data not shown). Furthermore, we analyzed the laminin-binding property of α-dystroglycan from DMRV patients, and the α-dystroglycan showed a strong binding as the control (data not shown).Fig. 2Sialylation of sera and muscles from DMRV patients and controls. A, sialic acid contents of the serum from control (n = 7) and DMRV patients (n = 9, patients 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 26, and 28) were measured using a SIALIZYME-550 kit.

Science. 1999; 284: 1372-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We examined the recovery of sialylation by the addition of NeuAc or ManNAc using primary cultured cells from patients and evaluated the sialylation status by lectin staining (Fig. 3A). We used two lectins, WGA, which specifically recognizes a cluster structure of sialic acids (20Bhavanandan V.P. Katlic A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4000-4008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SBA. WGA strongly stained the perinuclear region in control fibroblasts. Fibroblasts from patient 18, who harbors compound heterozygous missense mutations D176V and I472T, showed weaker staining with WGA compared with normal controls (Fig. 3A; WGA, DMRV, and Control). SBA did not stain the fibroblasts from normal controls but strongly stained cells from DMRV patients. These results were also confirmed in myotubes from another DMRV patient (patient 5) who has compound heterozygous mutations causing exon 4 skipping and V572L (Fig. 3B) and fibroblasts from patient 19 with a homozygous D176V mutation (data not shown). The sialic acid levels in skin fibroblasts and myotubes from DMRV patients were significantly decreased at ∼60–74% of control cells when cells were cultured in serum-free medium (Fig. 3C). By adding ManNAc or NeuAc into the culture medium, sialic acid levels in the fibroblasts and myotubes were restored to normal levels (Fig. 3C, +ManNAc and +NeuAc). Furthermore, WGA staining of cells from patients also increased to normal levels, and particularly strong WGA staining was observed in the plasma membrane of myotubes. In contrast, the SBA staining in DMRV cells disappeared by the addition of either sugar (Fig. 3, A and B; +ManNAc and +NeuAc). The addition of GlcNAc into the medium had no effect on the staining pattern with either lectin (Fig. 3, A and C, +GlcNAc). These results suggest the potential therapeutic use of ManNAc and NeuAc.Fig. 3Recovery of the sialylation in DMRV cells by treatment with ManNAc and NeuAc. A, the fibroblasts from patient 18 (DMRV) and control individuals were stained with WGA and SBA lectins. The patient 18 fibroblasts cultured in the presence of GlcNAc (+GlcNAc), ManNAc (+ManNAc) and NeuAc (+NeuAc) were also stained with both lectins. B, differentiated myotubes from patient 5 cultured without (DMRV) and with ManNAc (+ManNAc) and NeuAc (+NeuAc) were stained by WGA and SBA lectins and desmin antibody. Desmin-positive cells are myotubes.

Combined with prior results, the 1765G→C mutation accounts for 55% (36 of 66) of the abnormal alleles confirming the high frequency of this mutation in Japan. Haplotype analysis suggests that this common mutation is due to a founder effect (8Nishino I. Noguchi S. Murayama K. Driss A. Sugie K. Oya Y. Nagata T. Chida K. Takahashi T. Takusa Y Ohi T. Nishimiya J. Sunohara N. Ciafaloni E. Kawai M. Aoki M. Nonaka I. Neurology. 2002; 59: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All of the mutations identified in DMRV patients caused reduction (but not total loss) of enzymatic activities of either UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase or ManNAc kinase. These results strongly suggest that DMRV is caused by partial loss of function of the gene product. Interestingly, we previously identified the compound heterozygous mutations D378Y and A631V in a North American DMRV patient of German and Irish origin; these mutations have also been identified in an Irish HIBM patient (13Effertz K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). D378Y reduced UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity, and A631V decreased ManNAc kinase activity. Together with clinical and pathological similarities, these biochemical and molecular genetic results suggest that DMRV and HIBM are actually the same disease.Through our study, we obtained information about novel molecular aspects in GNE. The two catalytic domains of the GNE molecule do not always work separately or independently in contrast to a published report (13Effertz K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. J. Biol.

CD147-caveolin-1 complex formation was temperature and cholesterol dependent, reminiscent of associations seen within caveolae/lipid rafts. However, the subset of caveolin-1 associated with CD147 appeared exclusively within intermediate density sucrose gradient fractions, rather than in the low density fractions containing the bulk of caveolin-1. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that CD147 Ig domain 2 was required for caveolin-1 association. In contrast to CD147-caveolin-1 complexes, CD147-α3 integrin association was not disrupted upon cholesterol depletion, occurred in high density sucrose fractions, and did not involve CD147 Ig domain 2. Overexpression of caveolin-1 caused a specific decrease in clustering of cell surface CD147, as detected by “cluster specific” mAb M6/13. Conversely, a mutant CD147 deficient in caveolin-1 association showed enhanced spontaneous cell surface clustering (detected by mAb M6/13), and did not show decreased clustering in response to caveolin-1 overexpression. Furthermore, the same CD147 mutant yielded an elevated induction of MMP-1. In conclusion, caveolin-1 associates with CD147, in a complex distinct from CD147-α3 integrin complexes, thereby diminishing both CD147 clustering and CD147-dependent MMP-1-inducing activity.

In summary, CD147 on tumor cells stimulates MMP production by stromal cells and/or other tumor cells, thereby leading to extracellular matrix degradation, and elevated tumor growth and metastasis.

These diverse results emphasize the significance of CD147 and underscore the need for detailed understanding of its mechanism of action. The variably glycosylated CD147 protein (32–60 kDa) contains two extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a transmembrane domain, and a 39-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (25Biswas C. Zhang Y. DeCastro R. Guo H. Nakamura T. Kataoka H. Nabeshima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 434-439PubMed Google Scholar). The homophilic counter-receptor binding activity of CD147 requires the first Ig domain (16Sun J.

A monoclonal antibody screen for α3β1 integrin-associated proteins revealed a robust and possibly direct association of the structurally similar α3β1 and α6β1 integrins (but not α5β1 or α2β1 integrins) with CD147/EMMPRIN (26Berditchevski F. Chang S. Bodorova J. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29174-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, at present, there is no evidence to suggest that CD147 alters integrin function. CD147 also associates with the monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 (27Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), and facilitates their targeting to plasma membrane, where they act as lactic acid transporters. Studies using CD147 chimeras indicated that the cytoplasmic tail and/or transmembrane regions of CD147 may be particularly important for association with MCT1 (a protein that itself spans the membrane 12 times) (27Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Here we show that a population of CD147 (distinct from the integrin-associated population) co-immunoprecipitates with caveolin-1, with a resulting negative effect on CD147 cell surface clustering and function. The association of caveolin-1 with Ig superfamily proteins has generally not been observed. Instead, caveolin-1 is known primarily as an integral membrane protein, which oligomerizes and plays a central role in the formation of flask-shaped membrane structures known as caveolae (28Liu P. Rudick M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41295-41298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 can associate either directly or indirectly with a variety of signaling molecules (growth factor receptors, G proteins, Src family kinases, etc.), sometimes resulting in down-regulation of signaling function (28Liu P. Rudick M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41295-41298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 29Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). This down-regulation of critical signaling pathways is consistent with the oncosuppressive effects of caveolin-1 (29Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). In this regard, caveolin-1 can suppress cell proliferation, while being generally elevated on normal cells, but mutated or diminished on tumor cells (30Razani B. Lisanti M.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1553-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 also can inhibit tumor cell invasion, soft agar growth, and MMP production (31Fiucci G. Ravid D. Reich R. Liscovitch M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We suggest that caveolin-1 down-regulation of CD147 functions could contribute, at least in part, to the oncosuppressive effects of caveolin-1, and help to explain caveolin-1 effects on MMP production. Antibodies and Cell Lines—Antibodies to CD147 were rabbit polyclonal antiserum B10 and mAb 8G6 (16Sun J. Hemler M.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2276-2281PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berditchevski F. Chang S.

Anti-GFP mAb 3E6 was from Obiogene, Carlsbad, CA, and anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal was from Clontech. Antibodies to integrins α2 (mAb, IIE10), α3 (mAb, A3X8; pAb, D23), and β1 (mAb, TS2/16) and to tetraspanins CD151 (mAb 5C11) and CD81 (mAb M38) were referenced previously (34Yang X. Claas C. Kraeft S.-K. Chen L.B. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Human cell lines from embryonic kidney (HEK293), carcinoma (A431 and MDA231), and fibrosarcoma (HT1080) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) and 10% fetal calf serum. Transfected cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5–1 mg/ml G418. Primary fibroblast cell line NHDF-AD was purchased from Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ. Whereas A431 and HT1080 cells, with relatively high caveolin-1 levels, were used for endogenous studies; HEK293 cells, with relatively low levels, were used for caveolin-1 transfection studies. HT1080 cells, with relatively low levels of endogenous CD147, were preferred for studies of transfected wild type and mutant CD147. Using recombinant PCR, CD147 and caveolin-1 cDNAs were inserted into vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to obtain CD147-GFP and caveolin-1-GFP; and CD147 cDNA was inserted into vector pDsRed1-N1 (Clontech) to obtain CD147-RFP. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells (3–5 × 106) were lysed in 1.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Brij 96, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 2–4 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 10 min), lysates were incubated with protein A-conjugated beads overnight to remove nonspecific binding material. After incubation with antibody for 1 h, Protein A-conjugated beads were added and further incubated at 4 °C overnight, followed by four washes with lysis buffer. Immune complexes were eluted from beads with Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE under nonreduced conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA85, 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking with PBST (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% powdered skim milk for 1 h, blots were incubated for 2 h or overnight with primary antibody in the same buffer as above, washed three times with PBST, and then incubated with secondary antibody. All bands were detected using an ECL detection kit (RPN 2106, Amersham Biosciences). CD147-Caveolin-1 Association Is Specific, Reciprocally Demonstrated, and Occurs on the Cell Surface—While studying CD147-integrin associations, we uncovered surprising evidence that CD147 could associate with caveolin-1. As shown, we recovered caveolin-1 not only from whole cell lysates of A431 carcinoma cells (Fig. 1, lane k), and from caveolin-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, lanes f and j), but also from CD147 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, lanes e and i). Although tetraspanins CD81 and CD151, and integrin α3 and integrin β1 subunits were expressed at high levels, we did not observe any caveolin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with those molecules (Fig. 1, lanes b–d and h). Likewise we did not recover caveolin-1 from immunoprecipitates of other highly expressed cell surface molecules including CD98, CD44, CD71 (transferrin receptor), or from other transmembrane Ig superfamily proteins (VCAM-1, EWI-2) (not shown). In a separate experiment, using HEK293 cells co-transfected with CD147-RFP and caveolin-1-GFP, immunoprecipitates of CD147 again yielded caveolin-1 (Fig. 1C, lower panel, lane b), and conversely, immunoprecipitates of caveolin-1 yielded CD147 (top panel, lane c). Thus, association can be demonstrated reciprocally. If cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 instead of 1% Brij 96, CD147-caveolin-1 association was not observed (not shown). Next we determined that CD147-caveolin-1 complexes appear on the cell surface. The cell surface subset of CD147 was engaged on HT1080 cells, using mAb 8G6. Subsequent isolation of these CD147-containing immune complexes (S, surface) revealed an abundance of associated caveolin-1 (Fig. 2, lower panel, lane b). After removal of cell surface CD147 complexes, CD147 remaining in the lysates (IN, intracellular) was isolated, with caveolin-1 associated at diminished levels (Fig. 2A, lower panel, lane c). In a separate experiment, cell surface CD147-GFP was engaged on HEK293 cells, using an anti-GFP mAb. Again, an abundance of associated caveolin-1 was observed (Fig. 2B, lower panel, lane f). In contrast, the intracellular pool of CD147 contained markedly less caveolin-1 (Fig. 2B, lower panel, lane g). In control experiments, incubation of intact cells with control Ig did not yield any associated caveolin-1 from the subsequently prepared Brij 96 lysate. Also, immunoprecipitation of total CD147 from lysate (T, total; i.e. without prior removal of the cell surface subset) yielded only a modest amount of associated caveolin-1 (Fig. 2B, lower panel, lane e). As seen from the top panels, CD147 was recovered at similar levels from surface and intracellular fractions, and at a higher level from total lysate. These results indicate (a) that caveolin-1 is indeed associated with cell surface CD147 in multiple cell types, and (b) that caveolin-1 recovery is more efficient when anti-CD147 antibodies are added to intact cells prior to lysis. In another experiment, immunoprecipitation of caveolin-1 from Brij 96 lysate of A431 cells yielded cell surface biotin-labeled CD147 (not shown), thus confirming the cell surface location of CD147-caveolin-1 complexes. CD147 Associates with a Distinct Subset of Caveolin-1, in a Temperature- and Cholesterol-dependent Manner—Several proteins associate indirectly with caveolin-1 in the context of lipid-containing membrane microdomains, such that associations are stabilized at 4 °C, and dependent on cholesterol (29Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 35Elliott M.H. Fliesler S.J. Ghalayini A.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7892-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 37Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1880-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Indeed, association of CD147 with caveolin-1 was largely eliminated when immunoprecipitated CD147 samples were incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 3A, lane d) instead of 4 °C (lane c). Recovery of caveolin-1 was unaffected by temperature changes (lanes e and f), and no caveolin was associated with negative control α2 integrin (lanes a and b). In addition, association of CD147 with caveolin-1 was progressively lost upon preincubation of intact A431 cells with increasing doses of the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Fig. 3B). Whereas CD147 association with caveolin-1 was markedly diminished upon cholesterol depletion (Fig. 3, B, and C, lane d) CD147 association with α3 integrin was not (Fig. 3C, upper panel, compare lanes c and d). Likewise, recovery of α3 from A431 cell lysates was unaffected (upper panel, lanes e–g). No caveolin was associated with either α2 or α3 integrins (Fig. 3C, lower panel, lanes a, b, e, and f). Complexes containing caveolin-1 typically appear in the lowdensity “light membrane” fractions of sucrose gradients (38Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Indeed, from Brij 96 lysates of A431 cells, the bulk of caveolin-1 appeared in fractions (lanes 1-5) containing low density (5–35%) sucrose (Fig. 4C). In contrast, fractionated CD147 (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–8) was associated with a subset of caveolin-1 (Fig. 4B) that was mostly restricted to intermediate density fractions (lanes 6 and 7; ∼35–40% sucrose). Thus, CD147-caveolin-1 complexes differ from the majority of other caveolin protein complexes, which are found in light membrane fractions (28Liu P. Rudick M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41295-41298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Upon depletion of cholesterol with MβCD, CD147 shifted from intermediate fractions toward the dense fractions in sucrose gradients (not shown). In a control experiment, CD71, representative of typical cell surface proteins, was largely confined to the dense fractions (Fig. 4D). In a separate experiment, CD147 was fractionated and associated α3 integrin was shown to be largely present in the dense fractions (Fig. 4F, lanes 8–11), and aligned more closely with total α3 integrin (Fig. 4G, lanes 8–11) than with CD147 (Fig. 4E, lanes 5–10). Results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 support the idea that CD147-caveolin association is indirect, and dependent on cholesterol, while occurring in the context of an atypical lipid-containing environment. CD147 Ig Domain 2 Plays a Critical Role in Caveolin-1 Association—To map the site in CD147 required for caveolin-1 association we prepared CD147 chimeras in which the first Ig domain, second Ig domain, transmembrane, or cytoplasmic domains were either deleted or replaced by equivalent domains from another IgSF protein (called EWI-2 (39Stipp C.S. Kolesnikova T.V. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40545-40554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)). Extensive preliminary experiments, involving transient transfections of HEK293 and HT1080 cells pointed clearly to CD147 Ig domain 2 as being most critical for caveolin-1 association (not shown). We next carried out stable transfections of HT1080 cells. As indicated (Fig. 5A), replacement of Ig domain 2 together with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain resulted in loss of caveolin-1 association (lane d). In contrast, replacement of the cytoplasmic domain alone (lane b), or cytoplasmic plus transmembrane regions (lane c), or deletion of Ig domain 1 (lane f) minimally affected caveolin-1 association. These results suggested that Ig domain 2 plays a critical role in the association. To test further the importance of CD147 Ig domain 2, it was replaced either with Ig domain 4 from EWI-2 (lane h) or with Ig domain 2 from CD2 (mutant D2c, lane k) and in both cases caveolin-1 association was almost completely abolished. In additional experiments (indicated schematically in Fig. 5C), replacement of CD147 Ig domain 2 with Ig domain 6 from VCAM-1 also abolished caveolin-1 association. Likewise, deletion of CD147 Ig domain 2 or Ig domains 1 and 2 abolished caveolin-1 association, whereas deletion of the cytoplasmic tail did not. Deletion or replacement of CD147 domain 2 had no effect on association with α3β1 integrin (Fig. 5B, lanes m and n). Possible Functional Relevance of Caveolin-1 Association—To begin to understand the functional importance of CD147-caveolin-1 association, we overexpressed caveolin-1 in HEK293 cells (about 8-fold over endogenous), and then analyzed its effect on cell surface clustering of CD147, using previously defined “cluster specific” monoclonal antibody M6/13 (32Koch C. Staffler G. Huttinger R. Hilgert I. Prager E. Cerny J. Steinlein P. Majdic O. Horejsi V. Stockinger H. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As indicated, appearance of the M6/13 epitope on CD147 was markedly diminished (Fig. 6), whereas another epitope, defined by mAb 8G6, was only minimally affected. The M6/13/8G6 ratio, calculated from mean fluorescence intensities, was consistently reduced by ∼45%. In control experiments, neither background IgG staining, nor staining of irrelevant protein CD151 were affected by caveolin-1 overexpression. We next hypothesized that if caveolin-1 association leads to decreased clustering, accompanied by decreased M6/13 epitope appearance, then loss of caveolin-1 association should lead to enhanced M6/13 epitope expression. Indeed, the M6/13 epitope was selectively enhanced upon expression of the CD147-D2c mutant (lacking caveolin-1 association) compared with wild type CD147 in HT1080 cells (Fig. 7, bottom panel). In contrast, mutant and wild type CD147 yielded similar levels of the epitope defined using mAb 8G6 (Fig. 7, third panel). The M6/13/8G6 ratio, calculated from mean fluorescence intensities, more than doubled (from 9.8 up to 20.8%). In control experiments, antibody binding to α3 integrin and background IgG binding were unaffected by the CD147 mutant. Results from Figs. 6 and 7 predict that caveolin-1 overexpression should have less effect on CD147-D2c, compared with wild type CD147. Indeed, when CD147-D2c was transiently expressed in 293 cells already overexpressing caveolin-1 or not overexpressing caveolin-1, the M6/13/8G6 ratio (∼27%) was essentially the same (Table I). In contrast, transiently expressed wild type CD147 did show a significant decrease in the M6/13/8G6 ratio (from 41% down to 27%; Table I) because of the increased caveolin-1 expression.Fig. 7Decreased CD147 association with caveolin-1 correlates with increased CD147 clustering. H1080 cells were stably transfected with wild type CD147-GFP or mutant CD147-D2c-GFP, and then analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 6, except that goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse R-phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody was utilized to analyze only the gated, GFP-positive HT1080 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IDifferential effects of caveolin-1 on mutant and wild type CD147 M13/8G6 ratiosCell typeIgGaNumbers in these columns represent mean fluorescence intensity values.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies encompass a group of neurodegenerative diseases including scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and human pathologies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Gerstmann-Straüssler-Scheinker syndrome (1Ghetti B.

In prion diseases the normal cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) undergoes a conformational change to the scrapie isoform (PrPSc) that is partially resistant to proteases and accumulates in plaques (5Horwich A. Weissman J. Cell. 1997; 89: 499-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). PrPC is anchored to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Like most GPI-anchored proteins, PrPC is clustered into cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains called lipid rafts (6Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R. DeArmond S.J. Smart E.J.

A reduction in the level of cell surface PrPC through enhanced endocytosis or by release of the protein from the membrane may reduce PrPSc production by limiting the amount of PrPC substrate available for conversion (9Marella M.

However, the mechanism(s) by which soluble PrPC is released from cells remains to be determined. Like other GPI-anchored proteins, PrPC can be released from the cell surface in vitro by the action of exogenous bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (19Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of this fact, it has become widely assumed that soluble PrPC is produced via cleavage of its GPI anchor by an endogenous mammalian GPI-specific phospholipase (17Parizek P. Roeckl C. Weber J. Flechsig E. Aguzzi A. Raeber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44627-44632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, a growing number of cell surface proteins can also be proteolytically shed by the action of a group of zinc metalloproteases known as secretases or sheddases (reviewed in Ref. 20Moss M.L. Lambert M.H. Essays Biochem. 2002; 38: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This cleavage and secretion appears to be an important and widely used cellular post-translational regulatory process, because a variety of structurally and functionally unrelated cell surface proteins undergo such a process (reviewed in Ref. 21Hooper N.M. Karran E H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Whereas most proteolytically shed proteins are derived from transmembrane polypeptide-anchored precursors, several GPI-anchored proteins, including the folate receptor (22Yang X.Y. Mackins J.Y. Li Q.J. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11493-11499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase ART2.2 (23Kahl S. Nissen M. Girisch R. Duffy T. Leiter E.H. Haag F. Koch-Nolte F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4463-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and a GPI-anchored construct of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (24Parkin E.T. Tan F. Skidgel R.A. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3079-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are shed by the action of a metalloprotease. In the current study, we show for the first time that a significant proportion of PrPC is shed from the cell surface by the proteolytic action of a zinc metalloprotease with similarities to the α-secretase involved in the shedding of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We also show that this protease-mediated shedding of PrP is distinct from the shedding induced by treatment with the lipid raft-disrupting agents, filipin or methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), which is most likely phospholipase-mediated. Collectively, our data indicate dual mechanisms for the cell surface shedding of PrP. Cell Culture—The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 mg/ml), and 2 mm glutamate (all from Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. For stable transfections, 30 μg of DNA was introduced to cells by electroporation, and selection was performed in normal growth medium containing 500 μg/ml neomycin selection antibiotic. SB 244000 and all other hydroxamate-based inhibitor compounds were synthesized at GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (Harlow, UK) and were used at 20 μm. Structural details of these compounds have been published previously (25Parkin E.T. Trew A. Christie G. Faller A. Mayer R. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4972-4981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), filipin, and MβCD (Sigma) were used at 1 μm, 10 nm, and 5 mm, respectively. Cells were incubated with copper concentrations of 0–100 μm achieved by the addition of a CuSO4 stock diluted in fetal bovine serum. When the cells were confluent, the medium was changed to OptiMEM (Invitrogen), and the cells were incubated for 7 h or 30 min at 37 °C with the indicated compounds (24 h in the case of the copper incubations). The medium was then harvested and concentrated. For analysis of cell-associated PrP, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and scraped from the flasks into phosphate-buffered saline. Following centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells, they were lysed in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4. Protein and Enzyme Assays—Protein was quantified using bicinchoninic acid (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Malia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke B.J. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar) in a microtiter plate with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate, and the product was quantified spectrophotometrically as described previously (27Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Peptide:N-Glycosidase F Deglycosylation—Enzymic deglycosylation was performed by adding 10 μlof5× peptide:N-glycosidase F buffer (30 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 20 mm EDTA) to 35 μl of concentrated conditioned medium or cell lysate along with 2.5 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS and 2.5 μlof β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were boiled for 5 min, and then 20% (v/v) Triton X-100 (2.5 μl) was added along with 1 unit of peptide:N-glycosidase F. Samples were then deglycosylated for 16 h at 37 °C. Membrane Preparation and High Speed Centrifugation—SH-SY5Y cells were harvested as described above, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Hepes, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. The cells were then disrupted by sonication (30% maximum power for 30 s using a Branson Sonifier), and nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. A total membrane fraction was then pelleted by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 90 min. High speed centrifugation of media to pellet particulate material was performed under the same conditions. PI-PLC Digestion and Triton X-114 Phase Separation—For cleavage of the GPI anchor with PI-PLC, samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 unit/ml Bacillus thuringiensis PI-PLC. For Triton X-114 phase separation, samples (50 μl) were mixed with 150 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2% (v/v) precondensed Triton X-114 and successively incubated for 10 min at 4 °C and 3 min at 30 °C. The sample was then layered over a 6% (w/v) sucrose cushion (300 μl), and the aqueous and detergent phases were separated by centrifugation for 3 min at 3000 × g. The volume of the detergent phase was made equal to that of the aqueous phase with 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. SDS-PAGE and Immunoelectrophoretic Blot Analysis—Samples were mixed with an equal volume of reducing electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 7–17% polyacrylamide gradient gels and transferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as previously described (28Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 3F4 (Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA) recognizes a 3F4 epitope tag (corresponding to amino acid residues 109–112 of human PrP) at residues 108–111 of the murine prion protein and was used at a concentration of 1:4000. Monoclonal antibody SAF-32 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) recognizes the octapeptide repeat region located in the N-terminal region of PrP and was used at 1:3000. Monoclonal antibody R1 (a gift from Dr. A. Williamson (Department of Immunology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) recognizes amino acid residues 220–231 at the C terminus of PrP (29Leclerc E. Peretz D. Ball H. Sakurai H. Legname G. Serban A. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R Williamson R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1547-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and was used at 1:5000. Monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Signet Laboratories) recognizes amino acid residues 1–17 of the human amyloid beta sequence and was used at 1:2500. Bound antibody was detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in conjunction with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL®) detection method (Amersham Biosciences). Metalloprotease-mediated Constitutive Shedding of PrP—In order to elucidate the mechanism involved in constitutive PrP secretion, we compared the shedding of overexpressed wild-type PrP (wt-PrP) from human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with that of two mutant PrP constructs (Fig. 1A). In PrP-DA, the PrP signal peptide is replaced with the uncleaved signal sequence/transmembrane domain and stalk region from murine aminopeptidase A (30Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PrP-PG14 is associated with an inherited prion disease (31Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and possesses an additional nine octapeptide repeats. The expression levels of all three forms of PrP were essentially identical as determined by immunoblotting cell lysates with antibody 3F4 (Fig. 1B). Conditioned media obtained following incubation of the cells for 7 h in the absence or presence of the zinc metalloprotease hydroxamate-based inhibitor SB 244000 were also immunoblotted using antibody 3F4 (Fig. 1C). wt-PrP was effectively shed into the medium, and SB 244000 inhibited the shedding by 70%. In contrast, little or no PrP-DA or PrP-PG14 could be detected in conditioned media. When conditioned medium was subjected to phase separation in Triton X-114 (Fig. 1D), 85.0 ± 8.7% of wt-PrP was detected in the aqueous phase, thereby confirming the hydrophilic nature of the secreted PrP. As a control, membranes isolated from SH-SY5Y cells were also subjected to phase separation (Fig. 1D). In the absence of prior bacterial PI-PLC treatment, 100% of the membrane-associated PrP was located in the detergent-rich phase, and following PI-PLC treatment, all of the PrP was located in the aqueous phase. Immunocharacterization of Constitutively Shed PrP—Lysates and conditioned media from mock-transfected and PrP-transfected SH-SY5Y cells were immunoblotted with the PrP antibodies 3F4, SAF-32, and R1 (Fig. 2A). All three antibodies detected PrP as a diffuse band between 30 and 45 kDa in both cell lysates and conditioned media (Fig. 1, B–D). The amount of PrP in conditioned media was dramatically reduced in the presence of SB 244000. When deglycosylated samples were immunoblotted using antibody 3F4 (Fig. 2E), two major bands were detected at 27 and 21 kDa in cell lysates, and a 27-kDa band and a slightly less intense doublet at 20–21 kDa were detected in the conditioned medium. Using antibody SAF-32 (Fig. 2F), a major band at 27 kDa and a much less prominent band at 21–22 kDa were detected in deglycosylated cell lysates. PrP was detected almost exclusively as a 27-kDa polypeptide in conditioned medium using SAF-32. Using antibody R1 (Fig. 2G), PrP was detected as multiple bands in the lysates of PrP-transfected cells. In conditioned media, PrP was detected primarily as 27- and 21-kDa bands, with a faint band also detectable at 24 kDa. Thus, it appears that both full-length PrP and a C-terminal fragment are shed from the cells. Metalloprotease-mediated PrP Shedding Is Similar to That of the Amyloid Precursor Protein—Since PrP is GPI-anchored but appears to be shed by a metalloprotease, we compared its shedding mechanism with that of a transmembrane polypeptide-anchored protein known to be shed by the action of a metalloprotease, namely the APP. APP is expressed endogenously in SH-SY5Y cells; therefore, its shedding can be compared directly with that of PrP overexpressed in the same cells. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of a range of zinc metalloprotease hydroxamate-based inhibitors (25Parkin E.T. Trew A. Christie G. Faller A. Mayer R. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4972-4981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Conditioned media were immunoblotted with the APP monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Fig. 3A) and the PrP antibody 3F4 (Fig. 3B). Multiple blots were quantified by densitometric analysis, and the inhibition patterns of APP and PrP shedding were compared quantitatively (Fig. 3C). No significant differences could be detected between the inhibition profiles for APP and PrP shedding with a range of hydroxamate-based compounds. APP shedding is known to be stimulated by activators of the protein kinase signaling cascade such as PMA (32Canet-Aviles R.M. Anderton M. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Vaughan P.F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 102: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the PMA-regulated shedding of APP from SH-SY5Y cells with that of PrP. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of PMA, and conditioned media were immunoblotted with the APP antibody 6E10 (Fig. 4A) or the PrP antibody 3F4 (Fig. 4B). Both APP and PrP shedding were strongly enhanced to a similar extent by PMA treatment, and this regulated shedding of the two proteins was effectively inhibited by SB 244000 (Fig. 4C). Shedding of Endogenous GPI-anchored Alkaline Phosphatase Does Not Parallel That of PrP—Although hydroxamic acidbased compounds such as SB 244000 are active site-directed zinc metalloprotease inhibitors, we considered the possibility that they may have inhibited PrP shedding via interaction with a phospholipase rather than a protease. We have shown previously that SH-SY5Y cells possess endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity, which, like PrP (33Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37241-37248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), is localized within lipid rafts (35Parkin E.T. Hussain I. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2179-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that endogenous alkaline phosphatase is GPI-anchored, since the level of activity in conditioned media was increased 81-fold when cells were treated with exogenous bacterial PI-PLC, and SB 244000 had no effect on this release (Table I). In addition, the endogenous release of alkaline phosphatase was not inhibited by SB 244000 or stimulated by PMA (Table I), implying that these compounds were not exerting their effects on PrP via the inhibition or stimulation of a phospholipase activity.Table IShedding of endogenous alkaline phosphatase from the surface of SH-SY5Y cellsTreatmentAlkaline phosphatase activity in conditioned medianmol h-1Control14.40 ± 4.98SB 24400016.09 ± 2.53PMA12.94 ± 2.45PI-PLC1166.67 ± 353.76PI-PLC + SB 2440001128.19 ± 57.65 Open table in a new tab Metalloprotease-mediated PrP Shedding Is Stimulated by Divalent Copper Ions—Although copper promotes the endocytosis of PrP from the cell surface (36Perera W.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), at lower concentrations we noticed that it promoted the shedding of PrP (Fig. 5). Whereas the expression of PrP was unaltered by copper treatment (Fig. 5A), the level of PrP in the conditioned media was increased 2-fold at a copper concentration of 1.5 μm (Fig. 5, B and C). The amount of shed PrP continued to increase until a peak was reached at 5 μm copper, after which levels began to decrease again but remained above control levels. Despite SB 244000 having no effect on the levels of PrP in cell lysates (Fig. 5D), copper-induced shedding into the medium was almost abolished by co-incubation with this compound (Fig. 5, E and F), indicating the involvement of a zinc metalloprotease in the copper-induced shedding of PrP. Shedding of PrP Induced by Filipin and MβCD Is Not Inhibited by Hydroxamate-based Compounds—The lipid raft-disrupting agent filipin has previously been shown to stimulate PrP release from cells (9Marella M. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Chabry J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25457-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether lipid raft-disrupting agents stimulate PrP release by increasing the metalloprotease-mediated shedding of the protein, we incubated PrP expressing SH-SY5Y cells with filipin or MβCD in the absence or presence of SB 244000 (Fig. 6). After 30 min, the release of PrP from control cells was barely detectable on the immunoblots, whereas both filipin (Fig. 6, A and C) and MβCD (Fig. 6, B and D) dramatically enhanced PrP secretion. However, this enhanced secretion was not inhibited by co-incubation with SB 244000. Thus, the shedding of PrP induced by lipid raft-disrupting agents was not mediated via the action of the zinc metalloprotease. Filipin/MβCD-mediated PrP Shedding Involves Cleavage of the GPI Anchor—Triton X-114 phase separation of conditioned media from filipin- or MβCD-treated cells (Fig. 7A) showed that 89 ± 2 and 88 ± 2%, respectively, of PrP was located in the aqueous phase, indicating that the released PrP was hydrophilic in nature. In addition, PrP could not be pelleted from the media by high speed centrifugation (data not shown). To determine the possible role of the GPI anchor in filipin-mediated PrP shedding, we compared the shedding of wt-PrP with that of PrP-CTM. In PrP-CTM, the C-terminal GPI anchor addition sequence of PrP is replaced with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of angiotensin-converting enzyme (30Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7B). Both wt-PrP and PrP-CTM were expressed at identical levels in SH-SY5Y cell lysates (Fig. 7C). Since only the GPI-anchored wt-PrP and not PrP-CTM was shed into the medium in response to filipin treatment (Fig. 7D), it would appear that cleavage of the GPI anchor is involved in filipin-mediated PrP shedding. Consequently, we examined whether endogenous GPI-anchored alkaline phosphatase was also shed into the medium in response to filipin treatment (Fig. 7E). The amount of alkaline phosphatase activity in conditioned media from filipin-treated cells was 4-fold higher than that in conditioned media from control cells, indicating that the raft-disrupting agents filipin and MβCD promote the release of multiple GPI-anchored proteins through cleavage of the GPI anchor. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms behind the shedding of PrPC from human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In order to determine whether PrP was constitutively shed by means of a specific enzymic mechanism and not through a nonspecific process such as membrane blebbing, we compared the shedding of wt-PrP to that of PrP-DA and PrP-PG14. PrP-DA possesses an additional membrane anchoring domain at the N terminus (30Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and PrP-PG14 is the mouse PrP homologue of a nine-octapeptide insertional mutation, which is associated with an inherited form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans (37Duchen L.W. Poulter M. Harding A.E. Brain. 1993; 116: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Krasemann S. Zerr I. Weber T. Poser S. Kretzschmar H. Hunsmann G. Bodemer W. Mol.

Brain Res. 1992; 13: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PrP-PG14 is known to be resistant to PI-PLC cleavage (40Ivanova L. Barmada S. Kummer T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42409-42421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), implying that the addition of the nine octapeptide repeats imparts an additional form of membrane interaction to the protein. In contrast to wt-PrP, neither PrP-DA nor PrP-PG14 was present in the conditioned medium to an appreciable level, indicating that wt-PrP was probably being cleaved from its membrane anchoring domain. Confirmation of this came from the observation that constitutively shed PrP was hydrophilic as assessed by temperature-induced phase separation in Triton X-114 (Fig. 1D) and could not be pelleted by high speed centrifugation (data not shown) indicating the removal of at least the fatty acyl moiety of the GPI anchor upon shedding. The fact that constitutive PrP shedding was inhibited by SB 244000 suggested the involvement of a zinc metalloprotease in a proteolytic cleavage event. Consequently, we sought to determine the approximate site of cleavage within PrP by immunocharacterization of shed PrP (Fig. 2). Following deglycosylation, antibodies 3F4, SAF-32, and R1 all detected a 27-kDa band in the conditioned media that corresponds to either full-length or only slightly truncated PrP. Antibodies 3F4 and R1 but not SAF-32 also detected a 21-kDa band in the conditioned media. Since this PrP fragment retained both the C-terminal and 3F4 epitopes but lacked the N-terminal epitope recognized by SAF-32, it most likely represents the C-terminal PrP-21 fragment that results from reactive oxygen species-mediated cleavage within the octapeptide repeat region of the protein (41McMahon H.E.M. Mangé A. Nishida N. Créminon C. Casanova D. Lehmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2286-2291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The fact that shedding of both the 27- and 21-kDa PrP species was inhibited by SB 244000 implied that PrP was cleaved by a zinc metalloprotease very close to the C terminus. Since antibody R1 recognizes an epitope within the C-terminal amino acid residues 220–231 (29Leclerc E. Peretz D. Ball H. Sakurai H. Legname G. Serban A. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R Williamson R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1547-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the polypeptide chain of PrP must be cleaved very near the GPI anchor attachment site at Ser-231, thereby retaining sufficient amino acid residues on the shed protein to provide a minimum required epitope for the R1 antibody. An alternative explanation is that SB 244000 inhibited a phospholipase capable of cleaving PrP within its GPI anchor. However, this explanation is extremely unlikely for several reasons. First, neither the constitutive shedding of endogenous GPI-anchored alkaline phosphatase nor the shedding induced by exogenous bacterial PI-PLC treatment were inhibited by SB 244000 (Table I). Second, the inhibition profile for a range of structurally variant active site-directed hydroxamate-based zinc metalloprotease inhibitors (25Parkin E.T. Trew A. Christie G. Faller A. Mayer R. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4972-4981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was exactly the same in relation to PrP shedding as it was to the shedding of the transmembrane polypeptide-anchored APP (Fig. 3). Finally, PMA did not stimulate shedding of endogenous GPI-anchored alkaline phosphatase (Table I) but did stimulate the shedding of PrP and APP in an identical manner that was sensitive to inhibition by SB 244000 (Fig. 4). Since inhibition by hydroxamate-based compounds and stimulation by PMA are characteristic features of zinc metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding (21Hooper N.M. Karran E H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we conclude that PrP is shed by such a mechanism. Several studies have identified a secreted form of PrP and speculated that it was derived from GPI-anchored PrP by the action of a phospholipase (10Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos A. Stahl N.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) previously reported that PrP secreted from primary cultures of neonatal Syrian hamster brain exhibited no change in electrophoretic mobility upon treatment with aqueous hydrofluoric acid, indicative of loss of the entire GPI anchor modification. The authors suggested that PrP may be shed via the action of a protease, but no evidence was presented to support this theory. In addition, a proportion (15%) of PrPSc extracted from hamster brain was found to terminate at Gly-228 just N-terminal to the site of GPI anchor addition at Ser-231 (42Stahl N.

Whether the zinc metalloprotease-mediated shedding of PrPC that we have reported here is responsible for the generation of truncated forms of PrPSc awaits determination. The amino-terminal half of PrP contains a series of histidine- and glycine-rich octapeptide repeats that bind copper ions (43Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although at concentrations of 100 μm or above, copper ions stimulate the endocytosis of PrP (36Perera W.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 44Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), at lower concentrations, we observed that they promoted the shedding of PrP and that this shedding was sensitive to SB 244000, implicating the involvement of a zinc metalloprotease (Fig. 5). The apparent decrease in the amount of PrP shed at the higher concentrations (100 μm) of copper may be due to competition between the shedding and endocytosis of the protein. The enhanced shedding observed at low concentrations of copper may be due to the metal binding to PrP and inducing a conformational change in the protein that facilitates its cleavage by the zinc metalloprotease. Alternatively, the low concentrations of copper may directly stimulate the activity of the zinc metalloprotease. Interestingly, low micromolar concentrations of copper have been shown to stimulate the nonamyloidogenic shedding of APP, which is also a copper-binding protein (45Borchardt T. Camakaris J. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the zinc metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding of other membrane proteins is also stimulated by copper ions. In contrast to the constitutive PMA- and copper-induced shedding of PrP, the shedding induced by the lipid raft-disrupting agents filipin and MβCD was not inhibited by SB 244000 (Fig. 6), indicating that the zinc metalloprotease was not involved. Nonetheless, the shed PrP was hydrophilic in nature as assessed by phase separation in Triton X-114 (Fig. 7A) and was not pelleted by high speed centrifugation (data not shown), suggesting partial or complete removal of the GPI anchor. The fact that the transmembrane polypeptide-anchored PrP-CTM construct was not released from cells in response to filipin treatment (Fig. 7D) strongly suggests that cleavage within the GPI anchor moiety, possibly by a phospholipase, is involved in this mechanism of PrP shedding. Further support for this cleavage mechanism comes from the observation that endogenous GPI-anchored alkaline phosphatase was also shed in response to filipin treatment. Filipin has previously been reported to promote the release of PrPC from the surface of neuroblastoma cells, but the mechanism of this release, whether shedding or membrane blebbing, was not investigated (9Marella M. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Chabry J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25457-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Since filipin and MβCD are structurally unrelated cholesterol-binding compounds but both stimulated PrP shedding, it is likely that their mechanism of action is through disrupting the structure of lipid rafts and the subsequent activation of a phospholipase. Both filipin and MβCD have been used previously to remove GPI-anchored proteins from lipid rafts with the proteins then appearing to enter the detergent-soluble nonraft regions of the membrane (46Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 47Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.L. Simons K. Horber J.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). However, caution should be exercised in interpreting such results in light of the fact that these lipid raft-disrupting agents can actually induce the shedding of PrP and other GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that PrP can be shed from the surface of human neuroblastoma cells by two distinct mechanisms; one is a phorbol ester-stimulated process that involves the action of a zinc metalloprotease with a similar inhibition profile to the α-secretase that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein, and the other is stimulated by the lipid raft-disrupting agents filipin and MβCD and involves cleavage within the GPI anchor possibly by a phospholipase. Since PrPC is located in lipid rafts at the cell surface (33Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37241-37248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), it is likely that the zinc metalloprotease-mediated shedding takes place within these structures. However, it was not possible to use lipid raft-disrupting agents to establish this, since such reagents increased the shedding of PrP through activation of another sheddase, probably a phospholipase. Since increased shedding of PrPC would reduce the amount of membranebound protein available for subsequent conversion to PrPSc (9Marella M. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Chabry J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25457-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), these mechanisms of cell surface PrPC shedding may be of critical importance in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

A stretch of basic amino acids highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom is responsible for this calcium-independent interaction. Inositol hexakisphosphate modulates synaptotagmin coupling to the syntaxin/SNAP-25 dimer, which is mirrored by changes in chromaffin cell exocytosis.

Cell-cell communication relies on the regulated release of transmitter molecules from secretory vesicles. These vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner to release the transmitter molecules (1Katz B. Miledi R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1965; 161: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 2Augustine G.J. Charlton M.P. Smith S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 633-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite identification of the major players involved in intracellular membrane fusion (3Sudhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Cowan W.M. Sudhof T.C. Stevens C.F. Synapses.

Synaptotagmin I, a calcium-phospholipid binding protein, is essential for synchronous synaptic vesicle exocytosis, whereas membrane fusion itself relies on the three SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; SNAP-25, synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione-S-transferase. proteins: synaptobrevin, also known as vesicle-associated membrane protein or VAMP, on the vesicular membrane, and syntaxin and SNAP-25, on the target plasma membrane (5Perin M.S.

Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar), with the syntaxin/SNAP-25 dimer (t-SNARE dimer) being an important intermediate in this process (10Fasshauer D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 644-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Current models of calcium-triggered exocytosis depict the calcium sensor, synaptotagmin, being physically linked to the SNARE fusion machinery in anticipation of the calcium entry (12Koh T.W.

Indeed, many independent studies have demonstrated that synaptotagmin I, the major brain isoform, can interact specifically with the neuronal SNAREs in the absence of calcium, as evidenced by pull-downs and affinity chromatography approaches followed by Coomassie staining (16Sollner T.

Using the brain-purified SNAREs, syntaxin1 and SNAP-25, we were recently able to show that synaptotagmin I binds specifically and with high affinity the t-SNARE dimer (but not the monomeric SNARE proteins) in a calcium-independent manner (18Rickman C. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that the majority of syntaxin and SNAP-25 in neuroendocrine cells likely exist as stable t-SNARE dimers on the plasma membrane (11Rickman C. Meunier F.A. Binz T. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 644-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that interaction of vesicular synaptotagmin with this entity may take place during the SNARE-mediated fusion of the two membranes. Because it is well established that synaptotagmin I plays a critical role in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (3Sudhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Cowan W.M. Sudhof T.C. Stevens C.F. Synapses. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD2001Google Scholar, 6Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C.

Neuron. 2002; 36: 897-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the molecular basis for the observed calcium-independent physical link between synaptotagmin and SNAREs must be elucidated. All synaptotagmins possess tandem C2 domains connected to the transmembrane region through a variable length linker (21Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and it is these domains in synaptotagmin I that are responsible for the calcium-independent SNARE binding (18Rickman C. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the synaptotagmin/SNARE link using genomic information of synaptotagmin amino acid sequences, the available structures of the individual C2 domains (22Sutton R.B.

Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1057-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and biochemical/mutagenesis studies. We now show that lysine residues in the fourth β-strand of the C2B domain of synaptotagmins I and II are essential for binding to the t-SNARE dimer. The almost complete conservation of this polybasic motif throughout evolution and between the two major members of the synaptotagmin family highlights its importance in exocytosis. Our functional analysis of the calcium-independent synaptotagmin/SNARE link suggests that this interaction serves a positive role in vesicle exocytosis and may be regulated by inositol polyphosphates. Cloning of Synaptotagmin Isoforms and Their Mutants—RT-PCR of rat brain mRNA was used to produce GST fusion clones in pGEX-KG corresponding to synaptotagmins I (amino acids 95–421) and II (amino acids 101–422). The individual C2 domains of synaptotagmin I and the synaptotagmin II C2B mutations were described previously (18Rickman C. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Ninobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For amperometry, synaptotagmin I C2AB construct (residues 96–421) in pcDNA3.1 was used. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange system (Stratagene) to generate the K326A,K327A, D178N,D230N,D232N, and D363N,D365N mutations in the synaptotagmin I C2AB in pcDNA3.1. Similar levels of eukaryotic expression for synaptotagmin and its mutants were confirmed in HeLa cells by Western immunoblotting. To transfer the K326A,K327A mutation into a GST fusion, the wild-type Kpn-Pst fragment in synaptotagmin I pGEX-KG was substituted with the Kpn-Pst fragment from the mutant synaptotagmin I in pcDNA3.1. Preparation of Proteins and Binding Assays—Recombinant synaptotagmin fragments, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were washed with buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) adjusted to 1 m NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol before elution with 15 mm reduced glutathione in buffer A. Proteins were bound to heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), eluted using a linear gradient (0.1–1.2 M NaCl) in buffer A, and dialyzed against buffer A. Syntaxin and SNAP-25 were purified from bovine brain cortex, as described previously (25Hu K. Carroll J. Fedorovich S. Rickman C. Sukhodub A. Davletov B. Nature. 2002; 415: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). All synaptotagmin/SNARE binding reactions were performed in the absence of calcium. Synaptotagmin domains (∼3 μg each) attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C in 100 μl buffer A in the presence of 1 μm SNAREs. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, and bound protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. For Western immunoblotting, 0.5% of bound material was run on SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Protein bands were detected by using monoclonal antibodies to SNAP-25 (SMI 81, Sternberger Monoclonals) and syntaxin (HPC-1, Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence with exposure to x-ray film. For screening the synaptotagmin II C2B mutations, densitometric quantitation of bands on x-ray film was performed and normalized against the GST-C2B amounts used in each reaction. Phospholipid binding was performed as described previously (26Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine liposomes were labeled with 0.2% (w/w) DiO fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes), and bound fluorescence was measured using a microplate fluorimeter (Fluoroskan, Labsystems).

Synaptotagmin/SNARE Immunoprecipitation from Rat Brain—All procedures were performed at 4 °C. One rat brain was homogenized in 12 ml of buffer A using a glass Teflon homogenizer, and membrane protein was solubilized by the addition of 2% Triton X-100 in the presence of Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The brain detergent extract was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Anti-SNAP-25 beads were prepared as described previously (18Rickman C. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The beads, with or without attached anti-SNAP-25 (SMI81, Sternberger Monoclonals), were incubated with the brain extract for 1 h and washed extensively in either 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, or in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 750 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100. The bound proteins were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using antibodies that specifically stain synaptotagmin I (clone 41.1, Synaptic Systems), synaptotagmin II (monoclonal antibody against the luminal part of the protein; Ref. 27Angaut-Petit D. Juzans P. Molgo J. Faille L. Seagar M.J. Takahashi M. Shoji-Kasai Y. Brain Res. 1995; 681: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), calcineurin (clone CN-A1, Sigma), and polyclonal anti-syntaxin and anti-SNAP-25. The immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and visualized by using a Bio-Rad XRS detection system. Catecholamine Release Assays—For amperometry analysis, chromaffin cells were transfected by electroporation with plasmids encoding the cytoplasmic part (C2AB) of synaptotagmin I and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), as described previously (28Archer D.A. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18249-18252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Three days after electroporation, the transfected cells were identified with a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope. A carbon fiber electrode was positioned in contact with a cell, and stimulation was by pressure ejection of buffer B (139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2mm MgCl2, pH 6.5) containing 20 μm digitonin and 10 μm free Ca2+ for a 20-s pulse. Amperometric responses were monitored with a VA-10 amplifier (NPI Electronic), collected at 4 kHz, and digitized with a Digidata 1322A acquisition system. Data were analyzed by using the program Origin (Microcal) (28Archer D.A. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18249-18252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and are shown as mean ± S.E. In each series of experiments, EGFP-negative control cells, in the same dishes, were recorded, using the same carbon-fibers. The permeabilization of chromaffin cells and fluorescent assay for catecholamine release were done as described previously (29Burgoyne R.D. Boulton A. Baker G. Taylor C. Intracellular Messengers (Neuromethods, Vol. 20). Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ1992: 433-470Google Scholar). Briefly, chromaffin cells were incubated with 20 μm digitonin in buffer B for 5 min with or without IP6. The supernatant was discarded, and release was triggered for 5 min in buffer B containing 20 μm free Ca2+ in the absence or presence of IP6. Aliquots of the supernatant were assayed fluorometrically for catecholamine content (30Meunier F.A. Feng Z.P. Molgo J. Zamponi G.W. Schiavo G. EMBO. 2002; 21: 6733-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Released catecholamine was expressed as a normalized percentage to the release obtained in the absence of IP6. Confocal Microscopy—Chromaffin cells seeded on polylysine-coated bottom glass coverslip dishes (Mattek) were permeabilized with 20 μm digitonin in buffer B for 5 min with GST-C2B of synaptotagmin I (130 nm) or GST (150 nm) in the absence or presence of 200 μm IP6. After a 15-min incubation, cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and then blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100. Incubation with anti-SNAP-25 monoclonal antibody was followed by a phosphate-buffered saline wash. SNAP-25 and bound exogenous GST were visualized using Alexa594 anti-mouse and Alexa488 anti-GST, respectively. Images were collected on a Bio-Rad 600 confocal microscope using an oil-immersion objective (63×/1.4 numerical aperture). Fluorescence intensity was quantified by using the LaserPix software (Bio-Rad). The absence of structural information for the synaptotagmin/SNARE complex currently hinders analysis of this potentially important interaction. We analyzed the molecular basis of this link by using functional assays that rely on the stoichiometric, high-affinity binding of synaptotagmin to the target SNARE dimer (Fig. 1A; Ref. 18Rickman C. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Binding of the cytoplasmic part of synaptotagmin, C2AB, to the target SNAREs was sensitive to ionic strength, indicating that it is of an electrostatic nature (Fig. 1A). Both syntaxin and SNAP-25 contribute acidic residues to a negatively charged surface on the ternary SNARE complex (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar), suggesting that basic residues on synaptotagmin may be responsible for interaction with the t-SNARE dimer. Analysis of the surface charge of the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin I (22Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1994; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 23Fernandez I. Arac D. Ubach J. Gerber S.H. Shin O. Gao Y. Anderson R.G. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1057-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) revealed a prominent patch of basic residues present on the C2B domain (Fig. 1B). This positively charged patch is due to a high concentration of lysines in the fourth strand of the C2B β-sandwich structure (23Fernandez I. Arac D. Ubach J. Gerber S.H. Shin O. Gao Y. Anderson R.G. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1057-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Comparison of synaptotagmin I sequences from worms, insects, a primitive chordate Ciona, and humans, assembled from genomic databases, revealed that the polybasic amino acid stretch is virtually identical in all animal species, despite the fact that conservation of the whole synaptotagmin sequence is in the range of only 50–65% (Fig. 1C and data not shown). This observation strongly suggests an essential role for the C2B polybasic motif. We investigated whether the C2B domain is indeed sufficient for binding the t-SNARE dimer. Recent reports demonstrated that the functional properties of the bacterially expressed C2B domain are altered by bacterial contaminants such as nucleic acids (23Fernandez I. Arac D. Ubach J. Gerber S.H. Shin O. Gao Y. Anderson R.G. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1057-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 31Ubach J. Lao Y. Fernandez I. Arac D. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5854-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The C2B domain, isolated by a single affinity chromatography step from bacterial extracts, does not bind the t-SNARE dimer (18Rickman C. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the recombinant C2A and C2B domains, although pure by SDS-PAGE, were thoroughly washed in 1 m NaCl to remove any contaminants. After washing, C2B but not C2A bound to the t-SNARE dimer in a calcium-independent manner (Fig. 1D). Importantly, neither C2 domain was able to interact with monomeric syntaxin or SNAP-25. Therefore, the C2B domain binds the t-SNAREs through the same mechanism as for native synaptotagmin I (18Rickman C. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The C2B polybasic motif has been shown to bind inositol polyphosphates, including inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) (24Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Ninobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because IP6 can potently inhibit synaptic vesicle exocytosis (32Llinas R. Sugimori M. Lang E.J. Morita M. Fukuda M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12990-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether IP6 may have an effect on the synaptotagmin/SNARE interaction. IP6 strongly suppressed synaptotagmin binding to the t-SNARE dimer with an IC50 of 6 μm (Fig. 2A), indicating that the conserved polybasic motif is responsible for SNARE binding. It is noteworthy that the binding of both target SNAREs decreased in parallel, confirming that they exist in a binary complex and that it is this entity which is capable of interacting with the C2B domain. To correlate the in vitro and in vivo IP6 effects, we investigated the action of IP6 on calcium-triggered exocytosis from digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells. The catecholamine release exhibited high sensitivity to acute application of IP6 with an IC50 of 16 μm, a value close to the IC50 for inhibition of the synaptotagmin/SNARE interaction (Fig. 2B). It has been shown previously that the cytoplasmic part of synaptotagmin I can bind to the plasma membrane in resting cells (33Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Liu V. Sugimori M. Mikoshiba K. Llinas R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14715-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The single C2B domain alone exhibited strong localization to the chromaffin cell plasma membrane carrying the t-SNAREs, and this localization was abolished in the presence of IP6 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the C2B domain may interact with t-SNARE dimers on the plasma membrane. Synaptotagmin II is distributed in neuronal tissues in a complementary manner to synaptotagmin I, mainly in cerebellum and in neuromuscular junctions, and is likely to act through a similar mechanism in promoting vesicle exocytosis (21Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 27Angaut-Petit D. Juzans P. Molgo J. Faille L. Seagar M.J. Takahashi M. Shoji-Kasai Y.

To test whether synaptotagmin II can interact with SNAREs in vivo, we examined SNARE-interacting proteins in rat whole-brain extract using an anti-SNAP-25 antibody covalently linked to Sepharose beads. After incubation of these beads with the brain extract in the absence of calcium, the bound proteins were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Staining for both syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 confirmed that these two proteins interact in brain. Monoclonal antibodies specific for synaptotagmin I (clone 41.1) and synaptotagmin II (27Angaut-Petit D. Juzans P. Molgo J. Faille L. Seagar M.J. Takahashi M. Shoji-Kasai Y. Brain Res. 1995; 681: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Juzans P. Molgo J. Faille L. Angaut-Petit D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: R283-R284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified 65-kDa bands co-purifying with the SNAREs on anti-SNAP-25 beads but not on control beads lacking this antibody (Fig. 3A). Staining for a control protein, calcineurin, confirmed that co-isolation of the two synaptotagmin isoforms with the SNAREs is of a specific nature. Washing of the brain-purified synaptotagmin/SNARE assembly, using a salt solution, resulted in removal of both synaptotagmin I and II (Fig. 3A), demonstrating the electrostatic nature of the synaptotagmin/SNARE interactions for both isoforms. Together, these results support the view that syntaxin and SNAP-25 interact in vivo and, when assembled (11Rickman C. Meunier F.A. Binz T. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 644-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), these SNAREs can engage synaptotagmins I and II through an electrostatic mechanism. To confirm that the calcium-independent interaction of the SNAREs with synaptotagmins does not require synaptobrevin (18Rickman C. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we analyzed the two major synaptotagmin isoforms in a reconstituted assay. The cytoplasmic part of synaptotagmin II was indeed able to bind the t-SNARE dimer as efficiently as synaptotagmin I, with an apparent equimolar stoichiometry (Fig. 3B; Ref. 18Rickman C. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5501-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The polybasic motif is fully conserved between mammalian synaptotagmin I and synaptotagmin II (34Geppert M. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13548-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of the basic residues in the evolutionarily conserved motif, we analyzed the t-SNARE binding by synaptotagmin II C2B domains carrying mutations of positively charged arginine and lysines to neutral glutamines (Fig. 4A). The single-point mutations 5 and 6 resulted in the largest decrease in the binding of the t-SNAREs (Fig. 4B). The double mutation 5,6 had a more dramatic effect, and the triple mutation 5,6,7 completely eliminated binding of the t-SNARE dimer (Fig. 4B). Notably, these mutations have a parallel effect on the binding of both syntaxin and SNAP-25 (Fig. 4C), again illustrating that synaptotagmins recognize the syntaxin/SNAP-25 dimer as a single molecular entity. We conclude that the t-SNARE dimer interaction with synaptotagmins involves the polybasic patch on the C2B domain. A recent D. melanogaster genetic study demonstrated that substitution of two lysine residues in the evolutionarily conserved motif of synaptotagmin I, corresponding to mutations 5 and 6 (Fig. 4A), results in a marked decrease of excitation/secretion coupling in neurotransmission (37Mackler J.M. Reist N.E. J. Comput. Neurol. 2001; 436: 4-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We decided to test the importance of the polybasic motif of synaptotagmin I in a model for mammalian exocytosis, namely in chromaffin cells from bovine adrenal medullae (38Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We chose to study primary chromaffin cells rather than pheochromocytoma cell lines because PC12 cells exhibit normal exocytosis in the absence of synaptotagmin I, most likely because of the presence of other isoforms such as synaptotagmin IX (39Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 40Shoji-Kasai Y. Yoshida A. Sato K. Hoshino T. Ogura A. Kondo S. Fujimoto Y. Kuwahara R. Kato R. Takahashi M. Science. 1992; 256: 1821-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, synaptotagmin I-deficient chromaffin cells exhibit reduced exocytosis, indicating a role for synaptotagmin I in calcium-triggered hormone release (41Voets T. Moser T. Lund P.E. Chow R.H. Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11680-11685Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of expression of the soluble synaptotagmin I cytoplasmic part in chromaffin cells. If, indeed, synaptotagmin I, which is resident on secretory vesicles, interacts with the syntaxin/SNAP-25 dimer on the plasma membrane to promote vesicle fusion, then expression of synaptotagmin I without its transmembrane part may affect catecholamine release through competitive inhibition. We co-transfected bovine chromaffin cells with the soluble synaptotagmin I C2AB and EGFP to tag the transfected cells. Carbon fiber amperometry was used to measure catecholamine release from single cells. Stimulation by a brief application of 0.003% digitonin in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+ was used to directly activate exocytosis, circumventing a requirement for calcium channels. Expression of synaptotagmin I C2AB led to inhibition of regulated catecholamine release compared with control non-transfected cells (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the amplitudes of single release events were indistinguishable between the two populations, whereas the numbe"

Here we show that HeLa cells express comparable amounts of IP3R1 and IP3R3, but knockdown by RNA interference of each subtype results in dramatically distinct Ca2+ signaling patterns. Knockdown of IP3R1 significantly decreases total Ca2+ signals and terminates Ca2+ oscillations. Conversely, knockdown of IP3R3 leads to more robust and long lasting Ca2+ oscillations than in controls. Effects of IP3R3 knockdown are surprisingly similar in COS-7 cells that predominantly (>90% of total IP3R) express IP3R3, suggesting that IP3R3 functions as an anti-Ca2+-oscillatory unit without contributing to peak amplitude of Ca2+ signals, irrespective of its relative expression level. Therefore, differential expression of the IP3R subtype is critical for various forms of Ca2+ signaling, and, particularly, IP3R1 and IP3R3 have opposite roles in generating Ca2+ oscillations.

Activation of the phospholipase C pathway by hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters results in generation of a second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, small interfering RNA. which diffuses to the cytoplasm and binds to an IP3 receptor (IP3R), a Ca2+ release channel on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar). IP3R plays key roles in generation of spatially and temporally complex signaling patterns of cytosolic [Ca2+]i, such as Ca2+ oscillations. Since not only the amplitude but also the frequency of Ca2+ oscillation is critical for activation of various downstream effectors (2De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 3Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar, 4Li W. Llopis J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), how IP3R contributes to these parameters is a key question in the vast area of cell biology. There is only one gene for IP3R in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas three subtypes (all encoded by different genes) of IP3R (IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3) exist in birds and mammals (7Sorrentino V. Barone V. Rossi D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The three subtypes share high similarity (70-80%) in their primary sequences and are expressed to varying degrees in individual cell types (8Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Each IP3R subtype has been extensively characterized both biochemically and electrophysiologically, and it is now obvious that they share basic properties but differ in many respects such as regulation by small molecules (i.e. Ca2+ and ATP), modulations by binding proteins and kinases, degradation by proteases, and subcellular localization (9MacKrill J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 345-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Thrower E.C. Hagar R.E. Ehrlich B.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 580-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, to what extent these differences among subtypes contribute to the intricate regulation of [Ca2+]i signaling in living cells is not fully understood. Two main obstacles in this respect have been (i) the lack of a method of inactivating specific IP3R subtypes in a given cell type and (ii) the difficulty in quantifying the relative expression levels of IP3R subtypes. The latter point, which has often been overlooked, is quite important, because overexpression studies (11Davis R.J. Challiss J. Nahorski S.R. Biochem.

Determining the relative expression levels of each IP3R subtype has not been straightforward. Wojcikiewicz (17Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) purified each IP3R subtype protein from cell lines that dominantly express a single IP3R subtype and used it as the standard in a series of immunoblotting experiments to quantify the expression level of each subtype. Taylor and colleagues (8Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 18Cardy T.J. Traynor D. Taylor C.W. Biochem.

J. 1999; 344: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) established an antiserum (AbC) that recognizes all the IP3R subtypes approximately equally and used this as well as recombinant IP3R proteins for quantitation. These methods, however, are time-consuming and require many reagents and steps, which inevitably raise the possibility of artifacts and fluctuations between assays (8Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The use of a “pan” antibody could be very informative if it can detect endogenous IP3R with high sensitivity (a criterion that AbC does not seem to satisfy; see “Discussion” for more detail) and is combined with a technique allowing “deletion” of one specific subtype. There are a few precedents for inactivation of specific IP3R subtypes in cultured cell lines. Perhaps most importantly, Sugawara et al. established cell lines (derived from the DT40 chick pre-B cell line) that lack various combinations of IP3R subtypes (20Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Subsequently, using these cell lines, Miyakawa et al. reported that IP3R1 mediates rather irregular Ca2+ oscillations, that IP3R2 is required for long lasting and regular Ca2+ oscillations, and that IP3R3 tends to generate monophasic Ca2+ transients, all of which are presumably attributable to their differential sensitivity to Ca2+ and ATP (21Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although these works are elegant and of great significance, because the relative expression level of each IP3R subtype in DT40 cells is not known (21Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), it is still possible that the various changes in [Ca2+]i signaling patterns were due to changes in IP3R density and not to the absence or presence of a specific IP3R subtype. Other groups (e.g. see Refs. 22Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 23Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M.

Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have employed a vector-based antisense strategy to down-regulate specific IP3R subtypes in clonal cell lines. Although seemingly successful, the use of antisense in mammalian cells is frequently accompanied by nonspecific down-regulation of other proteins (25Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 26Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). Furthermore, selecting and isolating clones is time-consuming and thus leaves much room for adaptation and/or compensation by other gene products, which complicates interpretation of the observations. In this study, we took advantage of RNA interference (RNAi) and a newly established pan-IP3R antibody to quantify the relative expression levels of IP3R subtypes in HeLa and COS-7 cells, which are frequently used for investigation of [Ca2+]i signaling. We found that IP3R1 and IP3R3 have strikingly distinct roles in regulating [Ca2+]i signaling in these cell lines. How the biochemical difference between these subtypes could lead to distinct [Ca2+]i signaling patterns will be discussed. Reagents—Short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and resolved in Universal buffer (20 mm KCl, 6 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm MgCl2) to a final concentration of 20 μm. Opti-MEM, LipofectAMINE 2000, and other cell biological materials were from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). Other chemicals were from Sigma or Wako Chemical (Osaka, Japan). Microsome fractions from Sf9 cells overexpressing murine IP3R 2M. Iwai, T. Nakayama, M. Hattori, A. Mizutani, T. Inoue, T.

The expression vector for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged murine IP3R1 was described previously (27Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K. Nakamura T. Tateishi Y. Bannai H. Iwai M. Michcikawa T.

Iwai and T. Michikawa. Antibody Production and Purification—A peptide, Pan-C (Fig. 1A), was coupled to maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and 400 μg of antigen mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant was initially injected subcutaneously into female Japanese White rabbits, followed by a repeat injection with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Crude antisera were then affinity-purified on Pan-C peptide-coupled SulfoLink resin (Pierce). Typically, the resins were incubated with antisera (diluted with an equal amount of PBS) for 1 h and laid on a column. After extensive washing with PBS, the antibody bound was eluted with 100 mm glycine and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris (pH 8.0). Cell Culture—HeLa and COS-7 cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 1.0 g/liter glucose, and 2 mml-glutamine. Transfection of siRNA—The cells in a 35-mm dish were supplied with 2 ml of the fresh culture medium 30 min prior to transfection. 5 μl of siRNA solution (20 μm) and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 were each mixed with 250 μl of Opti-MEM. The two mixtures were combined and incubated for 20 min at room temperature for complex formation. The entire mixture was added to the cells, resulting in a final concentration of 40 nm for the siRNAs. The cells were incubated for 5-8 h in a CO2 chamber, washed once, and supplied with 2 ml of the fresh culture medium. Immunoblotting—Cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with PBS and then solubilized with 300-500 μl (depending on cell types and their density at the time of harvest) of radioimmune precipitation buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate), rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, and spun down at 15,000 rpm for 10 min with a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was mixed with a one-third volume of the 4× sampling buffer (250 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 20% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% bromphenol blue) and incubated at 60 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated on 4.5% (for detection of IP3R and calnexin) or 10% (for detection of actin, tubulin, and calreticulin) SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST (PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20) before incubation with the primary antibodies.

Incubation with the primary antibody was carried out for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBST, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences; 1:4000) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was developed using chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, ECL Plus, or ECL Advanced kit, from Amersham Biosciences). Ca2+ Imaging—Two days following transfection, cells were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl-ester (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). The fura-2-loaded cells were placed on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX-70; Olympus, Japan) and perfused with balanced salt solution (115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and either 2 mm CaCl2 or nominally Ca2+ free), at a rate of 2.0 ml/min. Image capture and processing were performed with an Argus 50/CA system (Hamamatsu Photonics) at room temperature. With alternate illumination at 340- and 380-nm excitation, pairs of fluorescence images (F340 and F380, respectively) were obtained every 3 s through an objective lens (UApo 20×/340; Olympus) and an emission filter (510-550 nm), captured with a silicon-intensified target video camera (C2400-8; Hamamatsu Photonics) and digitized with an image processor. Production and Characterization of Pan-IP3R Antibody—To quantify the relative expression levels of each IP3R subtype, we raised a polyclonal antiserum to a synthesized 21-mer peptide (Pan-C) (Fig. 1A). The sequence of Pan-C is located just downstream of the last transmembrane region and is completely conserved among all human, rat, and mouse origin subtypes of IP3R (Fig. 1A). Since this region is encoded in a single exon 3M. Hattori, A. Z. Suzuki, T. Higo, H. Miyauchi, T. Michikawa, T. Nakamura, T. Inoue, and K. Mikoshiba, unpublished observation. and is critical for gating of IP3R (30Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), all functional IP3R subtypes are expected to contain this sequence. To confirm that our pan-IP3R antibody recognized all the IP3R subtypes equally, the microsome fraction from Sf9 cells overexpressing each IP3R subtype was separated with SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining (Fig. 1B, left panel) or immunoblotting using the pan-IP3R antibody (Fig. 1B, right panel). The results confirmed the pan-IP3R antibody to recognize all IP3R subtypes to approximately the same extent. We also confirmed the specificity of this antibody by expressing IP3R proteins tagged with GFP in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1C). Densitometric analysis (data not shown) indicated the intensity of each GFP-IP3R band detected by anti-GFP and pan-IP3R antibodies to be within 6% of the values of the others. Therefore, we concluded that our pan-IP3R antibody recognizes each IP3R subtype equally well. Specific Knockdown of IP3R1 and IP3R3 by RNA Interference—The sequences of siRNA used in this study, selected according to the criteria suggested previously (31Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), are shown in Table I. We titrated the siRNA concentration in the medium during transfection and found that the effects were maximal at 20-40 nm for HeLa and COS-7 cells (data not shown). We also found that removing the siRNA-LipofectAMINE complex and supplying fresh medium 5-8 h after the addition of the complex was important; otherwise, the number of unresponsive cells increased significantly, and the peak amplitude of [Ca2+]i became smaller (data not shown).Table ISequence of siRNAsTarget geneNameSequencePositionDifferenceNoteIP3R1IP3R2IP3R3IP3R11-1GAAAUUCAGAGACUGCCUC1530231-2UGAGACAGAAAACAGGAAA3090651-3CUUGAACCAGAUUAUAGAUUTR0——b1-2CUGAGAAAGAACACAGGAAA287IP3R22-1UGUCCAGCUUCCUCUACAU144032-2CUACAGCACGCUGCAGAAC274407a,b2-3AUUGUAAAAUACAGUAAUG340—0—a2-4GAAUGCCAUGCGUGUGUCC432504b2-5ACAACCAAGUGCCAAGAUGUTR—0—a,bIP3R33-1UGUCCAGCUUUCUUCACAU114303-2GAAGUUCCGUGACUGCCUC150330a3-3CUGCAACACCAGCUGGAAG642320b3-4CUCAGUUUACCUUAAUGCCUTR——0a,b3-2CGAACUUCCGCGAAUGCCUC443 Open table in a new tab We first found that all of the siRNAs for IP3R1 and IP3R3, but none for IP3R2, effectively (>95%) decreased the amounts of respective proteins, as judged from immunoblotting experiments, at 48 h after transfection in both HeLa and COS-7 cells (data not shown). The reason IP3R2 was not effectively knocked down is as yet unknown, and in the present study, we focus on the results of IP3R1 and IP3R3 knockdown. Since RNAi works via destruction of mRNA and is saturable (31Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), its effect is highly dependent on the rate of transcription and protein stability (or half-life). Therefore, we investigated the time course of effects of each siRNA in HeLa cells. For both IP3R1 and IP3R3, the effect was observable around 12 h after transfection, peaked by 48 h after transfection, and persisted for up to 60 h after transfection (Fig. 2). We have not systematically investigated the time course in COS-7 cells, but we consistently observed down-regulation of IP3R1 and IP3R3 to exceed 95% between 40 and 60 h (data not shown). The effect of siRNAs used in this study was quite specific to the respective proteins, since the amounts of other IP3R subtypes, calnexin (Fig. 3), calreticulin, β-actin, or tubulin (data not shown) were unaffected. In addition, mixing siRNAs for IP3R1 and IP3R3 (i.e. co-transfection) did not give a satisfactory result; the efficacy of knockdown was no more than ∼60% each in HeLa cells (data not shown).Fig. 3Quantitation of relative expression level of IP3R subtypes in HeLa and COS-7 cells. HeLa cells (A) or COS-7 cells (B) were transfected with the siRNAs indicated, and cell lysates were prepared 48 h later. Immunoblotting (IB) with the indicated antibodies were performed. The arrows and arrowheads indicate the positions of IP3R1 and IP3R2/IP3R3, respectively. In A, cell lysates from HeLa cells without treatment (No transfection) were also applied to show that siRNA transfection in general had no effect on the composition of IP3R subtypes. In B, the HeLa cell lysate was also applied (right-most lane) for comparison. siRNA efficiently knocked down respective IP3R subtype without affecting expressions of other subtypes or calnexin, another membrane protein of the ER.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Relative Expression Levels of IP3R Subtypes in HeLa and COS-7 Cells—By using a combination of pan-IP3R antibody, type-specific antibodies, and RNAi, we are now able to determine the relative expression levels of IP3R subtypes. When whole cell lysates from control HeLa cells were immunoblotted with the pan-IP3R antibody, two bands with approximately the same intensity were obtained (Fig. 3A, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). The upper band corresponds to IP3R1, since this subtype has a slightly higher molecular weight than the other subtypes (as illustrated in Fig. 1, B and C). This was also confirmed by knocking down IP3R1 (Fig. 3A, top and second panels, lane 3). The lower band consists of IP3R2 and IP3R3, which have almost identical apparent molecular weights. When IP3R3 was knocked down in HeLa cells, this lower band almost disappeared (Fig. 3A, top and fourth panels, lane 4), indicating that IP3R3 constitutes most of the lower band. It also means that the amount of IP3R2 in HeLa cells is very low compared with other subtypes, although it was detectable with the IP3R2-specific antibody (Fig. 3A, third panel). By densitometric analysis, it was estimated that the expression level ratio (IP3R1/IP3R2/IP3R3) in HeLa cells is ∼53:1:46, which is consistent with a previous report (32Tovey S.C. de Smet P. Lipp P. Thomas D. Young K.W. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Berridge M.J. Thuring J. Holmes A. Bootman M.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3979-3989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that HeLa cells mainly express IP3R1 and IP3R3. Likewise, the relative expression levels of IP3R subtypes in COS-7 cells were quantified. In contrast to the case of HeLa cells, the pan-IP3R antibody detected a single band from the COS-7 cell lysate (Fig. 3B, top panel, lane 1). Its molecular weight is the same as that of IP3R2 and IP3R3 (Fig. 3B, top panel; compare with the HeLa sample), suggesting that COS-7 cells do not express IP3R1 that can be detected with pan-IP3R antibody. In fact, knockdown of IP3R1 did not change the intensity of this band (Fig. 3B, top panel, lane 2). Immunoblotting with the IP3R1-specific antibody, by prolonged exposure, revealed that COS-7 cells express very low amounts of IP3R1 (Fig. 3B, second panel). Knockdown of IP3R3 (Fig. 3B, lane 3) significantly decreased the lower band detected by the pan-IP3R antibody (Fig. 3, top panel, lane 3). The faint band that remained when IP3R3 was knocked down (Fig. 3, top panel, lane 3) was IP3R2. From densitometric analysis of these results, the relative expression level ratio for IP3R1/IP3R2/IP3R3 in COS-7 cells was estimated to be ∼0:7:93. The ratio between IP3R2 and IP3R3 is substantially different from a previous estimation in COS-1 cells (1:37:62) (17Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), which derived from the same parent cell line as COS-7 cells. Effects of Specific Knockdowns of IP3R1 and IP3R3 on Ca2+ Responses in HeLa Cells—To investigate specific roles of IP3R1 and IP3R3 in HeLa cells, we first titrated the agonist (ATP) concentration in single cell Ca2+ imaging experiments in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. In control cells, 1 μm ATP typically caused a transient elevation in [Ca2+]i with a rather slow decay, and 3 and 10 μm of ATP evoked a transient [Ca2+]i rise, which was often followed by Ca2+ oscillations without returning to the base-line level (Fig. 4A). In contrast, in HeLa cells in which IP3R1 had been knocked down (IP3R1-KD cells), 1 μm ATP rarely caused a rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4B). ATP at 3 and 10 μm evoked much smaller rises in [Ca2+]i than those in control cells (Fig. 4B). The averaged peak amplitude was always smaller in IP3R1-KD cells than in control cells, and this effect was more prominent at lower agonist concentrations (Fig. 4G). In addition, Ca2+ oscillations were less frequently observed than in the control cells when stimulated at 3 and 10 μm ATP. On the other hand, HeLa cells in which IP3R3 had been knocked down (IP3R3-KD cells) exhibited quite different [Ca2+]i signaling patterns. As shown in Fig. 4C, 1 μm ATP caused a transient [Ca2+]i rise in IP3R3-KD cells whose peak amplitude was comparable with that of the control cells. At higher ATP concentrations, IP3R3-KD cells often exhibited robust and sharp Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 4C), a response never observed in control or IP3R1-KD cells. The average of the traces (Fig. 4, D and F) indicated that the total amount of Ca2+ released was not greatly altered in IP3R3-KD cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 4G). To more specifically examine [Ca2+]i signaling derived from Ca2+ release and exclude any hangover effect caused by repetitive stimulation, we next performed the imaging experiments in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, with a single ATP (3 μm) stimulation. As shown in Fig. 5, the overall tendency was quite similar to the results shown in Fig. 4, but the differences caused by knockdown of IP3R became more apparent. We classified the [Ca2+]i signaling patterns into the following four categories: (i) no response, (ii) single peak (with or without plateau phase), (iii) oscillation with five peaks or less, and (iv) oscillations with more than five peaks. Among IP3R1-KD cells, the number of nonresponsive cells greatly (by 6-fold) increased (Fig. 5D, open bar), whereas Ca2+ oscillations were much less frequent (by 8-fold; Fig. 5D, gray and black bars). On the other hand, IP3R3-KD cells exhibited much more robust, regular, and long lasting Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 5C). In control cells, Ca2+ oscillations were often damped after a few oscillations; percentages of cells that exhibited Ca2+ oscillations with the number of discernible peaks being five or less and more than five are 23 and 33%, respectively (Fig. 5D, gray and black bars, respectively), whereas almost all of the IP3R3-KD cells that exhibited Ca2+ oscillations had more than five peaks (Fig. 5D, compare black bar with gray bar in the IP3R3-KD section). In other words, Ca2+ oscillations seldom stop once they have started in IP3R3-KD cells. Since the amounts of IP3R1 and IP3R3 are roughly the same in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A), these results indicate that the two subtypes have clearly distinct, actually opposite, roles in shaping Ca2+ signaling patterns; i.e. IP3R1 mainly functions in setting the threshold for an agonist concentration, establishing the overall response level, and generating Ca2+ oscillations, whereas IP3R3 shapes rather blunt and slow decay Ca2+ signaling, thus counteracting Ca2+ oscillations. Exactly the same tendency was observed when histamine (3 μm) was used as an agonist (data not shown), indicating that the effects seen in the above experiments are not agonist type-specific. Effect of Specific Knockdown of IP3R3 on Ca2+ Responses in COS-7 Cells—IP3R3 constitutes more than 90% of total IP3R in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, we anticipated that knockdown of IP3R3 in COS-7 cells might lead to a marked reduction in the agonist-evoked peak amplitude in [Ca2+]i. Alternatively, inferring from the observations obtained in HeLa cells (Figs. 4 and 5), more robust and long-lasting Ca2+ oscillations were also possible. The results shown in Fig. 6 clear"
https://openalex.org/W1997207809,"GABAB receptors are heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptors that mediate slow synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system. The dynamic control of the cell surface stability of GABAB receptors is likely to be of fundamental importance in the modulation of receptor signaling. Presently, however, this process is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that GABAB receptors are remarkably stable at the plasma membrane showing little basal endocytosis in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons. In addition, we show that exposure to baclofen, a well characterized GABAB receptor agonist, fails to enhance GABAB receptor endocytosis. Lack of receptor internalization in neurons correlates with an absence of agonist-induced phosphorylation and lack of arrestin recruitment in heterologous systems. We also demonstrate that chronic exposure to baclofen selectively promotes endocytosis-independent GABAB receptor degradation. The effect of baclofen can be attenuated by activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase or co-stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, we show that increased degradation rates are correlated with reduced receptor phosphorylation at serine 892 in GABABR2. Our results support a model in which GABABR2 phosphorylation specifically stabilizes surface GABAB receptors in neurons. We propose that signaling pathways that regulate cAMP levels in neurons may have profound effects on the tonic synaptic inhibition by modulating the availability of GABAB receptors.

Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). Termination of GPCR signaling is a key process that defines the overall properties of the response to a particular stimulus and extensive observations have allowed the proposal of a conserved series of events, divided into three distinct stages, that take place during receptor inactivation (2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). In the first stage, agonist occupancy triggers GPCR phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) causing desensitization over a time scale of seconds (3Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). In the second, phosphorylation results in the binding to proteins of the arrestin family, which mediate recruitment of GPCRs to clathrin-coated vesicles, subsequent internalization, and sorting to endosomes or lysosomes after seconds or minutes of stimulation (4Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, prolonged agonist exposure causes down-regulation, a phenomenon defined as the reduction in the total number of receptors and usually correlated with reduced receptor mRNA (5Tsao P. von Zastrow M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). GABAB receptors belong to family C and unlike other GPCRs they require the formation of a heterodimer composed of two subunits, namely GABABR1 and GABABR2 (6Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 274-286Crossref Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Both subunits display high homology to metabotropic glutamate, Ca2+-sensing, vomeronasal, and putative pheromone receptors (7Couve A. Moss S.J. Pangalos M.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 296-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recombinant heterodimeric GABABR1/GABABR2 receptors reproduce most of the characteristics and pharmacology of native receptors (7Couve A. Moss S.J. Pangalos M.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 296-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), i.e. they inhibit adenylyl cyclase, activate inwardly rectifying K+ channels, and inactivate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (8Mott D.D.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3498-3505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that phosphorylation of the GABABR2 subunit by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) promotes potentiation but not desensitization of GABAB receptors in dissociated cultured neurons (18Couve A. Thomas P. Calver A.R. Hirst W.D. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results conflict with the classical model of GPCR inactivation. To further understand the regulation of GABAB receptors we have investigated their modulation by phosphorylation and cell surface stability. Our results demonstrate that GABAB receptors do not undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation or internalization and are very stable at the neuronal plasma membrane. In addition, they show that over long time scales GABAB receptors are subject to degradation at or near the cell surface in a PKA-dependent manner. Together our observations suggest that unique mechanisms have evolved to regulate the activity of GABAB receptors reflecting their critical role in the tonic control of neuronal activity.

Metabolic [35S]Methionine, [32P]Orthophosphate Labeling, and Immunoprecipitations—For metabolic labeling, COS-7 cells were washed twice with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine or in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h at 37 °C. After the incubation periods, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 0.6 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml antipain). Nuclei were removed from cell lysates by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Cell lysates were preabsorbed with 25 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose, previously equilibrated in RIPA buffer, for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads were then removed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and lysates were rotated with 5 μg of antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then precipitated with 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed twice in RIPA buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and once in RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Quantification of radioactive bands was performed using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Kinase Assays—10 μg of GST fusion proteins or rod outer segments were mixed with purified GRK2 or purified PKA in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol; for GRK reactions the buffer was supplemented with Gβγ and PIP2) in a final volume of 25 μl. Agarose beads were pre-warmed in kinase buffer for 1 min at 37 °C, ATP was then added to the reaction to a final concentration of 0.2 mm containing 1/10 volume of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 10 mCi/ml) and the reactions were continued for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 12.5 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Quantification of radioactive bands was performed using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Cortical and Hippocampal Neuron Primary Cultures—Cortical and hippocampal neurons were obtained from embryonic day 18 rats as described previously (24Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Corticals neurons were used between 5 and 7 days in vitro and hippocampal neurons were maintained for 21 days in vitro before use. Biotinylation—5 days in vitro rat cortical neurones grown on poly-llysine-coated dishes were incubated for 1 h in culture media containing 100 μg/ml leupeptin. Dishes were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ (PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2). The biotin reagent was freshly dissolved at 1 mg/ml in ice-cold PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ and cultures were incubated with biotin for 12 min on ice. The biotin solution was aspirated and the dishes were blocked by washing 3× 5 min in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 2× 5 min in ice-cold PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+. Neurons were returned to the 37 °C incubator for the appropriate periods of time (10 min to 60 h) in the presence of 100 μg/ml leupeptin. Dishes were placed on ice, the media was removed, and 2–5 ml of ice-cold cleaving buffer was added (50 mm glutathione in 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.075 n NaOH). Dishes were incubated 2× 15 min at 4 °C with constant shaking. Finally neurons were washed twice in ice-cold PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+, lysed in 300 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer, and solubilized by rotating 1 h at 4 °C. Nuclear and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were precipitated with 100 μl of UltraLink NeutrAvidin slurry for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice in RIPA buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and once in RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Beads were resuspended in 60 μl of SDS sample buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-C membranes. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblots of brain membranes, transfected cells, cultured neurons, and biotinylation procedures were performed as described previously by incubating with the corresponding primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibodies conjugated to [125I] for 1 h at room temperature as described previously (18Couve A. Thomas P. Calver A.R. Hirst W.D. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were visualized via phosphorimager (Bio-Rad) and the radioactive bands were quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Imaging—Transfected cells were plated onto 6-cm dishes containing 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated 13-mm coverslips. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and blocked for 10 min in immunofluorescence solution (0.25% bovine serum albumin, 10% horse serum in PBS). Cells were permeabilized in immunofluorescence solution containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at room temperature and blocked for another 10 min in immunofluorescence solution containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution. Coverslips were examined using a confocal microscope (MRC1000, Bio-Rad). GABAB Receptors Do Not Undergo Agonist-induced Phosphorylation—Classically, monomeric GPCRs undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation by GRKs as a first step during their desensitization. The role of this process for the heterodimeric GABAB receptor remains poorly understood. To investigate the effect of agonist on GABAB receptor phosphorylation, incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into GABABR1 and GABABR2 was followed in COS-7 cells. Myc-tagged GABABR1 and FLAG-tagged GABABR2 cDNAs were transiently transfected and immunoprecipitated from cell lysates after metabolic labeling. In agreement with recent observations, a single band of ∼120 kDa, corresponding to basally phosphorylated GABABR1 (Fig. 1b, lanes 1 and 3), and a single band of ∼110 kDa, corresponding to basally phosphorylated GABABR2 (Fig. 1b, lanes 2 and 3) were obtained in immunoprecipitations from lysates derived from GABABR1-, GABABR2 or GABABR1-, GABABR2-transfected cells, respectively. Control immunoprecipitations from [35S]methionine metabolic labeled receptors indicated that the visualized bands corresponded indeed to GABABR1 and GABABR2 (Fig. 1a, lanes 1–4). Unexpectedly, neither GABABR1 nor GABABR2 phosphorylation levels were increased in response to the GABAB-specific agonist baclofen at all times up to 30 min of receptor stimulation (Fig. 1c, lanes 1–5). In contrast, phosphorylation of GABABR2 was significantly increased after treatment with forskolin, a known activator of PKA (Fig. 1c, lane 6). To explore the effects of various members of the GRK family in agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation, the phosphorylation levels of GABAB receptors were examined in cells cotransfected with GABABR1, GABABR2, GRK2, or GRK3. Interestingly, the levels of phosphorylation of GABAB receptors remained unchanged after baclofen treatment even in the presence of the additional kinases (Fig. 1d, lanes 1–4). The same results were obtained when cells were co-transfected with GRK5 and GRK6 (data not shown). The intracellular loops of class C GPCRs are generally small, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domains are relatively large and the most likely targets for kinase-dependent modulation. To further examine the roles of GRKs as regulators of GABAB receptor phosphorylation in vitro, phosphorylation assays were performed using purified GRK2 and the carboxyl-terminal domains of GABABR1 (CR1) and GABABR2 (CR2) expressed as GST fusion proteins. In agreement with our metabolic labeling experiments, GRK2 did not phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domains of either receptor subunit (Fig. 1e, lanes 1–4). This was in marked contrast with the in vitro phosphorylation of CR2 by PKA (Fig. 1e, lane 5; the major band of 45 kDa) (18Couve A. Thomas P. Calver A.R. Hirst W.D. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), or the phosphorylation of rod outer segment by GRK2 (Fig. 1e, lane 6). These observations indicate that GABAB receptors are not phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner and rule out the participation of agonist-induced phosphorylation as a key element in the inactivation of the GABAB receptor signal. GABAB Receptors Do Not Undergo Rapid Agonist-induced Internalization—GPCRs that undergo endocytosis in response to agonist occupancy do so by recruiting proteins of the arrestin family in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the agonist-induced internalization of GABAB receptors, an endocytosis and arrestin recruitment assay was performed. Arrestins 2 and 3 (β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2) have been shown to mediate GPCR internalization. Therefore, GABAB receptor internalization was evaluated in the presence of arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 via a microscopic analysis. COS-7 cells were transfected with GABABR1/GABABR2 or with the control thyrotropic-related hormone receptor in the presence of arrestin 2-EGFP or arrestin 3-EGFP. After transfections both the GABAB receptor heterodimer and the thyrotropic-related hormone receptor were present at the cell surface of COS cells (Fig. 2, b and f). In addition, there was an abundant expression of arrestin 3-EGFP, which did not significantly co-localize with the surface receptor population (Fig. 2 a, d and e, h). Activation of thyrotropic-related hormone receptor resulted in a rapid removal of receptors from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, n, o and v, w). Moreover, agonist stimulation produced a robust recruitment of receptors to an intracellular sorting compartment that co-localized extensively with arrestin 3-EGFP (Fig. 2, m, o, p and u, w, x). In contrast, exposure of GABAB expressing cells to baclofen did not result in receptor internalization (Fig. 2, j, k and r, s) or arrestin recruitment (Fig. 2, i, k, l and q, s, t). Identical results were obtained when the experiment was performed in the presence of arrestin 2-EGFP (data not shown). These results indicate that arrestins do not facilitate GABAB receptor internalization and strongly suggest that GABAB receptors are stable at the plasma membrane. Agonist Exposure Does Not Promote Receptor Endocytosis in Cortical Neurons—To investigate the relevance of these recombinant studies in a neuronal context, we examined the fate of cell surface GABAB receptors after periods of agonist exposure in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. Cell surface receptors were labeled using a cell-impermeable active biotin reagent that binds covalently to surface proteins (25Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with agonists and the internalized biotinylated fraction of GABAB receptors and control proteins was evaluated by quantitative immunoblotting. As expected, a significant GABABR1a reactivity was observed in the surface-biotinylated pool, demonstrating the presence of GABABR1 at the cell surface in cultured cortical neurons (Fig. 3a, lane 1). In addition, a very small fraction was detected in intracellular compartments after the surface proteins were allowed to undergo internalization (Fig. 3a, lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, the small internalized pool of GABABR1a did not increase after 10 or 60 min of agonist stimulation (60 min: control, 2.63 ± 0.97%; baclofen, 3.50 ± 0.99%, n = 3). A time course analysis indicated that no difference existed between the internalized pools of GABABR1a in the absence and presence of baclofen at all times ranging from 5 min to 6 h (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when the GABABR2 subunit was analyzed and no enhancement of internalized subunits was observed after agonist treatment (Fig. 3b). The biotin reagent did not interfere with GABAB receptor agonist potency suggesting that the lack of GABAB receptor internalization did not result from an interfering effect of the labeling procedure (Table I). In contrast, 43% of the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor internalized efficiently after 60 min of AMPA treatment (Fig. 3c, lanes 1–4) indicating that the membrane dynamics remain intact during our experimental procedure.Table IHEK293 cells were transfected with GABABR1 and GABABR2 Cells were left untreated or labelled with biotin prior to stimulation with GABAB agonists (GABA or baclofen). The activity of the GABAB receptor was determined using a Ca2+ mobilization assay and a fluorimetric imaging plate reader. The data represents the average and S.E. of three independent experiments.AgonistBiotinEC50nμmGABA–6.95 ± 0.263GABA+6.87 ± 0.193Baclofen–6.06 ± 0.373Baclofen+6.14 ± 0.123 Open table in a new tab To confirm these results an imaging analysis was performed in dissociated cultures of primary hippocampal neurons. Neurons were treated with baclofen or AMPA for 15 min and subsequently fixed to evaluate the distribution of GABABR2 and AMPA receptors relative to the EEA1, an established endosomal marker. 15 min after agonist exposure the distribution of AMPA receptors changed dramatically and most of the receptors clustered in intracellular compartments were closely associated with EEA1 (Fig. 3d, bottom panels). In contrast, exposure to baclofen for 15 min had no effect on GABAB receptor distribution and the receptors and EEA1 remained in different subcellular compartments. This situation was indistinguishable from the control condition (Fig. 3d, top panels). Similar results were obtained for 30 and 60 min of agonist treatment (data not shown). Taken together these results conclusively demonstrate that GABAB receptors fail to internalize in response to short term agonist exposure in dissociated cortical and hippocampal neurons and suggest that non-classical mechanisms of inactivation must take place after receptor stimulation. Chronic Agonist Exposure Results in a Specific Loss of Cell Surface GABAB Receptors—The lack of receptor internalization and lack of endosomal accumulation suggest that a novel mechanism may exist to regulate surface receptor numbers. To further analyze this, the fate of cell surface GABAB receptors was examined after chronic baclofen treatment using the biotinylation assay. In untreated neurons the levels of the biotinylated fraction of surface GABABR1a receptors decreased progressively over time (Fig. 4a, lanes 1, 2, 4, 6, and the duplicate lanes 8 and 9). Interestingly, treatment of the neurons with baclofen accelerated the decrease in the biotinylated population of surface GABAB receptors (Fig. 4a, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and the duplicate lanes 10 and 11). After 60 h the remaining fraction of GABAB receptors was significantly lower in neurons that received baclofen stimulation (basal, 24.33 ± 0.4% n = 7; baclofen, 14.75 ± 0.5%, n = 7, p < 0.0001). The specificity of this effect was demonstrated by following the fate of the biotinylated β3 subunit of the GABAA receptor. Importantly, baclofen had no effect on the levels of the β3 subunit remaining after 60 h of treatment compared with the levels remaining after basal degradation (baclofen, 97.10 ± 3.3% control, n = 6). Multiple labeling experiments were used to estimate the halflife of the GABAB receptor under these conditions. The half-life of the control population of cell surface GABAB receptors was calculated to be 31.0 h (Fig. 4b, τ basal) and was significantly reduced to 23.5 h after baclofen treatment (Fig. 4b, τ baclofen). To verify that biotinylated receptors recovered after 60 h corresponded to a surface population, a cleavable biotin reagent was used in the same experiment. When neurons were exposed to cleavage media no GABAB receptor immunoreactivity could be detected after purification with streptavidin (Fig. 4c, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that prolonged agonist treatment destabilizes cell s"

Recent studies have shown that several UBA domain proteins interact with ubiquitin (Ub), specifically p62, the phosphotyrosine-independent ligand of the SH2 domain of p56lck; HHR23A, a human nucleotide excision repair protein; and DDI1, another damage-inducible protein. NMR chemical shift mapping reveals that Ub binds specifically but weakly to a conserved hydrophobic epitope on HHR23A UBA(1) and UBA(2) and that the UBA domains bind on the hydrophobic patch on the surface of the five-stranded β-sheet of Ub. Models of the UBA(1)-Ub and UBA(2)-Ub complexes obtained from de novo docking reveal different orientations of the UBA domains on the Ub surface compared with those obtained by homology modeling with the related CUE domains, which also bind Ub.

The lifespan of proteins inside and outside a cell is tightly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and numerous studies show that protein degradation is tightly interlocked with cell cycle progression and is therefore an integral part of transduction pathways and other cellular processes (1Ciechanover A.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6794) Google Scholar). The principle mechanism of this covalent modification has been identified: an enzyme cascade known as E1-E2-E3 is responsible for activation and transfer of Ub onto the target protein in a linkage-specific manner (1Ciechanover A.

Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar).

Finley D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 21-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Monoubiquitination is not sufficient for targeting proteins to the proteasome, however; assembly of a poly-Ub chain of at least four Ub moieties is required to create a degradation signal (11van Nocker S.

The predominant linkages observed are Lys48-Gly76 (16Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), Lys29-Gly76 (17Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of which Lys48-linked chains appear to be the most frequent degradation signal. Poly-Ub assembly via Lys29 and Lys63 is less common, and chain formation via Lys63 seems to be involved in nondegradation signal events, e.g. DNA repair (18Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although key steps of Ub activation and transfer to a substrate as well as the structure of the 20 S subunit of the proteasome are known, the question of how proteins are targeted to the proteasome remains unanswered. It is not known whether there is an additional mechanism to regulate the time point of degradation. One possibility is that monoubiquitination leads to a “point of no return,” which proceeds to substrate destruction in a defined time span. Recently, several groups reported that proteins containing a UBA motif can bind directly to Ub and/or poly-Ub, leading to an inhibition of the degradation of target substrates through the proteasome (19Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 20Chen L. Shinde U. Ortolan T.G. Madura K.

UBA domains are a common motif in a variety of protein families involved in protein degradation, cell cycle control, or DNA repair. In vitro and in vivo assays have revealed that UBA domains of the DNA damage-inducible proteins, RAD23 (as well as the fission yeast homolog Rhp23) and DDI1, as well as proteins with no function in DNA repair, p62 and Mud1p, interact specifically with Ub. Furthermore, poly-Ub chain formation is inhibited by RAD23 in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner (20Chen L. Shinde U. Ortolan T.G. Madura K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 24: 24Google Scholar, 21Ortolan T.G. Tongaonkar P. Lambertson D. Chen L. Schauber C. Madura K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that poly-Ub chain extension stops at a length of three Ub moieties and that the inhibition of chain extension of RAD23 is specific for Lys48-linked chains (22Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the UBA-Ub interaction, Clarke et al. (23Clarke D.J. Mondesert G. Segal M. Bertolaet B.L. Jensen S. Wolff M. Henze M. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1997-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) concluded that RAD23 and DDI1 are involved in the checkpoint control of the cell cycle. They proposed that the UBA domains of RAD23 and DDI1 could bind to the nascent poly-Ub chain of the Pds1 substrate, inhibiting chain extension and thereby increasing the lifetime of Pds1, which would otherwise be rapidly degraded.In this report we provide a structural basis for the interaction of UBA domains with monomeric Ub based on an NMR chemical shift mapping study as well as Ub mutagenesis. Ub binds specifically to both UBA(1) and UBA(2) of HHR23A. The binding interface for both UBA domains is almost identical despite the low overall sequence similarity. Both UBA domains bind to the same region of monomeric Ub, which is also involved in the binding to the proteasome subunit S5a. Models for the UBA(1)-Ub and UBA(2)-Ub complexes were generated from the chemical shift mapping data by de novo docking as well as by homology modeling with the solution structure of the closely related CUE domain in complex with Ub (24Kang R.S.

These models revealed very different orientations of the UBA domains on the surface of Ub. Our results suggest that UBA domains may interact with Ub as well as other proteins, e.g. the HHR23A-binding proteins HIV-1 Vpr (25Withers-Ward E.S. Jowett J.B. Stewart S.A. Xie Y.M. Garfinkel A.

Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Withers-Ward E.S. Mueller T.D. Chen I.S. Feigon J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14103-14112Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 15N- and 15N-,13C-labeled proteins were prepared by growing cells on M9 minimal medium using 15NH4Cl and 13C6-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. For the titration of the UBA domain proteins, bovine Ub (amino acid sequence is identical to human Ub) was purchased from Sigma and purified by gel filtration. Purity was subsequently checked by SDS-PAGE and analytical reversed phase HPLC. For the NMR chemical shift mapping of Ub, yeast Ub was prepared from the expression plasmid pET11c-Ub (gift from A. Varshavsky). The protein was purified by reversed phase HPLC. Alanine mutants of yeast Ub were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene). The cDNA sequence was verified by sequencing using the DyeDeoxy-Terminator method (PerkinElmer). Ub mutant proteins were prepared similar to wild type Ub. Protein concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient at A280 of 1280 m-1 for Ub and UBA(2) and 5120 m-1 cm-1 for UBA(1), based on their respective amino acid compositions.Chemical Shift Mapping Experiments—Proteins for titration experiments were dialyzed against identical buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 100 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm deuterated dithiothreitol (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories CIL) to avoid chemical shift changes because of differences in buffer conditions. NMR samples for titration studies contained 0.25-0.5 mm15N-labeled protein. Unlabeled protein was added stepwise up to a final ratio of 1:10. Unlabeled Ub was concentrated as far as possible to minimize volume changes throughout the titration. The “reverse” titration of Ub with UBA proteins was performed similar to the experiment described above. In addition, the UBA domains were tested for homo- and heterodimerization with NMR mapping experiments. 15N-Labeled UBA(1) (0.7 mm) was mixed with unlabeled UBA(2). All of the measurements were performed at 27 °C using a Bruker DRX-500 or DRX-600. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiments with Watergate water suppression (60Piotto M. Sadek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar) and water flip-back pulses were used for monitoring the chemical shift changes. All of the titration data sets were processed identical using the software XWINNMR (Bruker). 1H dimensions were referenced using external 3-trimethyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionian. 15N nitrogen and 13C carbon frequencies were referenced using the gyromagnetic ratios 15N/1H = 0.101329118 and 13C/1H = 0.251449530. The changes of proton and nitrogen chemical shifts were averaged based on their gyromagnetic ratios using the following equation. Δδave=0.5×[(|Δδ(H1H)|+(0.125×|Δδ(N15)|)](Eq. 1) The chemical shifts of yeast Ub were reassigned (chemical shifts published for human Ub differ from yeast Ub because of three amino acid changes) using 15N,13C-labeled yeast Ub. A set of triple-resonance experiments (31Cavanagh J. Palmer A.G. Fairbrothers W. Skelton N. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar) (CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, HBHA(CO)NH, H(C)(CO)NH-total correlation spectroscopy, CC(CO)NH-total correlation spectroscopy, and HCCH-correlation spectroscopy) was acquired to assign all backbone and side chain chemical shifts for yeast Ub under the conditions used for the NMR chemical shift perturbation studies.Homology Modeling of the UBA-Ubiquitin Complexes—Model complexes of the UBA(1)/UBA(2) with Ub were built using the structure of the CUE domain of Cue2 and Ub as a template (24Kang R.S. Daniels C.M. Francis S.A. Shih S.C. Salerno W.J. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I. Cell. 2003; 113: 621-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Initial structures of the complexes were obtained by fitting the Cα atoms of the residues in helices 1 and 3 of the CUE and UBA domains. Close contacts between atoms in the interface were removed by manual remodeling using the software Quanta98. The structures were then subsequently refined by energy minimization and short (20 ps) molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K (Charmm force field, Quanta98) using only geometrical energy terms to maintain bond length and angles as well as van der Waals' packing.De Novo Docking for the UBA-Ubiquitin Interaction—The program HADDOCK (32Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar) was applied to dock Ub and the UBA domains of HHR23A. In this approach, the data obtained from chemical shift mapping are transformed into a set of ambiguous distance restraints that are used together with geometrical and electrostatic complementarity to dock the two molecules. Chemical shift mapping of UBA(1), UBA(2), and Ub and surface accessibility data calculated with the program NACCESS (33Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS Computer Program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London1993Google Scholar) were used to define ambiguous distance restraints as described. The target distance of these restraints was set to 2.0 Å; force constants for empirical and experimental restraints were used as suggested by the default settings. Initially 750 structures for a Ub-UBA complex were generated by docking Ub and UBA(1)/UBA(2) as rigid bodies using only ambiguous distance restraints, van der Waals' energy, and electrostatic energy terms using the program suite ARIA1.2 and CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Of those, 200 structures with the lowest overall energy were subsequently refined, allowing the side chain conformations of residues within the binding interface to be flexible. Finally, 100 refined structures with lowest overall energy were then refined using a short molecular dynamics simulation in explicit solvent to allow for a correct implementation of the electrostatic contribution. The method was applied to two closely related complexes for which structures were available, the UIM-2 S5a-HHR23A Ubl and the Cue2 CUE domain-Ub complex, to test for the reliability of that procedure. For the simulation of the Cue2 CUE domain-Ub interaction, the distance restraint set was defined based on the residues buried in the complex structure; for the simulation of the HHR23A Ubl-UIM-2 S5a interaction the same criteria for chemical shift changes and residue accessibility as used for the Ub-UBA domain modeling were applied for generating the distance restraint set. The test calculations yielded model structures that were within 1.5 Å rmsd of the experimentally determined structures. Different cut-off values for the surface accessibility in the definition of the distance restraint set used for the computational docking did not lead to altered complex architectures, confirming that the computational results are stable. The influence of the template structures of the individual complex components was determined by using the Ub structure of the Cue2 CUE-Ub complex for docking to the UBA domains as well as the structure of free Ub (Protein Data Bank entry code 1UBI). Again no change in complex architecture could be observed.RESULTSUbiquitin Binds Specifically to HHR23A UBA(1) and UBA(2) Domains—High resolution structures of both UBA domains of HHR23A have been determined showing that overall the three-helical bundles are largely identical, despite a low (∼20%) sequence identity (29Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Withers-Ward E.S. Mueller T.D. Chen I.S. Feigon J.

Biol. 1998; 5: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The main structural differences are slightly different packing of side chains in the hydrophobic core and the conformation of the N and C termini. Both domains have an unusually large hydrophobic surface patch that was predicted to be a protein-protein interface (29Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Withers-Ward E.S. Mueller T.D. Chen I.S. Feigon J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14103-14112Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on the structures and sequence analysis of UBA domains, we predicted that a conserved portion of this hydrophobic patch would be the binding region for Ub (29Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).To map the binding site of Ub on UBA domains, NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments were performed on both UBA(1) and UBA(2) from HHR23A. Samples of 15N-labeled UBA(1) and UBA(2) were mixed with bovine Ub, and two-dimensional HSQC spectra were acquired to monitor the changes in the chemical shifts of the backbone amides induced by the binding to Ub (Fig. 1, a and b). Changes in chemical shifts are observed for several residues in both UBA(1) and UBA(2) starting at about 0.6 molar equivalents, indicating the formation of specific complexes in fast exchange on both the 500 and 600 MHz NMR time scale. Assuming a binary interaction between the UBA domains and Ub, a KD in the range of 500-600 μm can be determined from nonlinear fitting of the titrations with either UBA(1) or UBA(2) (see also Fig. 3, a and b). However, a binding constant of about 10 μm was reported for full-length Rad23 (19Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which may indicate cooperative binding of both UBA domains (37Rao H. Sastry A. J. Biol.

The Ubl domain is structurally very similar to Ub (39Mueller T.D. Feigon J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4634-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 40Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and exhibits a high sequence identity. Weak binding between the HHR23A Ubl and UBA domains was also detected in the context of the full-length protein as well as isolated domains (41Walters K.J. Lech P.J. Goh A.M. Wang Q. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) under slightly different buffer conditions and at higher field strength, with a binding affinity at least 10-fold lower compared with the already weak interaction between the UBA domains and Ub.Ubiquitin Binds to a Conserved Surface Epitope of UBA Domains—The results of the chemical shift perturbation study were mapped onto the structures of UBA(1) and UBA(2) (Fig. 1). Although UBA(1) and UBA(2) have a relatively low sequence identity, the binding interfaces revealed by the chemical shift mapping are remarkably similar. Residues exhibiting the largest chemical shift changes upon binding to Ub, Gly174 and His192 for UBA(1) and Leu330, Gly331, and Glu348 for UBA(2), respectively, are in similar locations. A large cluster of residues in UBA(1) involved in binding is located at the C-terminal end of the first helix, Ile170, Met171, Ser172, and the first three residues in the short and highly conserved loop 1, Met173, Gly174, and Tyr175 (Fig. 1, a, c, and e). Several positions on the third helix of UBA(1) also show large changes upon binding, specifically His192 and Arg193 at the N terminus of helix 3 and Tyr197 at the second turn of helix 3. Together, these residues form a consecutive patch of about 520 Å on the surface of UBA(1) (Fig. 1e). The residues with the largest chemical shift changes, His192, Met173, and Gly174, are in the center of the epitope.Residue Tyr197 also exhibits a significant change in chemical shift upon the addition of Ub but is located on the “back face” of the binding interface. The change for the amide proton and nitrogen frequencies of Tyr197 might be attributed to small structural changes in the hydrophobic core because of interactions of the side chain of Tyr197 with Arg193, which is part of the binding interface. Residues in the C terminus of UBA(1) do not exhibit chemical shift changes when Ub is added (Fig. 1c) and do not seem to be part of the binding interface. This was surprising, because the C terminus is close to the hydrophobic patch involved in binding and is of relatively rigid nature (29Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Analysis of the binding of UBA(2) to Ub reveals that the general location of the epitope remains the same compared with UBA(1) (Fig. 1). Identical positions in the C-terminal end of helix 1 (Arg326, Leu327, and Ala329) as well as the first three residues of the hydrophobic loop 1 (Leu330, Gly331, and Phe332) form a large part of the binding interface to Ub. In addition, residues at similar positions at the N terminus of helix 3 (Glu348 and Asn349) are also among the residues with the highest chemical shift changes upon binding. The structurally equivalent residue of Glu348 in UBA(1) is Pro191; therefore no information about whether or not Pro191 is involved in the binding of Ub can be deduced from this analysis. A larger number of residues at the C-terminal end of helix 3 of UBA(2) are involved in binding than observed for UBA(1). On the last turn of helix 3, residue Leu356 is affected by the binding, whereas residues of UBA(1), Leu199 and Thr200, do not exhibit significant changes. Overall, with a binding area of ∼650 Å2, UBA(2) appears to have about a 25% larger interface than UBA(1), for which the residues within the binding epitope yield an area of about 520 Å2.UBA Domains Bind on the Five-stranded β-Sheet Surface of Ubiquitin—To investigate the binding surface for UBA domains on Ub, NMR chemical shift mapping was performed under the identical conditions as reported above using yeast Ub. Yeast Ub differs in three amino acids compared with human Ub, S21P, D24E, and S28A, none of which is close to the binding site for UBA domains determined in this study. The residue Pro19 in human Ub is located in a tight turn in the loop between the second β-strand and the first α-helix. The two other residues Asp24 and Ser28 are located on the α-helix, facing in the opposite direction of the determined binding interface. We therefore concluded that these mutations do not interfere with or modulate the binding of the UBA domains to Ub. However, to confirm that the recognition process is not influenced by indirect effects, we repeated the titration using 15N-labeled human Ub purchased from VLI research (Mavern) and UBA(2); no differences in the chemical shift changes compared with the study using yeast Ub were detected (data not shown).Chemical shift mapping of the amide resonances of Ub as a function of added UBA(1) or UBA(2) up to a ratio of 1:10 Ub:UBA again revealed complexes in fast exchange on the NMR timescale. Upon the addition of UBA(1) to Ub, significant changes in chemical shift are observed for 23 residues (Fig. 2, a, c, and e). Most of these residues are located on the β-strands or the connecting loops of the five-stranded β-sheet of Ub, forming a consecutive patch. Leu71-Leu73 are located in the C terminus close to the Gly-Gl"

The activity of KATP channels, which regulates β-cell membrane potential, is determined by the relative concentrations of intracellular ATP and ADP. When the blood glucose level rises, the increased intracellular [ATP/ADP] ratio favors KATP channel closure, resulting in membrane depolarization, Ca2+ influx, and insulin secretion. When the blood glucose level falls, the above molecular events reverse, and insulin release is stopped. In the event where KATP channels fail to open during glucose starvation, β-cell membrane potential remains depolarized, and insulin secretion persists, leading to severe hypoglycemia. These symptoms are found in patients suffering from congenital hyperinsulinism (5Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

When intracellular [ATP/ADP] ratio is high, ATP inhibition predominates, and channel activity decreases. Conversely, when intracellular [ATP/ADP] ratio is low, MgADP stimulation predominates, and channel activity increases. Importantly, many PHHI-associated SUR1 mutations specifically reduce or abolish the ability of the channel to be stimulated by MgADP (13Nichols C.G. Shyng S.-L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B.

In addition to conferring MgADP stimulation, SUR1 also mediates channel regulation by sulfonylureas and the potassium channel opener diazoxide (2Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 3Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M.

Sulfonylureas, such as glibenclamide and tolbutamide, inhibit channel activity by binding to SUR1; they are clinically effective in the treatment of type II diabetes (25Ashcroft F.M. Horm. Metab.

Diazoxide, by contrast, stimulates channel activity when bound to SUR1 and has been successfully used to treat some cases of PHHI (4Huopio H. Shyng S.-L. Otonkoski T. Nichols C.G. Am. J.

Perinatol. 2000; 24: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Aside from functional regulation, SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits are also both required for cell surface expression of the channel. Assembly of the KATP channel complex occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7Clement J.P.t. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). To ensure that only correctly assembled functional channels are exported to the plasma membrane, the cell has developed a quality control mechanism involving a RKR tripeptide motif present in both SUR1 and Kir6.2 (28Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that in preassembled and partially assembled channel proteins, the RKR motif is exposed, providing a signal for ER retention. Upon complete assembly of the channel complex, the RKR motifs become shielded to allow the channel to pass the ER quality control checkpoint and traffic forward to the plasma membrane. Inactivation of the motif by deletion or mutation to AAA leads to unregulated surface expression of individual subunits and partially assembled channel complexes (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 28Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Although trafficking signals other than the RKR sequence motif have been reported to regulate the abundance of KATP channels in the plasma membrane, their mechanisms are not as well understood (21Babenko A.P.

So far, the SUR1 mutations that have been reported to cause channel trafficking defects are located within or downstream of the second nucleotide-binding domain of the protein. Here, we report that two PHHI-associated SUR1 mutations, A116P and V187D (2Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 21Babenko A.P. Bryan J.

Unlike the previously reported trafficking mutants, trafficking defects caused by these two mutations can be corrected by sulfonylureas, and the rescued channels are fully functional.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology—FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was inserted at the N terminus of the hamster SUR1 cDNA by sequential overlap extension PCR. Point mutations of SUR1 were introduced into hamster SUR1 cDNA in the pECE plasmid using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The FLAG epitope tag and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All SUR1-Kir6.2 fusion constructs were also in pECE vector (22Matsuo M. Trapp S. Tanizawa Y. Kioka N. Amachi T. Oka Y. Ashcroft F.M. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41184-41191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rat Kir6.2 cDNA is in pCDNA3 vector. Mutant clones from multiple PCRs were analyzed in all experiments to avoid false results caused by undesired mutations introduced by PCR.86Rb+ Efflux Assay—The Cells were incubated for 24 h in culture medium containing 86RbCl (1 μCi/ml) 2–3 days after transfection with SUR1 and Kir6.2. Before measurement of Rb efflux, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in Krebs-Ringer solution with metabolic inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml oligomycin plus 1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose). At selected time points, the solution was aspirated from the cells and replaced with fresh solution. At the end of a 40-min period, the cells were lysed in 2% SDS-Ringer solutions. The 86Rb+ in the aspirated solution and the cell lysate were counted. The percentage of efflux at each time point was calculated as the cumulative counts in the aspirated solution divided by the total counts from the solutions and the cell lysates.Immunofluorescence Staining—COSm6 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates, transfected with 0.6 μg of SUR1 and 0.4 μg of Kir6.2/well using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. The cells were analyzed 48–72 h post-transfection. For surface staining, the cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma; diluted to 10 μg/ml in Opti-MEM containing 0.1% BSA) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS, and then incubated with Cy-3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three 5-min washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and viewed using an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope. For total cellular staining of FLAG-tagged SUR1, the cells were fixed with cold (–20 °C) methanol for 5 min. The fixed cells were incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml PBS containing 1% BSA) at room temperature for 1 h, washed in PBS, incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, and washed again in PBS before imaging.Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting analyses were performed using COS-1 cells instead of COSm6 cells to reduce background (22Matsuo M.

Transfection was carried out as described above. The cells were lysed 48–72 h post-transfection in a buffer (referred to as the lysis buffer) containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and CompleteTR protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The proteins in cell lysates were separated by SDS/PAGE (8%), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, analyzed by M2 anti-FLAG antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Femto; Pierce).Chemiluminescence Assay—COSm6 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and transfected with KATP channel subunits using FuGENE 6. Drug treatment was initiated 32–40 h post-transfection and lasted for 4–24 h. The cells were then processed for chemiluminescence assays as described previously (36Taschenberger G. Mougey A. Shen S.

Briefly, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, preblocked in PBS with 0.1% BSA for 30 min, incubated in M2 anti-FLAG antibody (10 μg/ml) for an hour, washed four times for 30 min in PBS with 0.1% BSA, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Jackson, 1:1000 dilution) for 20 min, and washed again four times for 30 min in PBS with 0.1% BSA. Chemiluminescence of each dish was quantified in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs) following 5 s of incubation in Power Signal ELISA 32 Femto luminol solution (Pierce). All steps after fixation were carried out at room temperature.Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—COS1 cells grown in 35-mm dishes were transfected with fSUR1 and Kir6.2 for 24 h. The cells were starved in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min prior to labeling with l-[35S]methionine (ICN Tran35S-Label, 150–250 μCi/ml) for 30 min. Labeled cultures were chased for various times in regular medium supplemented with 10 mm methionine at 37 °C. At the end of the chase, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of the lysis buffer (see above). For immunoprecipitation, 500 μl of cell lysate was incubated with 10 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed three times in the lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted using the Laemmli sample buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was subjected to fluorography. The dried gels were analyzed using a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager.Patch Clamp Recordings—COSm6 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 and plated onto coverslips. The cDNA for the green fluorescent protein was co-transfected with SUR1 and Kir6.2 to facilitate identification of positively transfected cells. Patch clamp recordings were made 36–72 h post-transfection. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature as previously described. Micropipettes were pulled from nonheparinized Kimble glass (Fisher) on a horizontal puller (Sutter Instrument, Co., Novato, CA). Electrode resistance was typically 1–2 MΩ when filled with K-INT solution (below). Inside-out patches were voltage-clamped with an Axopatch 1-D amplifier (Axon Inc., Foster City, CA). The standard bath (intracellular) and pipette (extracellular) solution (K-INT) had the following composition: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm K-HEPES, 1 mm K-EGTA, pH 7.3. ATP was added as the potassium salt. All currents were measured at a membrane potential of –50 mV (pipette voltage = +50 mV). The data were analyzed using pCLAMP8 software (Axon Instrument). Off-line analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel programs. The data were presented as the means ± S.E.RESULTSBoth the A116P and V187D Mutations in SUR1 Prevent Normal Cell Surface Expression of KATP Channels—Several recent studies have shown that defective KATP channel trafficking is an underlying mechanism of congenital hyperinsulinism. The trafficking mutations reported to date are all located in the NBD2 and the distal C-terminal region of the molecule, including ΔF1388, R1394H, and L1544P (34Cartier E.A. Conti L.R.

To examine whether mutations located in other parts of the molecule also affect channel trafficking, we focused our attention to two mutations, A116P and V187D, that are located in the first transmembrane domain, or TM0, of SUR1 (Fig. 1), and that have previously been reported to not form functional channels when co-expressed with Kir6.2 (6Sharma N. Crane A. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 803-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol.

To investigate how the A116P and V187D mutations lead to loss of functional KATP channels, we first performed Western blot analysis. Both mutations were engineered into a SUR1 construct that has been tagged with a FLAG epitope at its extracellular N terminus (referred to as fSUR1 from here on) to facilitate detection (34Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The N-terminal FLAG tag has been tested in many SUR1 constructs in previous studies and has been shown not to affect channel phenotype (34Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.-L. Proc.

As the core-glycosylated immature form (the lower band) traffics through the Golgi, its N-linked oligosaccharides become further modified to yield the complex glycosylated mature form (the upper band). Fig. 2A shows that, although both the immature and mature forms were seen with cells co-expressing WT-fSUR1 and Kir6.2, only the immature form was evident in cells co-expressing Kir6.2 and the A116P- or the V187D-fSUR1 mutants. These results demonstrate that the mutant protein is synthesized and suggest that the mutant channel may fail to traffic to the cell surface. The lack of surface expression is confirmed by immunofluorescent staining experiments. In contrast to the abundant surface staining observed in cells transfected with Kir6.2 and WT-fSUR1, surface staining in cells transfected with Kir6.2 and A116P-fSUR1 or V187D-fSUR1 was barely detectable (Fig. 2B, top panels). However, upon fixation and membrane permeabilization, both mutant proteins were found inside the cell, with fluorescent signals concentrated in the perinuclear region suggesting ER retention. These results led us to conclude that the A116P and V187D mutations cause loss of functional KATP channels by preventing channels from trafficking to the cell surface.Fig. 2Analysis of the A116- and V187D-SUR1 mutants by immunoblotting and immunofluorescent staining experiments. A, Western blot analysis of fSUR1. In cells expressing Kir6.2 and WT-fSUR1, two bands are observed: the lower core glycosylated band, or the immature band (solid arrow), and the upper complex glycosylated band, or the mature band (open arrow). In contrast, only the immature band is observed in cells expressing Kir6.2 and A116P- or V187D-fSUR1. The total steady-state protein level of A116P- and V187D-fSUR1 also appears less than that of WT-fSUR1. Molecular mass markers (kDa) are indicated on the right. B, top panels, surface staining of COSm6 cells transiently transfected with Kir6.2 and either WT-, A116P-, or V187D-fSUR1 using the M2 anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibodies followed by Cy-3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Staining was performed in living cells at 4 °C, and the cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and viewed by confocal microscopy (Olympus Fluoview 300). Whereas cells expressing WT-fSUR1 channels have abundant surface staining, those expressing A116P- or V187D-fSUR1 channels have barely detectable staining. Bottom panels, total cellular expression of WT or mutant fSUR1. Cells co-transfected with Kir6.2 and the various fSUR1 constructs were fixed and permeabilized with methanol and stained for the FLAG epitope using the M2 anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibodies followed by Cy-3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Both A116P- and V187D-fSUR1 were detected inside the cell, with a perinuclear staining pattern. fWT, WT-fSUR1; fA116P, A116P-fSUR1; fV187D, V187D-fSUR1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Trafficking Defects of the A116P and V187D Mutants Are Intrinsic to SUR1—One potential explanation for the trafficking defects seen with the A116P- and V187D-fSUR1 mutations is that the SUR1 mutants are unable to associate with Kir6.2. Because a prerequisite for either SUR1 or Kir6.2 to exit the ER is proper assembly of the two subunits into the octameric KATP channel complex that shields the RKR ER retention/retrieval signals, failure of SUR1 to associate with Kir6.2 would result in the absence of SUR1 in the plasma membrane, as we have observed. To address this possibility, we used a heterotandem dimer construct in which the C terminus of the mutant fSUR1 has been fused to the N terminus of Kir6.2 (referred to as A116P- or V187D-fSUR1/Kir6.2 fusion) to achieve obligatory physical association between the two subunits; similar SUR1/Kir6.2 fusion constructs have been used previously by a number of groups for structure-function and trafficking studies (7Clement J.P.t.

Here we report that Mafs, Prox1, and Pax6, which are essential transcription factors for normal lens development, bind to three functionally important cis elements, PL1, PL2, and OL2, in the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter and may cooperatively direct the transcription of this lens fiber cell preferred gene. Gel shift assays demonstrated that Mafs bind to the MARE-like sequences in the PL1 and PL2 elements, whereas Prox1, a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein like its Drosophila homolog Prospero, interacts with the OL2 element. Furthermore, Pax6, a known repressor of the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter, binds to all three of these cis elements. In transfection assays, Mafs and Prox1 activated the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter; however, their transactivation ability was repressed when co-transfected with Pax6. Taken together with the known spatiotemporal expression patterns of Mafs, Prox1, and Pax6 in the developing lens, we propose that Pax6 occupies and represses the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter in lens epithelial cells, and is displaced by Prox1 and Mafs, which activate the promoter, in differentiating cortical fiber cells.

The lens is a transparent tissue composed of cuboidal epithelial cells on its anterior surface and fiber cells that comprise the remainder of the lens. Vertebrate lens development initiates when a portion of lens-competent cephalic ectoderm responds to an inductive signal from the optic neuroepithelium. The induced ectoderm, termed the lens placode, thickens, invaginates, and pinches off to form the lens vesicle. Cells in the anterior portion of the lens vesicle develop into lens epithelium, whereas cells in the posterior portion leave the cell cycle, elongate and differentiate into primary lens fibers. After the lens forms, its growth is mediated by lens epithelial proliferation and the differentiation of lens epithelial cells at the lens equator into lens fiber cells (1Piatigorsky J. Differentiation. 1981; 19: 134-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 2Chow R.L. Lang R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 255-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). This differentiation event is marked by dramatic changes in cell shape, the down-regulation of epithelial markers such as vimentin, the initiation of aquaporin0/MIP and beaded filament expression, and the accumulation of crystallin proteins (3Wride M.A. Differentiation. 1996; 61: 77-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

In gel shift assays, L-Maf binds to MARE-like elements in a number of crystallin promoters and can activate the expression of constructs consisting of these MAREs coupled with heterologous promoters (11Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). MafB is transcribed in the lens epithelium (8Kawauchi S. Takahashi S. Nakajima O. Ogino H. Morita M. Nishizawa M.

Yasuda K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Prox1, a divergent homeodomain protein, is expressed initially in the early lens placode and is up-regulated during fiber cell differentiation (13Tomarev S.I. Sundin O. Banerjee-Basu S. Duncan M.K.

Prox1 null lenses do not undergo lens fiber cell elongation, although the expression of several fiber cell-specific genes can be detected by RT-PCR (14Wigle J.T. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Oliver G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In co-transfection assays, Prox1 activates several γ-crystallin promoters (16Lengler J. Krausz E. Tomarev S. Prescott A. Quinlan R.A. Graw J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 515-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been established whether Prox1 is a DNA binding transcription factor like its Drosophila homolog, Prospero (17Oliver G. Sosa-Pineda B. Geisendorf S. Spana E.P. Doe C.Q. Gruss P. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 18Hassan B. Li L. Bremer K.A. Chang W. Pinsonneault J. Vaessin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pax6 is a paired domain/homeodomain transcription factor hypothesized to be a master control gene of visual system development because it can induce ectopic eyes in both vertebrates and Drosophila (19Grindley J.C. Davidson D.R. Hill R.E. Development. 1995; 121: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Callaerts P. Halder G. Gehring W.J. Annu. Rev.

Lang R.A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1999; 126: 4213-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrates, Pax6 expression initiates in the head ectoderm and is essential for the development of the lens placode. Once the lens forms, Pax6 becomes restricted to the epithelium, which continues to express this transcription factor throughout life (24Koroma B.M. Yang J.M. Sundin O.H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 108-120PubMed Google Scholar, 25Duncan M.K. Haynes 2nd, J.I. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5579-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue recombination experiments demonstrated that lens epithelial cells lacking one functional copy of the Pax6 gene preferentially undergo fiber cell differentiation, suggesting that Pax6 maintains the epithelial cell phenotype in the mature lens (26Collinson J.M. Quinn J.C. Buchanan M.A. Kaufman M.H. Wedden S.E. West J.D. Hill R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9688-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Pax6 is a positive transcriptional regulator of the mouse αB (27Gopal-Srivastava R. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 4681-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) genes. Furthermore, Pax6 cooperates with Mafs to activate ζ-crystallin (32Richardson J. Cvekl A. Wistow G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4676-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Sharon-Friling R. Richardson J. Sperbeck S. Lee D. Rauchman M. Maas R. Swaroop A. Wistow G. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35751-35760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, Pax6 directly represses the transcription of the fiber cell preferred crystallin genes, chicken βB1 (25Duncan M.K. Haynes 2nd, J.I. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5579-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse γE,γF (35Kralova J. Czerny T. Spanielova H. Ratajova V. Kozmik Z. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). During lens development, the morphological transition between epithelial cells and fiber cells coincides with specific, regulated changes in crystallin gene expression. For example, βB1-crystallin, which accounts for 8.5% of the total protein of the newborn mouse lens (36Ueda Y. Duncan M.K. David L.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar), is not transcribed in lens epithelial cells, but its expression begins concurrently with the initial elongation of fiber cells (37Brahma S.K. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 38Duncan M.K. Li X. Ogino H. Yasuda K. Piatigorsky J. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, βB1-crystallin is a specific lens fiber cell marker whose transcription is likely to be controlled by molecular mechanisms that overlap those of fiber cell differentiation. Furthermore, these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved because the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter is fully functional in transgenic mice (38Duncan M.K. Li X. Ogino H. Yasuda K. Piatigorsky J. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The minimal promoter required for chicken βB1-crystallin transcription in transfected cells (–126/+30) contains at least three functionally important cis acting elements, PL1 (–116 to –102), PL2 (–90 to –76), and OL2 (–75 to –68) (Fig. 1A) (39Roth H.J. Das G.C. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of PL1 (M6A) and PL2 (M7) decrease chicken βB1-crystallin promoter activity (39Roth H.J. Das G.C. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PL1 and PL2 are both similar to the TPA-MARE consensus sequence (11Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and recognize a similar but not identical profile of transcription factors (39Roth H.J. Das G.C. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Tomarev S.I. Duncan M.K. Roth H.J. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 134-143PubMed Google Scholar). OL2, which is adjacent to the PL2 element, recognizes a distinct factor in lens cell nuclear extracts (39Roth H.J. Das G.C. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that Mafs bind the PL1 and PL2 elements, whereas Prox1 binds the OL2 element. Furthermore, Mafs and Prox1 can stimulate chicken βB1-crystallin promoter activity. Pax6, a known negative regulator of βB1-crystallin gene expression (25Duncan M.K. Haynes 2nd, J.I. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5579-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits Prox1- and Maf-mediated transactivation by competitively binding all three elements. Thus, we propose that Mafs, Prox1, and Pax6 collaborate to direct spatiotemporal expression of the chicken βB1-crystallin gene during lens development. RT-PCR Analysis of c-Maf Isoform Expression in Lens—Total lens RNA was harvested from 5-day-old mice using the SV Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). RT-PCR was performed using the Superscript RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The common 5′ primer for both c-Maf isoforms is GCAGGTAGACCACCTCAAGC, the 3′ primer for the c-Maf long form is GCAAACTGCAAGAGGGTCTC, and the 3′ primer for the c-Maf short form is AAAAGAGCCATCACCACCAC. The expected sizes of RT-PCR products are 249 bp for the c-Maf long form and 300 bp for the c-Maf short form. After reverse transcription, the products were PCR amplified for 35 cycles of 94 °C/15 s, 55 °C/30 s, and 72 °C/30 s. The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed in 8% PAGE, isolated from the gel using Ultrafree-DA DNA purification columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA), cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and verified by DNA sequencing. Constructs—The chicken βB1-crystallin promoter plasmid –432/+30/CAT (p432) was described previously (41Duncan M.K. Roth H.J. Thompson M. Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was performed to make PL1-deleted (pΔPL1), PL2-deleted (pΔPL2), PL1/PL2-deleted (pΔPL1/PL2), and OL2-mutated reporter (pOL2mut1) constructs from p432. For pΔPL1, the sense strand primer was 5′-GAGCTTTGCAGGATGGCCGCACAGACACTG-3′; for pΔPL2, the sense strand primer was 5′-CGGCCGCACAGACACACTTCCATTGTGTGC-3′; for pΔPL1/PL2, the sense strand primer was 5′-GAGCTTTGCAGGATGACTTCCATTGTGTGC-3′; for pOL2mut1, the sense strand primer was 5′-CAGACACTGATGAGCTGGGCGTTCCATTGTGTGCCCGCC-3′. The mutated constructs were prepared as suggested by the manufacturer (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Chicken MafB, an intronless gene, was cloned from genomic DNA by PCR using the 5′ primer AAGGAAGCGAGAGGCGAAGCGGA and 3′ primer ATTAAGCACTCACATGAACTC. The PCR product was subcloned into PCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene) and subjected to sequencing. The eukaryotic MafB expression vector was prepared by subcloning the BamHI-NotI fragment of PCR-Script-MafB, which contains the full coding region of MafB into pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). Two EST clones, respectively comprising the 5′ (GenBank™ accession number 2257419) and 3′ (GenBank™ accession number 2988788) ends of the mouse c-Maf long form cDNA separated by a NotI site, were purchased from Invitrogen. The NotI–EcoRI fragment of the 3′ mouse c-Maf EST was inserted into pVL1392 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) to create an XbaI site at its 3′ end. The eukaryotic expression vector for the c-Maf long form was then constructed by sequentially subcloning the EcoRI–NotI fragment of the 5′ EST and NotI–XbaI fragment of pVL1392-c-Maf into pcDNA 3.1 Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). The c-Maf short form expression vector was generated by inserting the XhoI fragment from pCR-2.1 TOPO-c-Maf short form (see the RT-PCR step) into the XhoI site of the long form expression vector. All of the c-Maf expression vectors were confirmed by sequencing. Pax6 (25Duncan M.K. Haynes 2nd, J.I. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5579-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Prox1 (16Lengler J. Krausz E. Tomarev S. Prescott A. Quinlan R.A. Graw J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 515-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expression vectors were previously described. pCMVβGAL was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA); pCAT-Basic was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell Culture and Transfection—N/N 1003A cells (a rabbit lens epithelium derived cell line) (42Reddan J.R. Chepelinsky A.B. Dziedzic D.C. Piatigorsky J. Goldenberg E.M. Differentiation. 1986; 33: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were transfected following the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent protocol provided by Invitrogen. Generally 6 × 105 cells were plated for each 60-mm dish at least 8 h before transfection, each dish received 2.5 μg of promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid, 0.5 μg of pCMV/βGAL, and 0.5 μg of various expression plasmids. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and cellular extracts were prepared by multiple cycles of freeze/thaw. The extracts were assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase activity as previously described (39Roth H.J. Das G.C. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All co-transfection experiments were performed at least twice in triplicate and analyzed statistically by Student's t test. Western Blot Analysis—The polyclonal MafB antibody was made in rabbit against mouse MafB peptide QPLQSFDGFRSAHH (amino acids 119–131) and affinity purified. For Western blotting, lenses were dissected from adult mice. Epithelium and fiber cells were separated and homogenized in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate) to obtain water-soluble protein. Cell extracts of αTN4-1 cells (a mouse lens-derived cell line) (43Krausz E. Augusteyn R.C. Quinlan R.A. Reddan J.R. Russell P. Sax C.M. Graw J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2120-2128PubMed Google Scholar) and N/N 1003A cells were prepared by harvesting the cultured cells and homogenizing them in RIPA buffer. 20 μg of each protein preparation was subjected to electrophoresis through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked overnight in 10% powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of the antibody raised against the MafB for 1 h. The blots were washed 3 times with PBS-T, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Upstate USA, Charlottesville, VA) for 1 h, washed as above, incubated with LumiGlo chemiluminescent reagents following the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate USA), and exposed to BioMax MR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Recombinant Protein Expression—The coding sequence for the bZip DNA binding region of MafB (from amino acid 195 to the carboxyl terminus) was synthesized by PCR with the 5′ primer GGGGCTCGAGAGGACCGGTTCTCGGATGAC and 3′ primer GGGGGAGATCTTAAGCACTCACATGAA. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO and confirmed by sequencing. The MafB expression vector was generated by subcloning the EcoRI fragment into pET 41(c) (Novagen, Madison, WI). The recombinant MafB expression construct was subjected to sequencing to confirm the correct reading frame. The GST-Prox1 expression vectors were previously described (44Belecky-Adams T. Tomarev S. Li H. Ploder L. McInnes R. Sundin O. Adler R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1293-1303PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-Pax6 expression vector was a gift from Drs. Jonathan Epstein and Richard Mass (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA). BL21-CodonPlus-RIL competent cells (Stratagene) were transformed by the expression vectors for GST-tagged MafB, Pax6, and Prox1 individually. Escherichia coli extracts were prepared by using the BugBuster protein extraction kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen). The GST-tagged recombinant MafB, Pax6, and Prox1 were then purified by using the GST·Bind purification kit (Novagen). The purified proteins were stored in A100 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—All EMSAs were performed in a total volume of 12.5 μl containing 6 μl of A100, 250 ng of poly(dA-dT) or poly(dI-dC), 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μgofGST fusion protein, and 20,000 Cerenkov counts of double-stranded DNA probe as described previously (25Duncan M.K. Haynes 2nd, J.I. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5579-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonradioactive competitors were added at 50-fold molar excess. After a 15-min preincubation at room temperature, reactions were electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gels, using 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA as the buffer, at 4 °C. The oligonucleotides used for EMSA (sense strands only shown) were: PL1 mut1 (5′-GGATGTGCACACTGGGCGGCCGCA-3′) (M6A) (39Roth H.J. Das G.C. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PL2 mut1 (5′-AGACACTAGGCCTCTGGCACTTCC-3′) (M7) (39Roth H.J. Das G.C. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PL2 mut2 (5′-AGACACCCATGAGCTGGCACTTCC-3′), OL2 mut1 (5′-AGACACTGATGAGCTGGGCGTTCC-3′), and OL2 mut2 (5′-AGACACTGATGAGCTGGCACTTGG-3′). PL1, PL2/OL2, –126/–46, –126/–46 (mut PL1) and –126/–46 (mut PL2) were described in Duncan et al. (25Duncan M.K. Haynes 2nd, J.I. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5579-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TDA-Pros and mPbs were described in Hassan et al. (18Hassan B. Li L. Bremer K.A. Chang W. Pinsonneault J. Vaessin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10991-10996Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PL1 and PL2 Elements Are Essential for Chicken βB1-Crystallin Promoter Activity—The full-length chicken βB1-crystallin promoter (–432/+30) can be separated into two portions: –126/+30 is the minimal promoter in transfections (39Roth H.J. Das G.C. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contains all of the signals necessary for lens fiber cell-specific gene expression (38Duncan M.K. Li X. Ogino H. Yasuda K. Piatigorsky J. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); whereas –432/–126 directs crystallin level gene expression (25Duncan M.K. Haynes 2nd, J.I. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5579-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Taube J.R. Gao C.Y. Ueda Y. Zelenka P.S. David L.L. Duncan M.K. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Three distinct functional cis elements have been identified in the minimal promoter by DNase I footprinting and transfection analyses (39Roth H.J. Das G.C. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PL1 and PL2 elements are similar to each other and to the TPA-MARE sequence for Maf transcription factors (11Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast, the OL2 element is similar to the consensus DNA recognition sequence for the Drosophila protein, Prospero (18Hassan B. Li L. Bremer K.A. Chang W. Pinsonneault J. Vaessin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10991-10996Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1A and 6A). The contribution of PL1 and PL2 to the activity of the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter was tested by generating –432/+30 reporter constructs with either PL1, PL2 or both deleted. Transfection assays performed in lens-derived N/N 1003A cells demonstrated that deletion of either one or both of the PL1 and PL2 elements reduced βB1-crystallin promoter activity by at least 70% (Fig. 1B). Similar results were also obtained in the non-lens cell line CHO (data not shown). MafB and c-Maf Isoforms Are Expressed in Lens—Because TPA-MARE consensus sites can be recognized by multiple Maf family members, we investigated Maf expression in the adult lens. Previous in situ hybridization studies showed that MafB mRNA was present in the embryonic lens (8Kawauchi S. Takahashi S. Nakajima O. Ogino H. Morita M. Nishizawa M. Yasuda K. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19254-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 46Yoshida K. Imaki J. Koyama Y. Harada T. Shinmei Y. Oishi C. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Matsuda A. Nishi S. Matsuda H. Sakai M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 2679-2683PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of MafB in the adult lens was determined by Western immunoblotting of extracts obtained from microdissected adult lens fiber cells, lens epithelial cells, and extracts of two lens-derived cell lines, αTN4-1 (43Krausz E. Augusteyn R.C. Quinlan R.A. Reddan J.R. Russell P. Sax C.M. Graw J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2120-2128PubMed Google Scholar) and N/N 1003A (42Reddan J.R. Chepelinsky A.B. Dziedzic D.C. Piatigorsky J. Goldenberg E.M. Differentiation. 1986; 33: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). MafB protein was detected in microdissected lens epithelial cells as well as in the established lens epithelial cell lines, but not in the fiber cells (Fig. 2A). c-Maf protein is expressed at moderate levels in the lens epithelium, and its expression increases sharply with fiber cell differentiation (9Ring B.Z. Cordes S.P. Overbeek P.A. Barsh G.S. Development. 2000; 127: 307-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mouse c-Maf gene is alternatively spliced, producing a long form with 10 extra amino acids at the carboxyl terminus compared with the short from (47Huang W. Lu N. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50668-50675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis detected the transcripts of both isoforms in 5-day-old mouse lenses (Fig. 2B), although this qualitative RT-PCR analysis suggests that the short form predominates over the long form. MafB and c-Maf Can Activate the Chicken βB1-Crystallin Promoter through the MARE-like Elements—Because the PL1 and PL2 elements, each containing a putative MARE, are critical for βB1-crystallin promoter activity, it is likely that these elements are binding sites for Mafs. To determine whether MafB and c-Maf are capable of activating the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter, the expression vector for MafB or c-Maf (either long form or short form) was co-transfected with the p432 reporter into N/N 1003A cells. MafB appears to be a stronger transactivator because it activates the promoter 15.5 ± 3.1-fold, whereas c-Maf short form and long form only activated the promoter 4.0 ± 0.2- and 1.7 ± 0.1-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, A, lane 3, and B, lanes 3 and 4). Transfection assays also demonstrated that MafB-mediated transactivation is dependent on both PL1 and PL2 because deletion of either PL1 or PL2 diminished MafB-mediated transactivation in N/N 1003A cells (Fig. 3C). Similar results were also obtained in the non-lens cell line CHO (data not shown). Maf Specifically Binds to the PL1 and PL2 Elements of the Chicken βB1-Crystallin Promoter—Because Mafs can transactivate the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter and this transactivation is dependent on the MARE-like PL1 and PL2 elements, we tested whether these elements can bind Maf proteins in gel shift assays (Fig. 4). When there was no nonradiolabeled PL2/OL2 competitor present, MafB·PL2/OL2 complexes can be visualized by autoradiography. The formation of a labeled complex was significantly reduced by competition with nonradioactive self-oligonucleotide PL2/OL2, PL1, –126/–46, or –126/–46 (mut PL1), but not with PL1 mut1 and PL2 mut1, suggesting that MafB can specifically bind to PL1 and PL2 elements of the chicken βB1-crystallin promoter. The PL2 element appears to be more important for MafB binding because –126/–46 (mut PL2), which has an intact copy of PL1, competed less efficiently than –126/–46 (mut PL1), which has an intact copy of PL2.

https://openalex.org/W2047973301,"The Wilson disease protein (WND) is a transport ATPase involved in copper delivery to the secretory pathway. Mutations in WND and its homolog, the Menkes protein, lead to genetic disorders of copper metabolism. The WND and Menkes proteins are distinguished from other P-type ATPases by the presence of six soluble N-terminal metal-binding domains containing a conserved CXXC metal-binding motif. The exact roles of these domains are not well established, but possible functions include exchanging copper with the metallochaperone Atox1 and mediating copper-responsive cellular relocalization. Although all six domains can bind copper, genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the domains are not functionally equivalent. One way the domains could be tuned to perform different functions is by having different affinities for Cu(I). We have used isothermal titration calorimetry to measure the association constant (Ka) and stoichiometry (n) values of Cu(I) binding to the WND metal-binding domains and to their metallochaperone Atox1. The association constants for both the chaperone and target domains are ∼105 to 106m–1, suggesting that the handling of copper by Atox1 and copper transfer between Atox1 and WND are under kinetic rather than thermodynamic control. Although some differences in both n and Ka values are observed for variant proteins containing less than the full complement of six metal-binding domains, the data for domains 1–6 were best fitted with a single site model. Thus, the individual functions of the six WND metal-binding domains are not conferred by different Cu(I) affinities but instead by fold and electrostatic surface properties.

Wilson disease and Menkes syndrome are human diseases of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the genes for two closely related proteins, the Wilson (1Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar) and Menkes (2Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) ATPases. These proteins couple ATP hydrolysis to copper translocation across membranes. Menkes syndrome is caused by decreased copper uptake across the small intestine as well as impaired copper distribution to a variety of tissues, including the brain. By contrast, Wilson disease is characterized primarily by copper overload in the liver because of reduced biliary excretion (3Llanos R.M. Mercer J.F.B.

This process is dependent on interaction with Atox1, a copper chaperone that delivers Cu(I) ions to WND (6Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.-J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

At elevated copper concentrations, WND redistributes to cytoplasmic vesicles and mediates copper efflux from the cell (4Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

Similarly, the Menkes disease protein (MNK) relocalizes from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane in response to potentially toxic copper concentrations (9Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B.

Both proteins consist of eight transmembrane domains, of which the sixth contains an invariant CPC motif proposed to bind metal ions. Phosphatase- and ATP-binding domains and a phosphorylation site are conserved as well (11Lutsenko S. Efremov R.G. Tsivkovskii R. Walker J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Metal transport ATPases are distinguished from other P-type ATPases by the presence of multiple soluble N-terminal domains containing a conserved CXXC metal-binding motif (12Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Both WND and MNK contain six such domains, whereas the yeast homolog, Ccc2 (13Yuan D.S.

These domains are present not only in the copper ATPases but also occur in Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) transporters (11Lutsenko S. Efremov R.G. Tsivkovskii R. Walker J.M. J. Bioenerg.

Notably, the CXXC motifs from two Atox1 molecules coordinate a single Cu(I) ion in the x-ray structure (15Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although there are no structures of polypeptides comprising all six repeats from WND or MNK, their metal-binding properties have been studied in some detail. Both the WND and MNK N termini bind 5–6 copper ions (22Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and x-ray absorption spectroscopic studies indicate that the copper is present as Cu(I), ligated by the sulfurs from two cysteines (23Ralle M. Cooper M.J. Lutsenko S. Blackburn N.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 13525-13526Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B.

Numerous genetic and biochemical studies suggest that the domains are not functionally equivalent. For WND, yeast complementation assays indicate that the sixth domain alone is sufficient for copper loading of Fet3, the yeast homolog of ceruloplasmin (26Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the second or third metal-binding domain cannot substitute for the sixth domain, supporting distinct functions for the individual domains (27Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recently, a more specific function has been assigned to domains 5 and 6. These domains are responsible for the cooperative effect of copper on WND catalytic phosphorylation activity (28Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast to WND, yeast complementation studies on MNK indicate that the first four N-terminal domains are important for copper transport (29Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It may be that the domains function differently in the two ATPases. Another potential function for the metal-binding domains is mediating copper-responsive cellular relocalization. For example, mutations in MNK domains 4–6 interfere with the ability to traffic to the plasma membrane in response to elevated copper (30Strausak D. LaFontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31Voskoboinik I. Strausak D. Greenough M. Brooks H. Petris M. Smith S.

Finally, some of the domains may interact specifically with the copper chaperone Atox1. According to yeast two-hybrid assays using both WND (32Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B. Yang A.-S. Gilliam T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28497-28504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and MNK (33Strausak D. Howie M.K. Firth S.D. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Multhaup G. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20821-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Atox1 interacts most strongly with domains 1–4 and not at all with domains 5–6, although an interaction with MNK domains 5–6 has been detected by surface plasmon resonance (33Strausak D. Howie M.K. Firth S.D. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Multhaup G. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20821-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These interactions are metal-dependent and specific for copper. Taken together, these data suggest that the six domains play discrete roles in the function and regulation of WND. The metal-binding domains most important for interaction with Atox1 (domains 1–4) are clearly distinct from those required for copper transport (domains 5–6). Domains 1–4 of WND have also been proposed to function in copper-responsive localization (27Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although all six metal-binding domains can bind copper (22Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), their copper-binding affinities are not known. Furthermore, the copper-binding affinity of Atox1 has not been reported. Such quantitative data are crucial to understanding the functions of individual domains. We have used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the association constant (Ka) and stoichiometry (n) values of Cu(I) binding to the WND metal-binding domains and to Atox1. These data provide new insight into the energetics of copper transfer and into how the individual functions of the WND domains are defined. Protein Cloning and Expression—Plasmids containing the cDNA for the entire WND and for Atox1 were generously supplied by Dr. Jonathan Gitlin (Washington University School of Medicine). Individual constructs comprising domains 1–2 (WD12), domains 3–4 (WD34), domains 5–6 (WD56), domains 1–4 (WD14), and domains 1–6 (WD16) were generated by PCR using the primers listed in Table I. The PCR products for the WND proteins were gel-purified and inserted into the pET32 Xa/LIC vector following the ligation independent cloning protocol from Novagen. This vector includes an N-terminal thioredoxin tag followed by a His6 tag, a thrombin cleavage site, an S-tag, and a Factor Xa cleavage site. Plasmids were then transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells for induction tests. The primers for Atox1 incorporate an NdeI sequence at the N terminus and a stop codon and EcoRI sequence at the C terminus. The Atox1 PCR product was gel-purified and cloned into the pET21b vector (Novagen) using conventional methods.Table IPrimersPrimerSequenceWD14, WD16aWD16 refers to a polypeptide consisting of all six metal-binding domains.

Open table in a new tab For the expression of WD12, WD34, WD56, and WD14, a single colony was used to inoculate a 50- or 100-ml culture of LB medium containing 1 mg/ml carbenicillin and 0.4 mg/ml chloramphenicol (LB/carb/chlor). After incubating overnight, 8 ml of this culture was used to inoculate multiple 2-liter flasks containing 1 liter of LB/carb/chlor, and these flasks were incubated at 250 rpm and 37 °C. When the optical density at 600 nm (A600) reached 0.6–0.8, protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.9–1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Three hours later cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min and stored at –80 °C. The procedure for WD16 was similar, but the temperature was reduced to 16 °C at an A600 of ∼0.3. Protein expression was induced with 0.9 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.7–0.9, and the cells were harvested after 20 h. This protocol was necessary for optimal solubility of WD16. Atox1 was expressed using the same procedures as for WD12, WD34, WD56, and WD14 except that chloramphenicol was not included in the medium. Protein Purification—For purification of WD12, WD34, WD56, and WD14, cells were thawed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol (buffer A). EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) and a small amount of solid DNase I were added, and protein was extracted with stirring for 30 min to 1 h at room temperature. This solution was then centrifuged at 9000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied to a 20-ml pre-equilibrated, nickel-loaded chelating-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), rinsed with buffer A, and eluted with an 8-column volume gradient of 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl (buffer B). For WD12, WD34, and WD56, fractions containing the tagged protein of interest were pooled and dialyzed versus 2 liters of buffer A overnight at 4 °C to remove excess imidazole. To cleave all three affinity tags, 200 units of Factor Xa (Novagen) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 18 °C for 16 h. At this point, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to stop the proteolytic cleavage. For WD14, the tagged protein from the nickel column was concentrated, cleaved with 100 units of Factor Xa, and then diluted to remove excess imidazole. Cleavage reactions were reloaded onto the nickel column, rinsed with buffer A, and eluted with a 6-column volume gradient into buffer B. Cleaved protein without the tags eluted at ∼24 mm imidazole except WD14 and WD16, which required up to 90 mm imidazole, whereas the uncleaved, tagged protein and the cleaved tags eluted at ∼150 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the cleaved protein were concentrated with a Centriprep 10 (Amicon) to 5 ml, loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with buffer A. For WD14, 1 mm EDTA and 5 mm dithiothreitol were added to buffer A for this step. Fractions >95% pure by SDS-PAGE were pooled, concentrated to 10 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in small aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. The purification of WD16 was performed according to the same procedures, with the following modifications to prevent proteolysis and protein precipitation. First, 500 μl of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture in Me2SO (Sigma) was added during the extraction step. Second, fractions from the nickel column were eluted into test tubes containing buffer A supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, diluting the fractions 1:1. Third, excess imidazole was removed using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Finally, the Factor Xa cleavage was carried out for just 12 h. For all proteins, successful removal of the three affinity tags was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis using a Bruker Reflex III instrument in the Mass Spectrometry Facility, Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona. Molecular masses of 17,882.3 kDa for WD12 (predicted 17,668.6 kDa), 21,424.3 kDa for WD34 (predicted 21,343.8 kDa), 16,436.5 kDa for WD56 (predicted 16,433.4 kDa), and 66,981.6 kDa for WD16 (predicted 67,496.9 kDa) were obtained. Purification of Atox1 was initiated by three rounds of freezing and thawing the cells followed by extraction into 500 ml of 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, for 1 h. The cell extract was centrifuged at 9000 × g for 50 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto an S column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 3-column volume gradient into 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 500 mm NaCl. The protein was then concentrated to 20 ml with a Centricon Plus-20 5000 molecular weight cut off (Amicon), applied in 3-ml aliquots to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column, and eluted with 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Measurements—Starting stock solution protein concentrations were measured using extinction coefficients at 280 nm, determined by amino acid hydrolysis (WD12, 25,588 m–1 cm–1; WD34, 7421 m–1 cm–1; WD56, 4140 m–1 cm–1; WD16, 36,554 m–1 cm–1; WD14, 19,840 m–1 cm–1; and Atox1, 3884 m–1 cm–1). Protein was concentrated or diluted to 50 μm in 3-ml amounts, and 10 mm EDTA was added. This stock protein solution was incubated for 30 min on ice and then transferred to a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce) with a 3000-Da molecular mass cutoff. After three successive rounds of dialysis versus 500 ml of chelexed 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.6 mm tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine, the concentration of EDTA was estimated to be ∼0.36 μm. The sample was then transferred to a Coy anaerobic chamber and dialyzed three times versus 500 ml degassed, chelexed 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 100 mm NaCl (buffer M), at which point the concentration of tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine was estimated to be ∼130 pm. After this treatment, the residual copper content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnalyst 700 with a high performance flame (detection limit for copper, 1.5 ppb) and copper lumina hollow cathode lamp. A standard curve was generated using a copper atomic absorption standard (Aldrich). All the samples contained ∼30 ppb copper as did buffer M. Taking into account the protein concentration, the average copper content prior to the ITC experiments was 0.03, 0.04, 0.06, 0.05, 0.03, and 0.09 copper ions per protein molecule for Atox1, WD12, WD34, WD56, WD14, and WD16, respectively. The number of reduced cysteines was measured using the thiol and sulfide quantitation kit from Molecular Probes. A stock solution of 9 mm CuCl in 10 mm HCl and 1.0 m NaCl was degassed extensively on a vacuum line, backfilled with argon, and stored in the anaerobic chamber. The concentration of this stock solution was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopic analysis by Galbraith Laboratories (Knoxville, TN). For all copper-binding experiments both protein and copper stock solutions were diluted with buffer M immediately before the run. Appropriate protein and copper concentrations for each titration were determined empirically and ranged from 3 to 25 μm protein and 250 to 600 μm Cu(I). Samples were checked by dynamic light scattering to ensure that the addition of Cu(I) did not cause aggregation. A sample of the diluted protein was set aside to determine the final concentration for each experiment. Because the protein concentration was too low to measure the absorbance at 280 nm, the enhanced bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) was used. The protein was removed from the anaerobic chamber in a 2.5-ml Hamilton gas-tight syringe and loaded into the calorimeter (MicroCal) sample cell under a constant pool of high grade pure argon. The Cu(I) solution was then loaded into a 250-μl titration syringe in the anaerobic chamber and transferred to the calorimeter chamber under argon gas. At this point, the experiment was initiated. In a typical run, an automated sequence of 30 injections of 6–10 μl of Cu(I) were applied to the protein in the sample cell with 6 min between injections to allow equilibration. The reaction solution was stirred at 300 rpm, and the temperature of the chamber was maintained at 22 °C, working against a surrounding water bath temperature of 15 °C. All experiments were repeated at least three times. All data were analyzed with the Origin 5.0 software package from MicroCal, using either a one- or two-site-binding model. A background correction was applied to each experiment, corresponding to the average of the last four injections. This value was consistent with control experiments in which the Cu(I) solution was titrated into buffer alone. After subtraction of this heat of dilution, a nonlinear least squares method was used to minimize χ2 values and obtain best fit parameters for the number of binding sites, n, the association constant, Ka, and the change in enthalpy, ΔH°. The specificity of copper binding was addressed by two additional negative controls. First, Mg(II) was titrated into both Atox1 (20 μm) and WD12 (10 μm) using 300 μm MgCl2 prepared in the same buffer as the Cu(I) stock solution. Second, Cu(I) was titrated into 20–35 μm solutions of lysozyme (14,296 kDa, Research Organics). These controls were performed in triplicate under the same conditions used for Atox1 and the WND proteins. ITC is an excellent technique for determining the thermodynamic properties of a reaction under defined solution conditions. Measuring the heat generated or absorbed on ligand binding to a protein can yield values for the stoichiometry, n, as well as for Ka, ΔH°, ΔG°, and ΔS°. To obtain useful ITC data, every aspect of the experiment must be considered carefully (35O'Brien R.E.L.J. Chowdhry B.Z. Harding S.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Protein-ligand Interactions: Hydrodynamics and Calorimetry. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001: 263-285Google Scholar, 36Pierce M.K. Raman C.S. Nall B.T. Methods. 1999; 19: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Studies of WND and Atox1 are further complicated by the presence of multiple cysteine residues, oxidation of which can cause aggregation, and by the air sensitivity and low solubility of Cu(I). As described above, we have developed protocols for preparing both the protein sample and the Cu(I) titrant solution for loading the calorimeter cell and for conducting the titration anaerobically. The validity of these procedures was tested by titrating Mg(II) into Atox1 (Fig. 2) and WD12, which do not bind Mg(II), and by titrating Cu(I) into lysozyme (Fig. 3), which does not bind Cu(I) specifically. None of these control experiments showed specific Cu(I) binding. By contrast, we obtained interpretable and reproducible data for Cu(I) binding to the WND metal-binding domains and Atox1. In each experiment, titrations of Cu(I) into solutions of metal-free, reduced protein resulted in large exothermic peaks, which eventually diminished to just the heat of dilution (see Figs. 4,5,6,7,8,9).Fig. 3Calorimetric titration of lysozyme with Cu(I).

Some studies have revealed a few possible autophosphorylation sites of RET by [32P]phosphopeptide mapping or by using specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. To ultimately identify these and other autophosphorylation sites of RET, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of an originally prepared RET recombinant protein. Both the autophosphorylation and kinase activity of myelin basic protein as an external substrate of the recombinant RET protein were substantially elevated in the presence of ATP without stimulation by a glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, a natural ligand for RET. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that RET Tyr806, Tyr809, Tyr900, Tyr905, Tyr981, Tyr1062, Tyr1090, and Tyr1096 were autophosphorylation sites. Levels of autophosphorylation and kinase activity of RET-MEN2A (multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A), a constitutively active form of RET with substitution of Tyr900 by phenylalanine (Y900F), were comparable with those of original RET-MEN2A, whereas those of the mutant Y905F were greatly decreased. Interestingly, those of a double mutant, Y900F/Y905F, were completely abolished. Both the kinase activity and transforming activity were impaired in the mutants Y806F and Y809F. These results provide convincing evidence for both previously suggested and new tyrosine autophosphorylation sites of RET as well as for novel functions of Tyr806, Tyr809, and Tyr900 phosphorylation in both catalytic kinase activities and cell growth.

The catalytic activity of PTKs is known to be regulated either positively or negatively by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at specified tyrosine residues. RET is a proto-oncogene that encodes a receptor-type PTK with a cadherin-related motif and a cysteine-rich domain in the extracellular domain (1Takahashi M. Buma Y. Iwamoto T. Inaguma Y. Ikeda H.

The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs), including GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin, are involved in the survival and differentiation of neurons via activation of RET (11Lin L.F.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 245-253Google Scholar). Unlike most other receptor-type PTKs, RET is not activated via direct binding of GFLs but is activated by the formation of a multicomponent receptor complex that includes glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface proteins called GFRαs, which bind GFLs directly. Four members of the family of GFRαs (GFRα1 to -4) have been identified, and it has been shown that they bind GFLs with high affinity. GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin use GFRα1, GFRα2, GFRα3, and GFRα4, respectively, as preferred ligand-binding receptors (11Lin L.F. Doherty D.H. Lile J.D. Bektesh S. Collins F.

RET can activate various signaling pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways, responsible for cell survival or differentiation (15Besset V.

Upon ligand binding, RET forms dimers and is phosphorylated at a specific tyrosine residue(s) in intracellular domains. RET has been shown to be alternatively spliced to produce three isoforms (short, middle, and long isoforms) that differ in C-terminal residues (19Tahira T. Ishizaka Y. Itoh F. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 97-102Google Scholar, 20Myers S.M. Eng C. Ponder B.A. Mulligan L.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2039-2045Google Scholar). RET short and middle isoforms contain 16 tyrosine residues in their intracellular domains, and RET long isoforms have two additional tyrosines in the C-terminal tail. Among these tyrosines, Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096 are thought to be phosphorylated to become binding sites for GRB7/GRB10, phospholipase Cγ, SHC/SNT(FRS2)/Enigma, and GRB2, respectively (21Pandey A.

For neuronal signal transduction, one model has suggested that GFRα functions to mediate localization of RET to a lipid raft, a sphingolipid, and cholesterol-rich lipid microdomain in the plasma membrane. GFRα stimulation via GDNF induces not only RET dimerization but also RET/Src association at the raft, and RET can be phosphorylated by activated Src kinase (27Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J.

In addition to endogenous ligands, oxidative agents such as H2O2, NO, HgCl2, and ultraviolet rays are known to increase the levels of catalytic activity of various PTKs, including Src (29Akhand A.A.

Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 473-482Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that Cys987, which is in the kinase domain of RET, plays a critical role in the up-regulation of kinase activity upon stimulation by an oxidative agent (37Kato M. Iwashita T. Takeda K. Akhand A.A. Liu W. Yoshihara M. Asai N. Suzuki H. Takahashi M. Nakashima I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 93-101Google Scholar, 38Takeda K. Kato M. Wu J. Iwashita T. Suzuki H. Takahashi M. Nakashima I. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 473-482Google Scholar). It is known that some cysteine residues, including Cys987 of RET or its equivalents, are widely conserved among a number of receptor-type and nonreceptor-type PTKs and some serine/threonine kinases (39Veillette A. Dumont S. Fournel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17547-17553Google Scholar). By analyzing amino acid sequences of various PTKs registered in a data base, we found that Cys987 exists in the motif sequence of Met-X-X-Cys-Trp (MXXCW), which is located in the C-end of α-helix H in the kinase domain (40Nakashima I. Takeda K. Kawamoto Y. Okuno Y. Kato M. Akhand A. Suzuki H. The Proceedings of XI Biennial Meeting of the Society for Free Radical Research International. Monduzzi Editore S.p.A.-Medimond Inc., Bologna, Italy2002: 229-234Google Scholar), and that this motif initially turns on the Tyr905-dependent local switch of RET kinase for activation through oxidation of Cys987 in the MXXCW motif (40Nakashima I. Takeda K. Kawamoto Y. Okuno Y. Kato M. Akhand A. Suzuki H. The Proceedings of XI Biennial Meeting of the Society for Free Radical Research International. Monduzzi Editore S.p.A.-Medimond Inc., Bologna, Italy2002: 229-234Google Scholar). Thus, after accumulation of RET proteins on the plasma membrane induced by ligand or potentially by oxidative stimulation, autophosphorylation that leads to kinase activation and downstream signaling will occur. The tyrosine residues Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096 in activated RET were suggested to be autophosphorylated in earlier studies by phosphopeptide mapping (41Liu X. Vega Q.C. Decker R.A. Pandey A. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5309-5312Google Scholar) or by using a specific antibody recognizing phosphotyrosine (42Coulpier M. Anders J. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1991-1999Google Scholar). Results of studies using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody also suggested that Tyr905 is an autophosphorylation site (43Salvatore D. Barone M.V. Salvatore G.

Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34618-34625Google Scholar). However, tyrosine residues in RET protein were not identified as autophosphorylation sites in earlier studies by reliable methods. In this study, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of purified recombinant RET proteins in order to determine RET autophosphorylation sites in the purified RET protein activated by ATP, and we found that Tyr806, Tyr809, Tyr900, Tyr905, Tyr981, Tyr1062, Tyr1090, and Tyr1096 are bona fide autophosphorylation sites that are actually autophosphorylated. Phosphorylation of Tyr806, Tyr809, Tyr900, Tyr981, and Tyr1090 in RET is reported here for the first time. Furthermore, this study demonstrated for the first time that Tyr806, Tyr809, and Tyr900, which are relatively highly conserved in a number of PTKs registered in a data base, play roles additional or supplemental to the role of Tyr905 in catalytic activity. Cell Culture—Murine NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells were grown in Grace's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Construction of Recombinant Baculoviruses—A cDNA clone containing the entire sequence of the human c-RET gene inserted into the Rc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) was digested by EcoRI and NotI ultimately to make glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused plasma membrane and extracellular regions-deleted RET, and then a 1.6-kb fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of a baculovirus transfer vector, pAcGHLT™ (Pharmingen). The transfer vector was then co-transfected with linearized BaculGold™ (Pharmingen) DNA into Sf21 cells to generate a baculovirus that can produce a primary recombinant GST-fused deletion RET protein, designated GST-ΔRET. The GST-ΔRET baculovirus was then amplified and maintained in Grace's insect medium at 4 °C until used for infection of Sf21 cells to generate large amounts of recombinant proteins. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cDNA encoding human RET-MEN2A with substitution of cysteine 634 by arginine in c-RET was prepared as described previously (28Kato M. Takeda K. Kawamoto Y. Iwashita T. Akhand A.A. Senga T. Yamamoto M. Sobue G. Hamaguchi M. Takahashi M. Nakashima I. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2414-2422Google Scholar). The RET-MEN2A gene was subcloned into the APtag-1 plasmid vector containing the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. RET-MEN2A single mutants, Y806F, Y809F, Y900F, and Y905F, and double mutants, Y806F/Y809F and Y900F/Y905F, were prepared by using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm the introductions of mutations, the plasmids were sequenced by a DNA sequencer ABI prism (Applied Biosystems). Purification and Characterization of GST-ΔRET—We purified GST-ΔRET recombinant protein generated by the baculovirus system by using GSH-agarose beads. The kinase activity of the purified GST-ΔRET was measured by using an ELISA-based tyrosine kinase activity kit (Chemicon International) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the purified GST-ΔRET bound to GSH-agarose beads was incubated in the absence or presence of ATP (1 mm) in kinase buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 30 mm NaCl) with a synthetic biotinylated peptide substrate (poly(Glu:Tyr), 4:1) at 30 °C for 20 min. The enzyme reaction was terminated by adding 24 mm EDTA, and the peptide substrate samples in the supernatant were then transferred to streptavidin-coated wells, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. After blocking the wells with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was added to the wells, and then tetramethylbenzidine as an horseradish peroxidase substrate was added. Finally, absorbance of sample wells was measured at A450. The residual GST-ΔRET samples that bound to GSH-agarose beads after ATP reaction were mixed with 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting as described below. Preparation of Phosphopeptides of GST-ΔRET—GST-ΔRET bound to GSH-agarose beads (20-30 μg) was washed with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2) four times and incubated in the absence or presence of ATP (1 mm) in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. The ATP-treated purified protein was washed three times with digestion buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8) followed by overnight digestion at 24 °C in the presence of Glu-C endoproteinase (8 ng/μl) (Roche Applied Science) or at 37 °C in the presence of sequencing grade modified trypsin (8 ng/μl) (Promega). The collected phosphopeptides were then incubated in the presence or absence of phosphatases, leukocyte antigen-related phosphatase (30 min at 30 °C, in reaction buffer; 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) or protein phosphatase 1 (30 min at 30 °C, in reaction buffer; 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Tween 20, 1 mm MnCl2) (New England BioLabs). Identification of Tyrosine Autophosphorylation Sites by Mass Spectrometry—The sample peptides were desalted by using C18 Zip Tip (Millipore Corp.), eluted in α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution containing 50% acetonitrile and 3% folic acid, and then analyzed by using a Voyager Elite MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) operated in the positive ion reflectron mode. For molecular mass determination of GST-ΔRET peptides, two-point external calibration based on angiotensin II (m/z 1046.54) and ACTH fragment peptide 18-39 (m/z 2465.20) was used. For ion trap mass spectrometric analysis, a mixture of protease-digested peptides was desalted with C18 Zip Tip and eluted in 98% acetonitrile solution containing 0.1% formic acid. The eluate was mixed with the same volume of 2% acetonitrile solution containing 0.1% formic acid, and then the sample was directly infused at 1 μl/min into an ion trap mass spectrometer, LCQ Advantage (Thermo Electron). The MS/MS spectra were analyzed by using the MS/MS ion searching program of MASCOT (Matrix Science; available on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com) and BioworksBrowser (version 3.0) (Thermo Electron) to assign individual mass signals, and then amino acid sequences were determined. Molecular Modeling—Primary amino acid sequences of human PTK family proteins were obtained from the SWISS-PROT protein data base. The tertiary structure of RET was simulated and determined using FAMS, a homology modeling software program, originally produced by H. Umeyama at Kitasato University, based on the tertiary structure of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 elucidated by x-ray diffraction. Subsequently, the structure was visualized with WebLab ViewerLite 3.20 software (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Western blotting was performed according to the method described previously (45Kato M. Takeda K. Kawamoto Y. Tsuzuki T. Dai Y. Nakayama S. Toriyama K. Tamada Y. Takahashi M. Nakashima I. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7536-7541Google Scholar). An anti-RET rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes both a 175-kDa form (a mature glycosylated form) and a 155-kDa form (an immature glycosylated form) of RET was produced as described previously (46Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T. Isomura T. Miyazaki K. Matsuyama M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2925-2929Google Scholar). The GST-ΔRET samples or the lysates (20 μg/lane) of NIH3T3 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 8% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then reacted with a first anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-RET antibody for 12 h at 4 °C followed by reaction with a second anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The levels of the phosphotyrosine or the RET protein signal were detected by Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and densitometry analysis was performed by using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitation and an in vitro RET kinase assay were performed as described previously (47Kato M. Liu W. Akhand A.A. Dai Y. Ohbayashi M. Tuzuki T. Suzuki H. Isobe K. Takahashi M. Nakashima I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 837-842Google Scholar). Briefly, RET proteins were immunoprecipitated with Protein A beads (Pierce) and washed three times with lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4). The immunoprecipitated RET proteins were washed three times with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2), suspended in the kinase buffer with 2 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) as an exogenous substrate, and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (370 kBq) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The kinase reaction was carried out for 20 min in a 30 °C water bath and was terminated by adding 2× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerin) with 2-mercaptoethanol. The immunoprecipitates were then boiled for 5 min and loaded on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to Imaging Plate (Fuji photo film), and the radioactive signals were detected by using a Typhoon 8600 imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry analysis of signal levels of phosphorylated MBP was performed by using Scion image software. Transformation Assay—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2A mutant cDNAs, and several G418-resistant cell clones were isolated. Trypsinized 1 × 105 cells were mixed with 2 ml of 0.36% soft agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, poured onto slightly solid 0.72% hard agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2 weeks. The number of aggregated cell foci in a dish was counted, and colony-forming efficiency (percentage = (number of colonies)/(number of seeded cells) × 100) was calculated. Identification of Tyrosine Autophosphorylation Sites—In order to investigate the autophosphorylation sites in the intracellular domain of RET, we made a deletion mutant RET gene in which the plasma membrane and extracellular regions were deleted (designated as ΔRET). We then connected glutathione S-transferase (GST) with the N terminus of ΔRET (Fig. 1) and constructed a baculovirus protein expression system. Silver staining was performed to evaluate the purity of GST-ΔRET. As shown in Fig. 2A, GST-ΔRET protein was highly purified but was contaminated by a small amount of endogenous GST, as shown by Western blotting using an anti-GST antibody (data not shown). By Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that might be coprecipitated with GST-ΔRET was observed at about 40 kDa. Since there in no known tyrosine kinase of less than 40 kDa, we assumed that non-PTK phosphoproteins were phosphorylated by GST-ΔRET and that any phosphorylation that newly occurred in vitro with purified GST-ΔRET resulted from autophosphorylation. Next, the levels of autophosphorylation of GST-ΔRET were examined by an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, both levels of autophosphorylation of purified GST-ΔRET and tyrosine phosphorylation of the synthetic substrate peptide were greatly increased when ATP was added to the in vitro kinase system, and these increases were prevented by treating the sample with λ-protein phosphatase before the addition of ATP. These results suggested that the recombinant RET has an enhanced activity in vitro for autophosphorylation in the absence of any ligands and can be used for analyzing tyrosine autophosphorylation sites.Fig. 2Autophosphorylation of purified recombinant RET protein. A, GST-ΔRET was purified by using GSH-agarose beads and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with or without ATP (1 mm) in kinase buffer containing MgCl2. These samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining for the detection of overall proteins and by Western blotting (IB) for the detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. B, in vitro kinase assay was performed with ATP-treated or untreated purified GST-ΔRET for determination of the levels of PTK activity to phosphorylate a synthetic substrate (B-1) and of autophosphorylation (B-2) according to the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” A portion of the sample (right lane) was treated with λ-protein phosphatase (λ-PPase) (100 units) for 30 min at 37 °C. Sodium orthovanadate (0.5 mm) was added to the λ-protein phosphatase-treated sample to inhibit the phosphatase activity prior to the addition of ATP. Quantitation of the tyrosine phosphorylation level of GST-ΔRET was performed by using Scion Image software. Data represent means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We extracted phosphorylated peptides from in vitro autophosphorylation-promoted GST-ΔRET that had been treated with Glu-C endoprotease. The samples were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to identify the phosphorylated peptides derived from GST-ΔRET. Because of the negative charge of phosphate groups, phosphopeptides exhibit low response to mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode. Nevertheless, several substantial intensities of mass spectra corresponding to phosphorylated peptides containing tyrosine residue(s) from the Glu-C endoproteinase-treated GST-ΔRET were obtained: Tyr806 + Tyr809 as 1718.53, Tyr900 as 2209.59, Tyr905 as 2343.69, Tyr981 as 3419.05, and Tyr1062 as"
https://openalex.org/W2064147082,"Abnormal regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation is thought to be involved in tumor formation. The secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) was detected in primary culture of canine mammary gland tumors but not in normal mammary tissues. Thus, to elucidate the role of SFRP2 in mammary tumorigenesis, we overexpressed SFRP2 in mammary gland tumor and MCF7 cells. The results indicated that SFRP2 is secreted and incorporated into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor and normal cells. In an attempt to understand the molecular basis underlying the interaction between SFRP2 and ECM, co-immunoprecipitation and cell adhesion assays were carried out. SFRP2 was found to be associated with the fibronectin-integrin protein complex and could promote cell adhesion. DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activity analyses showed that the susceptibility of the cells to UV-induced apoptosis decreased in the context of SFRP2 overexpression. Upon disruption of the fibronectin-integrin connection, the antiapoptosis activity of SFRP2 was decreased. Moreover, SFRP2 was found to induce tumorous transformation in normal mammary epithelial cells and to inhibit apoptosis in a modified paracrine model. Collectively, our results emphasize the relevance of SFRP2 and ECM in mammary tumorigenesis and provide further insight into the mechanism of SFRP2 action.

Such studies will undoubtedly provide important new insights into the cellular factors involved in tumorigenesis. Moreover homeostasis in normal tissue is regulated by a balance between proliferative activity and cell loss by apoptosis (1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar, 2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar). Dislodging cell-cell contacts and morphological changes pertaining to imbalance in the cell-cell adhesion complex are some of the features of the apoptotic cells (3Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The process of apoptosis is integral to normal mammary gland development (4Medina D. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The results of some studies suggested that cells derived from human cancers have a decreased capacity in undergoing apoptosis in response to various physiological stimuli (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar, 5Carson D.A. Ribeiro J.M. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1251-1254Abstract PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Thus, deregulation of apoptosis, with the potential consequence of cell survival and drug resistance enhancement, may lead to the development of breast cancer (6Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Adam L. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Wnt/Frizzled-mediated β-catenin/Tcf transcription is an important survival pathway (7Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In recent studies, Wnt signaling has been demonstrated to be involved in the specification of cell fate, polarity and proliferation, tissue patterning, apoptosis, and onset of neoplasia (8Huguet E.L. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2615-2621PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dale T.C. Weber-Hall S.J. Smith K. Huguet E.L. Jayatilake H. Gusterson B.A. Shuttleworth G. O'Hare M. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4320-4323PubMed Google Scholar). Existing evidence indicates that the Frizzled family of integral membrane proteins acts as Wnt receptors. Greater complexity in the Wnt signaling has emerged with the discovery of a family of secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs). Seven SFRPs have been identified to date (10Jones S.E. Jomary C. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). They are secreted glycoproteins containing an N-terminal domain that is typically ∼30–50% identical to the putative Wnt-binding site of the Frizzled receptor (11Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Varmus H.E. Rubin J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6770-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Melkonyan H.S. Chang W.C. Shapiro J.P. Mahedevappa M. Fitzpatrick P.A. Kiefer M.C. Tomei L.D. Urmansky S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13636-13641Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal heparin-binding domain with weak homology to netrins (proteins involved in axonal guidance) (13Leyns L. Bouwmeester T. Kim S.H. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 747-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 14Wang S. Krinks M. Lin K. Luyten F.P. Moos Jr., M. Cell. 1997; 88: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Both domains are cysteine-rich, having 10 and 6 cysteine residues in the Frizzled-like and heparin-binding domains, respectively. In our study on the tumorigenesis of canine mammary gland tumors (MGTs), we have found that a member of the SFRP family, SFRP2, is highly induced in canine MGTs (15Lee J.-L. Chang C.-J. Wu S.-Y. Sargan D.R. Lin C.-T. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). SFRP2 can serve as a modulator of Wnt signaling and is involved in the development and progression of cancer (16Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). During development, it was found that SFRP2 is expressed in spatially restricted patterns in the telencephalon, diencephalon, spinal cord, and ventral thalamus and that their expression is reduced in Pax-6 mutants but not in Dlx-1/Dlx-2 mutants (17Kim A.S. Anderson S.A. Rubenstein J.L.R. Lowenstein D.H. Pleasure S.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21 (1–5): RC132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly SFRP2 is abundantly expressed in quiescent uterine stromal cells but is down-regulated by estrogens (18Das S.K. Tan J. Raja S. Halder J. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28834-28842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). During disease or cancer progression, up-regulation of SFRP2 in the retinas of retinitis pigmentosa may reflect an antiapoptotic response (19Jones S.E. Jomary C. Grist J. Stewart H.J. Neal M.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1297-1301PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of transfected SFRP2 in breast adenocarcinoma cells increased their resistance to apoptotic signals and was associated with increased intracellular levels of β-catenin (12Melkonyan H.S. Chang W.C. Shapiro J.P. Mahedevappa M. Fitzpatrick P.A. Kiefer M.C. Tomei L.D. Urmansky S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13636-13641Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). SFRP2 overexpression could inhibit glioma cell motility and was associated with down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity (20Roth W. Wild-Bode C. Platten M. Grimmel C. Melkonyan H.S. Dichgans J. Weller M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4210-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The exact role of SFRP2 in mammary tumorigenesis is currently unknown. SFRPs are processed through the secretory pathway but remain associated with cells. In the presence of heparin, SFRP can be released into the medium (21Bafico A. Gazit A. Pramila T. Finch P.W. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16180-16187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to test the possible interaction of SFRP2 with the ECM. We demonstrated that their interaction can transduce an antiapoptotic signal in mammary cancer cells. Moreover, SFRP2 was also found to induce normal mammary epithelial cell tumorous transformation and to inhibit apoptosis in the modified paracrine model. Primary Culture from Canine MGTs—Surgically resected specimens were collected from the freshly excised specimens. Primary culture was prepared by a mechanical technique instead of enzymatic digestion as described previously (22Lee J.L. Chang C.J. Chueh L.L. Lin C.T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2003; 35: 221-227Crossref Google Scholar). After agar and dilution cloning, purified cancer cells were plated on a 25T flask and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cancer cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah). The cells were subcultured at subconfluency by harvesting with 0.05% trypsin, EDTA. The cells of primary culture tested positive for cytokeratin 8 and 18, ensuring that they were not fibroblasts. Primary culture from canine MGTs was termed “MPG,” while that from canine normal mammary tissue was termed “NMG” (22Lee J.L. Chang C.J. Chueh L.L. Lin C.T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2003; 35: 221-227Crossref Google Scholar). Expression Plasmids and Antibodies—The canine homologue of SFRP2 cDNA was first isolated and cloned from a specifically expressed gene population of a canine subtractive retinal cDNA library (23Lin C.T. Sargan D.R Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4427-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 24Lin C.T. Sargan D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Full-length canine SFRP2 cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-Taq4 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) where C-terminal FLAG-tagged SFRP2 is under control of the CMV promoter and can be selected by neomycin resistance. The rabbit polyclonal anti-SFRP2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse monoclonal anti-FN and the goat polyclonal anti-integrin α5β1 antibodies were purchased form Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Cell Culture and Stably Transfected Cells Lines—MPG and MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After selection in G418 (1.0 mg/ml), the transfected cells were cloned by limited dilution. The clones expressing FLAG-tagged SFRP2 were expanded and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (200 μg/ml). Preparation of Secreted Proteins, ECM Components, and ECM-associated Proteins—The media from cell culture were concentrated by centrifuging at 7,500 × g for 15 min using Vivaspin6 concentrators (VIVA Science, Hannover, Germany). For experiments of adhesion assay, ECM materials derived from the cultured cells were extracted overnight at 4 °C in 2 m urea and 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The soluble materials were dialyzed against PBS and used to coat plates. To determine the affinity of the ECM association of SFRP2, the confluent cell layers were released from the culture dishes by incubating with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. The remaining ECM components were extracted with 0.5 or 1 m NaCl at room temperature for 10 min and 0.05 or 0.1 mg/ml soluble heparin at 37 °C for 30 min. The ECM components remaining on the culture dishes were washed and extracted with 1× SDS Laemmli sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The details were performed essentially as described previously (25Xu Y. Yu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34990-34998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting— Cells were grown to ∼80% confluence, washed with PBS, and scraped into 100 μl of lysis buffer. For experiments with blocking antibody (integrin α5β1, 0.1 mg/ml) or soluble heparin (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma), cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The details of immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described previously (26Chang C.J. Chen Y.L. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5880-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid difficult extraction of insoluble FN by routine immunoprecipitation lysis buffer, the cells were preincubated with soluble FN (Invitrogen) for 1 h. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Insoluble material (cell debris) was discarded by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates were divided to ensure that each aliquot was derived from an equal number of cells. For immunoprecipitation analysis, 1 mg of whole cell extracts was precleaned with preimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose in 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol) at 4 °C for 2 h. The precleaned supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of anti-SFRP2 or anti-FN antibody and protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 90 min. After extensive washes, the protein complex was dissolved in SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated polypeptides were blotted onto a Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with anti-SFRP2, anti-FN, or anti-integrin α5β1 antibody. The results were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Colony-forming Efficiency Assay—First 1.0 × 103 cells in 2 ml of the standard culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum with 0.3% agar were laid on a 1-ml basal layer of 1% agar in 35-mm Petri dishes. After 1 week, 0.4 ml of fresh medium was added, and colony formation was determined on Day 14. The details were performed essentially as described previously (27Schleger C. Heck R. Niketeghad F. Schirmacher P. Radaeva S. Oesch F. Dienes H.P. Bannasch P. Steinberg P. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was assessed using a standard MTT assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Typically 103 cells were plated into each well in 96-well plates. Details of the assay were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The premixed, optimized dye solution was added to each well. After a 4-h incubation, the solubilization/stop solution was then added to the culture wells to resolve the formazan product. Relative concentrations of formazan were determined by quantifying the optical absorbance at 570 nm using a control wavelength of 690 nm in an automatic plate reader. UV Irradiation and DNA Laddering Assay—For UV irradiation, cells were plated on a 60-mm culture dish in growth media. The medium was reduced to 1 ml/dish, and culture dishes were uncovered in a UV cross-linker (model HL-2000, UVP Laboratory Products, Upland, CA) as described previously (28Chan P.C. Lai J.F. Cheng C.H. Tang M.J. Chiu C.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For experiments with blocking antibody (integrin α5β1, 0.1 mg/ml) or heparin (0.1 mg/ml), cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min. UV irradiation was carried out with the doses of 100 and 200 J/m2. Following irradiation, 3 ml of growth medium were added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Apoptosis was determined by DNA fragmentation assays. After 24 h of incubation, the medium of cells was collected and added to the scraped cells to allow centrifugation of both adhering and floating cells. The details of DNA laddering assays were essentially as described previously (29Ruest L.B. Marcotte R. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5418-5425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Caspase 3 Assay—Caspase 3 activity assays were performed using the Caspase 3 Colorimetric Assay kit from Chemicon International, Inc.. Following counting, 106 cells were pelleted and subsequently lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer. Whole supernatant following sedimentation was incubated with 50 μl of reaction buffer supplemented with 20 μl of deionized H2O and 10 μl of the caspase 3 colorimetric substrate, Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide. Following 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, caspase 3 protease activity was measured using a spectrophotometer at 405 nm. Experiments were performed within the linear range of the assay, and absorbance reading was normalized by the protein concentration of each lysate using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Adhesion Assay—Cells were grown to ∼80% confluence, washed with PBS, and scraped into PBS. Microtiter plates (96-well) were precoated with ECM materials derived from the cultured cells or the adhesive protein 10 ng/μl FN (Invitrogen) and subsequently blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to prevent nonspecific cell adhesion. The details of the assay were essentially as described previously (30Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For the experiment with Mn2+, 2 mm MnCl2 was added into the cell suspension before the adhesion assays. To estimate the reference value for 100% attachment, cells were seeded on plates precoated with ECM materials or 20 ng/μl FN and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SFRP2 Is Incorporated into the ECM—We have cloned canine SFRP2 from retina and characterized its expression in canine MGTs (15Lee J.-L. Chang C.-J. Wu S.-Y. Sargan D.R. Lin C.-T. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 23Lin C.T. Sargan D.R Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4427-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To further study the role of SFRP2 in mammary tumorigenesis, vector encoding C-terminally FLAG-tagged SFRP2 was constructed and delivered into canine and human mammary cancer cell lines. The canine cell line MPG was isolated in our laboratory, and it has been characterized as being of epithelial origin (22Lee J.L. Chang C.J. Chueh L.L. Lin C.T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2003; 35: 221-227Crossref Google Scholar). After being selected by G418, the stable clones of MPG-F2 and MCF7-F2 were generated, and the expression of SFRP2 was analyzed by Western blotting. Fig. 1A shows that MPG cells have a basal expression of SFRP2, and a dose-dependent expression of ectopic SFRP2-FLAG protein was observed in both MPG and MCF7 cells. Furthermore the presence of SFRP2 protein can be detected in the concentrated media from the stably expressed SFRP2 cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, consistent with previous reports, SFRP2 is indeed a secreted protein. Therefore, we conclude that SFRP2 is present in both cell lysates and culture medium in our overexpressed system. In our previous study, the immunohistochemical staining result of canine MGT tissues showed that SFRP2 existed in the extracellular compartment of tumor cells and in connective tissues (15Lee J.-L. Chang C.-J. Wu S.-Y. Sargan D.R. Lin C.-T. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). One possible reason is that SFRP2 may be associated with the ECM. To further address this issue, the ECM association of SFRP2 was examined by extracting the cell-free ECM deposited on the culture dishes by SFRP2-expressing MPG cells with different concentrations of NaCl. The eluted protein and the insoluble materials after extraction were subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, most of the ECM-incorporated SFRP2 was eluted from ECM with 1.0 m NaCl; a fair amount of SFRP2 remained in the ECM after 1.0 m NaCl extraction, indicating a strong ECM association and implicating a gradual incorporation process of SFRP2 into the ECM. SFRP2 Is Associated with FN and Enhances Integrin α5β1-FN Binding Affinity—In an attempt to identify the ECM component(s) that binds to SFRP2 in vivo, immunohistochemical staining was performed. After screening 50 canine MGT tissues, the results showed that SFRP2 and FN shared identical expression profiles (data not shown). To assess the possibility of an interaction between SFRP2 and FN, the immunoprecipitated SFRP2 complexes from culture media were subjected to Western blotting using anti-FN antibody. Fig. 2A shows that the SFRP2 antibody could co-immunoprecipitate FN from MPG and MCF7 cell culture media. FN has been reported to interact with integrin receptor (31Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1985; 40: 191-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 32Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4492-4500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the signaling pathways of SFRP2, we further examined whether integrin receptor is present in the SFRP2 protein complexes. Expression of integrin α5β1 in both MPG and MCF7 cells was confirmed (Fig. 2B, the slow migrating band is α5, and the other is β1). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the anti-SFRP2 antibody revealed that FN as well as integrin α5β1 receptor associate with SFRP2 in MPG and MCF7 cells (Fig. 2C). To confirm the interaction between SFRP2 and FN, a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using anti-FN antibody. Interestingly, although the amounts of precipitated FN were nearly identical in the two cell clones, we observed that the amounts of precipitated integrin receptors were in direct proportion to those of precipitated SFRP2 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SFRP2 is an interacting component of the FN-integrin receptor protein complexes and could enhance the formation of FN-integrin receptor complexes. Expression of SFRP2 Could Promote Cell Adhesion—With the knowledge that the interaction of FN and integrin receptor promotes cell adhesion, we compared the level of cell adhesion in the presence or absence of SFRP2. As shown in Fig. 3A, MPG cells overexpressing SFRP2 displayed a stronger adherence to dishes coated with FN and whole ECM extracts derived from MPG cells than the control cells. Moreover SFRP2 could further promote cell adhesion in the presence of Mn2+, an integrin β1 receptor stimulator (33Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar), especially on dishes coated with whole ECM extracts. It is possible that, in addition to the integrin α5β1-FN pathway, the SFRP2 may promote cell adhesion through other pathways. Fig. 3B shows that overexpression of SFRP2 in MPG cells led to a significant acceleration of cell adhesion to FN at 30 min after plating. Thus, according to the results of the co-immunoprecipitation and adhesion assay, we can conclude that the stimulatory effect of SFRP2 on cell adhesion is mediated through enhancing integrin α5β1-FN binding. Overexpression of SFRP2 Results in Diminished Sensitivity to UV-induced Apoptosis—The biological consequences of SFRP2 expression on mammary tumorigenesis were evaluated by colony-forming efficiency, MTT, and apoptosis assays. The results revealed that colony-forming efficiency (Fig. 4A) and cell proliferation rate (Fig. 4B) of MPG and MCF7 cells were not significantly altered by the expression of SFRP2. To further examine the apoptosis activity of SFRP2, the stable cell lines described in Fig. 1A were exposed to UV and subjected to caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation analysis. Fig. 4C shows that the caspase 3 activity in MPG cells was decreased in the presence of SFRP2 after UV irradiation. Additionally overexpression of SFRP2 in MPG and MCF7 cells could inhibit DNA fragmentation caused by UV (Fig. 4D). We also tried to induce apoptosis by using tumor necrosis factor α or serum starvation in MPG cells, but the cells seemed to show resistance to these treatments. Thus, the UV was used as the primary means to trigger apoptosis in the following experiments. Taken together, these results demonstrated that canine SFRP2, acting in an autocrine manner, has antiapoptosis activity in mammary cancer cells. SFRP2-FN-Integrin α5β1 Interaction Is Required to Reduce Cell Susceptibility to UV-induced Apoptosis—We have provided evidence demonstrating that SFRP2 interacts with FN and that expression of SFRP2 could protect cell from UV-induced apoptosis. To examine whether the interaction of SFRP2 with FN is essential for its antiapoptosis activity, we used inhibitors to interrupt the interaction between SFRP2 and FN. Heparin has been reported to release Frizzled-related protein from the cell surface (21Bafico A. Gazit A. Pramila T. Finch P.W. Yaniv A. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16180-16187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, in the absence of soluble heparin, SFRP2 was associated abundantly with the cell debris and ECM. Conversely, in the presence of soluble heparin (0.1 mg/ml), most of the SFRP2 was released from cell debris and ECM. Anti-integrin α5β1 antibody was also used to block the interaction between ECM and integrin α5β1. An immunoprecipitation assay using anti-SFRP2 antibody was done in the presence of heparin or anti-integrin α5β1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5B, the level of FN co-immunoprecipitated with SFRP2 was decreased in the presence of heparin. In addition, anti-integrin α5β1 antibody appeared to block the association of integrin with the SFRP2-FN complexes as revealed by the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Moreover results of the caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation analysis indicated that the antiapoptosis effect of SFRP2 was abrogated in the presence of heparin or anti-integrin α5β1 antibody (Fig. 5, C and D). Collectively the results from these inhibitor studies demonstrated that proper SFRP2-FN interaction is required to suppress cell susceptibility to UV-induced apoptosis. Paracrine Activity of SFRP2 on Neighboring Normal Cells— Our previous immunohistochemical staining results of canine MGT tissues showed that the extracellular SFRP2 is especially prominent in the border between tumorous and normal mammary tissues (15Lee J.-L. Chang C.-J. Wu S.-Y. Sargan D.R. Lin C.-T. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). For further characterization of the mechanism of SFRP2 action, we next investigated whether secreted SFRP2 associates with FN and acts as a paracrine factor. In the paracrine model, we chose NMG cells, which were isolated from canine normal mammary tissues in our laboratory (22Lee J.L. Chang C.J. Chueh L.L. Lin C.T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2003; 35: 221-227Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, NMG cells expressed FN and integrin α5β1 but lacked SFRP2 expression. To assay the paracrine activity of SFRP2, the media from MPG-F2 cells stably expressing SFRP2 were added to the NMG cells. Similar to the results in Fig. 1C, SFRP2 was expectedly found to be associated with the ECM of treated NMGs and extractable by NaCl (Fig. 6B). Furthermore SFRP2-treated NMG cells also displayed an increased adherence to dishes coated with FN and whole ECM extracts derived from MPG cells as compared with cells treated in the control media (Fig. 6C). Paracrine SFRP2 Induces Tumorous Transformation and Inhibits Apoptosis in the Neighboring Normal Cells—To further probe the potential link of SFRP2 to regulation of cell growth, we performed a colony formation assay and found that paracrine SFRP2 had a stimulatory effect on the formation efficiency (Fig. 7A). Surprisingly the cell proliferation rate of NMG cells was not significantly altered by paracrine SFRP2 (Fig. 7B). In agreement with the above results (Fig. 4C), in the presence of SFRP2, the UV irradiation-induced caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation in the NMG cells were diminished (Fig. 7, C and D). Taken together, the findings presented here suggest that SFRP2, acting as either an autocrine or paracrine factor, promotes cell survival by inducing a resistance to apoptosis"
https://openalex.org/W1995517360,"In examining the protein kinase components of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) cascades that regulate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in Drosophila S2 cells, we previously found that distinct upstream kinases were involved in responses to sorbitol and lipopolysaccharide. Here we have extended that analysis to the possible MAPK kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) in the JNK pathway. Fray, a putative Drosophila MAP4K, provided a major contribution to JNK activation by sorbitol. To explore the possible link to JNK in mammalian cells, we isolated and characterized OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive 1), one of two human Fray homologs. OSR1 is a 58-kDa protein of 527 amino acids that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and cell lines. Of potential regulators surveyed, endogenous OSR1 is activated only by osmotic stresses, notably sorbitol and to a lesser extent NaCl. However, OSR1 did not increase the activity of coexpressed JNK, nor did it activate three other MAPKs, p38, ERK2, and ERK5. A two-hybrid screen implicated another Ste20p family member, the p21-activated protein kinase PAK1, as an OSR1 target. OSR1 phosphorylated threonine 84 in the N-terminal regulatory domain of PAK1. Replacement of threonine 84 with glutamate reduced the activation of PAK1 by an active form of the small G protein Cdc42, suggesting that phosphorylation by OSR1 modulates the G protein sensitivity of PAK isoforms.

Cell growth and differentiation are precisely regulated by complex systems involving protein kinase cascades. A family of these cascades contain the pleiotropic mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAP4K, MAPK kinase kinase kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEKK, MAPK/ERK kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAK, p21-activated protein kinase; GCK, germinal center kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; MBP, myelin basic protein; RT, reverse transcriptase. 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAP4K, MAPK kinase kinase kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEKK, MAPK/ERK kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAK, p21-activated protein kinase; GCK, germinal center kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; MBP, myelin basic protein; RT, reverse transcriptase. These enzymes play critical roles in transducing signals from extracellular stimuli, including hormones, growth factors, and environmental stresses, throughout the cell (1Herskowitz I.

Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The core modules of MAPK cascades are composed of three sequentially acting protein kinases, a MAPK activated by a MAPK kinase (MAP2K), which is activated by a MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K). In mammals, the most studied MAPKs are ERK1/2, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and ERK5. Ste20p is the yeast MAP4K protein that activates the MAP3K in the pheromone-responsive MAPK cascade of the budding yeast mating pathway (5Ramer S.W. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the past several years, numerous protein kinases with catalytic domains closely related to that of Ste20p have been identified and constitute the Ste20p family. Based on structure and regulation, two subfamilies have been defined, the p21-activated kinase (PAK) subfamily and the larger germinal center kinase (GCK) subfamily (7Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The PAKs include the six enzymes nearest in characteristics to Ste20p itself; each contains a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain with a small G protein binding motif. PAKs have been shown not only to activate MAPKs (primarily JNK and p38) but also to influence disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton and apoptosis (8Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T.

The GCKs are distinct from PAKs in that they have N-terminal catalytic domains followed by C-terminal putative regulatory regions without conserved G protein binding sites. The 28 known human GCK-related kinases are classified in eight subdivisions and have diverse and much less well characterized functions (7Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Some, like Ste20p and PAKs, regulate the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. Those reported to activate JNK include the GCK-IV subfamily members, MINK, NIK, HGK, TNIK; GCK-I subfamily members, GCK, HPK1, GLK; and the GCK-V subfamily member, SLK (15Dan I. Watanabe N.M.

Among novel functions that have been found, SPAK is reported to regulate the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1), and a role in cell cycle control has been inferred for Stk10, which is a novel polo-like kinase (PLK) kinase (37Dowd B.F.

We previously examined the MAPK cascade components used by two agents to stimulate JNK in Drosophila S2 cells (40Chen W. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49105-49110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To extend these studies here, we have examined the potential involvement of putative MAP4Ks in regulating Drosophila JNK. We found that when the Ste20p relative Fray was knocked down using RNA interference, JNK activity stimulated by sorbitol decreased markedly, whereas ablation of other putative MAP4Ks decreased JNK activity little (CG4527) or not at all. These results suggested that Fray was the major MAP4K regulating the JNK pathway in response to sorbitol in S2 cells. We then wished to determine whether mammalian Fray homologs were MAP4Ks upstream of JNK. The kinases most closely related to Fray in the human genome are OSR1 (oxidant stress-responsive protein 1) and SPAK (Ste20/SPS1-related, proline alanine-rich kinase). SPAK has been reported to activate p38 but not JNK (25Johnston A.M. Naselli G. Gonez L.J. Martin R.M. Harrison L.C. DeAizpurua H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4290-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Human OSR1 had been isolated but not characterized. Here, we report the characterization of human OSR1 and an initial analysis of its biochemical functions. Cloning, Subcloning, Mutagenesis, and Plasmids—Total RNA prepared from HeLa cells was subjected to RT-PCR with a pair of primers spanning the complete human OSR1 cDNA synthesized based on the sequence in the NCBI data base. The 1.6-kb RT-PCR products were cloned into the GST-tagged bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG. This plasmid was used as the template for subsequent subcloning. Full-length OSR1 cDNA was also subcloned into p3XFLAG-CMV and pCMV5-Myc. Fragments encoding OSR1-(1–433), OSR1-(1–344), OSR1-(1–291), and OSR1-(345–527) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-KG, pRSET (His6 tag), pCMV5-Myc, and pVJL11 as indicated. Kinase-dead mutants of OSR1 (OSR1KR) and fragments were generated by mutating lysine 46 in the ATP binding pocket to arginine. All constructs were transformed into the bacterial strain TG-1 and grown at 30 °C to reduce the frequency of mutations. All clones were sequenced to confirm correct amplification.

HeLa cells were grown to confluence and starved in medium with 0.5% FBS overnight. Cells on coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized in cold methanol at –20 °C for 10 min, and then incubated with anti-OSR1 U5438 antibody (1:800). After incubation with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Alexa, 1:3000), OSR1 localization was observed using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus fluorescent microscope. Preparation of Tissue and Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Cultured cells or tissues from a 13-month-old mouse (provided by David Russell, Department of Molecular Genetics) were homogenized and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was sedimented in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard.

After three washes with detergent buffer (0.25 m Tris, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) and one with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), beads were incubated with indicated substrates in 50 μl of 1× kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 μm ATP (5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate) at 30 °C for 30 min for kinase assays. Purified proteins were incubated with indicated substrates in 30 μlof1× kinase buffer at 30 °C for 30 min. One-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (47Robbins D.J.

Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—A neonatal mouse brain cDNA library (gift from Mark Henkemeyer, Center for Developmental Biology) in plasmid pGADGH was screened as described. 2B.-H. Lee, X. Min, B-e. Xu, H. Shu, S. Chen, and M. H. Cobb, submitted. MAP4Ks and Activation of JNK in S2 Cells—In an earlier study, we examined the components of the protein kinase cascades that control JNK activity in response to lipopolysaccharide and sorbitol in Drosophila S2 cells (40Chen W. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49105-49110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both agents used both of the MAP2Ks MEK4 and MEK7 to activate JNK. Although lipopolysaccharide required a single MAP3K (DTAK), sorbitol employed four MAP3Ks to stimulate JNK activity. We have completed the examination of the likely kinase components of the MAPK module by testing the potential involvement of putative MAP4Ks in regulating Drosophila JNK. Based on sequence alignments and a consideration of the published classification of the fly protein kinases (48Morrison D.K. Murakami M.S. Cleghon V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F57-F62Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), six putative MAP4Ks, CG11228, DPAK, DPAK3, DMSN, CG4527, and Fray, were found to be expressed in S2 cells as determined by PCR analysis (data not shown). The expression of each of these was reduced using RNA interference, and the effect of the loss of each singly on activation of JNK by sorbitol was then examined (Fig. 1, A and B; data not shown). When expression of Fray, a Drosophila GCK-VI kinase family member, was knocked down, JNK activity stimulated by sorbitol decreased significantly. Reduction in expression of one of the other putative MAP4Ks, CG4527, decreased sorbitol-stimulated JNK activation to a small but reproducible extent. Reducing expression of CG4527 caused a further reduction in the residual JNK activation remaining upon suppression of Fray (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that Fray was the major MAP4K regulating the JNK pathway in response to osmotic stress in S2 cells. Interestingly, Fray is required for normal axonal ensheathment during fly development (49Leiserson W.M. Harkins E.W. Keshishian H. Neuron. 2000; 28: 793-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Structure and Expression of OSR1—We wished to learn whether mammalian homologs of Fray, SPAK and OSR1, also regulate the JNK pathway. SPAK has been reported to activate p38 but not JNK (25Johnston A.M. Naselli G. Gonez L.J. Martin R.M. Harrison L.C. DeAizpurua H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4290-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused on analyzing OSR1, which has not been characterized previously as a protein. Human OSR1 contains 527 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 58 kDa. We isolated a cDNA encoding OSR1 by RT-PCR using HeLa RNA. It has a conserved Ste20p-like protein-serine/threonine kinase domain at its N terminus with a C-terminal region of undefined function. The OSR1 kinase domain has the highest identity to the kinase domain of SPAK (89%), Drosophila Fray (74%), and the Caenorhabditis elegans Y59A8B.23 gene product (71%). These four enzymes comprise the GCK-VI subfamily of Ste20p protein kinases. Two small regions of similarity were found in the C-terminal regions of GCK-VI subfamily members, which were named PF1 and PF2 domains. They may represent regulatory or targeting elements (25Johnston A.M. Naselli G. Gonez L.J. Martin R.M. Harrison L.C. DeAizpurua H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4290-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A putative caspase 3 cleavage site (DEFD) is present at the end of the PF1 domain of OSR1 (Fig. 2). To detect the expression of OSR1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against the C-terminal, poorly conserved region. The specificity of the anti-OSR1 antibody was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitating overexpressed Myc-OSR1 in HEK-293 cells (data not shown). With this antiserum, a 58-kDa protein was recognized in all mouse tissues examined except thymus, including heart, spleen, liver, kidney, lung, testis, large intestine, small intestine, and stomach. OSR1 was also detected in mammalian cell lines including HEK 293, HeLa, PC3, BT20, HI299, SW480, 2721, and Cos-1, which were derived from a variety of tissues including kidney, cervix, ovary, prostate, breast, lung, and colon (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, although the same amount of protein was analyzed from each lysate, little or no OSR1 was detected in the pancreatic beta cell line INS-1 or the mouse fibroblast lines C2C12 or 3T3, suggesting some tissue specificity to its expression. The wide expression of OSR1 is consistent with the broad transcription of OSR1 mRNA as deduced from Northern blotting (50Tamari M. Daigo Y. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To detect the subcellular localization of endogenous OSR1, proteins from soluble, particulate, and nuclear fractions derived from HeLa cells were immunoblotted with anti-OSR1 and anti-lamin A/C antibodies. OSR1 was detected in all three fractions, whereas lamin A/C was detected only in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3B). Endogenous OSR1 detected by immunofluorescence was distributed throughout HeLa cells, consistent with the fractionation data (Fig. 3C). Protein Kinase Activity of OSR1—To verify that OSR1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase, recombinant wild type GST-OSR1 and the kinase inactive mutant GST-OSR1KR were expressed in bacteria and assayed with MBP as substrate. Wild type GST-OSR1 phosphorylated both MBP and itself, but GST-OSR1KR showed no detectable activity (Fig. 4A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of autophosphorylated GST-OSR1 revealed primarily phosphothreonine (Fig. 4B). Equal amounts of Myc-tagged OSR1 and OSR1KR expressed in HEK 293 cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody and assayed with MBP as substrate (data not shown). A phosphorylated band at 58 kDa, representing autophosphorylated Myc-OSR1, and phosphorylated MBP were detected in assays with the wild type OSR1 immunoprecipitate. However, the same bands were also detected in assays with OSR1KR. Similar experiments performed with different epitope tags (3XFLAG) and different cell types (Cos-1 and HeLa) yielded similar results (data not shown). Because OSR1KR had no activity when expressed in bacteria and because MBP is phosphorylated by many abundant protein kinases, we conclude that the phosphorylation comes from contaminating proteins co-purifying with or non-specifically trapped in OSR1 in immune complexes; some of these may be kinases that normally phosphorylate OSR1. As a consequence, MBP was not a suitable substrate to measure OSR1 activity in cell lysates or immunoprecipitates, although it was useful to characterize the activity of the protein expressed in bacteria. The PF1 Domain Is Necessary for OSR1 Kinase Activity—To examine the contribution of the C-terminal region to the kinase activity of OSR1, truncated forms of OSR1 were expressed as GST fusions in bacteria, and the purified proteins were assayed with MBP as substrate. Full-length OSR1, OSR1-(1–433) and OSR1-(1–344) have nearly identical kinase activity toward MBP or themselves. In contrast, OSR1-(1–291), a truncated protein with intact, conserved kinase domain but without the PF1 domain, has no detectable activity toward MBP or itself (Fig. 5). Thus, the PF1 domain is essential for OSR1 kinase activity. Many Ste20p-related kinases contain autoinhibitory domains; removal of the regulatory domains results in a significant increase in kinase activity due to loss of autoinhibition. This has been shown for PAKs, MST1, MST2, TAOs, and SOK1, for example (10Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

In the case of OSR1 and other GCK-VI kinases, the PF1 domain may comprise an essential part of the kinase catalytic domain. Because there is no significant difference in the kinase activity of full-length OSR1 and OSR1-(1–433), the PF2 domain is apparently not involved in regulating catalytic activity. Cellular Stimuli That Activate OSR1—To identify possible regulators of OSR1, a number of stimuli were tested on HeLa cells. Autophosphorylation was used to assess activity o"

Cytokine-inducible Src homology domain 2-containing protein, SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 have been implicated in the down-regulation of cytokine signaling. The function of SOCS4, 5, 6, and 7 are not known. KIT receptor signaling is regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases and adaptor proteins. We previously reported that SOCS1 inhibited cell proliferation in response to stem cell factor (SCF). By screening the other members of SOCS family, we identified SOCS6 as a KIT-binding protein. Using KIT mutants and peptides, we demonstrated that SOCS6 bound directly to KIT tyrosine 567 in the juxtamembrane domain. To investigate the function of this interaction, we constitutively expressed SOCS6 in cell lines. Ectopic expression of SOCS6 in Ba/F3-KIT cell line decreased cell proliferation in response to SCF but not SCF-induced chemotaxis. SOCS6 reduced SCF-induced activation of ERK1/2 and p38 but not activation of AKT or STATs in Ba/F3, murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF), or COS-7 cells. SOCS6 did not impair ERK and p38 activation by other stimuli. These results indicate that SOCS6 binds to KIT juxtamembrane region, which affects upstream signaling components leading to MAPK activation.

SOCS6 does not interact with JAKs, but the interaction with elongins B and C suggests that, as all SOCS proteins, it might be part of an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex (28Kile B.T.

Yet, there is no evidence so far suggesting that SOCS6 might be involved in the degradation of proteins.Regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) by SOCS proteins is much less understood.

We have previously identified SOCS1 protein as downstream component of the KIT receptor signaling pathway (29De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that SOCS1 bound to KIT via its SH2 domain. Constitutive expression of SOCS1 strongly suppressed the proliferative signals transduced by KIT without suppression of KIT catalytic activity. Neither SOCS1 docking site nor the mechanism of SOCS1 inhibition could be determined in these studies. However, we showed that SOCS1 not only interacted with KIT and JAK kinases but also interacted with SH3 domain-containing proteins, other receptor tyrosine kinases, and with VAV proteins.Here, we have screened the putative interactions of SOCS proteins with the KIT receptor in response to SCF stimulation. Our findings revealed that SOCS6 protein interacts with KIT following SCF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. The SH2 domain of SOCS6 binds directly to tyrosine 567 in KIT juxtamembrane domain. To determine the functional consequences of this interaction, we have studied the effect of SOCS6 ectopic expression on the cell proliferation and migration induced by SCF and investigated which signaling pathways are regulated by SOCS6.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Ba/F3 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence of 0.1% of conditioned medium from X63-IL-3 cells (35Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). EML-C1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS and 250 ng/ml murine SCF. COS-7, R4 MEFs, Phoenix A, and GP+E-86 retrovirus-packaging cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5 mg/ml sodium pyruvate. All of the media and sera were purchased from Invitrogen.Reverse Transcription and PCR—Total RNAs were extracted from cell lines and bone marrow-derived mast cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized with 2 μg of RNA using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and one-tenth of the cDNA was then subjected to 35 cycles of PCR amplification using SOCS6 primers (sense, 5′-CTCTCACCATTGCTACCTCCAA-3′; antisense, 5′-TCTCGCCCCCAGAATAGATGTAG-3′, 468-bp product) and 2 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplification of murine and human β2-microglobulin RNAs were used as controls.Expression Constructs—pEF-FLAG-SOCS6 construct was kindly provided by D. Hilton (The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). To convert tyrosine residues (at codons 544-546-552-567-569-577-702-719-728-745 and 934) to phenylalanine residues in KIT, point mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Stratagene Chameleon double-stranded mutagenesis kit. The reactions were performed on mouse KIT cDNA in the pECE-KIT vector. All of the cDNAs were entirely sequenced. The KIT-JM construct contained all six Y544F, Y546F, Y552F, Y567F, Y569F, and Y577F mutations in the juxtamembrane domain. The KIT-KI construct contained all four Y702F, Y719F, Y728F, and Y745F mutations in the interkinase domain. Retroviral vectors pMIEV and pMIEV-hemagglutinin-SOCS1 were described previously (29De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The FLAG-SOCS6 cDNA was cloned in pMIEV using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The yeast two-hybrid vectors are described below.Reagents and Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-KIT serum was raised against glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the kinase insert. The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal rabbit anti-SOCS6, anti-STAT5b, anti-ERK2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-p44/42 ERK (Thr-202, Tyr-204) and phospho-p38 (Thr-180, Tyr-182) antibodies were obtained from Promega. Antiphospho STAT5, anti-phospho-AKT, anti-AKT, and anti-p38-specific antibodies were used according to the manufactured instructions (Cell Signaling). Anti-hemagglutinin antibody 12CA5 was from hybridoma culture supernatant. Protein A-horseradish peroxidase (ICN Biomedicals), goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories), and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology) were used as secondary antibodies for Western blots. Recombinant EGF was obtained from Invitrogen, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from Sigma, and anisomycin was from Calbiochem.Transfection Procedure—Transfection of COS-7 cells was carried out in 60-mm plates. Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions with 1 μg of expression vector. Cells were serum-starved overnight 24 h after transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% FBS and then stimulated for 5 min with 250 ng/ml murine SCF.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Stimulated cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis, pelleted, and lysed in HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 100 μm Na3VO4. Clarified whole cell lysates were mixed for 18 h with 2 μg of antibodies and a bed volume of 10 μl of protein A or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were saturated with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and probed with different antibodies as specified in the text and figure legends. Blots were revealed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Yeast Two-hybrid System—The entire cytoplasmic domains of wild-type murine KIT, KIT-JM, or KIT-KI mutants (nucleotides 1646–2988) were fused to LexA DNA-binding domain in the yeast expression vector pBTM116. SOCS6 cDNA coding for SH2 and C-terminal domains (amino acids 310–533), SOCS6 SH2 domain alone (amino acids 310–479), and SOCS1 full-length cDNA were cloned in the vector pACT2 using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The vectors pLexA-lamin and pACT2 were used as controls for each yeast two-hybrid experiment.GST Pull-down Experiments—The GST-SOCS6 construct in pD-EST15 vector-expressing SOCS6 amino acids 310–533 was introduced in the Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLacI strain (Novagen). Bacterial cultures grown to log phase were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) for 4 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were then lysed in HNTG buffer, and the GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Lysates from non-stimulated and SCF-stimulated Ba/F3-KIT cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of the GST fusion construct or with 5 μg of GST-β-catenin control immobilized on gluthatione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times in HNTG buffer, and bound fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Bound KIT protein was visualized by Western blotting using the 4G10 antibody.Peptide Binding Assay—Forty-four 15-mer peptides corresponding to the 22 tyrosine motifs of KIT intracellular domain either phosphorylated or not were synthesized on cellulose membranes as described previously (36Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were saturated with 10% FBS in TBST buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. It was then probed overnight at 4 °C with 32P-labeled GST-SOCS6 (amino acids 310–533) and washed in TBST buffer. The interactions were analyzed by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The probe was prepared in a reaction mixture containing 5 μg of GST-SOCS6, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.2 μm ATP, and 2500 units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (New England Biolabs) in the manufacturer's kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2). Unincorporated ATP was removed, and the labeled protein was eluted with 20 mm glutathione.Infection of Cells with Retroviral Vectors—Stable populations of GP+E-86 cells producing MIEV or MIEV-SOCS6 retroviruses were obtained as follow. Phoenix A cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent with pMIEVSOCS6 or empty pMIEV. In the next 2 days, filtered retroviral culture supernatants were used to infect GP+E-86 cells. GP+E-86 populations were then sorted for GFP expression. Infections of Ba/F3 or EML cells were done by coculture in 100-mm plates using 106 GP+E-86 cells stably producing retroviruses and 106 Ba/F3-KIT or Ba/F3-EGFR or EML with the target cell culture media and 4 ng/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Non-adherent cells were collected 48 h later and sorted for expression of GFP using a cell sorter. Infected R4 MEFs were obtained through similar procedures but with filtered retroviral culture supernatant instead of coculture.Cell Proliferation Assay—A total of 5000 cells/well were plated in triplicate into 96-well plates in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS and 250 ng/ml SCF. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and pulsed for 6 h with 0.5 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were then transferred onto glass fiber filters (Packard, Netherlands), and incorporation was measured using a β-counter Rackbeta Compact 1212-411 (LKB, Uppsala, Sweden).In Vitro Two-chamber Migration Assay—Chemotaxis was assayed by a modification of the Boyden chamber assay. 3 × 105 serum-starved Ba/F3-KIT cells in 100 μl of chemotaxis media (RPMI 1640 with 0.5% bovine serum albumin) were added to the upper chamber of a Costar Transwell 24-well plate (6.5 mm diameter, 5 μm pore size, Cambridge, MA). 600 μl of chemotaxis medium was added to the lower chamber. SCF was added in the lower chamber to create a positive gradient. Transwell plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. SCF-induced cell migration into the lower chamber was measured by counting using FACScan for 20 s at high flow rate. Average cell number and mean ± S.D. were calculated from quadruplet wells.RESULTSSOCS6 Protein Associates with KIT Receptor in Response to SCF—We earlier reported that SOCS1 physically associated with KIT receptor through its SH2 domain in response to KIT-ligand (SCF)-induced activation (29De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To determine whether the other SOCS proteins interacted with KIT, we transiently expressed FLAG-tagged SOCS proteins and KIT in COS-7 cells. Transfected cells were serum-starved overnight prior to stimulation with SCF for 5 min. SCF induced a strong association of SOCS6 with KIT (Fig. 1) and a weak association of SOCS4 and SOCS5 with KIT (data not shown). By contrast, CIS bound to KIT constitutively, whereas SOCS2 and SOCS3 did not interact (data not shown).Transcripts encoding CIS, SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 are up-regulated following cytokine signaling (1Krebs D.L.

As shown Fig. 2A, expression of socs6 gene was induced after 1 h of SCF stimulation in primary cultures of bone marrow-derived mast cells. Additionally, socs6 mRNA was present in cells that express KIT, including the cell lines UT-7, TF1, and MO7e and ES cells (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that socs6 is expressed in KIT-positive cells and that KIT signaling induces socs6 mRNA expression.Fig. 2Induction of socs6 gene expression by SCF. A, KIT receptor signaling induces socs6 mRNA in bone marrow-derived mast cells. Cells were serum-starved overnight, they were then either left untreated (lane 1) or stimulated with SCF (250 ng/ml) for 1 h (lanes 2) and 4 h (lanes 3), or cultured in the presence of IL-3 (lane 4). Total RNAs were isolated, and the expression of socs6 mRNA and β2-microglobulin were analyzed by RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, socs6 mRNA is expressed in positive KIT cell line. RNAs from thymus and spleen were obtained from Stratagene. MO7e, UT-7, and TF1 cells were cultured in the media containing 1 and 5 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, respectively. Murine embryonic stem cells were cultured in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (1000 units/ml). Total RNAs were treated as in panel A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We set out to analyze the interaction of SOCS6 with KIT. As shown Fig. 1, KIT was detected in SOCS6 immunoprecipitates following KIT activation by SCF (Fig. 1, panel A, lane 7). Conversely, SOCS6 was detected in KIT immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, panel C, lane 7). The interaction was dependent on SCF stimulation and tyrosine phosphorylation of KIT. Protein expression in the transfected cells was confirmed by immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates with the anti-FLAG (Fig. 1, panel B) and anti-KIT (Fig. 1, panel D) antibodies, respectively. Tyrosine phosphorylation of KIT was controlled by using an antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1, panel E). The binding of SOCS6 to KIT was confirmed by two other experimental procedures, the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 4A) and GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 5B).Fig. 4SOCS6 interacts with juxtamembrane domain of KIT receptor. A, SOCS6 SH2 domain interacts with KIT in the yeast two-hybrid system, full-length SOCS6, or the SH2 domain of SOCS6 as GAL4 activation domain fusion proteins in the pACT2 vector in the yeast strain L40.

https://openalex.org/W2031547967,"ERK2 nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution is regulated in response to hormones and cellular state without the requirement for karyopherin-mediated nuclear import. One proposed mechanism for the movement of ERK2 into the nucleus is through a direct interaction between ERK2 and nucleoporins present in the nuclear pore complex. Previous reports have attributed regulation of ERK2 localization to proteins that activate or deactivate ERK2, such as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase MEK1 and MAP kinase phosphatases. Recently, a small non-catalytic protein, PEA-15, has also been demonstrated to promote a cytoplasmic ERK2 localization. We found that the MAP kinase insert in ERK2 is required for its interaction with PEA-15. Consistent with its recognition of the MAP kinase insert, PEA-15 blocked activation of ERK2 by MEK1, which also requires the MAP kinase insert to interact productively with ERK2. To determine how PEA-15 influences the localization of ERK2, we used a permeabilized cell system to examine the effect of PEA-15 on the localization of ERK2 and mutants that have lost the ability to bind PEA-15. Wild type ERK2 was unable to enter the nucleus in the presence of an excess of PEA-15; however, ERK2 lacking the MAP kinase insert largely retained the ability to enter the nucleus. Binding assays demonstrated that PEA-15 interfered with the ability of ERK2 to bind to nucleoporins. These results suggest that PEA-15 sequesters ERK2 in the cytoplasm at least in part by interfering with its ability to interact with nucleoporins, presenting a potential paradigm for regulation of ERK2 localization.

ERK2 is the multifunctional kinase in a kinase cascade that is activated by various stimuli acting through tyrosine kinase receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, and others (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S.

Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar). Activation of this cascade results in the dual phosphorylation of ERK2 and the consequent phosphorylation of target kinases, transcription factors, and other proteins throughout the cell. The effectors of ERK2 are localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, making its subcellular localization important for its ability to induce cellular changes (3Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H.

Regulation of ERK2 localization has been characterized mostly by overexpression and/or by using antibodies to N- and C-terminal epitopes (5Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pages G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A.

This suggests that cytosolic binding is important in determining the distribution of ERK2 in cells. Coexpression with MEK1 shifts the distribution in favor of the cytoplasm (13Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). From these studies, it has been suggested that inactive ERK2 is anchored in the cytoplasm by MEK1, and that once active, ERK2 loses affinity for MEK1, moves through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and accumulates in the nucleus (15Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Overexpression studies have shown that ERK2 export can be facilitated by MEK1, which has a nuclear export sequence (NES) and requires the NES-binding protein CRM1 for movement out of the nucleus (16Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 17Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Nuclear entry of ERK2 has been described recently as a facilitated mechanism in which ERK2 moves through the NPC by binding directly to nucleoporins (18Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This process, which has been described for at least two other signaling proteins (20Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), does not rely on the classical, karyopherin-mediated import mechanism. Thus, regulatory mechanisms governing the localization of ERK2 appear to differ significantly from those for many other proteins displaying regulated nuclear import. Because ERK2 responds to a wide range of stimuli and controls numerous effectors throughout the cell, a number of mechanisms most likely exist to regulate its subcellular localization and thereby maintain fidelity between stimulus and stimulus-specific phenotypic change. Recently, the small anti-apoptotic protein, PEA-15, has been demonstrated to bind to ERK2 and localize it to the cytoplasm (22Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). PEA-15 was originally characterized in astrocytes, where it became highly phosphorylated in response to phorbol ester treatment (23Danziger N. Yokoyama M. Jay T. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Chneiweiss H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1016-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Neuronal cells express relatively high amounts of PEA-15; nevertheless, it is detected in most cultured cell lines. Astrocytes from PEA-15 knockout mice display a heightened sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-α induced apoptosis, indicating a protective effect of PEA-15 in the central nervous system (24Kitsberg D. Formstecher E. Fauquet M. Kubes M. Cordier J. Canton B. Pan G. Rolli M. Glowinski J. Chneiweiss H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8244-8251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown to bind to the TRAIL receptor to inhibit apoptotic signaling (25Xiao C. Yang B.F. Asadi N. Beguinot F. Hao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25020-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Various cancer cell lines also express relatively high amounts of PEA-15, and an increase in its mRNA is correlated with neoplastic changes in mouse mammary gland (26Tsukamoto T. Yoo J. Hwang S.I. Guzman R.C. Hirokawa Y. Chou Y.C. Olatunde S. Huang T. Bera T.K. Yang J. Nandi S. Cancer Lett. 2000; 149: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistent with its anti-apoptotic phenotypes, PEA-15 contains a death effector domain, which is required for PEA-15 to reverse Ras-mediated suppression of integrin activation (27Ramos J.W. Kojima T.K. Hughes P.E. Fenczik C.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33897-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PEA-15, when overexpressed, localizes ERK2 to the cytoplasm, even in the presence of stimuli that activate ERK2 (22Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). PEA-15 has an NES and accumulates in the nucleus in cells treated with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. These data suggested that PEA-15 may influence the localization of ERK2 in a similar manner to that proposed for MEK1, by binding to ERK2 and mediating its nuclear export. Thus, these studies describe one potential mechanism for the regulation of ERK2 subcellular localization by non-catalytic proteins, which may contribute to targeting ERK2 to specific cellular compartments and substrates. To understand better the mechanism by which PEA-15 regulates ERK2 subcellular localization, we examined the behavior of ERK2 and PEA-15 using a permeabilized cell reconstitution assay, and we found that PEA-15 prevents ERK2 nuclear entry. Furthermore, PEA-15 prevents ERK2 from binding to nucleoporins in vitro, indicating it may assist in localizing ERK2 to cytoplasmic sites of action by inhibiting its movement into the nucleus. Constructs and Recombinant Proteins—The cDNA encoding rat ERK2 was subcloned into pRSETB-His6-green fluorescent protein (GFP) by using KpnI and HindIII restriction sites. Mutants were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The cDNA encoding hamster PEA-15 was a gift from Mark Ginsberg and Joe Ramos (Scripps Research Institute and Rutgers). pGAD-ERK2 was cloned, and two-hybrid vectors encoding LexA-PEA-15 or kinase-dead MEK1 were generated by PCR as described previously (11Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The constructs encoded the proteins fused to the C terminus of the LexA DNA-binding domain. Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments—Pairwise interaction tests were carried out in the yeast strain L40 co-transformed with pGAD-ERK2, or the indicated ERK2 mutants, and either the empty pVJL11 (LexA) vector or pVJL11-based constructs encoding LexA fusions with sequences from PEA-15, MEK1, or MNK1 as described (11Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ERK2 mutants were originally identified and described in a study of MEK1-ERK2 interactions or in an earlier study of ERK2 nuclear localization (11Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H.

Co-transformants were selected, and protein-protein interactions were tested by examining growth of co-transformed isolates on medium lacking His, Leu, and Trp. The expression of all LexA and GAD fusion proteins in yeast cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for either LexA or ERK1/2 (11Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—GFP-ERK2 and GFP-ERK2 mutants were prepared as described (29Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). GST-ERK2 was purified as described (30Robinson M.J. Xu B. Stippec S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5094-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PEA-15 and PEA-15 D74A each containing a His6 tag were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and MonoQ. Elution from the latter was performed with a step salt gradient. Karyopherin-1, karyopherin-2, Ran, p10, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NUP153c were purified as described (31Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol.

Rhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) was coupled to a peptide containing the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the simian virus 40 T antigen to make the control import substrate NLS-BSA (32Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff F.R. Weeks D.L. Ogniewski V. Ohno M. Niehrs C. Kjems J. Mattaj I.W. Fornerod M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Import Assays—Import assays were performed as described by using REF52 cells grown in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine (31Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells plated on coverslips 24 h before permeabilization were washed once with import buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and permeabilized with 70 μg/ml digitonin in transport buffer for 5 min on ice. Cells were washed and inverted over 40 ml of import mix, which contained 0.6-0.8 μm GFP-ERK2 (38-50 μg/ml) or 5 μg/ml NLS-BSA-TRITC (0.07 μm); for NLS-BSA import, cells were incubated with 0.5 μm karyopherin-1, 0.25 μm karyopherin-2, 2 μm Ran, and 0.4 μm p10/NTF2 (31Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were incubated for 15 min or the indicated times and were washed and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. Coverslips were mounted in 1 mg/ml phenylenediamine in 90% phosphate-buffered saline plus 10% glycerol. GFP and TRITC were visualized by fluorescence microscopy with a Zeiss Axiocam microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca II camera. Pictures for individual experiments were taken using identical exposures. Uptake was quantified by using Improvision OPEN LAB software. Binding Experiments—The method described by Werner and co-workers (34Hill J.M. Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Werner M.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was used to measure binding of purified GST-ERK2 wild type and mutants to His6-PEA-15, except that bovine serum albumin (3 mg/ml) was included in the incubations, and interactions were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Clontech). To measure ERK2 binding to Nup153c, GST-Nup153c (2 mm) was incubated for 30 min with glutathione-agarose equilibrated in import buffer at 4 °C. His6-ERK2 (200 nm) was added with or without the indicated ratios of PEA-15 and mixed end over end at 4 °C for 2 h. Bovine serum albumin (6 mg/ml) was present in the binding reactions. Beads were washed four times with 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 in import buffer and analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in SDS. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with antiserum Y691 for 1 h at 1:1000 dilution (35Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed as described previously. ERK2 (0.8 μm) was incubated with 120 nm MEK1R4F (36Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), 10 μm ATP, and increasing amounts of PEA-15. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. Proteins were resolved on gels as above and subjected to autoradiography. Counts/min incorporated into ERK2 were measured by liquid scintillation counting. To analyze the possible site of interaction of PEA-15 with ERK2, we first demonstrated that we could measure their binding using a directed two-hybrid test (Fig. 1A and Table I). We then assessed the binding of PEA-15 to the following ERK2 mutants that are defective in interactions with other proteins, some of which were identified from an ERK2 mutant library (11Robinson F.L.

PEA-15 bound to ERK2 (DDAA) as well as it bound to wild type ERK2, indicating that PEA-15 does not bind to ERK2 through a basic/hydrophobic D domain. However, PEA-15 did not interact with ERK2Δ241-272, although this mutant retained binding to MNK1 and MKP-3 (11Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Loss of a two-hybrid interaction suggests a substantial decrease in the affinity of their association. The point mutants that displayed reduced binding to PEA-15 were all located in or near the MAP kinase insert and included Y261N/C, which is the most defective in binding to MEK1 based on its inability to be activated in cells (Table I) (11Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). No functions of the MAP kinase insert are known other than for productive binding of ERK2 to MEK1. The binding data here indicate that a second function of the MAP kinase insert is to interact with PEA-15.Table IThe ability of ERK2 wild type and mutants to bind to PEA-15 by yeast two-hybrid analysisMutationMEK1-K97MPEA-15MNK1WT+++L235P−−+L235P,N236I+−+G243R−−+Y261C,Y261N−−+ Open table in a new tab To validate the results of the two-hybrid tests, the binding of the two key GST-ERK2 mutants to PEA-15 was assessed using glutathione-agarose to harvest bound proteins (Fig. 1C). As expected, ERK2 (DDAA) associated with PEA-15 in the pull-down assays, but ERK2Δ241-272 bound poorly to GST-PEA-15, consistent with the two-hybrid findings. As indicated above, the region of ERK2 that was necessary for the interaction with PEA-15 overlaps that identified previously (11Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) as required for the capacity of MEK1 to activate ERK2 in cells. This observation suggested that PEA-15 should also interfere with the interaction of ERK2 with MEK1. To determine whether this was the case, we included PEA-15 in kinase assays with ERK2 and a constitutively active form of MEK1, MEK1 R4F. Under these conditions, we could assess competition as a loss of ERK2 phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 2). A 10-fold molar excess of PEA-15 in the kinase assays was sufficient to reduce ERK2 activation by MEK1 to less than 20% of that in its absence, consistent with the idea that PEA-15 interferes with a productive interaction of MEK1 with ERK2. Overexpression studies demonstrated that PEA-15 can induce accumulation of ERK2 in the cytoplasm. This accumulation was attributed to regulation of ERK2 export by PEA-15, which has an NES (22Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B. Nguyen X.T. Barnier J.V. Camonis J. Ginsberg M.H. Chneiweiss H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of PEA-15 on ERK2 localization, we included PEA-15 in an import reconstitution assay with GFP-ERK2. In vitro import assays are performed by permeabilizing the plasma membrane with digitonin. Digitonin permeabilization results in the loss of soluble proteins including proteins required for conventional import and export processes, notably the small G protein Ran, but leaves the nucleus and NPC intact. We have shown previously that the control import substrate, NLS-BSA, is not imported in the absence of added transport factors and energy in this system (19Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, GFP-ERK2 enters the nucleus in the absence of added soluble proteins and energy in a manner facilitated by interactions with the FXF-rich nucleoporins, which are major components of the nuclear pore (18Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Protein outside the nucleus that is not tightly bound will wash away prior to visualization. Entry of GFP-ERK2 into the nucleus is inhibited by the lectin wheat germ agglutinin, which binds to N-acetylglucosamine residues on nucleoporins and occludes the NPC (19Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). If we included PEA-15 in these assays, we found a significant inhibition of GFP-ERK2 entry at 15 min. The inhibition of entry was dependent on the PEA-15 concentration. Reduced entry of GFP-ERK2 was clearly detectable if a 7.5-10-fold molar excess of PEA-15 was included in the assay (Fig. 3A). We also performed additional assays including recombinant transport factors, α-karyopherin, β-karyopherin, p10, Ran, and an energy reconstitution system (19Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), to determine whether nuclear accumulation of GFP-ERK2 was influenced by PEA-15 in the presence of transport factors. Under these conditions, nuclear accumulation of GFP-ERK2 was still inhibited by PEA-15. On the other hand, PEA-15 had no effect on the entry of the control import substrate NLS-BSA (Fig. 3C), indicating that PEA-15 does not generally disrupt conventional nuclear import. Because an energy-regenerating system, Ran, and CRM1 were not required in the permeabilized cell system, inhibition of the nuclear accumulation of GFP-ERK2 is most likely not due to CRM1-mediated export of a PEA-15-GFP-ERK2 complex. Our findings with PEA-15 are consistent with work by Nishida and co-workers (18Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) who reported previously that MEK1 can prevent the nuclear entry of GFP-ERK2 in similar reconstitution assays. Thus, we conclude that the ability of PEA-15 to prevent nuclear accumulation of ERK2 in this assay must be due to its sequestration outside the nucleus. To determine whether cytoplasmic retention of GFP-ERK2 caused by PEA-15 required a direct interaction with ERK2, we tested the effect of PEA-15 on nuclear import of ERK2 with mutations noted above. GFP-ERK2 DDAA entered the nucleus like wild type ERK2, and its entry was reduced by PEA-15 (Fig. 4, A and B). This result was consistent with the binding data that showed that mutation of the two aspartic acid residues in ERK2 DDAA did not reduce PEA-15 binding (Fig. 1, A and C). GFP-ERK2Δ241-272 was also capable of nuclear entry, but in contrast, its entry was much less sensitive to the presence of PEA-15; reduced entry was only observed at the highest PEA-15 concentration (Fig. 4, A and B). In the presence of PEA-15 no entry of wild type ERK2 was observed even at 1 min, the shortest time of observation, nor was it observed at any time over the time course up to 30 min (Fig. 4C). ERK2Δ241-272 displayed a similar accumulation over time even in the presence of PEA-15 (Fig. 4D). No inhibition of nuclear entry was observed with ERK2 Y261N (Fig. 5A and Table II), which was the point mutant most impaired in binding to MEK1 and PEA-15 by the two-hybrid test (11Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, a mutant in the death effector domain of PEA-15, D74A, that reportedly fails to bind to ERK2 was also tested in the reconstitution assay. In the presence of PEA-15 D74A, nuclear entry of GFP-ERK2 was detected; the extent was intermediate between that observed in the absence and presence of wild type PEA-15 (Fig. 5B). This result is consistent with the decreased ERK2 binding of this mutant. Thus, we conclude that binding of PEA-15 to ERK2 induces a cytoplasmic localization of ERK2 in this assay by directly preventing its nuclear entry.Fig. 5ERK2 and PEA-15 mutants in the import assay.

Lymphotactin, the unique member of the “C” chemokine subclass, is a highly basic protein that binds heparin, a glycosaminoglycan, with high affinity (∼10 nm). We detected lymphotactin-heparin binding by NMR and mapped this interaction to a narrow surface that wraps around the protein. Substitutions in and around this binding site and surface plasmon resonance analysis of heparin binding affinity identified two arginine residues of lymphotactin as critical for glycosaminoglycan binding. Both arginine mutant proteins and the combined double mutant had dramatically diminished in vivo activity in a leukocyte recruitment assay, suggesting that the lymphotactin-glycosaminoglycan interactions detected in vitro are important for the function of this chemokine. Our results demonstrate that like other chemokines, lymphotactin utilizes highly specific glycosaminoglycan-binding sites that represent potential targets for drug development.

Chemokine sequences are divided into four subfamilies, based on the number and spacing of conserved cysteine residues.

Chemokines stimulate leukocyte migration by activating specific G protein-coupled receptors expressed in their target cell populations (3Gale L.M. McColl S.R.

This signaling network of roughly 50 chemokines and 20 receptors is both selective and redundant: specific leukocyte types express a particular receptor and are recruited only in response to their cognate chemokines, however, many receptors can be activated by more than one chemokine ligand (7Proudfoot A.E.

For example, an inappropriate or uncontrolled T cell infiltration driven by hLtn expression is a factor in both Crohn's disease (10Middel P. Thelen P. Blaschke S. Polzien F. Reich K. Blaschke V.

Interestingly, the unique ability of hLtn to specifically chemoattract lymphocytes has been exploited therapeutically in combination with the T cell-activating cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). T cells recruited by hLtn and activated by IL-2 generated potent antitumor immunity in human clinical trials for treatment of neuroblastoma, where studies with either hLtn or IL-2 alone failed to generate a significant response (12Rousseau R.F. Haight A.E. Hirschmann-Jax C. Yvon E.S. Rill D.R. Mei Z. Smith S.C. Inman S. Cooper K. Alcoser P. Grilley B. Gee A. Popek E. Davidoff A. Bowman L.C. Brenner M.K. Strother D. Blood. 2003; 101: 1718-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hence, hLtn and its analogs with activity toward XCR1 will be extremely valuable as agents for T cell recruitment in cancer vaccines (6Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar), whereas specific antagonists of hLtn activity may be useful for treating certain autoimmune or inflammatory diseases (7Proudfoot A.E. Nat. Rev.

High affinity chemokine binding to cell surface GAGs is thought to serve in the formation of a concentration gradient leading back to the site of chemokine production. These interactions may regulate the types of chemokines immobilized at inflammatory sites, because the content and composition of cell surface glycosaminoglycans vary with the type and location of endothelial tissues (13Kuschert G.S.

Whereas a cluster of basic residues commonly associated with heparin-binding proteins (the BBXB motif (25Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) appears in the 40's loop of the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β, GAG binding sites identified in other chemokines are highly divergent (26Lortat-Jacob H. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cell-based in vitro assays for chemotaxis (or Ca2+-flux) showed that GAG binding mutants of RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β remained fully functional, suggesting that G protein-coupled receptor binding and activation is independent of the interactions with extracellular matrix (20Chakravarty L.

However, the same mutants with disrupted GAG binding sites were nonfunctional in vivo, demonstrating that the biological activity of chemokines depends on both types of intermolecular interactions (27Proudfoot A.E.

A co-crystal structure is available for heparin bound to the cytokine basic fibroblast growth factor (28Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), but the features governing protein-GAG recognition are still relatively uncharacterized. Complete description of a functional chemokine signaling complex will require structural characterization of GAG binding elements that represent targets for development of specific chemokine antagonists (14McFadden G. Kelvin D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Proudfoot A.E. Power C.A. Rommel C. Wells T.N. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Like most chemokines, hLtn is highly basic and binds heparin with high affinity (∼10 nm), presumably through some combination of its 15 lysine and arginine residues (Fig. 1) (13Kuschert G.S. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Hubbard R.E. Hoogewerf A.J. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12959-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In this work, we monitored the interaction between 15N hLtn and a synthetic heparin pentasaccharide by NMR spectroscopy. Chemical shift perturbations clearly identified a GAG recognition element involving a subset of basic residues. On this basis, we generated mutant proteins with greatly reduced affinity for heparin, and showed that these substitutions eliminated in vivo hLtn activity. Our results identify a specific GAG binding site for the chemokine lymphotactin and suggest that the interaction is essential for in vivo function.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning and Mutagenesis—We previously described the production of human Ltn (hLtn) in Escherichia coli using a codon-optimized synthetic gene incorporated into a fusion protein construct with a Factor Xa cleavage site (4Kuloglu E.S. McCaslin D.R. Kitabwalla M. Pauza C.D. Markley J.L. Volkman B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12486-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A disadvantage of this approach resulted from Factor Xa proteolysis at a favorable secondary cleavage site in the hLtn sequence, lowering the overall yield of hLtn. In this work we developed an improved method for expression of recombinant hLtn based on the pQE vector system. PCR was used to generate a full-length, codon-optimized hLtn fragment with BamHI and HindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, to facilitate insertion into a modified pQE30 vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Modifications to the pQE30 vector include extension of the (His)6 tag to a total of 8 histidine residues and incorporation of a tobacco etch virus protease (30Dougherty W.G. Cary S.M. Parks T.D. Virology. 1989; 171: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) site as a means of removing the affinity tag. Many chemokines are inactivated by N-terminal modifications, however, lymphotactin containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope was active (31Kelner G. Kennedy J. Bacon K. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Bazan J. Moore K. Schall T. Zlotnik A. Science. 1994; 266: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), and deletion of the N-terminal Val residue yielded a functional hLtn protein (32Dorner B. Müller S. Entschladen F. Schröder J.M. Franke P. Kraft R. Friedl P. Clark-Lewis I. Kroczek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8817-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To accommodate the tobacco etch virus protease recognition sequence, Val-1 was excluded from the expression construct resulting in a recombinant protein composed of residues 2–93 of hLtn (GenBank™ accession U23772). This recombinant hLtn (2–93) protein is referred to as wild-type hLtn throughout this paper.Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using pairs of complementary primers and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All expression vectors were verified by DNA sequencing.Protein Expression, Purification, and Refolding—The hLtn expression plasmid, pQE308HT-hLtn, was transformed into E. coli strain SG13009[pRPEP4] (Qiagen). Cell were grown at 37 °C in LB media containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin until the cell density reached A600 = 0.7–1.0. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Following induction, cells were grown for another 3.5 h, harvested and stored at -80 °C until processed further. For uniform labeling with 15N, cells were grown in M9 media containing 15N-ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source.Recombinant hLtn was found exclusively in the insoluble fraction of the harvested cells, and isolated by the following procedure for purification and refolding. Cell paste from a 1–2-liter culture was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidizole, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride) and lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell. Inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 10 ml of solubilization buffer (6 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidizole, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), disaggregated by passage through a 16-gauge needle, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. This protein solution was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) in batch mode for 30 min at room temperature, packed into a 5-ml disposable column, and washed with 3 × 10-ml portions of solubilization buffer. Bound Ltn was eluted with 3 × 10-ml portions of elution buffer (6 m guanidinium chloride, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidizole, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). Eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 3 × 4 liters of 0.3% (v/v) acetic acid to remove denaturant. Separation of the affinity tag was performed by adjusting the buffer conditions to 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, addition of a catalytic amount of tobacco etch virus protease (∼1,000:1), and incubation for 3 h at 22 °C. Formation of the single hLtn disulfide was accomplished by dropwise addition of the cleavage reaction into 150 ml of oxidation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl), followed by dialysis of the oxidation reaction against 4 liters of oxidation buffer. Oxidized hLtn was concentrated to 20 ml by ultrafiltration in an Amicon stirred-cell using a 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Fully refolded hLtn was separated from reduced or aggregated species by reversed-phased high performance liquid chromatography. Purity and identity of all hLtn variants were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.SPR Measurements—Sensor chips (SA, C1, and CM5), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, and N-hydroxysuccinimide were from Biacore (Biosensor AB, Uppsala). Semi-purified heparin, heparin-albumin, and heparin-biotin were from Sigma. SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore 3000 operated using BIAevaluation 3.1 software. Freshly prepared, degassed buffers were used, and all protein samples were purified to >95% by high performance liquid chromatography and filtered. Covalent immobilization was used to avoid baseline drift because of a decaying surface. Reference surfaces were created using the same coupling reagents and carrier agents as the measurement surface, and a reference sensorgram was subtracted from each dataset. Each injection was performed in duplicate, and stringent surface regeneration (2 m NaCl, followed by glycine (pH 2.0) and NaOH (pH 10.0)) was performed between all injections.Initial SPR studies using biotinylated heparin immobilized on a streptavidin sensor chip failed because of nonspecific binding of hLtn to the surface. Preliminary experiments were performed at 25 °Cin20mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6), using soluble semi-purified heparin (average molecular mass of 11,000 Da). hLtn was covalently coupled through its primary amino groups to a CM5 (carboxymethyl dextran) sensor chip using standard N-hydroxysuccinimide ester/carbodiimide coupling chemistry. To identify suitable oligosaccharides for NMR analysis of a hLtn-GAG complex, we also measured the interaction of immobilized hLtn with several homogeneous heparin fragments purified from porcine mucosal heparin (33Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 34Yu G. LeBrun L. Gunay N.S. Hoppensteadt D. Walenga J.M. Fareed J. Linhardt R.J. Thromb. Res. 2000; 100: 549-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sensorgrams were acquired at 25 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6) for a panel of seven heparin oligosaccharides with the general formula ΔUA2S (1[→4)-α-d-GlcNS6S(1→4)-α-l-IdoA2S(1→]n4)-α-d-GlcNS6S, where ΔUA is 4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-eno-pyranosyluronic acid, GlcN is 2-deoxy-2-aminoglucopyranose, IdoA is idopyranosyluronic acid, S is sulfate, and n = 1 (tetrasaccharide); n = 2 (hexasaccharide); n = 3 (octasaccharide; n = 4 (decasaccharide); n = 5 (dodecasaccharide); n = 6 (tetradecasaccharide), or n = 9 (ecosisaccharide).To provide an efficient means of comparing heparin binding affinities for hLtn variant proteins, heparin-albumin conjugate (Sigma, heparin average molecular weight of 11,000) was immobilized through protein amino groups using standard N-hydroxysuccinimide ester/carbodiimide coupling chemistry on a carboxymethyl (C1) sensor chip as described previously (35Zhang F. Fath M. Marks R. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 304: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Successful immobilization was confirmed by the observation of a ∼300 response unit increase. The control flow cell was prepared by immobilizing bovine serum albumin using a similar coupling procedure. This sensor surface displayed minimal nonspecific binding, and a series of hLtn mutants were analyzed at 10 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6), 200 mm NaCl, identical to solution conditions used for NMR analysis of the hLtn structure (4Kuloglu E.S. McCaslin D.R. Kitabwalla M. Pauza C.D. Markley J.L. Volkman B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12486-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and heparin binding as described below.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a 1H/15N/13C CryoProbe®. NMR samples containing 0.25 mm hLtn were prepared in 90% H2O, 10% D2O containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 200 mm sodium chloride, 0.02% sodium azide. All two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectra (36Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1995; 105: 94-98Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar) were collected at 10 °C, with spectral widths of 10,000 (1H) and 2,000 (15N) Hz, using 16 transients per free-induction decay, 200 complex points in the 15N dimension, and 1024 complex points in the 1H dimension. Total experiment time for each spectrum was 2 h. Heparin titrations were performed by adding substoichiometric aliquots from concentrated stock solutions (10 mg/ml, determined from heparin dry weight) in H2O of the purified tetra-, hexa-, or decasaccharide described above (33Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) or a synthetic heparin pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin III binding site of heparin (α-d-GlcNS6S-(1→4)-α-d-Glc-A-(1→4)-α-d-GlcNS3S6S-(1→4)-α-l-IdoA2S-(1→4)-α-d-GlcNS6SOMe) (34Yu G.

Each addition of heparin was monitored by one- and two-dimensional NMR. Chemical shift assignments for the fast-exchange hLtn-pentasaccharide complex were transferred by inspection from the free protein (4Kuloglu E.S. McCaslin D.R. Kitabwalla M. Pauza C.D. Markley J.L. Volkman B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12486-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (BioMagResBank ID 5042), because shifts for most resonances could be followed through the course of the titration. A three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HQSC spectrum was used to confirm assignments of the arginine side chain NH resonances and other overlapped signals.In Vivo Cell Recruitment Assay—Four to 5-week-old female CD-1 mice (Charles River) were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected intraperitoneally with 100 μl of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution (Sigma) or 20 μg of various mutants of hLtn diluted in 100 μl of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution. At 14 h post-injection, the animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. The peritoneal cavity was washed 3 times with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and the total lavage was pooled for individual mice. The total number of cells harvested from each animal was counted using a hematocytometer.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHeparin Binding of Human Lymphotactin—Lymphotactin binds heparin, like most chemokines (13Kuschert G.S. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Hubbard R.E. Hoogewerf A.J. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12959-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). We monitored the kinetics of the interaction between immobilized hLtn and semipurified heparin (Mr ∼ 11,000) by SPR and obtained an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 5 nm at 25 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6) (data not shown). Because chemokine-GAG interactions have not been characterized structurally, we sought to form a soluble complex that could be studied by NMR. Addition of semi-purified heparin (Mr ∼ 3,000–5,000) to a sample of 0.25 mm hLtn produced an insoluble precipitate, so we used SPR to measure the binding of a series of seven smaller purified heparin fragments ranging from 4 to 20 residues. Kd values for the structurally defined heparin oligosaccharides ranged from 350 nm (ecosisaccharide) to 23 μm (tetrasaccharide) (data not shown), leading us to speculate that one or more of the shorter heparin sequences might bind hLtn in a manner suitable for NMR analysis.Our previous work showed that hLtn adopts the canonical chemokine fold as a monomer (Fig. 1a) at low temperature (10 °C) in 200 mm NaCl (4Kuloglu E.S. McCaslin D.R. Kitabwalla M. Pauza C.D. Markley J.L. Volkman B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12486-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and we recently reported that the protein is conformationally heterogeneous under near-physiological solution conditions (37Kuloglu E.S. McCaslin D.R. Markley J.L. Volkman B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17863-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The normal chemokine structure interchanges reversibly with a novel conformational state that predominates at elevated temperature (∼40 °C) in low salt, however, the functional consequences of this rearrangement are unknown. At physiological solution conditions (37 °C, 150 mm NaCl), the two structural species are present in equal proportions, as detected by two-dimensional NMR, so it is impossible to infer which is more physiologically relevant from biophysical analysis alone. Because the low temperature state is structurally homologous to dozens of other chemokines with known biological activity, and the novel high temperature state has no structural or functional analog, we hypothesize that, whereas each may have a functional role, the chemokine-like conformation of lymphotactin is very likely to be important for in vivo activity. To consistently promote the chemokine-like conformation throughout our subsequent studies, we performed all NMR and SPR analyses at 10 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer with 200 mm NaCl at pH 6.The Glycosaminoglycan Binding Surface of hLtn—We used two-dimensional NMR to screen a panel of homogenous, structurally defined heparin fragments (tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and decasaccharide) (33Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 34Yu G. LeBrun L. Gunay N.S. Hoppensteadt D. Walenga J.M. Fareed J. Linhardt R.J. Thromb. Res. 2000; 100: 549-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in the solution conditions used for determination of the chemokine-like hLtn conformation (10 °C, 200 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm phosphate, pH 6.0). Addition of substoichiometric amounts of either the deca- or hexasaccharide fragments to submillimolar concentrations of hLtn (200–450 μm) (oligosaccharide:hLtn molar ratio of 1:5) resulted in immediate precipitation and a quantitative reduction in NMR signal intensity consistent with the formation of insoluble complexes. No shifting of the residual protein resonances was detected. Efforts to discourage the precipitation reaction, including lower protein concentration, higher salt, and a wide range of temperature and pH values, were unsuccessful. In contrast, addition of a 2-fold molar excess of the tetrasaccharide under the same solution conditions produced neither insoluble precipitate nor spectral changes, suggesting that the GAG binding site of hLtn requires at least five carbohydrate residues to form a specific complex.We tested this hypothesis by performing another titration using a synthetic heparin pentasaccharide (34Yu G. LeBrun L. Gunay N.S. Hoppensteadt D. Walenga J.M. Fareed J. Linhardt R.J. Thromb. Res. 2000; 100: 549-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Comparison of 15N-1H HSQC spectra before and after addition of the pentasaccharide (Fig. 2a) revealed chemical shift perturbations for a unique set of residues of hLtn, including a subset of the Arg side chain NH signals (Fig. 2b). As increasing amounts of heparin pentasaccharide were added, signals from these residues shifted in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2c), demonstrating that the binding reaction occurs in the fast exchange regime of the NMR chemical shift time scale. From these data, it appears that the pentasaccharide binds hLtn with low affinity (Kd ∼100 μm) relative to values obtained by SPR using a series of purified heparin oligosaccharides (0.4–23 μm). However, the earlier SPR experiments were performed in the absence of salt at 25 °C, and pentasaccharide binding was not measured so a direct comparison with NMR is not possible. Thus, formation of a high affinity 1:1 hLtn-heparin complex requires a minimal GAG element of six or more carbohydrate residues, and longer he"
https://openalex.org/W2032992679,"Psoriasis is a common skin disease characterized by hyperplastic regenerative epidermal growth and infiltration of immunocytes. The etiology of psoriasis is unknown, although several genetic and cellular factors have been elucidated. To find new psoriasis-related genes, we have cloned cDNAs that are differentially expressed between normal and psoriatic skins. Among these clones, we have identified a new gene that codes for a new member of the type IV cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) family. We refer to this gene as cPLA2δ. It encodes a polypeptide of 818 amino acids that has significant homology with known cPLA2 proteins in the C2 and catalytic domains. The cPLA2δ gene was mapped to the 15q13-14 chromosomal locus, near to the locus of the cPLA2β gene, from which it is separated by a physical distance of about 220 kb. To identify the phospholipase A2 activity of cPLA2δ, we transfected COS-7 cells with His-tagged cPLA2δ. The cell lysate from these cells had calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 activity. Northern blot analysis revealed that a cPLA2δ transcript of about 4 kb is expressed in stratified squamous epithelia, such as those in skin and cervix, but not in other tissues. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that cPLA2δ is expressed strongly in the upper spinous layer of the psoriatic epidermis, expressed weakly and discontinuously in atopic dermatitis and mycosis fungoides, and not detected in the epidermis of normal skin; cPLA2α is not detected in either normal or psoriatic skin. These results suggest that cPLA2δ exhibits a unique distribution pattern compared with that of known cPLA2 subtypes, and it may play a critical role in inflammation in psoriatic lesions.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). One of the free fatty acids released by PLA2, arachidonic acid, is known to be the precursor of eicosanoids such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are potent inflammatory mediators. Among various mammalian PLA2s, calcium-dependent 85-kDa cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2α) is thought to have an important role in this process, because it is able to selectively release arachidonic acid (2Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). cPLA2α, which encodes a polypeptide of 749 amino acids that contains an N-terminal calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domain (the C2 domain) and a catalytic domain (2Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar), is expressed ubiquitously in many different tissues (3Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and is regulated post-translationally. In response to a submicromolar concentration of intracellular free calcium ions, cPLA2α is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum (2Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). This process is dependent on the N-terminal C2 domain (2Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). In addition to the calcium-regulated mechanism, it is also known that MAP kinases can phosphorylate Ser-505 of cPLA2α and directly activate its intrinsic enzymatic activity (4Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Recently, two new members of the cPLA2 family (cPLA2β and cPLA2γ) have been identified (3Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17063-17067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). cPLA2β encodes a polypeptide of 1012 amino acids that shares homology with both the C2 and catalytic domains of cPLA2α and is expressed ubiquitously (3Pickard R.T.

On the other hand, cPLA2γ encodes a polypeptide of 541 amino acids that shares homology with only the catalytic domain of cPLA2α. cPLA2γ exhibits calcium-independent activity due to the loss of the C2 domain and also has a prenylation site at the C terminus. It is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle (5Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to elucidate the function of these molecules in the arachidonic acid cascade and in inflammation. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that is associated with both genetic and environmental risk factors (7Farber E.M. Nall L.M. Dermatologica. 1974; 148: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 8Nickoloff B.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1161-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The psoriatic skin is characterized by the overgrowth and abnormal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, resulting in an impaired barrier function of the skin, and by the influx of activated immunocytes into both the epidermis and dermis, although the sequence of these events in the progression of psoriatic lesions is unclear (8Nickoloff B.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1161-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). PLA2s are among the numerous molecules that reportedly participate in the progression of psoriatic lesions. They are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis by releasing arachidonic acid as the source of inflammatory eicosanoids, because free arachidonic acid and eicosanoids such as leukotriene B4 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid are known to accumulate in psoriatic skin (9Hammarstorm S.

Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 837-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that transgenic mice overexpressing type IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2IIA) exhibit epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis in the absence of inflammatory infiltrate (11Grass D.S. Felkner R.H. Chiang M.-Y. Wallace R.E. Nevalainen T.J. Bennett C.F. Swanson M.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have described a new member of the human cPLA2 family that is induced in the epidermis of psoriatic skin and shows an epithelial-specific tissue distribution. Samples and Materials—Skin samples were obtained from diseased and normal skin of psoriatic patients, from age-matched healthy controls, and from patients with atopic dermatitis and mycosis fungoides. Informed consent was obtained from all individuals who were subjected to skin biopsies. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). COS-7 cells were obtained from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen. [α-32P]dCTP and Hybond-N+ were from Amersham Biosciences. Affinity purified polyclonal anti-cPLA2α and anti-sPLA2IIA antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Expression Profiling in Normal and Psoriatic Human Skin—Total RNA was isolated from all samples using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 3′-directed cDNA library was constructed from each total RNA sample derived from normal and psoriatic skin according to the methods of Okubo et al. (12Okubo K. Hori H. Matoba R. Niiyama T. Matsubara K. DNA Seq. 1991; 2: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Random sequencing of 10,000 clones from each library was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using an Applied Biosystems Model 373A automated sequencer and a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Biosystems). The frequency of appearance of each sequence was determined, and a search of sequence similarity against a DNA data bank was performed. Quantitative expression profiling of candidate genes in 7 normal skin samples, 10 psoriatic skin samples, 2 atopic dermatitis samples, and 3 mycosis fungoides samples was performed by a PCR-based method, introduced-amplified fragment length polymorphism (iAFLP) (13Kawamoto S. Ohnishi T. Kita H. Chisaka O. Okubo K. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was annealed with a pUC19-based vector primer, and first and second cDNA syntheses were performed. cDNA was cleaved with MboI and ligated with an iAFLP adapter cassette with T4 ligase. Using this cDNA as template, a competitive PCR reaction was performed. An autosequencer 377XL and GeneScan program (PE Biosystems) were used for sizing and quantitation of dye-labeled fragments. For amplification of GS21015, the PCR reaction was performed using Tamra-labeled T7 primer (5′-ACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATTACTT-3′) and GS21015-specific antisense primer (5′-TACACGACAAAACCACAT GA-3′). Screening of the cDNA Library—The partial 3′-untranslated region fragment of cPLA2δ cDNA (about 1.2 kb) was amplified by PCR using sense (5′-GTCCAGCGCAGCCCCGCAGA-3′) and antisense (5′-AAATACACGACAAAACCACA-3′) primers. To obtain the full-length cPLA2δ cDNA, library screening was performed as reported previously (14Imai Y. Suzuki Y. Tohyama M. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using the aforementioned cDNA fragment as a probe and a human keratinocyte cDNA library. A pBluescript II SK(-) plasmid containing an insert DNA was isolated from a positive plaque by an in vivo excision method (Stratagene), and the nucleotide sequence of the insert DNA was determined. Production of a Polyclonal Antibody to cPLA2δ—A fragment of cPLA2δ representing amino acids 1-224 (Fig. 1) was subcloned into a pGEX vector for expression of a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The expressed fusion protein, purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Expression of cPLA2s in COS-7 Cells and the PLA2 Assay—The open reading frame region of cPLA2α cDNA was PCR-amplified using the following primers: a 5′ sense primer with an associated EcoRV site (5′-GATCGATATCCATGTC-ATTTATAGATCCTTACCAGC-3′) and a 3′ antisense primer with an associated XhoI site (5′-GATCCTCGAGCTATGCTTTGGGTTTACTTAGAAAC-3′). The obtained cPLA2α cDNA and the open reading frame region of the cPLA2δ cDNA were each subcloned into a pcDNA4/HisMax vector (Invitrogen) and used to transfect COS-7 cells using a SuperFect transfection kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells harvested from a 10-cm dish were suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.34 m sucrose, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed with sonication on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was used as the lysate. The protein concentration was determined with a DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Anti-cPLA2δ polyclonal antibody and an Omni-probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for Western blot analysis to detect proteins that were expressed in the lysate. PLA2 activity was determined in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA as described previously (5Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) except for a minor change of substrate concentration (2 μm). 1-Palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine (PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl-PC, and 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]-oleoyl-PC (PerkinElmer Life Science) were used as substrates in the assay. The released free arachidonic acid was measured as described previously (16Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—A human multiple tissue Northern blot (Toyobo) was hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe as described for the library screening. Hybridization was performed by incubating the probe at 65 °C for 16 h in 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Finally, the membrane was washed with 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h and exposed to x-ray film at -70 °C for 2 days. In Situ Hybridization—A XbaI/AccI fragment of 720 bp in the 3′-untranslated region of cPLA2δ was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) and used for probe preparation. The cDNA fragments of the respective PLA2 subtypes were amplified by PCR and cloned into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) using the following primers: cPLA2α-5′ (5′-GGA-TCCTAATCAGGAAAATG-3′), cPLA2α-3′ (5′-GAATTCCTGATTCGTATAAT-3′), cPLA2β-5′ (5′-GAAGAGGCCATGGAGAAGGC-3′), cPLA2β-3′ (5′-CCTCCAGTT-GAACGTGCAAG-3′), cPLA2γ-5′ (5′-TCGAGGCTGACCTGAAACAT-3′), cPLA2γ-3′ (5′-CCAATTCTGAGCATCTCAG-3′), sPLA2IIA-5′ (5′-CCAT-GAAGACCCTCCTACTG-3′), sPLA2IIA-3′ (5′-GAGGGGACTCAGCAACGA-GG-3′). Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense cRNA probes were synthesized with T7, T3, and SP6 polymerase using a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit from Roche Diagnostics according to the manufacturer's instructions. In situ hybridization was performed on paraffin-embedded sections from normal and psoriatic skin as described previously (15Komminoth P. Merk F.B. Leav I. Wolfe H.J. Roth J. Histo-chemistry. 1992; 98: 217-228Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical observations were performed on paraffin-embedded sections from normal and psoriatic skin with an ABC kit (Vector Laboratory) using anti-cPLA2δ polyclonal antibody and affinity-purified anti-cPLA2α and anti-sPLA2IIA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Gene Expression Profiling in Normal and Psoriatic Human Skin—To monitor the difference in gene expression between normal and psoriatic skin, we constructed 3′-directed cDNA libraries from normal and psoriatic skin and determined the nucleotide sequence of 10,000 randomly selected clones from each of these libraries. Information was obtained for 3,156 independent 3′-expressed sequence tags (Gene Signature). The frequency information for the gene signature in each library provides a rough estimate of the mRNA composition of each source tissue. Some of the clones were identified by comparison with a DNA data bank. These included genes already known to be differentially expressed in psoriasis compared with normal skin, such as keratins 6, 16, and 17 (17Leigh I.M. Navsaria H. Purkis P.E. McKay I.A. Bowden P.E. Riddle P.N. Br. J. Dermatol. 1995; 133: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), psoriasin (18Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Leffers H. Honore B. Dejgaard K. Olsen E. Kiil J. Walbum E.

GS21015 Expression Profiling in Normal and Psoriatic Skin—We also obtained some undefined clones from the above procedure. To investigate the possible function of these genes, we searched their predicted cDNA sequences using exon the prediction software GenScan (21Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Consequently, we obtained a new gene, referred to as GS21015. The predicted GS21015 cDNA consists of 25 exons and encodes a polypeptide of 1020 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of GS21015 was highly homologous with cPLA2β, ∼50% within a region of 800 amino acids. The GS21015 sequence appeared three times in the 3705 clones from the psoriasis library. In contrast, it did not appear in the 4302 clones from the normal skin library. These results suggest that GS21015 mRNA expression is up-regulated in psoriatic skin. To confirm the up-regulation of GS21015 mRNA in psoriatic skin, we examined quantitative mRNA expression using the iAFLP method. Total RNA samples prepared from 7 normal and 10 psoriatic skin samples were used as templates for iAFLP. The relative data showed that the expression of GS21015 mRNA increased by about 9-fold (p < 0.001) in psoriatic skin compared with normal skin (Table I). Furthermore, to investigate whether GS21015 is up-regulated in other inflammatory skin diseases, two atopic dermatitis samples and three mycosis fungoides samples were analyzed in the same way. No significant difference was observed between normal skin and mycosis fungoides, but GS21015 was significantly increased (p < 0.001) in atopic dermatitis compared with normal skin.Table IComparison of cPLA2δ expression levels among different skin types using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (iAFLP)StateRelative peak area (no. of biopsies)Normal0.88 ± 0.38 (n = 7)Psoriasis7.89 ± 4.52 (n = 10)Atopic dermatitis4.35 ± 0.77 (n = 2)Mycosis fungoides2.11 ± 1.17 (n = 3) Open table in a new tab Cloning of the Full-length cPLA2δ cDNA (GS21015)—The full-length cDNA of GS21015 was isolated from a λ-phage human keratinocyte cDNA library by conventional hybridization screening. The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2454 nucleotides that encodes a polypeptide of 818 amino acids. (The DNA sequence data are available from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data bases under accession number AB090876.) A search of the GenBank™ Data Bank using the nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed a significant homology with members of the cPLA2 family (Fig. 1). The full-length cDNA, designated as cPLA2δ, showed the highest homology with cPLA2β. The open reading frame sequence of cPLA2δ cDNA shares 44.5, 59.9, and 45.7% identity with cPLA2α, cPLA2β, and cPLA2γ, respectively. The amino acid sequence of cPLA2δ shares 29, 50, and 27% identity and 49, 66, and 42% similarity with cPLA2α, cPLA2β, and cPLA2γ, respectively. The genomic BAC clone RP11-35K2, which contains the cPLA2δ gene, maps to human chromosome 15q15, which is near the 15q11.2-q21.3 chromosomal locus of the cPLA2β gene. The cPLA2α and cPLA2γ genes are present at chromosomal locus 1q25 and 19q13.3, respectively. Alignment of the cPLA2δ cDNA sequence with the genomic sequence showed that cPLA2δ cDNA contained 20 exons, including the 7th-25th exons predicted by GenScan, and also showed that all of the intron/exon boundaries follow the GT-AG rule. Residues in cPLA2α that are considered necessary for catalysis, such as Arg-200, Ser-228, and Asp-549, were conserved in cPLA2δ at Arg-333, Ser-361, and Asp-647, respectively (Fig. 1, asterisks). The Ser-505 in cPLA2α, which is known to be phosphorylated by ERK1/2 MAP kinases, is absent in cPLA2δ, which has no MAP kinase phosphorylation site motif, similar to cPLA2β and cPLA2γ. Expression of cPLA2δ in COS-7 Cells and PLA2 Activity—To investigate the enzymatic activity of cPLA2δ, we transfected COS-7 cells with a pcDNA4/HisMax vector containing the full-length cDNA of cPLA2δ. The vector only was transfected as a control. cPLA2δ protein of about 90 kDa was detected in the cPLA2δ-transfected cell lysate by Western blot using an anti-cPLA2δ polyclonal antibody and an anti-express tag antibody (Omni-probe). cPLA2δ was detected as a doublet, probably because of post-translational modification (Fig. 2A). PLA2 activities were determined in cell lysates of the cPLA2δ-transfected cells and vector-transfected cells using 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-PC as a substrate. The amount of arachidonic acid released by the cPLA2δ-transfected cell lysate was 5-6 times higher than that released by the vector-transfected cell lysate (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that cPLA2δ is functional as a PLA2 enzyme. A similar level of PLA2 activity was obtained for a cPLA2α-transfected cell lysate (as a positive control) (Fig. 2B), although the quantity of expressed cPLA2δ protein estimated from the Western analysis was much higher than that of cPLA2α (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that the specific activity of cPLA2δ might be considerably lower than that of cPLA2α. The activity of cPLA2β has been reported to be about 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of cPLA2α (3Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and therefore the level of cPLA2δ activity may be similar to that of cPLA2β. When the PLA2 assay was performed in the absence of free calcium ions, no activity was detected in the lysate (Fig. 2C). This result indicates that cPLA2δ has a functional C2 domain. We next investigated the substrate specificity of cPLA2δ in the sn-2 position. PLA2 activities were determined in cell lysates of the cPLA2α-, cPLA2δ-, and vector-transfected cells using 14C-labeled substrates including oleic acid or linoleic acid instead of arachidonic acid, in the sn-2 position (Table II). cPLA2α lysate released arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position most efficiently, as described previously (2Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). In contrast, cPLA2δ lysate released similar levels of oleic acid and arachidonic acid and released linoleic acid about 6 times more efficiently than arachidonic acid. This result suggests that the activity of cPLA2δ is not arachidonic acid-specific and that cPLA2δ has linoleic acid-specific activity.Table IISubstrate specificity of cPLA2δ at the sn-2 positionSubstrateVector controlcPLA2αcPLA2δ1-Pam-2-[14C]Ach-PtdCho2.49 ± 0.239.34 ± 0.819.23 ± 0.631-Pam-2-[14C]Lin-PtdCho−0.52 ± 0.686.13 ± 0.1058.56 ± 13.771-Pam-2-[14C]Ole-PtdCho−0.70 ± 0.400.27 ± 0.5110.99 ± 0.24 Open table in a new tab Epithelium-specific Expression of cPLA2δ—To determine whether the expression of the cPLA2δ transcript is specific to skin, Northern blot analysis was performed using human multiple tissue mRNA blots with the cPLA2δ cDNA fragment as a probe. The mRNA of cPLA2δ was detected as a band of about 4 kb in fetal skin, cervix, and, to a lesser extent, in prostate but not in other tissues (Fig. 3). Among the tissues examined, only skin and cervix contain stratified squamous epithelia, and both expressed cPLA2δ strongly. Other epithelial tissues such as lung, stomach and colon, which consist of simple or pseudostratified columnar epithelia, appeared not to express cPLA2δ. Therefore, this suggests that cPLA2δ is expressed specifically in stratified squamous epithelia. Increased Expression of cPLA2δ in the Epidermis of Psoriatic Skin—To confirm the increased expression of cPLA2δ in psoriatic skin compared with normal skin, and to identify the cells that express cPLA2δ in the skin, we performed an in situ hybridization analysis on paraffin-embedded tissue sections from samples of normal skin, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and mycosis fungoides using a cRNA probe derived from the 3′-cDNA fragment of cPLA2δ. The results showed that cPLA2δ mRNA was expressed strongly in the upper epidermis of psoriatic skin but not in the lower epidermis and dermis (Fig. 4B). In contrast, cPLA2δ was not detected in normal skin, even in the upper epidermis where normally differentiated keratinocytes were distributed (Fig. 4A). In atopic dermatitis, cPLA2δ expression was observed in the upper epidermis, but the signal was discontinuous, whereas a continuous signal was observed in psoriatic skin (Fig. 4C). In mycosis fungoides, a very weak, discontinuous signal was observed in the upper epidermis. No such signal was ever seen in normal skin. These results suggest that the expression of cPLA2δ is increased in inflammatory skin diseases, especially in psoriasis. To confirm the expression of other PLA2 subtypes in psoriatic skin, in situ hybridization was also performed using cPLA2α, cPLA2β, cPLA2γ, and sPLA2IIA cRNA probes. The results showed that none of the PLA2 subtypes could be detected in either normal or psoriatic skins (data not shown). Although the lack of detection may reflect the low sensitivity of this experiment, it is possible that over-expression of these subtypes does not occur in psoriatic skin compared with normal skin. To investigate the cPLA2δ protein expression further, we prepared a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal 224 amino acids of cPLA2δ. An immunohistochemical analysis using the antibody showed that cPLA2δ was expressed in the upper epidermis of psoriatic skin but was not detected in normal skin (Fig. 5, A and C), a similar result to that found in in situ hybridization. A weak signal was seen in the basal layer of normal skin, but this was considered to be because of melanin pigmentation, as there is similar pigmentation in dewaxed-only sections with hematoxilin staining (Fig. 5B). Therefore it was concluded that this weak signal is not cPLA2δ-specific. We also investigated the expression of cPLA2α and sPLA2IIA in normal and psoriatic skin using commercially available antibodies. sPLA2IIA was detected in the upper epidermis of psoriatic skin but not in normal skin (Fig. 5, F and G), although no in situ hybridization signal was detected in either skin type. cPLA2α was not detected in either skin type (Fig. 5, D and E). In this study we isolated a novel cPLA2 subtype, which we designated as cPLA2δ. cPLA2δ has significant homology with the known cPLA2 subtypes, cPLA2α, cPLA2β, and cPLA2γ, in both the C2 and catalytic domains. Among the three known subtypes, cPLA2δ seems to be the most closely related to cPLA2β in terms of sequence similarity and chromosomal location. However, cPLA2δ is expressed specifically in stratified squamous epithelia, whereas cPLA2β is expressed widely in many tissues (3Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The expression of cPLA2δ is markedly increased in psoriatic skin, but cPLA2β is not detected in either psoriatic or normal skin. Although the possibility that cPLA2β mRNA expression is below the detection limit of in situ hybridization cannot be ruled out, these results suggest that cPLA2β and cPLA2δ are subject to different transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and may have distinct physiological roles in the human body. As expected, cPLA2δ has calcium-dependent PLA2 activity when expressed in COS-7 cells. Therefore, cPLA2δ activity might be regulated by intracellular calcium levels and by a variety of other stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines that may cause translocation of cPLA2δ as well as cPLA2α. cPLA2δ was detected as a doublet band by Western blotting, the cause of which is unclear. The activity of cPLA2α is regulated by phosphorylation (4Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), and hence this raises the question of whether cPLA2δ is also activated enzymatically through phosphorylation. However, cPLA2δ contains no MAP kinase phosphorylation site motif, an issue that remains to be elucidated. There is strongly induced expression of cPLA2δ in the upper layer of the psoriatic epidermis, which consists of abnormally differentiated keratinocytes. These keratinocytes have been activated by inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ, which are released by infiltrated T cells in which diverse genes are activated transcriptionally or post-translationally. cPLA2δ could also be activated transcriptionally by such stimuli. In contrast, cPLA2α was not detected in the normal and psoriatic epidermis at both the mRNA and protein levels, and therefore it appears not to be increased in psoriatic skin compared with normal skin. cPLA2β and cPLA2γ mRNA were also not detected in normal or psoriatic skin. sPLA2IIA is the only PLA2 subtype that has previously been reported to be increased in psoriasis (22Andersen S. Sjursen W. Laegreid A. Volden G. Johansen B. Inflammation. 1994; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); we also confirmed this result at the protein level although failing to detect the sPLA2IIA mRNA. A similar result has been reported in a different species. sPLA2IIA was detected in several rat tissues by immunohistochemistry and Northern blotting, but no in situ hybridization signal was detected (23Nyman K.M. Ojala P. Laine V.J. Nevalainen T.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1469-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the case of this gene, mRNA expression may be below the detection limit of the current methods of tissue preservation and in situ hybridization. On the basis of the results of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses, cPLA2δ is expressed in psoriasis at a higher level than sPLA2IIA. It is thus likely that cPLA2δ is the most abundant PLA2 subtype in psoriatic skin. The result of the enzyme assay suggests that cPLA2δ preferentially releases linoleic acid in the sn-2 position and, to a lesser extent, arachidonic acid and oleic acid. In psoriatic skin, it has been reported that 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids, which are linoleic acid metabolites, are the principal fatty acid derivatives (24Baer A.N. Costello P.B. Green F.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 125-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that in psoriatic skin the release of linoleic acid from membrane phospholipids occurs efficiently along with arachidonic acid release due to cPLA2δ induction. It has been reported that PLA2 activity and the amount of free arachidonic acid were markedly increased in psoriatic skin compared with normal skin (9Hammarstorm S. Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Duell E.A. Stawiski M. Voorhees J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 5130-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and that multiple topical applications of arachidonic acid to the skin of a mouse ear over several days induced acanthosis (epidermal hyperplasia), hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and intraepidermal neutrophil accumulation (25Doherty N.S. Beaver T.H. Rheins L.A. Nordlund J.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 298-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which are the hallmarks of psoriatic skin. Therefore, it is suggested that the release of arachidonic acid in the epidermis is an important event in the onset of psoriasis, and cPLA2δ might have a central role in the production of free arachidonic acid in psoriatic skin. Hence, there is a possibility that the selective inhibition of cPLA2δ might result in the healing of psoriasis and would also have minimal side effects due to the restricted distribution of cPLA2δ. To investigate these possibilities, further studies, such as the construction of transgenic mice expressing cPLA2δ constitutively in the epidermis and a study of the effects of specific inhibitors on inflammatory skin models, will be required."
https://openalex.org/W2030651372,"Induction of heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression by stress is initiated by binding of HSF1 to HSP gene promoters to increase their transcription. The cytoprotective functions of these HSPs are essential for cell survival, and thus it is critical that inducible HSP gene expression be executed rapidly and efficiently. Here we report an interaction between heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and symplekin, a protein known to form a complex with the polyadenylation factors CstF and CPSF. HSF1-symplekin complexes are detected only after stress treatment, and these two proteins co-localize in punctate nuclear structures in stressed cells. HSF1 also complexes in a stress-induced manner with the 3′ processing factor CstF-64. Interfering with HSF1-symplekin interaction by overexpressing a non-DNA-binding mutant HSF1 protein significantly decreases Hsp70 mRNA polyadenylation in stressed cells, supporting the functional role for HSF1 in promoting 3′ processing of this transcript. Importantly, this was also found to result in a significant loss of Hsp70 protein induction and increased cell death in response to stress exposure. These results indicate that the HSF1-symplekin interaction functions as a mechanism for recruiting polyadenylation factors to HSP genes to enhance the efficiency/kinetics of production of mature Hsp mRNA transcripts to achieve the critical cellular need for rapid HSP expression after stress. Thus, HSF1 regulates HSP gene expression at not one but two different steps of the expression pathway, functioning both as a transcription factor and a polyadenylation stimulatory factor.

In response to stress HSF1 is converted from a monomeric form that is unable to bind DNA to a trimeric form that binds with high affinity to heat shock elements in the promoters of HSP genes, particularly the HSP70 gene, to induce their transcription (1Christians E.S.

The increased levels of Hsp70 and other HSP molecular chaperone proteins that result are critical for the ability of cells to survive exposure to stress conditions, and thus it is vital that the steps of HSP expression between HSF1 promoter binding and HSP mRNA translation be executed as quickly and efficiently as possible (4Naylor D.J. Hartl F.U. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 68: 45-68Google Scholar, 5Kregel K.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 6Jaattela M. Ann.

Symplekin is a protein that has been shown to interact with the polyadenylation factors CPSF and CstF, and it has been implicated as playing an important role in polyadenylation by acting as a molecular scaffold to bring both CPSF and CstF together into the same complex (8Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Hofmann I. Schnolzer M. Kaufmann I. Franke W.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1665-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In this study we report the identification of an interaction between HSF1 and symplekin. The results show that HSF1 interaction with symplekin is stress-dependent and that HSF1-containing complexes in stressed cells also contain the polyadenylation factor CstF-64. Further, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrates that HSF1 and symplekin colocalize in punctate bodies in the nuclei of stressed cells. Importantly, interfering with the interaction between HSF1 and symplekin results in a decreased efficiency of polyadenylation of Hsp70 mRNA transcripts in stressed cells, loss of Hsp70 protein induction, and a significant increase in cell death upon exposure to stress. These results suggest that the HSF1-symplekin interaction plays a critical role in the cellular stress response by maximizing the kinetics and efficiency of Hsp70 mRNA polyadenylation via recruitment of polyadenylation factors to HSP genes, thereby helping to ensure that cells can produce elevated levels of the Hsp70 protein as quickly as possible.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGST-symplekin and His6-HSF1 Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Interaction Assays—The full-length coding region of human symplekin (amino acid resides 1–1274) was amplified from a full-length symplekin EST (expressed sequence tag) plasmid (GenBank™ AL560175) by PCR incorporating EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites and inserted into pGEX-MPB. The construct was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), washing, and elution. After extensive washing with buffer D (10Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) with 100 mm NaCl, proteins were eluted with buffer D containing 50 mm glutathione. The pQE30-HSF1β protein construct was expressed in E. coli and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen), washed with buffer D, and incubated with 50 ng of purified GST-symplekin at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with buffer D plus 100 mm NaCl, and then subjected to Western blot analysis with mouse monoclonal anti-symplekin antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). The resulting bands were quantitated from a digital image using Kodak image processing software.Cell Culture and Heat Shock Conditions—HeLa cells were cultured at 37C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Human erythroleukemia K562 and K562 HSF1-PD (K562 cells stably transfected with HSF1 point mutant, which lacks DNA binding ability) were the kind gifts of Stuart Calderwood (11Chen C. Xie Y.

They were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Analysis—Nuclei were prepared from HeLa cells (≈106) by a hypotonic lysis protocol (10Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated as described previously (12Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12967-12970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using 3 μl of anti-HSF1 polyclonal antibody or 10 μl of anti-IgG control antibody (Sigma) bound to 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and then analyzed by Western blot using anti-symplekin mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or anti-CstF64 mouse monoclonal antibody (generously provided by Yoshio Takagaki, University of Virginia) (13Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T.A Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The resulting bands were quantitated from a digital image using Kodak image processing software. Western blot analysis of Hsp70 levels was performed using antibody SPA-812 (StressGen) specific for the stress-inducible Hsp70i protein or β-actin antibody (Sigma A5441) as loading control. For Hsp70i 35S in vivo labeling/immunoprecipitation analysis, after heat treatment at 43 °C for 30 min the K562 and K562 HSF1-PD cells were washed and resuspended in prewarmed (37 °C) pulse-label medium (RPMI 1640 without methionine and cysteine, ICN) at 37 °C for 15 min to deplete intracellular pools of methionine and cysteine and then labeled with Tran35S-label (ICN) at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1%Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate), and then subjected to immunoprecipitation using the anti-Hsp70i antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography.Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—Yeast strain pJ694A was transfected with pGBD-HSF1 bait and used to screen a mouse embryo yeast two-hybrid library. The interaction between the pGBD-HSF1 and pVP16-symplekin-(1–124) was verified by streaking the yeast containing these constructs or pGBD-HSF1 bait and empty pVP16 plasmid (as negative control) on -TL, -HTL, and -ATL plates (12Hong Y.

Sense primer 3 (5′-agtcatgtgtgagagagctacctaacatgacaGGGCCTTTCCAAGATTGCTG-3′; lowercase letters indicate a 30-bp nonhomologous sequences) and antisense primer 4 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGacgtggactctgATCTGCCCTTACTGGAAGC-3′; a 19 bp T7 promoter is underlined, and lowercase letters indicate a 12-nucleotide nonhomologous sequence) were used for amplification of human Hsp70 3′-untranslated region (a 427-bp PCR product yielding a 409-nucleotide RNA transcript, of which 260 nucleotides are homologous to the Hsp70 sequence surrounding the site of poly(A) addition). Antisense riboprobes were labeled with biotin-16-UTP using T7 RNA polymerase (MAXIscript kit, Ambion) and resuspended in water. Total RNA was isolated from heat-treated K562 and K562 HSF-1-PD cells using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). RNase protection assays were performed using the Ambion protocol with minor modification. The 1 ng of labeled probe was co-precipitated with 5 μg of total RNA and then resuspended in 10 μl of hybridization buffer. Following a 16-h incubation at 56 °C, samples were digested at 37 °C for 30 min with 2.5 units/ml RNase A and 100 units/ml RNase T1 (Ambion), ethanol-precipitated, separated on an 8 m urea-6% polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to nylon membrane, UV-cross-linked, and visualized with a SuperSignal kit (Pierce). The resulting bands were quantitated from a digital image using Kodak image processing software.Measurement of Cell Viability—K562 and K562 HSF1-PD cells were pretreated at 43 °C for 30 min, returned to 37 °C for 4 h to develop thermotolerance, exposed to a stringent 45 °C heat treatment for 20 min, and then placed at 37 °C for 40 h, after which they were subjected to a trypan blue exclusion assay to determine the number of viable cells. A parallel aliquot of cells kept at 37 °C for the duration of this experiment (45 h) was also counted by trypan blue exclusion assay as a control. The percent viability was calculated and expressed according to the following equation: viability (%) [(number of viable cells with heat stress)/(number of viable cells under nonstress conditions (kept at 37 °C)) × 100%].RESULTSTo advance the understanding of the critical role of HSF1 in mediating stress-induced transcription of HSP genes, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify HSF1-interacting proteins. One of the partners identified was symplekin, a protein previously found to associate with the CPSF and CstF factors involved in mRNA polyadenylation (Fig. 1A) (8Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Hofmann I. Schnolzer M. Kaufmann I. Franke W.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1665-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The clone identified in our screen represented a region at the N terminus of symplekin comprising amino acids 1–124 (Fig. 1B). As an independent test of the interaction between HSF1 and symplekin, and to determine whether the interaction is direct, we performed an in vitro pull-down assay. The results, shown in Fig. 1C, indicate that His6-HSF1 specifically bound purified recombinant symplekin. Quantitation of the data revealed that 62% of the input symplekin was bound, indicating the efficiency of interaction of these two proteins.To test for interaction between endogenous HSF1 and symplekin we performed immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicate the existence of a specific interaction between the endogenous proteins and demonstrate that this complex is only found in cells that have been exposed to heat shock treatment (Fig. 2A). To test whether HSF1 also associates with other components of the polyadenylation machinery such as the CstF complex, we performed an immunoprecipitation analysis of HSF1 interaction with the CstF-64 protein. The results indicate that HSF1 is indeed found in a complex with CstF-64 and that, as with symplekin, this association is observed only after cells have been exposed to stress conditions (Fig. 2B). We quantitated these data and determined that in the symplekin immunoprecipitation 0.74% of the symplekin protein in the input was recovered, and in the CstF-64 immunoprecipitation 0.80% of the CstF-64 protein in the input was recovered. This is consistent with our expectations that only a fraction of the total cellular symplekin and CstF-64 would likely be associated with HSF1. We also noted that, because our results would represent only the complexes that survived the antibody binding incubations and washes of the immunoprecipitation protocol, these are likely to be conservative estimates of the amounts of HSF1-symplekin and HSF1-CstF-64 complexed in the cell.Fig. 2Stress-induced association of HSF1 with symplekin and CstF-64. A, extracts of nonstressed (37 °C) and heat-shocked (42 °C, 60 min) HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with HSF1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (10Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

To test whether symplekin was also found in these bodies we performed a co-immunofluorescence analysis of these two proteins in nonstressed and heat-treated HeLa cells. The results of this experiment, shown in Fig. 3, reveal that a portion of the symplekin protein colocalizes with HSF1 in these foci in a stress-dependent manner, suggesting that these bodies may represent a site where HSF1 associates with symplekin, perhaps promoted by the concentration of these two partners in the bodies.Fig. 3Co-localization of HSF1 and symplekin in nuclear bodies of heat-shocked cells. Nonstressed (37 °C) and heat-shocked (42 °C, 60 min) HeLa cells were subjected to immunofluorescence using anti-HSF1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (10Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) and anti-symplekin mouse monoclonal antibodies detected with anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled and anti-mouse Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The stress-induced nature of the interaction of HSF1 with symplekin and CstF-64 suggests that it could be important for assisting HSF1 function in up-regulating expression of HSP genes. Specifically, in light of the known functions of symplekin/CstF-64, we postulated that this interaction could serve as a mechanism for enhancing the efficiency of polyadenylation of Hsp70 mRNA transcripts by recruiting symplekin-CstF to HSP gene promoters and the associated polymerase II complex, similar to the described function of TFIID in recruiting CPSF to polymerase II on promoters (17Dantonel J.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Tora L. Nature. 1997; 389: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we examined the polyadenylation efficiency of Hsp70 mRNA transcripts in heat-treated cells, either in K562 cells or K562 cells that stably express a mutant HSF1 protein that is unable to bind DNA because of a point mutation in its DNA-binding domain (K562 HSF1-PD cell line) (11Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The reasoning was that the mutant HSF1 protein would bind to symplekin, thereby reducing the amount of symplekin available for association with the endogenous wild-type HSF1 and decreasing the efficiency of Hsp70 mRNA polyadenylation. Parental K562 cells and the K562 HSF1-PD cells were subjected to heat shock treatment at 42 °C for 30 or 60 min, after which total RNA isolated from these cells was analyzed by RNase protection assay using two different probes, one hybridizing to the 3′ cleavage site and the other to an internal region of the transcript for normalization purposes (positions shown in Fig. 4A). The results demonstrate that the cells harboring the mutant HSF1 protein exhibit a significantly lower efficiency of 3′ end formation than the parental K562 cells (Fig. 4B). The total levels of Hsp70 mRNA transcripts (detected by internal probe) are not appreciably affected by the presence of the HSF1 mutant protein, suggesting that it does not affect Hsp70 gene transcription to any significant extent. Because this mutant protein is unable to bind the Hsp70i promoter, it presumably is unable to interfere with the assembly of transcription complexes on this promoter. Quantitation of the RNase protection results reveal approximate 60 and 70% decreases in Hsp70 mRNA 3′ end processing in the K562 HSF1-PD cells for the 30- and 60-min heat shock treatment samples, respectively (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Expression of DNA binding-defective HSF1 mutant inhibits polyadenylation of Hsp70 mRNA in heat-shocked cells. A, location and design of probes (pr.) used for RNase protection assay. 173-nucleotide Hsp70 internal probe (Int. pr.) and 408 nucleotide poly(A) probe (poly(A) pr.) yield protected fragment sizes of 131 and 260 nucleotides (for polyadenylated Hsp70 mRNA), respectively. B, K562 cells or a K562 cell line stably transfected with an HSF1 point mutant (HSF1-PD) (11Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol.

Total RNA isolated from these cells was subjected to RNase protection assay using probes indicated in A. In C, bands from two independent experiments were quantitated, and the values obtained for the poly(A) protection products were normalized to those of the internal probe protection products and expressed as percent relative to values in the K562 cells (100%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This loss of Hsp70 mRNA polyadenylation is correlated with a significant decrease in induction of Hsp70 protein in response to heat stress (Fig. 5, A–C). Similar results were obtained for both K562 (Fig. 5, A and C) and CHO versions (Fig. 5B) of HSF1-PD cell lines, using both a direct Hsp70 Western blot approach (Fig. 5, A and B) and 35S in vivo pulse labeling/immunoprecipitation measurements of Hsp70 levels (Fig. 5C). Importantly, the reduced Hsp70 protein induction observed in HSF1-PD cells is associated with a significant increase in the levels of cell death following stress exposure (Fig. 5D), indicating the critical importance of HSF1-enhanced polyadenylation for the ability of cells to survive stress treatment.Fig. 5Decreased Hsp70 induction and cell viability in HSF1-PD cells. K562 and K562 HSF1-PD cells (A) or CHO and CHO HSF1-PD cells (B) were kept at 37 °C or heat-shocked at 43 °C for 30 min followed by a 4-h recovery at 37 °C to allow expression of heat shock proteins and then subjected to Western blot using Hsp70 antibody or β-actin antibody as the loading control. C, K562 and K562 HSF1-PD cells were heat-shocked at 43 °C for 30 min, switched to medium lacking methionine and cysteine at 37 °C for 15 min, and then labeled with Tran35S-label (ICN) at 37 °C for 2 h followed by immunoprecipitation with Hsp70 antibodies and SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. D, K562 and K562 HSF1-PD cells were heat-shocked at 43 °C for 30 min followed by 37 °C for 4 h to allow development of thermotolerance before being subjected to a stringent 45 °C treatment for 20 min. Cells were returned to 37 °C for 40 h followed by trypan blue staining to determine the number of viable cells remaining for each cell line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONA fascinating development in the study of gene expression has been the finding that transcription and mRNA processing events such as capping, splicing, and polyadenylation are not independent events and can be coupled (18Minvielle-Sebastia L.

For example, interaction between the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and CPSF/CstF polyadenylation factors allows coupling to occur between transcription and polyadenylation events (23McCracken S.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). TFIID interaction with CPSF represents a mechanism for loading CPSF onto the C-terminal domain, but whether a similar mechanism existed for recruitment of the CstF complex to promoters is not known (17Dantonel J.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Tora L. Nature. 1997; 389: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, and more relevant to our present study, because these mechanisms involve components involved in transcription of all class II genes, RNA polymerase II and TFIID, it was also not known whether related mechanisms exist that could couple transcription to 3′ processing in a gene- or gene family-specific manner. Such a mechanism would make particular biological sense in the case of genes whose expression needs to be rapidly induced in response to some signal.Our results indicate that this mechanism does exist, at least in the case of stress-induced transcription of HSP genes, and that it is mediated by interaction between HSF1 and the symplekin protein. It will be fascinating to explore whether symplekin interacts with other transcription factors responsible for regulating genes in which products are required to be rapidly inducible. Indeed, symplekin makes an ideal partner for such interactions because it associates with both CstF and CPSF complexes (8Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Hofmann I. Schnolzer M. Kaufmann I. Franke W.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1665-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and thus interacting with symplekin could allow a transcription factor to efficiently recruit both of these components critical for 3′ processing to promoters it binds.Finally, these data reveal that HSF1 positively regulates stress-induced HSP gene expression at not one but two distinct steps in the gene expression pathway. Thus, in addition to its well characterized function in stimulating the transcription of HSP genes, our results now show that HSF1 also acts to enhance polyadenylation of the resulting HSP mRNA transcripts via its interaction with the symplekin-3′ processing complex. The existence of this mechanism demonstrates even further the critical role played by HSF1 in the cellular stress response and underscores the vital importance of stress-induced HSP gene expression for cell function and survival.

Tumor necrosis factor-induced protein-6 (TNFIP6) is essential for this transfer reaction. Female mice deficient in TNFIP6 are infertile due to the lack of a correctly formed cumulus matrix. In this report, we characterize the specificity of TNFIP6-mediated HC transfer from IαI to hyaluronan. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides with eight or more monosaccharide units are potent acceptors in the HC transfer, with longer oligosaccharides being somewhat more efficient. Epimerization of the N-acetyl-glucosamine residues to N-acetyl-galactosamines (i.e. in chondroitin) still allows the HC transfer although at a significantly lower efficiency. Sulfation of the N-acetyl-galactosamines in dermatan-4-sulfate or chondroitin-6-sulfate prevents the HC transfer. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides disperse cumulus cells from expanding cumulus cell-oocyte complexes with the same size specificity as their HC acceptor specificity. This process is accompanied by the loss of hyaluronan-linked HCs from the cumulus matrix and the appearance of oligosaccharide-linked HCs in the culture medium.

The cellular events of matrix formation, which include the synthesis and organization of hyaluronan (HA) around the cumulus cells, have been studied extensively in mouse COCs both in vivo and in vitro (8Salustri A. Camaioni A. Di Giacomo M. Fulop C. Hascall V.C. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1999; 5: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After the LH surge, COCs quickly upregulate the expression of hyaluronan synthase 2, the enzyme required to produce hyaluronan (9Fulop C. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although the mediators that induce hyaluronan synthesis in the COCs in vivo have yet to be determined, prostaglandin E2, follicular stimulating hormone and epidermal growth factor are potent initiators of hyaluronan production in vitro (10Dekel N.

Science. 2002; 296: 2178-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), and growth differentiation factor-9 and bone morphogenic protein 15 are the most likely oocyte-derived growth factors involved in this regulation (16Elvin J.A.

Particularly, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (IαI)-related proteins have been shown to be crucial for cumulus matrix formation both in vitro and in vivo (19Zhuo L. Yoneda M. Zhao M. Yingsung W. Yoshida N.

IαI and pre-α-trypsin inhibitor (PαI) are the two major serum-derived IαI family proteins synthesized by hepatocytes. IαI and PαI are covalent complexes of bikunin (the light chain with trypsin inhibitor activity), and either one or two of three heavy chains (HCs) linked through a chondroitin sulfate chain (24Salier J.P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In mice, these serum proteins diffuse into the preovulatory follicle from the capillaries after the LH surge (25Powers R.W. Chen L. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E290-E298PubMed Google Scholar), and their HCs incorporate into the cumulus matrix through covalent linkages to HA (26Chen L. Zhang H. Powers R.W. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19409-19414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The links between HCs and HA are most likely ester bonds formed between the N-acetyl-glucosamine residues of HA and the C-terminal aspartic acid residues of the HCs, as previously described for the HA-HC complexes in the synovial fluid (27Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In vitro, COC expansion does not occur in the absence of the IαI family proteins (i.e. serum) (22Chen L. Mao S.J. Larsen W.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20473-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cumulus cells synthesize hyaluronan at a normal rate under these conditions, but release it into the culture medium, rather than form an extracellular matrix (28Camaioni A. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Salustri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20473-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of IαI family proteins in vivo has been established by studies with bikunin-deficient mice (19Zhuo L. Yoneda M. Zhao M. Yingsung W. Yoshida N. Kitagawa Y. Kawamura K. Suzuki T.

Bikunin-null mice are unable to synthesize IαI family members; their females do not correctly form the cumulus extracellular matrix and are infertile. Tumor necrosis factor-induced protein 6 (TNFIP6, also known as TSG6) is another matrix protein that is essential for cumulus matrix formation. TNFIP6 is synthesized by both cumulus and granulosa cells during the process of COC expansion (20Varani S. Elvin J.A. Yan C. DeMayo J. DeMayo F.J. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Matzuk M.M. Mol.

The protein exists in two forms, a monomer and a covalent complex with either of the HCs of IαI, in the extracellular matrix of expanded COCs (30Yoshioka S. Ochsner S. Russell D.L. Ujioka T. Fujii S. Richards J.S. Espey L.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4114-4119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we and others have demonstrated that the presence of TNFIP6 is crucial for the transfer of HCs from IαI to HA (21Fulop C. Szanto S. Mukhopadhyay D. Bardos T. Kamath R.V. Rugg M.S. Day A.J.

Reproduction. 2003; 125: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This transesterification reaction appears to be necessary for the formation of the COC extracellular matrix. Female mice lacking Tnfip6 are unable to perform this mandatory reaction and do not assemble the cumulus extracellular matrix leading to infertility (21Fulop C. Szanto S. Mukhopadhyay D. Bardos T. Kamath R.V. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Development. 2003; 130: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Previous studies have implemented the approach to inhibit cumulus matrix formation by administrating HA oligosaccharides as competitors for endogenous polymeric HA (2Hess K.A. Chen L. Larsen W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Camaioni A. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Salustri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20473-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this inhibition remains largely unexplored. In this study, we report that HA oligosaccharides of defined sizes are potent acceptors in the TNFIP6-mediated HC transfer reaction, with an octamer being the smallest effective size. Our data also indicate that the chemical composition of the acceptor glycosaminoglycan chain greatly influences the TNFIP6-mediated HC transfer reaction. HA oligosaccharides inhibit COC expansion with the same size specificity as the HC transfer, strongly suggesting a direct functional link between the transesterification reaction and the assembly of the cumulus matrix.

The samples were boiled in reducing Laemmli's loading buffer for 5 min and loaded on 4–20% SDS-PAGE precast gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-IαI (1:1000). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:10000) was used as a secondary antibody. Bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for the TNFIP6-mediated HC Transfer—Maxisorp plates were coated with 50 μg (or as the experimental procedures required) of high molecular weight hyaluronan in 50 μl of PBS at room temperature overnight. The wells were blocked with 150 μl of 2.5% skim milk in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. Mouse serum, human recombinant TNFIP6, and glycosaminoglycans were added in a total volume of 50 μl in PBS as the experimental protocols required. The optimal amount of mouse serum that produced low nonspecific binding was found to be 0.1 μl and was used in all the reactions. HC transfer reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 24 h. In the time course experiments, the reaction was stopped at the given time points by the addition of 50 μl of 100 mm EDTA, since previous studies suggested the requirement of divalent cations (32Jessen T.E. Odum L. Reproduction. 2003; 125: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After completion of the reaction, the plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 10 min, and then incubated with 100 μl of anti-IαI antibody (1:1000) in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were washed three times as above, and then 100 μl of HRPO-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:5000) was added in PBS/0.05% Tween 20. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and three times with detergentfree PBS. The color reaction was developed by adding 100 μl of 1 mg/ml orthophenylenediamine and 0.1 μl/ml hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.0. Color development was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 4 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance values were read at 490 nm using a Spectramax 250 ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp, Sunnyvale, CA). Isolation and Culture of COCs—Sexually immature (21 days old) Swiss CD1 female mice were primed by intraperitoneal injection of 5 international units of PMSG, in 0.1 ml PBS. After 46–48 h, the animals were sacrificed, and their ovaries were dissected out in MEM containing 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 ng/ml gentamycin. Compact COCs were collected by puncturing large follicles, and washed in culture medium containing MEM, 3 mm glutamine, 0.3 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 ng/ml gentamycin. COCs were cultured in 300 μl of culture medium containing 1 mm dbcAMP and mouse serum (generally 5% if not indicated otherwise) at 37 °C, for 16 h. HA oligosaccharides, chondroitin, and chondroitin 22-mer were added at concentrations indicated in the Result section. Certain cultures were also supplemented with 1 μg/ml recombinant TNFIP6. COC expansion was assessed with an Olympus inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Characterization of Medium and Matrix Fractions of Cultured COCs—COCs with their culture medium were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 300 × g, 4 °C for 3 min. The culture medium was carefully removed, and the COCs were washed three times with PBS and centrifuged as above. After resuspension in PBS, the complexes were digested with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (10 milliunits/100 COC) at 37 °C for 1 h to release matrix molecules bound to hyaluronan. After digestion, the cells were pelleted at 300 × g, 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were aspirated and called as matrix fraction. Aliquots of medium were similarly digested with Streptomyces hyaluronidase at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-IαI antibody as described above. TNFIP6-mediated HCs Transfer from IαI and PαI to HA Oligosaccharides—We and others (21Fulop C. Szanto S. Mukhopadhyay D. Bardos T. Kamath R.V. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Development. 2003; 130: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 32Jessen T.E. Odum L. Reproduction. 2003; 125: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have previously shown that TNFIP6 is essential for the transfer of HCs from IαI and PαI to high molecular weight HA. In order to investigate the size specificity of the TNFIP6-mediated HC transfer to HA, small oligosaccharides of defined sizes were incubated with mouse serum (as the source of IαI and PαI) in the presence of recombinant TNFIP6 at 37 °C for 24 h. Western blot analysis with anti-IαI antiserum indicated that in this cell free biochemical reaction, it was possible to transfer HCs from IαI and PαI not only to high molecular weight HA but also to HA oligosaccharides (Fig. 1). The transfer of the HCs were apparent from the disappearance or the reduction of the IαI and PαI bands and from the appearance of new bands either at the level of HCs (∼85 kDa, in the case of oligosaccharides) or at the wells (in the case of high molecular weight HA). As we described previously, incubation of high molecular weight HA and serum without TNFIP6 did not transfer HCs to HA (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The addition of recombinant TNFIP6 caused the whole IαI band and most of the PαI band to disappear and a high molecular weight HA-HC complex to appear (Fig. 1A, lane 1). HA oligosaccharides with 8 or more monosaccharide units were potent acceptors in the HC transfer reaction (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8). In these reactions, the size of the IαI-reactive bands at the HC level increased with the size of the HA oligosaccharide, indicating that the HCs were actually transferred onto the oligosaccharides. In the case of the HA4 and HA6 oligosaccharides only minor bands were detected at the HC level (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), and the intensity of these bands did not significantly differ from the HC band observed in the absence of the oligosaccharides (Fig. 1B, lane 2). However, the intensity of the IαI band in the HA6 reaction was somewhat decreased, suggesting that either minor amounts of HC were transferred to this oligosaccharides, or spontaneous HC release from IαI occurred. It is also important to note that the IαI band disappeared completely in the case of all oligosaccharides except for HA6 and HA4 but the PαI band was still present at a low intensity in all the cases. This observation suggested that the HCs transfer from the IαI was probably a more favorable reaction than that from the PαI. In order to quantitatively determine the differences in the HC acceptor abilities of the HA oligosaccharides, we established an ELISA system in which the HC transfer reaction was completed on surface immobilized HA (Fig. 2). As expected the reaction was dependent on the concentration of the HA coating solution (Fig. 2A), and the amounts of TNFIP6 (Fig. 2B) and serum (not shown) added. The transfer reaction showed a saturation curve when 50 μl of 1 mg/ml HA coating solution, 25 ng of TNFIP6 and 0.1 μl of serum were used, and could be accelerated by the addition of magnesium ions (Fig. 2C). Under these conditions, we used different amounts of high molecular weight HA and HA oligosaccharides to compete with the surface immobilized hyaluronan for the HC transfer reaction (Fig. 2D). The competitor amounts that caused 50% inhibition were compared assess the HC acceptor ability of these competitors. As expected from our Western-blot results HA8 or larger oligosaccharides in the range of 1–400 ng effectively inhibited the HC transfer to the immobilized HA (Fig. 2D). In the same range, neither HA6 (Fig. 2D) nor HA4 (not shown) were able to compete. However, a drastically larger amount of HA6 (10 μg) could cause partial inhibition (see below). Generally, the larger oligosaccharide resulted in better inhibition, with HA8, HA10, HA12, and HA14 being ∼6.4, 4.9, 3, and 2 times weaker competitors, respectively, than high molecular weight HA (inhibition curves for HA10 and HA12 are not shown). Glycosaminoglycan Specificity of the TNFIP6-mediated HC Transfer—With the purpose of exploring the structural specificity of the HC transfer, we used different glycosaminoglycans, either sulfated or unsulfated in our biochemical transfer studies and checked their ability to accept HCs from the IαI and PαI in the TNFIP6-mediated HC transfer reaction. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans, such as dermatan-4-sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate could not serve as acceptors. Neither IαI nor PαI could be eliminated with these glycosaminoglycans, and no new bands were apparent in Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 7) compared with the control reaction without glycosaminoglycans (Fig. 3A, lane 9). Chondroitin, an unsulfated glycosaminoglycan, was acceptor for the TNFIP6-mediated HC transfer as indicated by the disappearance of the IαI band and the reduction of the PαI band in Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, A, lane 3, and B, lane 4). In addition, new bands appeared on the gel in the range between the HC and PαI. The size and polydispersity of these new IαI-positive bands were consistent with chondroitin chains bearing one HC. The digestion of the chondroitin reaction product with Streptococcal hyaluronidase (an enzyme that is able to degrade chondroitin but not chondroitin sulfates) resulted in a strong band at the HC level and the disappearance of the multiple bands in the range between the HC and PαI (Fig. 3, A, lane 4, and B, lane 3). The HC transfer reaction to chondroitin took place only in the presence of TNFIP6 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4), indicating the essential role of this protein. Furthermore, a monodisperse chondroitin oligomer with 22 monosaccharide units was also able to serve as an acceptor in the TNFIP6-mediated transfer reaction (Fig. 3C). These data indicated that beside the N-acetyl-glucosamine-containing HA, unsulfated N-actyl-galactosamine-containing chondroitin was also able to participate in the transesterification reaction as an acceptor. HA Oligosaccharides Suppress Cumulus Cell-Oocyte Complex Expansion by Inhibiting HC Transfer to Endogenous HA— The inhibitory effect of HA oligosaccharides on COC expansion has been described previously (2Hess K.A. Chen L. Larsen W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Camaioni A. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Salustri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20473-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this inhibition has not yet been determined. In order to investigate HA oligosaccharide specificity of the suppression of COC expansion, we used highly purified HA oligosaccharides of defined sizes (34Tawada A. Masa T. Oonuki Y. Watanabe A. Matsuzaki Y. Asari A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to competitively inhibit COC expansion in vitro. Freshly isolated mouse COCs were cultured in the presence of 5% mouse serum, 1 mm dbcAMP and 1 mg/ml HA oligosaccharides of different sizes (HA4-HA14)"

The extracellular domain of the EGFR is recognized by seven distinct ligands that are related in primary sequence, which results in tyrosine kinase activation (1Prenzel N. Fischer O. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In response to ligand stimulation, the EGFR forms homo- or heterodimers as part of the activation and signaling mechanism (2Klapper L. Kirschbaum M. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv.

Also, glioblastomas and other tumors often express a deletion mutation in the EGFR gene that constitutively activates the receptor (2Klapper L. Kirschbaum M. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 25-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Usually EGFR overexpression results in cellular transformation only if the presence of a ligand, for example transforming growth factor α (21Matsui Y. Halter S. Holt J. Hogan B. Coffey R.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3915-3927PubMed Google Scholar), accompanies the increase in the receptor level. ErbB-2 overexpression as a result of gene amplification has been detected in breast, ovarian, prostate, and other cancers (2Klapper L. Kirschbaum M. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv.

Oncol. 2001; 12: S9-S13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ErbB-2 overexpression is often associated with a more aggressive form of disease and poorer prognosis (2Klapper L. Kirschbaum M. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 25-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 15Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Kraus M. Segatto O. King R. Aaronson S. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Interestingly, more advanced invasive carcinomas have lower levels of ErbB-2 expression than early benign forms of breast cancer, which suggests that there is selection against ErbB-2 overexpression during the early stages of tumorigenesis (15Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5561) Google Scholar, 26Ross J. Fletcher J. Stem Cells. 1999; 16: 413-428Crossref Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Several clinical studies demonstrate that co-expression of EGFR and ErbB-2 in tissues is associated with a poorer prognosis than expression of only one of these molecules (27Suo Z. Risberg B. Kalsson M. Willman K. Tierens A. Skovlund E. Nesland J. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 28Garcia I. Vizoso F. Martin A. Sanz L. Abdel-Lah O. Raigoso P.

Surgery. 2003; 133: 219-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The conclusion usually drawn is that sustained activation of EGFR and ErbB2 leads to the transformation of cells that have elevated levels of these receptors. Although EGFR and ErbB-2 are usually associated with increased cell proliferation it has also been reported that either receptor may activate an apoptotic program (30Danielsen A. Maihle N. Growth Factors. 2002; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For example, EGF stimulates cell death in A431 or MDA-468 cells (31Gill G. Lazar C. Nature. 1981; 293: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 32Filmus J. Pollak M. Cailleau R. Buick R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Also, the overexpression of ErbB-2 in mammary epithelial cells may induce morphological and biochemical changes consistent with apoptosis (33Harris R. Hiles I. Page M. O'Hare M. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Casalini P. Botta L. Menard S. J. Biol.

A required role of EGFR and ErbB-2 in the development of many mammalian tissues is well documented by genetic studies in mice. However, it is also known that high doses of EGF inhibit the growth of mammary terminal end buds (37Coleman S. Daniel C. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38DiAugustine R. Richards G. Sebastian J. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that ductal growth in mammary glands is impaired in ErbB-2 transgenic mice (39Mukherjee S. Louie S. Campbell M. Esserman L. Shyamala G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is clear that a considerable increase in the EGFR and the ErbB-2 levels during the proliferative phases of the development of certain tissues does not result in cellular transformation, for instance, during each pregnancy cycle in mammary epithelial cells. Therefore, there are mechanisms that define cellular responses initiated by ErbB ligands. Because expression of high levels of EGFR and ErbB-2 is implicated in cell transformation as well as in ligand-induced apoptosis, it is important to identify the parameters by which stimulation of EGFR and ErbB-2 results in cell proliferation or cell death. Although the signaling mechanisms that underlie the capacity of the EGFR and ErbB-2 to stimulate cell proliferation have been intensively investigated, the mechanisms that lead to the apoptotic response by these receptors are considerably less clear. Herein we present data showing that co-expression of elevated levels of EGFR and ErbB-2 in several cell lines invariably results in induction of ligand-dependent cell death, which in all cases is mediated by p38 MAPK.

Cell Lines and Cell Culture—NIH3T3 cells stably expressing EGFR (CL17 and SAA cells, gift of Dr. L. Beguinot and Dr. Paolo Di Fiore, respectively) were transfected with ErbB-2/pIRES2-EGFP construct containing an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence and separately expressing GFP as a marker. For transfection experiments cells were grown to ∼80% confluency and transfected with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were then grown for 2-3 weeks in the presence of G418. Several drug-resistant clones were selected. Clones with high levels of ErbB2, as confirmed by Western blot, were used in experiments. HEK293 cells were transfected with an ErbB-2/RFP construct, and hygromycin-resistant cell clones were selected. Then cells were transfected with construct containing EGFR tagged at the carboxyl-terminus with GFP and selected in the presence of G418. SKBr3 and BT474 cells were transfected with a construct containing EGFR-GFP. After transfection cells were grown in the presence of G418 for 2 weeks, and then cells were sorted using GFP as a marker. Five clones of SKBr3/EGFR cells and three clones of BT474/EGFR cells were selected and used in experiments. Expression of EGFR was confirmed by Western blotting. Membrane localization of EGFR was verified by fluorescent microscopy. SKBr3/EGFR cells were grown in the McCoy medium containing 10% FBS, whereas other cell lines were grown in the DMEM medium with 10% FBS. Construction of Vectors—The ErbB-2 sequence was inserted into pIRES2-EGFP vector through NheI and XhoI restriction sites. The GFP sequence was inserted into the pcDNA3.1+ vector-containing ErbB-2 sequence. To do this the carboxyl-terminal part of the ErbB-2 was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer, GAT GCT GAG GAG TAT CTG GTA CCC CAG CAG, and a 3′ primer, TCT AGA CTC GTC GAC CAC TGG CAC GTC CAG ACC CAG GTA, containing KpnI and SalI restriction sites, respectively. The GFP sequence was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer, CTA CCG GTC GTC GAC ATG GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG GAG, and a 3′ primer, AGA TCT TCT AGA CTA CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT GCC, containing SalI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively. Both PCR products were cut with SalI and ligated. The final product was cut again with KpnI and XbaI. This sequence was inserted into the ErbB-2/pcDNA3.1+ vector through KpnI and XbaI restriction sites. The same strategy was employed to prepare the ErbB-2 expression vector tagged with RFP. The RFP sequence was amplified using a 5′ primer, TCG TTG GAG GTC GAC CCG GTC GCC ACC ATG GCC TCC TCC GAG, and a 3′ primer, CTA GAG TCG TCT AGA CTA CAG GAA CAG GTG GTG GCG GCC CTC, containing SalI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively. The ErbB-2 sequence was inserted into the pcDNA3.1/hygro vector through NheI and XhoI restriction sites, and the final ligation product was inserted into this vector through KpnI and XbaI restriction sites. DNA Ladder and Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase DNA Fragmentation Assay—SKBr3/EGFR cells were grown on 60-mm dishes or Titertek chamber slides and treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 2 days. Suicide-Track™ DNA ladder isolation kit (Oncogene) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and DNA fragmentation was detected using the TdT-FragEL™ DNA fragmentation detection kit (Oncogene). All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Detection of the Loss of Mitochondrial Potential—A431 and SKBr3/EGFR cells were grown on Titertek chamber slides and treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 1-2 days. Loss of the mitochondrial potential was detected using Mitocapture apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunoblotting—At the end of each experiment the cells were solubilized by scraping into cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4). The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min). The detergent-insoluble fractions were boiled in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, clarified by centrifugation, and added to 100 μl of lysates. Aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membrane was blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h (overnight at 4 °C for antibodies against phosphorylated proteins) with the indicated antibody in TBSTw buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2% nonfat milk), washed 3 times in the same buffer, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibody or protein A. The membranes were then washed five times with TBSTw buffer and visualized by ECL. Co-expression of Exogenous EGFR and ErbB-2 in NIH3T3 and HEK293 Cells—To assess a possible role of EGFR and ErbB-2 co-expression in cellular responsiveness to EGF, we established several stable cell lines containing high levels of both receptors. NIH3T3 cells that stably express high levels of human EGFR (CL17 and SAA) were transfected with the pIRES2-EGFP vector containing the human ErbB-2-encoding sequence. Because this vector contains an IRES and allows expression of GFP as a marker separate from ErbB-2, we used flow cytometry to select cells with high levels of GFP and established several independent cell lines from these populations. That this selection resulted in increased levels of ErbB-2 is shown in Fig. 1C. These cell lines were then employed to test the influence of increased ErbB-2 levels on EGF-dependent cell growth. EGF does not induce apoptosis in the parental CL17 cells (Fig. 1A). However, the addition of EGF to CL17 cells that express high levels of both EGFR and ErbB-2 (CL17/ErbB-2) results in a changed (more rounded) morphology, loss of contact with extracellular matrix, nuclear shrinkage, and eventually cell death in 4 days (Fig. 1A). Similar data were obtained with SAA cells and SAA/ErbB-2 transfectants. This observation was confirmed using HEK293 cells that do not express high levels of endogenous ErbB receptors. Vectors containing either EGFR tagged with GFP attached to its carboxyl terminus (40Carter R. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or ErbB-2 with RFP attached to its carboxyl terminus were used to doubly transfect HEK293 cells. Several independent cell lines containing high levels of both receptors, as determined by Western blot (Fig. 1C), were selected, and membrane localization of EGFR and ErbB-2 was verified by fluorescent microscopy. Incubation of these HEK293/EGFR/ErbB-2 cells with EGF induced cell death in 70-80% of cell population in 4 days (Fig. 1B). However, the growth of control cells was not significantly changed by the addition of EGF. These data indicate that enhanced levels of EGFR and ErbB-2 in two experimental cell systems do not necessarily result in the stimulation of cell proliferation after the addition of EGF. Rather the addition of EGF to these cells results in cell death. Co-expression of EGFR and ErbB-2 in Carcinoma Cells—Several mammary carcinoma cell lines, such as SKBr3 and BT474, have high levels of ErbB-2 and low levels of EGFR (41DeFazio A. Chiew Y. Sini R. Janes P. Sutherland R. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and stimulation with EGF does not result in cell death. To determine whether increased expression of EGFR would sensitize these cells to ligand-induced death, SKBr3 and BT474 cells were transfected with GFP-tagged EGFR, and stable cell lines were selected. During selection most cells with high levels of EGFR died, but several cell lines that expressed elevated levels of EGFR were established (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the parental cells, which exhibited no detectable level of cell death under these conditions, about 70% of BT474/EGFR and almost 100% of SKBr3/EGFR cells died 4-5 days after the addition of EGF (Fig. 2, A and B). We also stably transfected ErbB-2 into A431 cells, which express high levels of EGFR and low levels of ErbB-2 (42Bera T. Viner J. Brinkmann E. Pastan I. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4018-4022PubMed Google Scholar). The increased level of ErbB-2 expression (∼5-fold) was demonstrated by Western blot (data not shown). Although it is known that EGF stimulates apoptosis in A431 cells (31Gill G. Lazar C. Nature. 1981; 293: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), we found that ∼10-20% of cells usually survived treatment with EGF for several days and formed clones viable in the presence of EGF. In contrast, all A431 cells stably transfected with ErbB-2 cells die upon treatment with EGF, and no viable clones could be detected (data not shown). Sustained Activation of the ErbB-2 Kinase Results in Cell Death—The above results suggest that ligand-dependent transactivation of ErbB-2 could be a mechanism by which EGF-dependent cell death is provoked. To test this possibility we used an NIH3T3 cell line that expresses a high level of a chimeric EGFR (ectodomain plus transmembrane domain)/ErbB-2 (cytoplasmic domain) receptor. These cells express ∼7 × 105 chimeric receptors per cell, and the ErbB-2 tyrosine kinase is activated by EGF (43Sorkin A. Di Fiore P. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3021-3028PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in 1% FBS and treated with EGF for 4 days. The data in Fig. 3 show that under these conditions the addition of EGF resulted in high level of cell death (80-90%). This result indicates that sustained activation of the ErbB-2 kinase is sufficient to mediate cell death. EGF Induces Apoptosis in Cells That Overexpress EGFR and ErbB-2—To further characterize the cell death response induced by the addition of EGF, hallmarks of apoptosis were examined. The data in Fig. 4 show that SKBr3/EGFR cells treated with EGF displayed apoptotic morphology characterized by DNA fragmentation as detected by ladder formation (Fig. 4A), terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay (Fig. 4B), and nuclear fragmentation visualized by Hoechst staining (Fig. 4C). These cells also exhibited reduced cytoplasmic space, chromatin condensation, and detachment from the extracellular matrix. Because it has been suggested that apoptosis in A431 cells treated with EGF depends on caspase activation (44Chin Y. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R. Fu X.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone was employed to prevent ligand-induced cell death in A431, A431/ErbB-2 cells, SKBr3/EGFR cells, or NIH3T3 cells that express the EGFR/ErbB-2 chimeric receptor. In each case this inhibitor at all concentrations tested (20-100 μm) did not abrogate EGF-induced apoptosis. Also, there was no significant activation of caspase 3 (detectable by either Western blot with antibody against activated caspase 3 or formation of cleaved fluorescent substrate detected using the caspase 3 intracellular activity assay Kit, Calbiochem) in cells undergoing EGF-induced apoptosis. The p38 MAPK Inhibitors Block EGF-induced Apoptosis—In attempt to determine the mechanism of EGF-induced apoptosis ∼50 pharmacologic inhibitors of specific signaling pathways were tested. EGF-induced cell death in SKBr3/EGFR cells was not blocked by inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway (U0126, PD98059, Raf1 inhibitor), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (wortmannin, Akt inhibitor), general serine/threonine kinases H7, cyclin-dependent kinases (olomoucine), protein kinase C (rottlerin, bisindolylmaleimide), p53 (pifithrin), p70S6 kinase (rapamycin), metalloproteases (GM1489, MMP II, BB3103, BB94), serine proteases (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin), calpain (E64d), trypsin-like proteases and chymotrypsin (aprotinin, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone), tyrosine kinase (herbimycin, geldanamycin), or Jun kinase (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibitors I and II, Calbiochem). Among tyrosine kinase inhibitors only genistein (100 μm) and the specific EGFR/ErbB-2 kinase inhibitor PKI 116 (200 nm) efficiently blocked apoptosis. However, the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitors SB203580 or SB202190 (10 μm) completely prevented cell death induced by EGF in cell lines that co-express EGFR and ErbB-2 (Fig. 4 and data not shown). In addition, these p38 MAPK inhibitors completely blocked apoptosis induced by EGF in A431 cells. The capacity of EGF to inhibit proliferation of SKBr3/EGFR cells and the influence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 is shown quantitatively in Fig. 5. In the absence of added EGF the cells proliferated over the period of 8 days. In the presence of EGF, however, proliferation was suppressed, and the remaining cells were, in fact, dead cells. The addition of EGF and SB203580 prevented the cell death induced by EGF and restored cell proliferation to near control levels. EGF-induced autophosphorylation of the EGFR or ErbB-2 or activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, detected with phospho-specific antibodies, in SKBr3 cells were not significantly decreased in the presence of SB203580, which suggests specific inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway (data not shown). These data show that EGF-induced apoptosis in cells expressing high levels of EGFR and ErbB-2 is mediated by activation of the p38 stress kinase and that co-expression of EGFR and ErbB-2 may significantly alter the EGF-dependent activation of p38 MAPK. When this possibility was tested EGF provoked a sustained activation of p38 MAPK in SKBr3/EGFR cells as shown in Fig. 6. Activation of p38 MAPK was detected at 10 min after the addition of EGF (Fig. 6A) and was sustained for 72 h (Fig. 6B). In contrast, no sustained activation of p38 MAPK could be detected in parental SKB"

Genetic analysis of not mutants in yeast identifies a negative role in transcription, which is dependent on core promoter structure. To obtain direct support for this we targeted individual core subunits of the human Ccr4-Not complex to promoters in transient transfections of human cells. In this experimental setup we found that the CNOT2 and CNOT9(hRcd1/hCaf40) subunits act as repressors of reporter gene activity. Interestingly, recruitment of other Ccr4-Not subunits did not affect the reporter gene. The major repression function of CNOT2 is localized in a specialized protein motif, the Not-Box. This conserved motif is present in all CNOT2 orthologs and surprisingly also in CNOT3 orthologs. Repression by the Not-Box was sensitive to treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. In addition, mutation of a canonical TATA-box enhanced repression.

Regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (pol II) 1The abbreviations used are: pol II, polymerase II; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DBD, DNA binding domain; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; Luc, luciferase; TK, thymidine kinase; TSA, trichostatin A; WT1, Wilms' tumor 1. requires the interplay of many transcription factors at different levels (1Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). This involves proteins recognizing gene-specific DNA elements, which can recruit transcriptional coactivator and corepressor complexes. Several of these cofactors mediate their effect via chromatin, either by ATP-dependent remodeling of nucleosomal structures or by altering the modification status of histone proteins. The latter involves phosphorylation, methylation, or acetylation/deacetylation of histones (2Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). The end point of transcriptional regulatory pathways is recruitment of the basal pol II transcription machinery. This machinery assembles at the core promoter of the gene, which often contains a combination of the TATA-box and DNA elements like the initiator and the downstream promoter element (3Butler J.E.F. Kadonoga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2583-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 4Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2503-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Within the basal machinery two large protein complexes, TFIID and Mediator, are focal points for transcriptional regulation because they can interact with multiple gene-specific activators. Interestingly, these evolutionary conserved complexes can synergize in activation in vitro (5Johnson K.M. Wang J. Smallwood A. Arayata C. Carey M. Genes Dev. 2002; 15: 1852-1863Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The TFIID complex, consisting of TATA-binding protein in combination with 13–14 TATA-binding protein-associated proteins (6Tora L. Genes Dev. 2002; 15: 673-675Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar), nucleates preinitiation complex assembly by binding to the core promoter (7Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 8Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The Mediator complex consisting of more than 20 subunits bridges activators with pol II (9Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 10Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 11Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In crude extracts Mediator complexes are also required for basal levels of transcription (12Baek H.J. Malik S. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M.

It has become clear that several other regulators control the basal transcription machinery at the level of the core promoter (for reviews, see Refs. 3Butler J.E.F. Kadonoga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2583-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 15Lee T.I. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1398-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, and 16Pugh B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Ccr4-Not complex is a key representative of this class of regulators. This complex is evolutionary conserved and consists of a core of nine subunits (for reviews, see Refs. 17Collart M.A. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 313: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar and 18Denis C.L. Chen J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 221-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The five NOT (negative on TATA-less) genes were isolated in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae via genetic screens for an increased transcription from the TATA-less promoter of the HIS3 gene. Besides the Not proteins, the core Ccr4-Not complex of ∼1.0 MDa also harbors Ccr4p, Pop2/Caf1, Caf40, and Caf130. Only Not1p is essential for yeast cell viability, but in most combinations deletion of two nonessential genes results in lethality (19Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid interaction studies indicate that the 240-kDa Not1p protein acts as the scaffold for the complex, organizing the Ccr4p and Caf1 at a central region and the Not2p-Not3p-Not4p-Not5p module at its C terminus (17Collart M.A. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 313: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical analysis revealed two different enzymatic activities associated with the core complex. First, the Ccr4p and Caf1p contain a 3′–5′ exonuclease activity involved in degradation of mRNA via poly(A) tail shortening (20Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 21Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 22Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Second, the human ortholog of Not4p, CNOT4, contains ubiquitin protein ligase activity (24Albert T.K. Hanzawa H. Legtenberg Y.I.A. de Ruwe M.J. van den Heuvel F.A.J. Collart M.A. Boelens R. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The relevance of these findings for transcriptional regulation by the Ccr4-Not complex is yet an unresolved question. Results from in vivo protein-DNA cross-linking studies in yeast indicate that the Not2p, Not5p, and Ccr4p subunits associate with promoter DNA, and it was suggested that the Gcn4p activator is involved in promoter recruitment of components of the Ccr4-Not complex (25Swanson M.J. Qiu H. Sumibcay L. Krueger A. Kim S.J. Natarajan K. Yoon S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2800-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Deluen C. James N. Maillet L. Molinete M. Theiler G. Lemaire M. Paquet N. Collart M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6735-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several genetic and biochemical analyses in yeast provide links between Ccr4-Not proteins and the TFIID and Mediator complexes (for review, see Ref. 18Denis C.L. Chen J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 221-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For example, epitope-tagged Not5p can retain several TATA-binding protein-associated proteins from yeast extracts (26Deluen C. James N. Maillet L. Molinete M. Theiler G. Lemaire M. Paquet N. Collart M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6735-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Badarinarayana V. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutant alleles of four core subunits (NOT1, NOT3, NOT5, and CAF1) can suppress a ts allele of SRB4 (28Lee T.I. Wyrick J.J. Koh S.S. Jennings E.G. Gadbois E.L. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4455-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which encodes an essential subunit of Mediator. This finding is consistent with the proposed repressive function of the Ccr4-Not complex. However, recent analyses obtained in mammalian cells indicate that Ccr4-Not core subunits are involved in transcriptional activation. The murine CAF40 ortholog, CNOT9(mRcd1/mCaf40), is required for retinoic acid-induced differentiation of murine terato-carcinoma cells and associates with retinoic acid receptors and the ATF-2 activator (29Hiroi N. Ito T. Yamamoto H. Ochiya T. Jinno S. Okayama H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5235-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of human CNOT6(hCCR4) or CNOT7(hCAF1) potentiates ligand-dependent activation by the estrogen receptor (30Morel A.-P. Sentis S. Bianchin C. Le Romancier M. Jonard L. Rostan M.-C. Rimokh R. Corbo L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2929-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In these cases involvement of the other Ccr4-Not subunits has not been tested. To investigate transcriptional regulation by the Ccr4-Not subunits in a systematic manner we studied the effects of promoter recruitment of the mammalian subunits. In transient transfection assays we found that CNOT2 and CNOT9(hRcd1/hCaf40) act as repressors. The major repression function of CNOT2 resided in a novel conserved protein motif, which we designated as the Not-Box. Mechanistic aspects of repression of the Not-Box were investigated further. Our results show for the first time that promoter targeting of Ccr4-Not subunits directly results in repression of pol II transcription. Cell Lines—The U2OS (human osteosarcoma) and HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Plasmids—The expression vector pSG424, which expresses the Gal4-DBD under control of the early promoter of SV40, has been described before (31Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). pSGCNOT2 was constructed by insertion of the XmaI/XbaI fragment encoding the CNOT2 open reading frame obtained by PCR using B42-hNOT2 (32Albert T.K.

The EcoRI/XbaI-digested fragment of encoding amino acids 661–753 of CNOT3 was cloned into pCMVDBD to obtain pCGDNBC-NOT3. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing across the cloning junctions. Details on primer sequences are available upon request. pCMVWT1Gal was constructed by insertion of the Asp718I/NotI fragment encoding WT1(–)Gal4 from the plasmid pBSIIKS+WT1(–)Gal4 into pcDNA3 (34de Ruwe M.J. Transcription Regulation by the Wilms' Tumor Suppressor WT1 and Structure/Function Analysis of Human NOT4. Utrecht University, Utrecht2000: 55-66Google Scholar). Constructs 5xGal.TATAAAA.Luc and 5xGal.TGTAAAA.Luc are described before as 5xGAL-M2-luc and 5xGAL-M1-luc, respectively (35Keaveney M. Berkenstam A. Feigenbutz M. Vriend G. Stunnenberg H.G. Nature. 1993; 365: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These luciferase reporter constructs contain five Gal4 binding sites, the TATA sequence as indicated followed by a retinoic acid receptor β2 initiator (nucleotides –5 to +6) driving the firefly luciferase gene. Immunoblot Detection of Proteins—293T cells were plated on 3-cm dishes. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in 200 μl of SDS loading buffer. 30 μl of each sample was analyzed by a 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-Gal4-DBD mouse monoclonal antibody RK5C1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) recognizing epitope 94–147 and by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Assays—U2OS or 293T cells were plated on 3-cm dishes and transfected in duplicate or triplicate (as indicated in the figure legends) by the calcium phosphate method (36van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To correct for transfection efficiency, 50 ng of pCMV-Renilla-luciferase (U2OS) or 5 ng of pCMV-Renilla-luciferase (293T) was cotransfected. For experiments using trichostatin A (TSA; ICN), transfected cells were treated with carrier (dimethyl sulfoxide) and 100, 400, or 1000 nm TSA for 17 h prior to harvesting. 40 h after transfection the cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase values were corrected for the transfection efficiency by determining the firefly luciferase:Renilla luciferase ratio. The -fold repression by Gal4-DBD fusion proteins was calculated by normalization of the firefly luciferase: Renilla luciferase ratios to the ratio obtained by the transfection containing only reporter plasmids and the empty pcDNA3.1 vector. Sequence Alignments—Amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar), with default settings. The sequences used for the alignment with the GenBank accession number in parentheses are: Homo sapiens Not2 (NP_055330), Anopheles gambiae Not2 (EAA03143), Drosophila melanogaster Not2 (NP_524239), Schizosaccharomyces pombe Not2 (NP_587823), Caenorhabditis elegans Not2 (NP_494772), Saccharomyces cerevisiae Not2 (NP_010116), H. sapiens Not3 (NP_055331), A. gambiae Not3 (EAA14776), D. melanogaster Not3 (NP_610176), S. pombe Not3 (NP_594789), C. elegans Not3 (NP_499534), S. cerevisiae Not3 (NP_012226), and S. cerevisiae Not5 (NP_015397). The Ccr4-Not Subunits CNOT2 and CNOT9(hRcd1/hCAF40) Repress Reporter Gene Activity—To investigate the ability of the human Ccr4-Not complex to regulate transcription the individual subunits (CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CNOT8, CNOT9(hRcd1/hCAF40), and the C-terminal 1,290 residues of CNOT1) were targeted to a pol II promoter by fusing each subunit to the Gal4(1–147) DBD. As a positive control a construct expressing the Sin3 interaction domain, amino acids 1–35, of Mad1 fused to the Gal4(1–94) DBD was used (38Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The Gal4 expression plasmids were cotransfected into human osteosarcoma U2OS cells with the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid 7xGalTKLuc, which contains seven Gal4 binding sites fused to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter, or with the control reporter plasmid TKLuc lacking any Gal4 binding sites. To correct for differences in transfection efficiency a plasmid expressing the Renilla luciferase gene under control of the strong CMV promoter was also included in each transfection. Fig. 1 shows that cotransfection of the Gal4-CNOT2 and Gal4-CNOT9 plasmids resulted in 8- and 6-fold reduction of luciferase activity, respectively. These effects were dependent on the presence of Gal4 binding sites in the promoter. Luciferase expression from the TKLuc control was only weakly affected by Gal4-CNOT2 (1.5-fold) or Gal4-CNOT9 (2.1-fold). As expected, cotransfection of Gal4-MAD plasmid reduced luciferase expression. Analysis of transfected cell lysates by immunoblotting indicated that all Gal4 fusion proteins are expressed and of the expected size (data not shown). Repression by CNOT2 was also observed using ts20 (Chinese hamster lung), 911 (adenovirus-transformed human embryonic retina), and 293T (adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney) cell lines (data not shown). Our experiments showed that only two of the six Ccr4-Not subunits tested here affect promoter activity. Others found that artificial recruitment of CNOT6 (hCCR4) also does not influence TK promoter activity (39Dupressoir A. Morel A.P. Barbot W. Loireau M.P. Corbo L. Heidmann T. BMC Genomics. 2001; 2: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although we did not test the CNOT7 (hCAF1) subunit, based on our results with its paralog CNOT8 (hPOP2/CALIF) we expect that CNOT7 will also not affect promoter activity. In conclusion, we observed that promoter targeting of the CNOT2 and CNOT9 subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex resulted in a strong repression of reporter gene activity. The Conserved C-terminal Part of CNOT2 Contains the Major Repression Function—To investigate further the strong repressive effect on transcription by CNOT2 we decided to map the region responsible for this. The human CNOT2 gene displays a strong sequence homology with the yeast ortholog Not2p in the last 190 residues (32Albert T.K. Lemaire M. van Berkum N.L. Gentz R. Collart M.A. Timmers H.T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, two short amino acid stretches (258–285 and 333–365) of CNOT2 share homology with orthologs from other metazoans but are absent in yeast orthologs. We constructed CMV promoter-based expression plasmids for CNOT2 deletions in the context of Gal4 fusions as indicated (Fig. 2A). The various Gal4-CNOT2 constructs were transiently transfected into U2OS cells together with the 7xGalTKLuc reporter plasmid. As expected full-length CNOT2 strongly repressed luciferase activity (9.1-fold). Constructs only expressing the nonconserved N-terminal part of CNOT2 did not repress the reporter. On the other hand the C-terminal constructs, spanning amino acid regions 256–540 or 334–540, repressed transcription between 8- and 10-fold. Progressive truncations indicated that the CNOT2(437–540) region is minimally required to observe the repressive effect, although it is reduced to 5-fold. Truncating 46 residues from the C-terminal end of CNOT2 completely abolished repression of the reporter as evidenced by the CNOT2(334–494) construct. Immunoblot analysis of transfected 293T cell lysates using a monoclonal antibody specific for Gal4 indicated that all proteins were expressed and of the expected size (Fig. 2B). Although some Gal4 fusions were expressed at higher levels than others, this variation did not correlate to repression properties. For example, the CNOT2(386–540) fusion is expressed to lower levels than CNOT2(1–225) or CNOT2(349–540) but showed a strong reduction in reporter activity. In conclusion, we found that the major repression function of CNOT2 is contained in the last 104 residues of the C-terminal conserved region of the protein. Sequences Similar to the CNOT2 Region Responsible for Repression Are Also Present in CNOT3 Orthologs—Analysis of the genomic data bases for proteins containing sequences homologous to the minimal repression domain of CNOT2 revealed that this region is not unique to CNOT2 and its orthologs. Surprisingly, we found that CNOT3 orthologs (including yeast Not3p and Not5p, which could be considered paralogs; see Ref. 17Collart M.A. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 313: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) also contain sequences at their C termini, which are significantly similar to region 437–540 of CNOT2. Because these sequences are only present in the core subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex, we tentatively named this protein motif the Not-Box, which encompasses residues 438–524 of CNOT2. Fig. 3A shows the alignments of this region with human CNOT3 and with orthologs of CNOT2 and CNOT3 from the mosquito A. gambiae, the fruit fly D. melanogaster, the fission yeast S. pombe, the nematode C. elegans, and the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Orthologs from other mammals such as mouse and monkey were not included to prevent a bias toward higher eukaryotes. Fig. 3B depicts the percentages of identity between the Not-Boxes in a pairwise comparison. The identity between Not-Boxes from CNOT2 orthologs ranges between of 32 and 74% (depicted in the upper left quadrant). The identity between Not-Boxes of CNOT3 orthologs varies from 8 to 91% (depicted in the lower right quadrant). Clearly, yeast Not3p and Not5p show the lowest percentage identity, and when they are excluded the lower limit is 62%. Comparison of the Not-Box of the CNOT2 and CNOT3 proteins within one species indicates that the identity ranges between 19 and 38% (depicted in bold). Clearly, Not-Boxes of CNOT2 orthologs are more similar among each other than when compared with Not-Boxes from CNOT3 orthologs and vice versa. Taken together, we found that the region of CNOT2 capable of transcription repression is not only conserved between CNOT2 orthologs, but is also present in the C-terminal regions of CNOT3 orthologs. In addition, the sequence comparisons indicated that these Not-Boxes were separated into CNOT2 and CNOT3 types of Not-Boxes. The Not-Box Is an Autonomous Transcription Repression Domain in Mammalian Cells—The finding that the C-terminal part of human CNOT2 can repress reporter gene activity was surprising in light of the findings of Struhl and co-workers (40Benson J.D. Benson M. Howley P.M. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6714-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), who reported that promoter targeting of yeast Not2p resulted in strong transcriptional activation of a yeast promoter. We also noted that fusion of human CNOT2 to the LexA DBD could strongly activate a promoter bearing LexA binding sites in yeast (32Albert T.K. Lemaire M. van Berkum N.L. Gentz R. Collart M.A. Timmers H.T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To investigate this issue further we decided to test the transcriptional effect of yeast Not2p and its isolated Not-Box in human cells. In addition, we decided to analyze transcriptional properties of the isolated Not-Box of CNOT3 as we found that promoter targeting of full-length CNOT3 did not alter reporter gene activity (Fig. 1). To this end gene fusions were constructed of the Gal4(1–147)-DBD with full-length yeast Not2p, CNOT3, the Not-Boxes of yNot2p (residues 96–191) or of CNOT3 (residues 661–753) under control of the CMV promoter. The effects of these expression plasmids on reporter gene activity were tested by transfection into U2OS cells. Interestingly, a clear repression of reporter activity, which was dependent on the presence of Gal4 binding sites, was observed for both full-length yNot2p and by its isolated Not-Box (Fig. 4A, compare 7xGalTKLuc with TKLuc). In contrast to full-length CNOT3, the isolated Not-Box from CNOT3 reduces expression from the Gal4 binding site reporter gene (7xGalTKLuc). We repeated this experiment in 293T human embryonic kidney cells and also observed Gal4 binding site-dependent repression by yeast Not2 (data not shown). However, in this cell line expression of the fusion of Gal4 with yeast Not2 also represses the TKLuc reporter construct lacking Gal4 binding sites. The reason for this is unclear to us. Immunoblot analysis of the transfected cell lysates indicated that proteins of the expected size were expressed (Fig. 4B). This also showed that the inability of the full-length CNOT3 fusion to repress transcription is not caused by low levels of expression as it is expressed to higher levels than the NOT2 fusion proteins (see also Supplemental Fig. 1). In conclusion, our experiments showed that the isolated Not-Boxes from yNot2 and CNOT3 also repressed gene activity upon promoter targeting. Not-Box-mediated Repression Is Sensitive to the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor TSA—Our experiments suggest that the Not-Box motif as present in CNOT2 and CNOT3 orthologs can actively repress transcription. At present it is not evident how the Ccr4-Not complex is recruited to promoters, but its effect is reminiscent of the action of other repressors (e.g. MAD), which in certain cases can recruit histone deacetylases (41Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). We decided to test whether repression by CNOT2 is sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA. Gal4 fusion constructs for full-length CNOT2, its isolated Not-Box, or the unrelated Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) repressors were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter into 293T cells. Gal4-WT1 served as a negative control, as we observed previously that transcription repression by WT1 is insensitive to TSA (34de Ruwe M.J. Transcription Regulation by the Wilms' Tumor Suppressor WT1 and Structure/Function Analysis of Human NOT4. Utrecht University, Utrecht2000: 55-66Google Scholar). Different concentrations of TSA were added to cell cultures prior to harvesting transfected cells. Interestingly, TSA treatment reduced the repression by Gal4-CNOT2 from 11-fold to 6.5-fold (Fig. 5). The repression by the Not-Box of CNOT2 is reduced from 5.8-fold to 1.8-fold. This effect required 400 nm TSA. Repression by WT1 was not affected by the addition of TSA, which indicates that TSA specifically affected CNOT2-mediated repression. Immunoblotting of transfected cell lysates showed that Gal4 proteins are expressed at slightly higher levels in TSA-treated cells (Fig. 5B). This indicated that the TSA-mediated reduction in repression is not caused by a reduced expression of Gal4 proteins. Taken together, these results showed that transcriptional repression by the Not-Box of CNOT2 is TSA-sensitive, which suggests involvement of h"

Finally, some of the common strategies used by the bacterial pathogens of insects, animals, and plants are discussed. The availability of more than 100 microbial genomes, including the benign and pathogenic forms of closely related bacteria, is leading to an improved understanding of the common mechanisms used by pathogenic bacteria to invade and survive in hosts. The current evidence suggests that bacterial pathogens of various hosts share many genes that aid virulence and survival (1Keen N. Staskawicz B. Mekalanos J. Ausubel F. Cook R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8752-8753Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 2Cao H. Baldini R.L. Rahme L.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2001; 39: 259-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The products of such genes are often called virulence factors and include factors required for host and tissue tropism, cytotoxicity and multiplication within the host (3Shea J.E. Santangelo J.D. Feldman R.G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These virulence genes are often present on genomic islands that have been shared among pathogens by horizontal gene transfer (4Hacker J. Kaper J.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 641-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The complete genomes available to date have a bias toward vertebrate pathogens, with only a few available for plant pathogens, and one for an invertebrate pathogen, the recently released Photorhabdus luminescens strain TT01 genome (5Duchaud E. Rusniok C. Frangeul L. Buchrieser C. Givaudan A. Taourit S. Bocs S. Boursaux-Eude C. Chandler M. Charles J.F. Dassa E. Derose R. Derzelle S. Freyssinet G. Gaudriault S. Medigue C. Lanois A. Powell K.

The study of insect pathogens such as Xenorhabdus nematophila, P. luminescens, or Bacillus thuringiensis may provide insight into pathogen evolution and may also lead to the development of new insecticides (6Hilder V.A. Boulter D. Crop Prot. 1999; 18: 177-191Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus are Gram-negative bacteria that live in symbiosis with nematodes (7Forst S. Dowds B. Boemare N. Stackebrandt E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 8Burnell A.M. Stock S.P.

Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 1-23Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This bacteria-nematode association is highly toxic to many insect species, and in most cases the bacteria alone are highly virulent once they are circulating in the hemocoel of the insect (10Forst S. Nealson K. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 21-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacteria and nematode share a complex life cycle, which includes symbiotic and pathogenic stages. During the symbiotic stage, the bacteria are carried in the gut of the nematode, but after infection of an insect host, the nematodes inject the bacteria into the insect hemocoel. Over several days, the combined actions of the nematode and bacteria kill the insect. Within the hemocoel of the insect carcass, the bacteria grow to stationary phase while the nematodes develop and sexually reproduce. The final stage of development is the re-association of the bacteria and nematodes to form non-feeding infective juveniles, which emerge from the insect carcass to find new hosts. The naturally occurring bacterial symbionts found in the gut of the nematodes are called phase I cells. Variant forms, called phase II, are rarely observed in vivo but are often observed under laboratory conditions (7Forst S. Dowds B. Boemare N. Stackebrandt E. Annu. Rev.

Robson J.M. Mcdougall R.J. Scullie B.L. Akhurst R.J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 3647-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phase II bacteria are still toxic to insects such as Galleria mellonella, despite having many altered properties, including motility and lipase, phospholipase, and protease activities (7Forst S. Dowds B. Boemare N. Stackebrandt E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 9Akhurst R.J. Dunphy G.B. Beckage N.E. Thompson S.N.

Throughout their life cycle, the bacteria and the nematodes produce a variety of metabolites to enable them to colonize and reproduce in the insect host. These metabolites often have overlapping functions, a strategy that is likely to contribute to the success of the nematode-bacteria association against a variety of insect hosts (9Akhurst R.J.

The bacteria and nematodes also produce toxins that are responsible for killing the insect host. Analysis of the genome of P. luminescens identified more predicted toxin genes than any other bacteria sequenced to date, including potential gene products with homology to hemolysin A, chitinase, Rtx (repeats-in-toxin)-like toxin, and δ-endotoxin (5Duchaud E.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3871-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This paper describes the identification, purification, and characterization of a novel insect toxin from X. nematophila strain A24. Isolation of Toxin Gene—High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from X. nematophila strain A24 (23Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8945) Google Scholar), partially digested with Sau3AI to generate fragments in the size range 30–50 kb, dephosphorylated, and ligated to linearized cosmid cloning vector “Supercos” (Stratagene) (24Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The ligated DNA was packaged in vitro using Gigapack II XL Packaging Extract (Stratagene), transfected into the Escherichia coli strain NM554 (Stratagene), and screened by G. mellonella injection bioassay as described below. One clone, designated cos149, was chosen for further analysis. Deletion analysis of this clone (25Henikoff S. Gene. 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar) was performed using the Erase-a-Base kit (Promega) and the enzymes BamHI, ClaI, SphI, SacI, and HindIII (Roche Applied Science). Digested DNA was ligated into pGEM7Z(f)+ (Promega) and transformed by electroporation into E. coli strain DH5α, and the lysates were screened for insecticidal activity using the G. mellonella bioassay. The smallest of the deletion clones that retained insecticidal activity was sequenced on both strands using a combination of vector and gene-specific primers. Similarly, the DNA immediately surrounding the toxin gene and at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cosmid clones and the intermediate deletion clones was sequenced using a combination of vector and sequence-specific primers. DNA sequencing was performed on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 377) using ABI Prism™ di-deoxy dye-terminator sequencing mix (Applied Biosystems). DNA was isolated from strains using a standard alkaline lysis procedure and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (24Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Toxin Protein—All protein purification steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Expression of the full-length protein from X. nematophila strain A24 was performed in the IMPACT system (New England Biolabs), in which the toxin open reading frame was cloned at the 5′ end of a self-splicing intein coding sequence fused to a short DNA sequence encoding a chitin binding domain. Recombinant plasmid containing the X. nematophila strain A24 toxin gene was prepared in the IMPACT vector pCYB3 and transformed into the E. coli strains DH10B or BL21(DE3) by electroporation. Cultures (500 ml) of LB 1The abbreviations used are: LB, Luria-Bertani; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MBP, maltose-binding protein. broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5–0.6. Protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, and the cells were grown overnight at 14 °C. The preparation of bacterial cell extracts, affinity isolation of the fusion proteins on chitin columns, on-column dithiothreitol-mediated cleavage of the fusion proteins, and elution of the purified toxin proteins were all performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the lysis and cleavage buffers. E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) was prepared from the IMPACT™ system using the same methods and was used as a negative control for the insect bioassays. Purified proteins were exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and concentrated using Ultrafree spin cartridges (Millipore) with a nominal molecular mass cut-off of 5 or 10 kDa. Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE, using either the buffer system of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) with a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean apparatus, or the NuPAGE Novex system (Invitrogen). All gels were stained with Fast Stain (Zoion Research). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent and BSA (Sigma) as a standard. The identity of the protein was confirmed by mass spectroscopy on a Voyager Elite matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems) for both whole and trypsin-digested protein samples. Mass spectroscopy on the whole protein was performed using sinapinic acid as the matrix and BSA as the standard. The in-gel tryptic digest and subsequent mass spectroscopy were carried out essentially as described previously (27Campbell P.M. Harcourt R.L. Crone E.J. Claudianos C. Hammock B.D. Russell R.J. Oakeshott J.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except that the gel pieces were not treated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide. Theoretical molecular mass and trypsin digest patterns were calculated using Protein Prospector (prospector.ucsf.edu/, version 3.4.1). Bioinformatics—Programs available via BioManager (www.angis.org.au/, release 4.0) were used to analyze the DNA sequences for the presence of open reading frames (Flip). Searches of the non-redundant nucleotide and protein data bases (released Oct. 17, 2003) were performed using the various BLAST programs (version 2.2.6) available via NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Motif and fold recognition analysis of the protein sequence was performed using programs such as InterProScan (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/, July 22, 2003 (28Zdobnov E.M. Apweiler R. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar)), PANAL (mgd.ahc.umn.edu/panal/ (29Silverstein K.A. Kilian A. Freeman J.L. Johnson J.E. Awad I.A. Retzel E.F.

Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar)). The amino acid composition of the sequence was compared with bacterial sequences available at EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/proteome/). The sequence was also analyzed using programs available via ExPASy (kr.expasy.org/tools/), including SignalP (version 1.1) and PSORT (version 6.4). Toxin Expression in Native Bacteria—Phase I and phase II bacteria from glycerol stocks of X. nematophila strain A24 were streaked on LB agar plates and grown at 28 °C for 2 days. The phase of the bacteria was confirmed by growth on nutrient agar, bromothymol blue, and tetrazolium chloride agar plates (33Akhurst R.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; : 303-309Google Scholar) and assays for antibiotic and lecithinase activity (34Boemare N.E. Akhurst R.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 751-761Google Scholar). Single colonies from the LB plates were used to inoculate 5 ml of nutrient broth (13 g/liter, Oxoid), and cultures were grown at 200 rpm for 24 or 48 h at 14, 20, or 28 °C. Cultures (2 ml) were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant was removed (the soluble secreted material). The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 8), and 500 μg of lysozyme was added to 500 μl of this suspension and left on ice for 30 min. After boiling for 2 min, 50 μg of DNase I was added, and the sample was left at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting suspension was centrifuged (3000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant was removed (the soluble material from lysis). The final pellet (the insoluble material from lysis) was resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (see below). Antibody Production—Antibody was raised against his6 V16tox, 2S. Brown, A. Cao, P. Dobson, E. Hines, R. Akhurst, P. East, manuscript in preparation. a P. luminescens protein closely related to A24tox, following standard procedures at the Institute for Medical and Veterinary Science (Adelaide, Australia). Approximately 400 μg of purified his6V16tox protein was used to immunize each of two New Zealand White rabbits by subcutaneous injection. Each animal received a primary inoculation and three boosts at 3-week intervals. Following the final boost ∼40 ml of serum was collected from each animal. The antiserum was used without further purification. Western Blots—Western blots were performed using a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences) on a Novablot semi-dry blotter at 0.8 mA/cm2 in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris-Cl, 0.375% SDS). The membrane was processed at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 using three 5-min washes between all steps. The steps used were a 1-h or overnight block with 3% BSA, a 1-h incubation with the toxin antibody (1:3000 dilution), and a 1-h incubation with anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma, 1:30,000 dilution). The blots were visualized using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega) in substrate buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, pH 9.5). Insects—Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera) were reared until fourth instar on an artificial diet (35Akhurst R.J. James W. Bird L.J. Beard C. J. Econ. Entomol. 2003; 96: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G. mellonella (Lepidoptera) were reared at 27 °C until fourth instar on an artificial diet containing dried rice cereal (500 g), honey/glycerol mix (154 ml of honey, 179 ml of glycerol, 37 ml of water), brewers yeast (30 g), and methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (Tegasept, 0.2% w/w). Lucilia cuprina (Diptera) were reared at 27 °C until third instar on an artificial liver and meat meal diet. Bioassays—The activity of crude extracts and purified proteins was determined using an intra-hemocoel injection assay against the insects G. mellonella, H. armigera, and L. cuprina. Larvae were treated with 5–10 μl of either crude or pure sample, which was injected through an intersegmental membrane into the abdominal region. Bioassays were performed on at least 10 larvae that were held at 22 °C, and mortality was recorded daily over 3–6 days. For testing of the cosmid library against G. mellonella, crude extracts were prepared by growing E. coli cultures overnight at 28 °C in LB broth containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and treating them with 2 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco) for 15 min. The oral activity of this crude extract was also determined by incorporating 5 ml of crude extract into 95 ml of diet for H. armigera. The temperature dependence of the insecticidal activity was determined using crude extracts of cultures of A24tox in pGEM7Z(f)+/DH5α that were grown overnight at 37 °C, treated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml), and left at room temperature for 30 min. These extracts were injected into G. mellonella larvae that were kept at 20 and 25 °C. The activity of purified recombinant A24tox was tested against all three insects, using a dose range of 1–1000 ng of protein per larva for G. mellonella and H. armigera and 10–100 ng of protein per larva for L. cuprina. For G. mellonella and H. armigera, data were fitted to the probit curve using POLO-PC (LeOra software, 1987), a program that corrects for natural mortality. Histology—Fourth instar H. armigera larvae were injected with 10 μl of purified A24tox (100 ng) or MBP (100 ng). At 18 h post-injection, fixative (4% formaldehyde in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH ∼7.2) was injected into three larvae; holes were punctured into the cuticle, and the larvae were transferred to fixative overnight at 4 °C. The larvae were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 6 μm, and the sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images were captured with a ProgRes 3012 digital camera on a Leica Diaplan microscope. Isolation of Toxin Gene—Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria are known to be toxic to insects, but to date the only toxins from the bacteria that have been studied in detail are the Tc toxins. In order to identify other insect toxins from the bacteria, crude extracts from a cosmid library constructed from X. nematophila strain A24 were tested for insecticidal activity using a G. mellonella injection bioassay. The library screen identified two clones with insecticidal activity, whereas control lysates prepared from E. coli NM554 cells containing nonrecombinant Supercos vector showed no insecticidal activity. Both cosmid clones appeared to contain the same region of ∼35 kb of X. nematophila genomic DNA. Deletion analysis of this cosmid clone, further injection bioassays, and DNA sequencing identified an open reading frame of 1104 bp (368 amino acids) that was required for toxicity (Fig. 1). The DNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AX029373). An analysis of the 5′ region of the gene identified possible imperfect –10 and –35 RNA polymerase recognition sites and an imperfect Shine-Dalgarno sequence, suggesting that the open reading frame was likely to be transcribed. Note that it is not possible to say whether the 1.1-kb toxin gene is part of the genome or a megaplasmid, as the cosmid clone had a size of ∼35 kb, and X. nematophila strain A24 is known to contain megaplasmids of size 70 and 120 kb (11Smigielski A.J. Akhurst R.J. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1994; 64: 214-220Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Purification and Characterization of Toxin Protein—Biochemical characterization of the toxin encoded by the cloned gene from X. nematophila strain A24 required recombinant expression of the full-length protein. Initial attempts to overproduce the protein from commonly used E. coli vectors and strains, such as pGEM7Zf(+) in DH10B, resulted in the expression of very small amounts of protein, most of which was insoluble. Similarly, the toxin was mostly insoluble when expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein using the vector pGEX (Amersham Biosciences). Eventually, a useful amount of soluble protein without N- or C-terminal modifications was obtained by expressing the toxin as a fusion protein in the IMPACT system. After expression and purification according to the manufacturer's instructions, the A24tox construct produced a major soluble protein product of the expected size of ∼42 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) and mass spectroscopy (see below). The final preparations contained 90% or more of the toxin protein, along with contaminants that varied slightly depending on the cleavage and wash conditions used during the purification process. Western blotting with an antibody known to be highly specific for the toxin indicated that some of these contaminants were related to A24tox, in particular the uncleaved fusion protein that runs at about 90 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). E. coli GroEL (∼57–60 kDa) can also co-purify in small amounts with the target protein (www.neb.com/neb/faqs/impact.html). After purification and concentration, the yield of A24tox was ∼0.4 mg per liter of E. coli culture. The identity of the protein was confirmed by mass spectroscopy, where an analysis of the tryptic digest of A24tox identified peptides that covered 77% of the predicted open reading frame, including peptides from both the N and C termini (Fig. 1). The measured molecular weight (41,485) was within instrumental error (0.05%) of the calculated molecular weight (41,502). Both the whole protein and tryptic digest spectra suggested that the N-terminal methionine residue of the recombinant protein had not been processed. Biological Activity of the Toxin—The biological activity of the recombinant purified protein was tested by an intra-hemocoel injection bioassay, a method that delivers the bacteria directly into the hemolymph and thus mimics the release of the bacteria into the hemolymph that occurs soon after a nematode infects the insect host (7Forst S. Dowds B. Boemare N. Stackebrandt E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 8Burnell A.M. Stock S.P. Nematology. 2000; 2: 31-42Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The bioassay results indicated that purified A24tox killed a high percentage of G. mellonella, H. armigera, or L. cuprina larvae after a single injection of at least 10 ng of toxin per larva. MBP purified from the IMPACT system was used as a control for these experiments and did not cause significant larval mortality (0–5%) at any of the quantities tested. This confirmed that A24tox was responsible for the observed toxicity and not any of the minor contaminants present in the toxin purification. With H. armigera, the larvae ceased feeding almost immediately and were dead after 2–3 days, and for G. mellonella, the larvae were unable to spin cocoon silk and were dead after 6 days. Mortality was dependent on the concentration of the toxin, as shown in Fig. 3A for G. mellonella and H. armigera. The LD50 values were calculated by probit analysis (Fig. 3A) and are listed with the 95% confidence limits shown in parentheses. G. mellonella was killed effectively by A24tox (LD50 = 26 ng (11–48 ng)), as was H. armigera (LD50 = 5.2 ng (1.4–9.0 ng)). Because the average larval mass at the time of injection was ∼140 mg for H. armigera and ∼800 mg for G. mellonella, this indicated that the LD50 values were in the range 30–40 ng/g. The A24tox protein was also active by injection against L. cuprina larvae, with an observed mortality of 60, 100, and 100% at doses of 10, 50, and 100 ng, respectively, compared with a MBP control mortality of 5–10%. Crude extracts of A24tox from E. coli strains, which were known to be active by injection, did not have any oral activity when incorporated into the H. armigera diet (data not shown). The activity of an E. coli crude extract against G. mellonella larvae was found to be temperature-dependent (Fig. 3B), with the toxin causing 100% mortality in approximately half the time at 25 °C as compared with 20 °C. It is clear that a major target of the toxin is the caterpillar midgut (Fig. 4). Control animals injected with MBP showed the expected histology for hea"
https://openalex.org/W2054378237,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone is a main regulator of mammalian stress response by stimulating pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression, and thus adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, which then causes glucocorticoid release from the adrenal. In a recent study in the pituitary corticotroph cell line AtT20, oxidative stress stimulated the activity of nuclear transcription factor B (NF-κB), whereas corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) inhibited both the constitutive and the oxidative stress-induced NF-κB DNA-binding activity. To further investigate the role of NF-κB on the CRH-induced pituitary POMC gene activation, AtT20 cells were transiently transfected with a POMC-luciferase construct mutated at an NF-κB binding site. After treatment with CRH, intracellular POMC-luciferase activity was significantly higher from the stimulation observed with transfection of the parental POMC-luciferase construct. In agreement with a previous report, CRH inhibited the constitutive NF-κB DNA-binding activity in AtT20 cells, as shown by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay, as soon as within 15 min of treatment. These effects of CRH were blocked by the CRH-R1 antagonist CP154,256. Our findings provide evidence that the regulation of corticotroph NF-κB activity by CRH is related to the activation of the pituitary POMC gene and, thus, may play an important role in stress response.

Our findings provide evidence that the regulation of corticotroph NF-κB activity by CRH is related to the activation of the pituitary POMC gene and, thus, may play an important role in stress response. Hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) 1The abbreviations used are: CRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone; POMC, proopiomelanocortin; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; HPA, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal. acts as a major mediator of the mammalian stress response by stimulating pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion that, in turn, stimulates release of glucocorticoid from the adrenal gland (1Vale W. Spiess J. Rivier C. Rivier J. Science. 1981; 213: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). CRH stimulates POMC gene transcription in pituitary corticotrophs through cAMP and calcium-mediated events (2Reisine T. Guild S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 488-496PubMed Google Scholar). Positive and negative regulation of the POMC gene has been described and shown to be mediated by several transcription factors such as AP-1 (3Boutillier A.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), Nurr77 (4Philips A. Maira M. Mullick A. Chamberland M. Lesage S. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 3492-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The Crh-deficient (Crh–/–) mouse has normal basal circulating ACTH levels, but shows no increase in ACTH secretion following restrain stress (7Muglia L. Jacobson L. Dikkes P. Majzoub J.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This fact suggests that, although CRH is not required for a normal basal pituitary POMC gene expression, it is necessary for the stress-induced regulation of the POMC gene. Activation of the pituitary POMC gene by CRH is mediated by CRHR1, the receptor subtype expressed in corticotroph cells, as exemplified by the inability of Crfr1–/– mice to respond to stress by increased levels of ACTH (8Smith G.W.

Wurst W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Although it has been well shown that binding of CRH to CRHR1 increases cAMP levels, the cascade of events between cAMP production and POMC gene activation has not yet been elucidated. It has been shown previously that the transcription factor NF-κB is expressed in the brain, and its DNA binding activity is inhibited by CRH in hippocampal neurons as well as in a pituitary corticotroph cell line, the AtT20 cells (10Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Berning B. Behl C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This finding has been associated with the neuroprotective effects of CRH during hypoxia. We have investigated the possibility of a biologically significant role for NF-κB expressed in pituitary corticotrophs by studying the role of NF-κB in the regulation of the pituitary POMC gene by CRH. We show that inhibition of the pituitary NF-κB DNA-binding activity is required for the transcriptional activation of the POMC gene by CRH in corticotroph cells. Therefore, we propose that the CRH-mediated inhibition of NF-κB DNA-binding activity is required for the pituitary corticotroph hormonal response to stress. Cell Culture—The AtT20 mouse pituitary corticotroph cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen). On the day of the experiment, the media were replaced with serum-free media, and the cells were treated with CRH, LPS, H2O2, dexamethasone, antalarmin (a CRH receptor antagonist), the PKA inhibitor H89, or the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, as indicated in the figure legends. CRH and antalarmin were generous gifts of Dr. Chrousos, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, GF109203X was purchased from Calbiochem, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Mutagenesis and Plasmid Construction—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the NF-κB binding site on the POMC promoter was, for the NF-κB binding site, GGGAAGCCCC, and for the mutated binding site, GGGAAGAACC. The mutated plasmid was sequenced for verification. Transfection of AtT20 Cells and Luciferase-Renilla Assays—AtT20 cells were placed in 24-well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h. All the transfection studies were performed in phenol-free media. Cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the full-length POMC promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene (kindly provided by Dr. Melmed, UCLA/Cedars Sinai Medical Center) (11Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 840: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or with a plasmid containing a mutated POMC promoter at the NF-κB binding site, as described above. Cells were also co-transfected with a plasmid containing the CMV promoter driving the Renilla reporter gene. After cell lysis, luciferase and Renilla activities were measured by using the Dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Hybridization—AtT20 cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the full-length cDNA of human IκBα, subcloned in Invitrogen PCDNA3 vector at the EcoRI site, kindly provided by Dr. Simeonides, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA. Twenty hours later, both transfected and non-transfected cells were treated with either vehicle (saline) or 10–7m CRH. Cells were isolated 18 h later and RNA was extracted, as we have previously reported, by using Trizol reagent (Sigma). RNA (10 μg) was separated on a 1.4% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following standard protocols (12Karalis K. Goodwin G. Majzoub J.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A complementary RNA POMC riboprobe was labeled with [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T7 polymerase, as previously described (13Weninger S.C. Peters L.L. Majzoub J.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for at least 16 h with 106 cpm riboprobe/lane. The filter was washed (3× for 20 min in 0.1× SSC-10% SDS) and exposed to Kodak XAR 5 film at room temperature for 30 min. Isolation of Nuclear Extracts—AtT20 cells were harvested, and the cell pellets were lysed in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min. After a brief centrifugation at 3000 × g for 1 min, the cytosolic extracts were collected while the nuclear pellets were lysed in high-salt extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. After incubation on ice for 45 min with intermittent vortexing, the nuclear extracts were collected, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and their protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The nuclear extracts were stored at –80 °C until further use. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from AtT20 cells were subjected to EMSA analysis. Double-stranded oligonucleotides of the core sequence of the NF-κB binding element on mouse immunoglobulin κ light chain (sense, 5′-TCG, ACA GAG GGG ACT TTC CGA GAC GC-3′; antisense, 5′-TCG AGC CTC TCG GAA, AGT CCC CTC TG-3′) were labeled with [32P]dCTP (50 μCi at 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli, DNA polymerase I (Roche Applied Science). Equal amounts (6–10 μg) of nuclear extracts were incubated in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 2.5 μg of poly(dI/dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and 2 μl of the 32P-labeled probe for 30 min at room temperature. For the supershift studies, 2 μl of antibody (anti-p50, anti-p65, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for another 20 min at room temperature before the addition of the 32P-labeled probe. The DNA-protein-binding complexes were analyzed by EMSA on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel using a Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer. After being dried, the gel was exposed to film at –70 °C. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times. Data were analyzed by Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc multiple comparison tests. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. CRH Inhibits Pituitary NF-κB— We evaluated the effect of CRH on pituitary NF-κB DNA-binding activity using AtT20 cells, a pituitary corticotroph cell line. Our findings showed inhibition of the NF-κB DNA-binding activity by CRH (Fig. 1A), which is in agreement with a previous report (10Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Berning B. Behl C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inducer of the NF-κB DNA-binding activity in immune cells, had a similar effect in AtT20 cells as well (Fig. 1A). The effect of CRH was apparent within 15 min of treatment and lasted at least 6 h after its addition to the culture (Fig. 1B). This effect of CRH was blocked by CP154,526, a nonpeptide-specific CRHR1 antagonist (Fig. 2). Challenge of the cells with dexamethasone inhibited the NF-κB DNA-binding activity, analogous to the effect of dexamethasone on the expression of NF-κB in immune cells (Fig. 2). Finally, co-addition of CRH and dexamethasone resulted in a greater inhibition of the NF-κB DNA-binding activity than each agent alone (Fig. 2), suggesting that these hormones might activate this transcription factor by means of independent mechanisms.Fig. 2The CRH effect on NF-κB DNA-binding activity in AtT20 cells is mediated by the CRHR1. AtT20 cells were treated with CRH (10–7m; lane 2), dexamethasone (Dex, 10–6m; lane 3), the CRHR1 antagonist, CP154,526 (10–6m; lane 4), or CRH together with either dexamethasone (lane 5) or CP154,526 (lane 6). EMSA was performed using as probe either 32P-labeled or an excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide. n.s., a nonspecific band shown for loading evaluation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NF-κB-dependent Effect of CRH on Pituitary POMC Gene Expression—The importance of pituitary NF-κB on the CRH-induced regulation of the POMC gene expression was studied by transfecting AtT20 cells with a plasmid containing the POMC promoter coupled to the luciferase reporter gene either intact or mutated at an NF-κB binding site. Cells were treated with 10–7m of CRH for 6 h or vehicle (control). As has been shown previously (11Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 840: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), CRH treatment of AtT20 cells transfected with the intact construct resulted in 2.5–3× induction of the transcriptional activity of the POMC gene (Fig. 3A). CRH treatment of the AtT20 cells transfected with the mutated construct resulted in a further increase (6× over the control) of the transcriptional activation of the POMC gene (Fig. 3A). To elucidate the pathway mediating the above effects of CRH, we pretreated AtT20 cells transfected with either the WT or the mutant construct for 1 h with 10 μm of H89, PKA, or GF109203X, the PKC inhibitor, before the 6-h treatment with 10–7m CRH. H89 abolished the CRH-induced transcriptional activation of both the WT and the mutated POMC promoter construct (Fig. 3B, left panel). GF109203X had no effect on the CRH-mediated transcriptional activation of either POMC promoter construct (Fig. 3B, right panel). We further investigated the effect of NF-κB on the transcriptional activation of the pituitary POMC using AtT20 cells transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the full-length cDNA of IκBα, the cytoplasmic protein that binds NF-κB and does not allow its activation. The abundance of POMC mRNA was assessed by Northern blot analysis in cells transfected with IκB or in control cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the abundance of POMC mRNA was significantly increased (2.5×) after CRH treatment in the cells overexpressing IκBα. These data suggest that induction of NF-κB DNA-binding activity is an important pathway for the CRH-induced stimulation of the pituitary POMC gene expression. In mammals, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis constitutes the main endocrine response to stress and is mediated primarily by increased expression of the hypothalamic CRH (14Chrousos G.P. Gold P.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1992; 267: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3111) Google Scholar). By binding to CRHR1 on pituitary corticotrophs, CRH stimulates pituitary POMC transcription and thus secretion of ACTH, which leads to glucocorticoid release (15Vale W. Rivier C. Brown M.R. Spiess J. Koob G. Swanson L. Bilezikjian L. Bloom F. Rivier J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1983; 39: 245-270PubMed Google Scholar). CRH-induced POMC expression is mediated through the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway and through calcium-dependent events (2Reisine T. Guild S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 488-496PubMed Google Scholar). Other regulators of POMC such as leukemia inhibitory factor have been found to act independently of cAMP and may work by stimulation of the transcription factor STAT3 (16Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Bousquet C. Melmed S. J. Biol.

Invest. 2000; 106: 1417-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of a variety of proinflammatory genes. NF-κB DNA-binding activity is induced by proinflammatory factors as well as by cellular stresses such as heat and hypoxia (19Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). NF-κB is expressed in the brain; a recent study (10Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Berning B. Behl C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that the hypoxia-induced NF-κB DNA-binding activity in hippocampal neurons is inhibited by CRH, suggesting protective effects of CRH on brain cells suffering ischemia-induced damage. This finding provided a mechanism for the suggested neuroprotective effects of CRH. In this report, we demonstrate that induction of pituitary NF-κB DNA-binding activity participates in the transcriptional regulation of the POMC gene by CRH, a critical step of the stress response. In a study evaluating the effect of heating stress on NF-κB activation in a lung cell line, there was inhibition of the NF-κB DNA-binding activity in lung cells that paralleled the degree of stimulation of heat-shock proteins (20Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Radice L. Anzon E. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the inhibition of the NF-κB DNA-binding activity may be part of the tissue-specific stress responses. In previous studies (21Zhao J. Karalis K.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2561-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we showed that CRH stimulates the NF-κB DNA-binding activity in immune cells. This effect of CRH is attributed to the proinflammatory action of peripheral CRH, and it is unlikely to be mediated by the CRH receptor 1 because a CRHR1-specific antagonist did not block this effect of CRH. On the other hand, the effect of CRH on pituitary NF-κB should be mediated by CRHR1, the only shown CRH receptor subtype expressed in corticotroph cells. The above suggests receptor-specific effects of CRH on the regulation of transcription factors such as NF-κB, and, furthermore, they raise the hypothesis of differential regulation of NF-κB by immune versus physical/psychological stressors. Our findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of CRH on the NF-κB DNA-binding activity in pituitary cells is related to the transcriptional activation of the POMC gene by CRH (Fig. 4). Activation of the POMC gene leads to ACTH secretion, a step necessary for the release of glucocorticoid, the end product of the activated HPA axis. Three putative regulatory elements on POMC promoter have been found to bind CRH-induced transcription factors. The AP-1 site in exon 1 (+41/+47) binds CRH-induced cAMP-response element-binding protein, cfos, and junB. Nurr1 and Nurr77 bind to two specific sequences: –70/–63, which corresponds to a pivotal responsive sequence for positive or negative POMC regulation by Nurr and the glucocorticoid receptor, respectively, or –404/–383, that recognizes Nurr77 homodimers or heterodimers of the POMC promoter (4Philips A. Maira M. Mullick A. Chamberland M. Lesage S. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5952-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Drouin J. Maira M. Philips A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We found stimulation of the CRH-mediated transcriptional activation of POMC after mutation of a traditional NF-κB binding sequence. There is no overlap of this site with any of the above well characterized sequences on the POMC promoter. In addition, there is no overlap between this sequence and the suggested glucocorticoid responsive element on the POMC promoter. Negative regulation of the POMC gene by glucocorticoid by means of antagonism between the glucocorticoid receptor and factors such as the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 or the AP-1 has been shown (4Philips A. Maira M. Mullick A. Chamberland M. Lesage S. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5952-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 23Drouin J. Charron J. Gagner J.P. Jeannotte L. Nemer M.

Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, inhibition of the transcriptional stimulation of POMC gene by any other transcription factor has not been reported. In summary, inhibition of NF-κB DNA-binding activity is associated with the transcriptional activation of the POMC gene. It has been well shown that transcriptional activation of the POMC gene is associated with activation of the AP-1 factor (25Autelitano D.J. Brain Res. Bull. 1998; 45: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Parallel activation of NF-κB and AP-1, which leads to increased transcription, has been described for several genes related mainly to activation of the immune system (26Bozinovski S. Jones J.E. Vlahos R. Hamilton J.A. Anderson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42808-42814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest opposing roles for NF-κB and AP-1 in the activation of the POMC gene in corticotroph cells. The contribution of NF-κB in the regulation of the induced expression of other pituitary hormones and its physiological significance remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2115082461,"Antimicrobial peptides such as defensins are crucial for host defense at mucosal surfaces. We reported previously that Salmonella enteritidis flagellin (FliC) induced human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells via NF-κB activation (Ogushi, K., Wada, A., Niidome, T., Mori, N., Oishi, K., Nagatake, T., Takahashi, A., Asakura, H., Makino, S., Hojo, H., Nakahara, Y., Ohsaki, M., Hatakeyama, T., Aoyagi, H., Kurazono, H., Moss, J., and Hirayama, T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 30521–30526). In this study, we examined the role of ganglioside as co-receptors with Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) on FliC induction of hBD-2 expression in Caco-2 cells. Exogenous gangliosides suppressed FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity and binding of FliC to Caco-2 cells. Incorporation of exogenous ganglioside GD1a into Caco-2 cell membranes increased the effect of FliC on hBD-2 promoter activity. In support of a role for endogenous gangliosides, incubation of Caco-2 cells with dl-threo-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-phenylpropanol, a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, reduced FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity. GD1a-loaded CHO-K1-expressing TLR5 cells had a higher potential for hBD-2 induction following FliC stimulation than GD1a-loaded CHO-K1 cells not expressing TLR5. FliC increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, p38, and ERK1/2. Exogenous gangliosides GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b each suppressed FliC induction of p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, FliC did not enhance luciferase activity in Caco-2 cells transfected with a plasmid containing a mutated activator protein 1-binding site. These results suggest that gangliosides act as co-receptors with TLR5 for FliC and promote hBD-2 expression via mitogen-activated protein kinase. Antimicrobial peptides such as defensins are crucial for host defense at mucosal surfaces. We reported previously that Salmonella enteritidis flagellin (FliC) induced human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells via NF-κB activation (Ogushi, K., Wada, A., Niidome, T., Mori, N., Oishi, K., Nagatake, T., Takahashi, A., Asakura, H., Makino, S., Hojo, H., Nakahara, Y., Ohsaki, M., Hatakeyama, T., Aoyagi, H., Kurazono, H., Moss, J., and Hirayama, T.

Furthermore, FliC did not enhance luciferase activity in Caco-2 cells transfected with a plasmid containing a mutated activator protein 1-binding site. These results suggest that gangliosides act as co-receptors with TLR5 for FliC and promote hBD-2 expression via mitogen-activated protein kinase. Antimicrobial peptides play an important role in host defense against bacteria, fungi, and viruses (1Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev.

Defensins are antimicrobial cationic peptides that are stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bonds. In humans, the defensin family consists of α- and β-defensins, with positions of the conserved cysteines defining type.

HE2β1, identified as a splicing variant of the human EP2 gene, also contains the β-defensin-specific cysteine motif (7Jia H.P. Schutte B.C. Schudy A. Linzmeier R. Guthmiller J.M. Johnson G.K.

In addition to their antimicrobial activity, hBD-2 and murine β-defensins can potentially function as chemokines for immature dendritic cells and memory T cells through interaction with chemokine receptor CCR6 (16Yang D. Chertov O. Bykovskaia S.N. Chen Q. Buffo M.J. Shogan J. Anderson M. Schroder J.M. Wang J.M. Howard O.M. Oppenheim J.J.

Recently, it was reported that murine β-defensin 2 is a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 on immature dendritic cells (18Biragyn A. Ruffini P.A. Leifer C.A. Klyushnenkova E. Shakhov A. Chertov O.

TLRs function as pattern recognition molecules for various microbial components and endogenous ligands and mediate activation of the innate immune response (19Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisyo T. Nat.

Thus, induction of hBD-2 may also affect inflammatory reactions. Salmonella is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes gastroenteritis and enteric fever in humans. Salmonella infection of cultured intestinal epithelial cells resulted in hBD-2 induction (15O'Neil D.A. Porter E.M. Elewaut D. Anderson G.M. Eckmann L. Ganz T. Kagnoff M.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6718-6724PubMed Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways involved in hBD-2 induction in Caco-2 cells, a human colon carcinoma line, by Salmonella are still unclear. From our previous work to evaluate the role of hBD-2 in Salmonella enteritidis infection, we concluded that S. enteritidis flagellin (FliC) increased hBD-2 promoter activity and mRNA levels in Caco-2 cells via NF-κB activation (21Ogushi K. Wada A. Niidome T. Mori N. Oishi K. Nagatake T. Takahashi A. Asakura H. Makino S. Hojo H. Nakahara Y. Ohsaki M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol.

It has been demonstrated that TLR5 is a receptor for flagellin of Gram-negative, as well as Gram-positive, bacteria (24Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K.

We reported recently that S. enteritidis FliC increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration via activation of phospholipase C, leading to translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and increased hBD-2 promoter activity (26Takahashi A.

However, the signal transduction pathways involved in hBD-2 induction by FliC are still unclear. Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic cell membranes that have been identified as receptors for bacterial toxins and viruses (27Fishman P.H.

Although TLR5 was determined to be a FliC receptor, gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a, and asialo-GM1 also bound Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin (31Feldman M. Bryan R. Rajan S. Scheffler L. Brunnert S. Tang H. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, asialo-GM1, serving as a P. aeruginosa flagellin receptor, was critical for flagellin-dependent signaling in epithelial cells (32McNamara N. Khong A. McKemy D. Caterina M. Jose D. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9086-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently, Yu et al. (33Yu Y. Zeng H. Lyons S. Carlson A. Merlin D. Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T.

In this study, to evaluate signal transduction pathways used by FliC, we examined the effect of gangliosides and TLR5 on FliC induction of hBD-2 expression in Caco-2 cells, focusing on the potential role of complex gangliosides as TLR co-receptors.

After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, 1 ml of DMEM was added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. To initiate experiments, the medium was replaced with 200 μl of fresh FCS-free DMEM, and 50 μl of the sample to be assayed were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 or 6 h, cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS and lysed by adding 300 μl of lysis buffer (Toyo Ink Co.). After 15 min at room temperature, the lysate was centrifuged (18,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Luciferase activity of the supernatant, measured using a luminometer (Berthold), was expressed relative to the activity of an internal control Renilla luciferase. To assess the effects of TLR5 expression and GD1a loading on FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity, CHO-K1 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates (1.0 × 105 cells per well) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. 1.5 μg of pGL3-2110 were incubated with 0.5 μg of pRL-TK, 1 μg of TLR5 expression vector (pEF6V5/HIS TOPO::TLR5), and 5 μl of DAC-30 (2.5 μg) in 250 μl of FCS-free medium at room temperature for 20 min before addition to cells.

After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h), the pH of the supernatant containing soluble monomeric flagellin was adjusted to 7.2 with 1 m NaOH, and solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to 65% saturation. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). The precipitate was dissolved in distilled water, dialyzed against distilled water, then heated at 65 °C for 15 min, placed on ice, and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h). To the supernatant, which contained depolymerized FliC, solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to 65% saturation. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min.

Effect of Exogenous Ganglioside on FliC Induction of hBD-2 Promoter Activity—Caco-2 cells, transfected with luciferase reporter gene, were incubated with FliC (100 ng/ml) and the indicated concentration of ganglioside at 37 °C for 3 or 6 h. hBD-2 promoter activity was determined using the luciferase reporter gene assay. Effect of Anti-ganglioside Antibodies on FliC Induction of hBD-2 Promoter Activity—Caco-2 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates (5 × 104 cells per well) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before transfection with luciferase reporter gene as described above and incubation with the indicated concentration of anti-GD1a, -GD1b, or -GT1b antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h followed by incubation with FliC (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 6 h. hBD-2 promoter activity was determined using the luciferase reporter gene assay.

S. enteritidis FliC (3 μg), VacA (3 μg), or P. aeruginosa flagellin (3 μg) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with or without the indicated amount of ganglioside at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by addition of trypsin (Sigma), 60 ng in a final volume of 100 μl, and incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, before addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50 mm dithiothreitol), and heating at 95 °C for 5 min.

Western Blotting Analysis—Caco-2 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates (3 × 105 cells per well). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with FCS-free DMEM, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. FliC (10 μg/ml) was added, and after 30 min at 37 °C, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 300 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, which were washed with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 133 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4) at room temperature for 5 min, and then incubated with 5% (w/v) milk powder in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, 133 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm Na3VO4) at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were washed with TBS-T, followed by incubation in a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-phospho-p38 or -phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing in TBS-T, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (1:4,000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h and then washed in TBS-T, followed by incubation for 5 min in TBS before detection by ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To assess TLR5 expression, CHO or CHO-K1 cells transfected with TLR5 expression vector were washed with PBS and lysed in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, which were washed with TBS at room temperature for 5 min, and then incubated with 5% (w/v) milk powder in TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were washed with TBS-T, followed by incubation in a 1:2,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody at room temperature for 1 h, then washed in TBS-T, followed by incubation for 5 min in TBS before detection by ECL system. Effect of Exogenous Gangliosides on FliC Induction of hBD-2 Promoter Activity in Caco-2 Cells—The hBD-2 promoter was coupled to luciferase, and activity was quantified in pGL3-2110-transfected Caco-2 cells incubated with FliC (100 ng/ml) and various amounts of ganglioside mixtures. Gangliosides inhibited hBD-2 promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To determine the specificity of ganglioside inhibition, several gangliosides were tested in the luciferase reporter gene assay. Asialo-GM1 and GM3 had no effect, whereas GM1, GM2, and GD3 were weakly inhibitory, and GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b strongly inhibited FliC action (Fig. 1B). To examine further the inhibitory effects of GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b, we used the luciferase reporter gene assay. Gangliosides GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b each inhibited FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C), with more than 90% inhibition at 10 μm. These results showed that exogenous gangliosides suppress FliC action when added to Caco-2 cell culture medium. Effects of Anti-ganglioside Antibodies on FliC Induction of hBD-2 Promoter Activity in Caco-2 Cells—To confirm the role of FliC interaction with gangliosides on signal transduction, gangliosides on the cell surface were masked by reaction with anti-ganglioside antibody, and then FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity was evaluated with the luciferase assay. After masking of native GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b on Caco-2 cells by antibodies, FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Anti-asialo-GM1 and isotype control antibodies had no effects (data not shown). These results suggested that native gangliosides on Caco-2 cells are functionally important for FliC induction of signaling, leading to hBD-2 expression. Exogenous GD1a Binds to FliC and Prevents Binding of FliC to Caco-2 Cells—Rusnati et al. (37Rusnati M. Tanghetti E. Urbinati C. Tulipano G. Marchesini S. Ziche M. Presta M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that gangliosides directly bind to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and protect it from tryptic digestion. Furthermore, they recently reported (41Rusnati M. Urbinati C. Tanghetti E. Dell'Era P. Lortat-Jacob H. Presta M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4367-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that GM1 acts as functional co-receptor for FGF-2. To determine whether gangliosides directly bind to FliC, we determined whether ganglioside interaction with FliC can prevent its digestion by trypsin. GD1a protected FliC from tryptic digestion in a concentration-dependent manner, but asialo-GM1 had no effect (Fig. 3A), and GD1a did not protect an unrelated bacterial toxin VacA from tryptic digestion (Fig. 3B). Both GD1a and asialo-GM1 had no effect on tryptic digestion of P. aeruginosa flagellin (Fig. 3C). We investigated the effect of exogenous GD1a on binding of FliC to Caco-2 cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. FliC bound to Caco-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and exogenous GD1a suppressed FliC binding to Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4), consistent with the notion that exogenous GD1a directly interacts with FliC and prevents binding of FliC to Caco-2 cells. Effects of Ganglioside Depletion and GD1a Loading on FliC Induction of hBD-2 Promoter Activity in Caco-2 Cells—To confirm that native gangliosides in Caco-2 cells serve as a FliC co-receptor, Caco-2 cells were incubated with 5 μm PPMP, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase before stimulation with FliC. FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity was reduced in PPMP-treated Caco-2 cells. GD1a-loaded Caco-2 cells exhibited greater hBD-2 expression by following FliC stimulation than did untreated cells. Furthermore, incubation of ganglioside-depleted cells with GD1a restored FliC responsiveness (Fig. 5). These results also supported the hypothesis that ganglioside is functionally important as a FliC co-receptor. Effects of TLR5 Expression and GD1a Loading on FliC induction of hBD-2 Promoter Activity in CHO-K1 Cells—To confirm further that the gangliosides serve as a FliC co-receptor, we determined the effects of TLR5 expression and GD1a loading on FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity in CHO-K1 cells. First TLR5 expression in cells was confirmed using Western blotting analysis (Fig. 6A). Both lines of TLR5-expressing cells respond to FliC in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6, B and C). Induction of hBD-2 was increased by prior loading of TLR5-expressed CHO-K1 cells with GD1a, but CHO-K1 cells not expressing TLR5 were unresponsive to FliC (Fig. 6D). These results supported the hypothesis that gangliosides serve as a co-receptor for FliC. Effects of Exogenous Gangliosides on FliC Induction of MAP Kinase Phosphorylation in Caco-2 Cells—To examine the effect of ganglioside on MAP kinase phosphorylation, Caco-2 cells were incubated with FliC plus gangliosides. p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by FliC were significantly inhibited by the presence of GD1a, GD1b, or GT1b (Fig. 7). Effect of Mutation in the AP-1 Site of the hBD-2 Promoter on Response of Caco-2 Cells to FliC—To determine the importance of AP-1 for induction of hBD-2, we constructed pGL3-938/AP-1mt, a plasmid having a mutated AP-1 site. FliC increased activity in cells transfected with pGL3-938 but not pGL3-basic (empty vector), pGL3-938/NF-κBmt, and pGL3-938/AP-1mt (Fig. 8). This result suggested that AP-1 is also an important transcriptional factor for hBD-2 induction in Caco-2 cells by FliC. Binding of P. aeruginosa flagellin to gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a, and asialo-GM1 had been reported in 1998 (31Feldman M. Bryan R. Rajan S. Scheffler L. Brunnert S. Tang H. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, asialo-GM1 on epithelial cells interacted with P. aeruginosa flagellin, leading to activation of phospholipase C, Ca2+ mobilization, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and activation of mucin transcription (32McNamara N. Khong A. McKemy D. Caterina M. Jose D. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9086-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that higher order gangliosides serve as a S. enteritidis FliC co-receptor and influence FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity in Caco-2 cells was inhibited by exogenous gangliosides, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b (Fig. 1). These three gangliosides have a common backbone (GM1) plus additional one or two sialic acids (Fig. 9). Because exogenous GD1a protected FliC from tryptic digestion (Fig. 3A) and suppressed binding of FliC to Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4), it appears that exogenous GD1a directly interacts with FliC. Moreover, these data are consistent with the inhibitory effects of GD1a on FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity. In contrast to the S. enteritidis FliC, P. aeruginosa flagellin digestion by trypsin was not inhibited by GD1a and asialo-GM1 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the sialic acids components of gangliosides have an important role in FliC binding and induction of promoter activity. In agreement, anti-GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b antibodies partially blocked FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity (Fig. 2). Increasing the GD1a content of Caco-2 cells enhanced FliC responsiveness; similarly, inhibition of ganglioside synthesis by treatment with PPMP decreased sensitivity to FliC, which was restored by GD1a loading (Fig. 5). In addition, as shown in Fig. 6, GD1a loading of TLR5-expressing CHO-K1 cells increased hBD-2 induction by FliC, whereas GD1a-loaded CHO-K1 cells were not responsible to FliC. Glycosphingolipid, particularly gangliosides, sphingomyelin, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins exist in glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomain (lipid rafts) in the plasma membrane. Li et al. (42Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) provided a perspective on the biological effect of gangliosides on cell proliferation. Depletion of the gangliosides conceivably abolishes the formation of glycosphingolipid clusters in the cell plasma membrane, and consequently, this could be one mechanism leading to blocked growth factor-induced proliferation. Conversely, preincubation of the cells with gangliosides, which causes enrichment of gangliosides (GD1a) in the plasma membrane and thereby potentially enhances the formation of glycosphingolipid cluster, promoted growth factor-induced proliferation (42Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) through enhancement of growth factor signaling and activation of Src kinase by gangliosides (43Li R. Liu Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42782-42792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, by coupling to glycosphingolipid, Escherichia coli P fimbriae utilize the TLR4-dependent pathway to trigger cytokine responses, consistent with the conclusion that the glycosphingolipid receptors for P fimbriae recruit TLR4 as a co-receptor (44Frendeus B. Wachtler C. Hedlund M. Fischer H. Samuelsson P. Svensson M. Svanborg C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 45Svanborg C. Frendeus B. Godaly G. Hang L. Hedlund M. Wachtler C. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: S61-S65Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, these results supported our hypothesis that cell membrane gangliosides such as GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b function as co-receptors for FliC with TLR5. TLRs can activate not only NF-κB signaling pathways but also MAP kinase-dependent signaling. MAP kinase pathways are thought to play a major role in the activation of gene transcription by proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides. Hobbie et al. (46Hobbie S. Chen L.M. Davis R.J.

In agreement, FliC increased phosphorylation of MAP kinases, p38 and ERK1/2, whereas exogenous GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b blocked FliC induction of p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7). The promoter region of the hBD-2 gene contains an AP-1-binding site as well as NF-κB-binding sites. AP-1 is a homo- or heterodimer of proteins of the Jun and Fos families, transcription factors activated by MAP kinase pathways. Recently, Krisanaprakornkit et al. (47Krisanaprakornkit S. Kimball J.R. Dale B.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported that MAP kinase pathways involving the AP-1 transcription family are important for Fusobacterium nucleatum-dependent hBD-2 induction in gingival epithelial cells. We had reported that FliC enhanced hBD-2 promoter activity in Caco-2 cells transfected with pGL3-938, containing the 5′-flanking region of the hBD-2 gene (–938 to –1) linked to a luciferase reporter but did not enhance activity with pGL3-938/NF-κBmt containing a mutated NF-κB-binding site (21Ogushi K. Wada A. Niidome T. Mori N. Oishi K. Nagatake T. Takahashi A. Asakura H. Makino S. Hojo H. Nakahara Y. Ohsaki M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol.

FliC increased luciferase activity in Caco-2 cells transfected with pGL3-938 but not with pGL3-basic (empty vector), PGL3–938/NF-κBmt, and pGL3-938/AP-1mt (Fig. 8). These data suggest that both NF-κB and AP-1 are important for hBD-2 induction by S. enteritidis FliC in Caco-2 cells. P. aeruginosa can activate MAP kinase signaling pathways through effects on intracellular Ca2+ concentration (48Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Weber A. Nguyen S. Barnes D. Pitt A. Gelber S. Cheung A. Prince A.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 3271-3281PubMed Google Scholar) showed that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration can be elicited by human Jurkat T cell line by using cholera toxin B subunits to ligate ganglioside GM1. It would appear that GM1 may act as a cell activation molecule associated with unidentified transmembrane protein(s) (49Gouy H. Deterre P. Debre P. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3271-3281PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously (26Takahashi A. Wada A. Ogushi K. Maeda K. Kawahara T. Mawatari K. Kurazono H. Moss J. Hirayama T. Nakaya Y.

In this study, we reported that exogenous gangliosides inhibited not only FliC induction of hBD-2 promoter activity but also MAP kinase phosphorylation. Endogenous gangliosides by serving as co-receptors with TLR5 may increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration and MAP kinase phosphorylation by FliC. Moon et al. (50Moon S.K. Lee H.Y. Li J.D. Nagura M.

FliC-initiated signals may activate related pathways because TLRs and the IL-1 receptor have homologous cytoplasmic domains and can induce expression of some of the same target genes. In summary, we have shown that gangliosides such as GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b act as co-receptors for FliC and promote hBD-2 induction in Caco-2 cells. FliC can activate not only the NF-κB pathway but also MAP kinase pathways followed by enhancement of hBD-2 induction. Understanding the signaling pathways used by FliC could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for preventing the toxic effects of bacterial products. We thank M.

https://openalex.org/W2159717687,"In order to investigate the influence of cholesterol (Ch) and monosialoganglioside (GM1) on the release and subsequent deposition/aggregation of amyloid β peptide (Aβ)-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42), we have examined Aβ peptide model membrane interactions by circular dichroism, turbidity measurements, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Model liposomes containing Aβ peptide and a lipid mixture composition similar to that found in the cerebral cortex membranes (CCM-lipid) have been prepared. In all, four Aβ-containing liposomes were investigated: CCM-lipid; liposomes with no GM1 (GM1-free lipid); those with no cholesterol (Ch-free lipid); liposomes with neither cholesterol nor GM1 (Ch-GM1-free lipid). In CCM liposomes, Aβ was rapidly released from membranes to form a well defined fibril structure. However, for the GM1-free lipid, Aβ was first released to yield a fibril structure about the membrane surface, then the membrane became disrupted resulting in the formation of small vesicles. In Ch-free lipid, a fibril structure with a phospholipid membrane-like shadow formed, but this differed from the well defined fibril structure seen for CCM-lipid. In Ch-GM1-free lipid, no fibril structure formed, possibly because of membrane solubilization by Aβ. The absence of fibril structure was noted at physiological extracellular pH (7.4) and also at liposomal/endosomal pH (5.5). Our results suggest a possible role for both Ch and GM1 in the membrane release of Aβ from brain lipid bilayers.

The major components of amyloid plaques are the amphiphilic 40 and 42 residue peptides, Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) (1Haass C. Scholossmocher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L.

Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) consists of a hydrophilic N-terminal region (residues 1–28) and a hydrophobic C-terminal region (residues 29–40 or 29–42). The hydrophobic part of Aβ is originally part of a transmembrane α-helix of APP anchored in the membrane of several subcellular compartments, including the ER (3Bunnell W.L. Pham H.V. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31947-31955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proteolysis by the enzyme(s) γ-secretase leads to the formation of Aβ within the membrane. Thus, the membrane release of Aβ following this enzyme cleavage should play a pivotal role in subsequent amyloid plaque formation. Recent studies have shown that the interaction of Aβ and lipids plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. For instance, the fibrillogenic properties of Aβ are in part a consequence of the composition of the membrane in which it resides, its peptide sequence, and its mode of assembly within the membrane (4Waschuk S.A. Elton E A. Darabi A.A. Fraser P.E. McLaurin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33561-33568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In terms of membrane composition, Ch and GM1 in neuronal cell membranes are widely accepted to be modulators of membrane-associated Aβ fibrillogenesis and neurotoxicity (5Yip C.M. Elton E.A. Darabie A.A. Morrison M.R. McLaurin J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Yanagisawa K. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The formation of GM1-bound Aβ, which is thought to be a seed for the formation of toxic amyloid fiber, depends on the concentration of Ch in model membranes prepared from GM1/Ch/sphingomyelin (SM) (7Kakio A. Nishimoto S. Yanagisawa K. Kozutsumi Y. Matsuzaki K J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24985-24990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Additionally, oligomeric Aβ can promote the release of lipids from asterocytes and neurons by forming Aβ-lipid particles consisting of Ch, phospholipids, and GM1 (8Michikawa M. Gong J.-S. Fan Q.-W. Sawamura N. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7226-7235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Aβ-(1–42) is essential to the early development of AD pathology but is not alone sufficient to promote the formation of mature neuritic plaques unless it is succeeded by the deposition of Aβ-(1–40) (9Ueda K. Fukui Y. Kageyama H. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Compared with Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–42) has been shown to have a greater potential for aggregation (10Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). Studies of Aβ-lipid interaction using total brain lipid extract have shown that the peptides interact in different ways: 1) Aβ-(1–40) destabilizes model membranes and 2) Aβ-(1–42) initially destabilizes but then with time proceeds to stabilize the membrane (11Yip C.M. Darabie A.A. McLaurin J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with a “seeding” hypothesis, in which the aggregates of Aβ-(1–42) act as an initiation factor for early plaque formation, which is then followed by the progressive accumulation of Aβ-(1–40) in the AD brain. So too, they provide an insight into a mechanism of fibrillogenesis, which is at least in part controlled by the release of Aβ from the membrane. AD is a disease that involves attack of the central cerebral cortex. To investigate how Ch and the ganglioside GM1 may influence the release of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) from cerebral cortex membranes we have prepared and examined some model Aβ-containing liposomes. The liposomes are composed of a lipid-mixture similar in composition to cerebral cortex membranes (CCM-lipid). The liposomes prepared were of four different lipid compositions (see Table I); CCM-lipid, liposomes with no GM1 (GM1-free lipid), liposomes without cholesterol (Ch-free lipid), and liposomes without GM1 and Ch (Ch-GM1-free lipid). Liposomes were prepared by hydrating an organic film composed of a mixture of Aβ and one of the four lipid mixtures outlined in Table I. This method of liposome preparation was chosen to reflect a more natural release process as opposed to a method involving addition of Aβ to preformed liposomes.Table IComposition of lipids in the peptide-containing liposomes of this studyCerebral cortex lipidaValues for CCM-lipid are those of Rossiter (Ref. 24)CCM-lipidCh-free lipidGM1-free lipidCh-GM1-free lipidw/w %mol %PC13.915.4 (14.0)18.817.120.4PS8.08.9 (7.0)13.39.811.7PE23.926.5 (24.0)29.229.431.4SM8.08.9 (4.0)12.59.811.7Ch13.314.8 (26.0)16.3Cerebroside14.315.9 (15.0)16.617.621.0GM18.759.7 (4.0)9.6Plasmalogen9.94a Values for CCM-lipid are those of Rossiter (Ref. 24Rossiter R.J.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1477-1482PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were done at a pH of 7.4 to represent a physiological extracellular pH. However, to model whether or not the more acidic environment of the endosomal pathway is significant we have carried out a number of our experiments at a pH of 5.5. The common endosomal and lysosomal pH values are thought to be 6.0 and 4.5–5.5, respectively (15Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 8-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Cain C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 544-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); consequently we chose 5.5 to be representative of both organelles. We report here the mode of interaction of Aβ-(1–40) and a mixture of Aβ-(1–40)/Aβ-(1–42) (10/1) with each of the four types of liposome as revealed by CD, turbidity, and negative-stained TEM measurements. Lyophilized amorphous powders of synthetic Aβ-(1–40) and -(1–42) from dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were obtained from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan), Purities were analyzed by HPLC and amino acid analyses. Egg yolk l-α-phosphatidylcholine (egg PC), egg yolk l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (egg PE), bovine brain l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS), bovine brain galactocerebroside (Cer), bovine brain sphingomyelin (SM), and Ch were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Japan K. K. (Tokyo). Bovine brain ganglioside GM1, 1.1.1.3.3.3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), and other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). It has been recognized that the self-assembly of Aβ is dependent on the initial Aβ structure, i.e. whether it is monomeric and has a random coil structure or whether it has a β-sheet structure (17Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 18McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the present study, the lyophilized powders of the peptide(s) were dissolved in HFIP, a solvent well known for its good solubilizing and α-helical structure-promoting properties. In HFIP solution, Aβ is monomeric (19Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 20Shen C.L. Murphy R.M. Biophys.

The peptide stock solution was made by dissolving the lyophilized amorphous powder in HFIP. Each liposome, composed of the appropriate mixture of lipids and peptide, was prepared by hydration and sonication of a film obtained from the evaporation of a mixture of the lipids in CHCl3 solution and Aβ in HFIP solution. CD Spectrum Measurements—Mixed films of lipids and Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(1–40)/Aβ-(1–42) (10/1) in HFIP were prepared by evaporating the organic solvents under a stream of nitrogen. Any residual solvent in the film was removed in vacuo overnight. Films were hydrated in Tris buffer solution (5 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH of 7.4 or 5.5) and sonicated by ultrasonic irradiation in the cuphorn of a Branson Model 185 sonifier (Danbury, CT). Solutions were sonicated at room temperature for about 30 min until they became transparent. CD spectra were measured on a JASCO J-600 apparatus (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) controlled by a personal computer (NEC PC-9801) using a 1-mm pathlength quartz cell at 25 °C. Four scans were averaged for each sample. An averaged blank spectrum (vesicle suspension or solvent) was subtracted from each sample spectrum. The peptide and lipid concentrations were 50 μm and 1 mm, respectively. Conformational analyses were performed using CONTIN3 in a software package for analyzing protein CD spectra (CDPro) via the Internet (22Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 28: 252-260Crossref Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the program has been successfully applied to the solutions of peptides consisting of α-helix, β-sheet structure, β-turn, and random structure such as the p53 tetramerization domains that have been well characterized by NMR (23Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Turbidity Measurements—A mixed solution of lipids in chloroform and Aβ in HFIP measured to the appropriate peptide/lipid mol ratio was placed in a round bottom flask and dried under a stream of N2 gas. The residual films were further dried overnight in vacuo and then hydrated with Tris buffer saline solution (5 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH of 7.4 or 5.5) by vortexing and then sonicated as described above. Lipid concentrations were kept to a concentration of 100 μm in the same Tris buffer at 25 °C. The absorbance of the sample solution was recorded at 400 nm using a JASCO spectrometer (JASCO Corp., Tokyo, Japan) after vigorous vortexing. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—Each sample was absorbed onto a carbon-coated copper grid (mesh) by floating a drop of sample solution. Excess solution was removed by filter paper blotting, the grid was washed by floating a drop of water, and then the water was removed. The sample on the grid was then negatively stained with an aqueous phosphotungstic acid (1.0%), and the excess staining solution was removed. After drying, the samples were imaged with a HITACHI HU-12A electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan) operating at 100 kV. Samples prepared for the CD experiments were also used for the TEM experiments. The peptide and lipid concentrations were 50 μm and 1 mm, respectively. Compositions of Lipid Mixtures Similar to Cerebral Cortex Membrane—To investigate the roles of GM1 and Ch in Aβ-lipid interactions, we chose to model cerebral cortex membranes, because this is the main location of amyloid in the body. Values for the composition of total lipid extract from cerebral cortex membranes were those reported by Rossiter (24Rossiter R.J. Neurochemistry.2nd Ed. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield1962Google Scholar). Because of its easily oxidative property and its instability under acidic conditions, plasmalogen was not included in the model liposomes of this study. In the human cerebral cortex tissue, there is about 10% (w/w) of plasmalogen. We have adjusted the proportion of the other components to allow for this omission as shown in Table I, where we list the compositions of the four types of liposomes examined. Ch (26 mol %) is significantly more abundant in CCM membranes than GM1 (4 mol %). Secondary Structure of Aβ-(1–40) in Lipid Bilayers—Amyloidogenesis involves a transition from random or α-helical to a β-structure, which is necessary for fibril formation in vivo. Thus we monitored the conformational change of Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(1–40)/-(1–42) (10:1, molar ratio) in the four liposome systems (Table I) by CD spectroscopy over a period of 7 days. In buffer solution, the peptide Aβ-(1–40) adopts a mainly random coil structure upon addition of the peptide stock solution to the buffer solution (Fig. 1A). This result agrees with the CD data reported previously (7Kakio A. Nishimoto S. Yanagisawa K. Kozutsumi Y. Matsuzaki K J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24985-24990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 25Ji S.-R. Wu Y. Sui S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6273-6279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Then, after 5 days, it takes a mainly β-sheet structure as suggested by the peak minimum around 218 nm. A conformational analysis of its spectrum showed 15% α-helix and 30% β-structure. This main structure still persisted after 7 days. In the CCM membrane at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1, B-a), upon preparation from the lipid-peptide film, Aβ-(1–40) adopts a mainly random structure within the liposomes, however, after 1 day a broad negative band is seen around 218 nm, the intensity of which is approximately equal to that of the peak observed for the 7-day-old sample in buffer. But conformational analysis of the spectrum showed 60% β-structure and the same spectral pattern after 3, 5, and 7 days. When compared with the CD spectra in buffer, the β-structure formation was accelerated and more extensive. At pH 5.5, similar CD curves were obtained, though the rate of β-structure formation was significantly reduced. After 1 day under acidic conditions there was only 36% β-structure as compared with 60% at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1, B-b). On the other hand, the peptide in GM1-free lipid liposomes at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1C), showed a shallow negative band around 210 nm with 25% α-helix and 10% β-structure, and after 1, 3, and 5 days the negative band had shifted to 216 nm, corresponding to 45% β-structure and 10% α-helix, indicating that the absence of ganglioside slightly reduces formation of β-structure, compared with CCM membranes. Interestingly, in Ch-free membrane (Fig. 1D), Aβ-(1–40) had a negative band around 205 nm similar to that of GM1-free liposomes after preparation. Some α-helical structure (about 15%) was seen, but in time the band around 205 nm intensified, and a crossing point on the horizontal axis occurred characteristic of β-structure. After 3 days, β-structural content reached 50%, indicating, that in time, the absence of either Ch or the absence of GM1 led to a decrease in β-structure formation. For Ch- and GM1-free liposomes (Fig. 1E) at pH 7.4, Aβ-(1–40) showed a broad negative band around 220 nm upon preparation, there was some α-helical structure present. However, in time, the band shifted to 203 nm and became shallower, also the crossing point of the horizontal axis red-shifted to more than 210 nm, indicating decreased β-structure. In fact, the spectra could not be analyzed using the CDPro software (22Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 28: 252-260Crossref Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). Similar CD spectra have been reported in which the spectrum has an atypical minimum at 223 nm and a maximum at 203 nm; this pattern is characteristic of amyloid fibers (26Huang T.H.J. Yang D.-S. Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 27Gorman P.M. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, electron microscopy of Aβ-(1–40) did not detect any fibril structure in Ch-free or Ch-GM1-free membranes. These results indicated that the CD spectral patterns having the minimum at 223 nm and the maximum at 203 nm do not necessarily exhibit the characteristics of amyloid fibers. At pH 5.5, although the minima around 220 were shallower than those at pH 7.4, very similar CD curves were observed, and the fibril structure was not detected by TEM at either pH (data not shown). Consequently, it would appear that the presence of Ch and GM1 ganglioside is necessary for β-amyloid formation to occur. CD Spectra of Aβ-(1–40)/Aβ-(1–42) (10:1)) in Lipid Bilayers—To investigate a seeding hypothesis in which aggregates of Aβ-(1–42) act as an initiation factor for early plaque formation, we examined changes in conformation of Aβ-(1–40)/-(1–42) (10:1, molar ratio) in the four model liposomes at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2) by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our results show that in the CCM and Ch-free membranes, the rate of β-structure formation is greater than that for the corresponding Aβ-(1–40) liposomes. In CCM-lipid, upon preparation, we observed 40% β-structure which, after 1 day became 50%; for Aβ-(1–40) these values are 18 and 60% β-structure, respectively (Figs. 2A and 1B). In the GM1-free membrane, the CD spectral pattern of Aβ-(1–40)/-(1–42) is not different from that of Aβ-(1–40) (Figs. 2B and 1C). In Ch-free lipids, a mixture of Aβ-(1–40)/-(1–42) formed a β-structure more easily than the Aβ-(1–40) liposomes (Figs. 2C and 1D). Interestingly, in the Ch-GM1-free lipid liposomes upon preparation the peptide had a 35% β-structure and 10% α-helical structure. This was not observed for Aβ-(1–40) and in time it transformed the conformations to the other conformational mixture containing β-structure as described above (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the rate of formation of the β-structure is generally promoted by the addition of Aβ-(1–40), although ultimately formation depends on lipid composition. Turbidity Measurements—To monitor the aggregation or precipitation produced by lipid-peptide interactions, we measured the changes in turbidity in the buffer solution and solutions of the four Aβ-lipid mixture liposomes over a 7-day period (Fig. 3). Solution absorbance measured at 400 nm was plotted as a function of time. Days after successive film preparation, hydration, and sonication of mixture solutions for different ratios of Aβ-(1–40) and lipids are shown on the abscissa. The lipid concentration was kept at 100 μm. In the absence of liposomes, at a peptide concentration of 40 μm at pH 7.4, the absorbance gradually increased from 1 day and reached a maximum at 3 days, and then leveled out as a plateau (Fig. 3A). However, at lower peptide concentrations (5–20 μm), the aggregation behavior was dependent on peptide concentration. In conjunction with the CD results, it was concluded that increasing turbidity was attributable to β-structure formation, associated with Aβ aggregation. For 40 μm Aβ in CCM liposomes at pH 7.4, solution turbidity gradually increased over 4 days, then it slightly decreased, but at lower peptide concentrations there was little change in turbidity (Fig. 3B). With the results of CD and TEM experiments in mind, little or no change in turbidity is due to an aggregation of Aβ-(1–40) to form a β-structure. Similar turbidity changes in CCM were obtained at pH 5.5 (date not shown). In the GM1-free liposomes at pH 7.4, solution turbidity did not change at the examined Aβ concentrations except for 40 μm peptide, where a slight decrease occurred 1 day after preparation and was followed by a gradual increase (Fig. 3C). Little or no change in turbidity was consistent with the CD and TEM results, which showed the formation of aggregated peptide-lipids particles (to be described below). Interestingly, in Ch-GM1-free lipid liposomes at pH 7.4, turbidities for 20 and 40 μm peptide decreased. For 40 μm peptide an especially dramatic decrease in turbidity occurred over the first day (Fig. 3, E-a). Similar changes in turbidity were observed at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3, E-b). The decrease in turbidity indicated liposomes were solubilized by Aβ-(1–40), to form small peptide-lipid particles. The TEM image for this solution showed the liposomes became smaller with time and showed no fibril structure. Although a similar decrease in turbidity was observed for the Ch-free liposome solution (Fig. 3D), this was independent of peptide concentration; the turbidity of 20 μm Aβ was much larger than that of 40 μm. This also indicated that liposomes were solubilized and led to the formation of small particles. Turbidity of Aβ-(1–40)/Aβ-(1–42) (10:1) was measured in CCM lipid and ChGM1-free lipid at pH 7.4 (data not shown). Initial turbidity did not depend on peptide concentration and did not change dramatically with time, which indicated the membrane solubilization did not occur as it did for Aβ-(1–40) in Ch-free and Ch-GM1-free membranes. Studies by Transmission Electron Microscopy—To observe changes with time in the morphological characteristics of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–40)/Aβ-(1–42) (10:1) both in buffer and in the liposomes we made measurements by TEM. Liposomes were prepared from a mixture of lipids (1 mm) and peptide (50 μm) and then examined over a period of 1–10 days under the electron microscope. The TEM samples were negatively stained. For Aβ-(1–40), after 1 day in buffer solution at pH 7.4, an indistinct fibril structure was observed, which after 10 days became better defined (Fig. 4A). In CCM lipid membrane at pH 7.4, a distinct fibril structure was observed, with a dark phospholipid membrane-like shadow after 1 day (Fig. 4B-a, i). After 10 days the same clear fibril structure seen in saline buffer was observed (Fig 4B-a, iii). At pH 5.5, lots of short filaments were visible after 1 day and clear long fibrils were observed after 3 days, indicating that the growth of fibril structure is slower than that at pH 7.4 (Fig 4B-b). This is consistent with the slower rate of β-structure formation seen by CD after 1 day at pH 5.5 relative to that at pH 7.4. In GM1-free membranes (Fig. 4C) at pH 7.4 after 1 day, long fibril structures were present along the surface of vesicles, which were probably large aggregated/fused liposomes. After 3 days, small vesicles emerged around the large aggregate liposomes, also some fibrils were still apparent along their surface. After 10 days we observed aggregates of small vesicles (several ten-fold nanometers in diameter). These results indicate that Aβ can disrupt the large liposomes into smaller vesicles, presumably by the formation of lipid-peptide complexes. After 1 day in the Ch-free membrane (Fig. 4D) at pH 7.4, a few relatively long fibrils were observed around the large liposomes. After 4 days, numerous small filament-like structures, probably lipid-peptide complexes, were present around the liposomes. Interestingly, after 10 days, thicker and longer fibrils (several ten-fold nanometers in diameter) were observed around the liposomes, which were different from the fibril structure observed in the buffer and CCM liposomes.Fig. 4Electron micrographs in buffer solution (A), CCM at (a) pH 7.4 and at (b) pH 5.5 (B), GM1-free (C), Ch-free (D), Ch-GM1-free (E) at (a) pH 7.4 and at (b) pH 5.5 over a period of 14 days after the incubation of Aβ-(1–40) and in CCM (F) and Ch-GM1-free liposomes (G) of Aβ-(1–40)/Aβ-(1–42)(10:1).

Bars are 500 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results indicate that although the Ch-free membrane first releases some Aβ to create fibrils, in time, the membranes were slowly solubilized by Aβ to make short and thin fibrils and eventually thicker and longer fibers. In Ch-GM1-free membranes at pH 7.4 and 5.5 (Fig. 4, E-a and -b) fibrils were not observed, liposomes of various shapes and sizes were present, and with time an increase in the number of smaller vesicles occurred. Images of Aβ-(1–40)/Aβ-(1–42) (10:1) in CCM (Fig. 4F) were very similar to those for Aβ-(1–40) (Fig. 4B), showing indistinct fibril structures after 1 day and extensive well defined ones after 10 days (Fig. 4F). Similar images (not shown) were observed for GM1-free membranes. Interestingly, in Ch-GM1-free membranes, both fibrils and spherical liposomes were present after 1 day, although with time the number of fibrils increased and the spherical liposomes disappeared (Fig 4G). Similar images (data not shown) were observed for the Ch-free membranes. Because Aβ peptides are generated by the partial processing of the transmembrane α-helix of APP anchored in the brain membrane, their release from the membrane must play an important role in their subsequent aggregation and precipitation. Thus, to investigate how membrane lipids participate in the formation of fibril structure, we monitored the release of Aβ peptide from Aβ peptide-model membranes. Liposomes were prepared from Aβ and a lipid-mixture similar in composition to that of cerebral cortex membranes with and without ganglioside and/or cholesterol. Our CD studies have shown that when a 50 μm solution of Aβ-(1–40) in HFIP solution is hydrated in buffer solution, it undergoes a transition from random coil to β-structure over a period of 3 days (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with the turbidity measurements. Over 24 h, the turbidity did not change, but it rapidly increased from 1 to 3 days, and only moderately after 3 days (Fig. 3A). From these results we propose that hydration of monomeric Aβ-(1–40) in organic solvent caused a slow change in confor"

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5926-5939PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis is the mechanism utilized by metazoans to eliminate redundant or potentially deleterious cells and is considered an essential process for regulating tissue homeostasis. Apoptosis induction is arguably the most potent defense against cancer making it a desirable end point for both chemoprevention (9Sharma R.A. Manson M.M. Gescher A. Steward W.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: 12-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and chemotherapy (10Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a relatively linear process. It is triggered by an initiation phase that is highly varied depending on cell type and the underlying stress stimulus (e.g. oxidative stress, DNA damage, ion fluctuations, and cytokines). This is followed by an effector phase where the cell undergoes distinct biochemical changes that result in the systematic activation of catabolic enzymes (proteases and nucleases) that ultimately participate in the cleavage of proteins and DNA characteristic of the degradation phase (11Kroemer G. Petit P. Zamzami N. Vayssière J.-L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 12Raff M. Nature. 1998; 396: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Two effector mechanisms associated with caspase (cysteine proteases involved in apoptosis) activation have been characterized extensively. These include the extrinsic or death receptor-mediated effector mechanism and the intrinsic or mitochondrial-mediated effector mechanism (13Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6168) Google Scholar). The extrinsic mechanism is mediated by the activation of caspase-8, while the intrinsic mechanism relies on the release of soluble apoptogenic mitochondrial proteins (i.e. cytochrome c) to activate caspase-9 and initiate cellular degradation. These apical caspases can trigger the activation of downstream proteases like caspase-3. Furthermore, cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic effector mechanisms can be established via the activity of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (e.g. Bid and Bax) to amplify cell death signaling (14Reed J.C. Jurgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In addition to the mitochondria, growing evidence suggests that other organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes are also major points of integration for damage sensing, pro-apoptotic signaling, and caspase activation (15Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). CDDO appears to induce apoptosis through the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic effector mechanisms. The activation of caspase-8 (5Stadheim T.A. Suh N. Ganju N. Sporn M.B. Eastman A. J. Biol.

However, none of the previously referenced studies investigated the underlying cytotoxic signal responsible for triggering the downstream effector mechanisms associated with CDDO-induced apoptosis. This study compared and contrasted the effects of CDDO on COLO 16 human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells and their respiration-deficient derivatives depleted of mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 clones). We demonstrate that CDDO triggers apoptosis in these cells by increasing cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c). The increase in [Ca2+]c caused by CDDO appeared to encourage caspase activation and chromatin condensation without inducing MPT in the parental cells. The data would also suggest that CDDO could conceivably promote the release of soluble apoptogenic mitochondrial proteins (e.g. cytochrome c, endonuclease G, and apoptosis inducing factor) via Ca2+-induced MPT in the ρ0 clones, which may be dependent on the Ca2+ buffering capacity of their mitochondria. Cell Culture and Reagents—The COLO 16 cell line was provided by Dr. Janet Price (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX).

Assays for Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production and Mitochondrial Inner Transmembrane Potential (ΔΨm)-Hydroperoxide and superoxide production were determined using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and dihydroethidium, respectively (17Hail Jr., N.

Briefly, cells in 10-cm plastic tissue culture plates were treated for 2 or 4 h with 20 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and 5 μm CDDO, 5 μm 4HPR, 5 μm CDDO and 5 μm 4HPR, or Me2SO. The cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in 5 ml of Ca2+-free PBS at 37 °C, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of Ca2+-free PBS at 37 °C, and analyzed immediately for 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry. For superoxide detection, cells in 10-cm plastic tissue culture plates were treated for 2 or 4 h with 5 μm CDDO or Me2SO. Twenty min before the cells were harvested, dihydroethidium was added directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 5 μm. The cells were harvested as described above and analyzed immediately for ethidium fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry. The cationic dyes DiOC6 (3Suh N. Wang Y. Honda T. Gribble G.W.

Assay for Ca2+ Mobilization—[Ca2+]c was measured using the cell-permeant Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (17Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Where indicated, BAPTA acetoxymethyl ester (10 μm) was added to the culture medium of cells in 10-cm plastic tissue culture plates for a 1-h exposure prior to the loading procedure with Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester. The medium was removed from the tissue culture plates and replaced with 4 μm Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester diluted in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) (10 mm d-glucose, 120 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm NaH2PO4, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4 at 37 °C)) (Sigma) for 20 min. The dishes were washed once with 5 ml KRB to remove the residual dye. The cultures were then treated for the designated times with the indicated concentrations of CDDO or the vehicle Me2SO diluted in KRB alone or including 2 mm CaCl2. The cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in 5 ml of Ca2+-free PBS at 37 °C, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of Ca2+-free PBS at 37 °C, and analyzed immediately for Fluo-3 fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry. Flow Cytometry—All flow cytometric procedures were performed with a Coulter XL flow cytometer, and data analysis was accomplished using System II XL software (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). The experiments employing flow cytometry were typically conducted using duplicate samples for each treatment, unless otherwise indicated, and each experiment was repeated at least two times. Approximately 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample. In all cytofluorometric determinations, cell debris and cells clumps were excluded from the analysis of the cell suspensions by gating. Electron Microscopy—Cells were seeded in single-well tissue culture slides and allowed to attach and proliferate for 24–48 h. The culture medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 5 μm CDDO or an equal volume of the vehicle Me2SO. After 4 h, the medium was removed from the wells and the cells were washed twice with 3 ml of Ca2+-free PBS at 37 °C. The last wash was replaced with 2 ml of fixative (3% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.3 at 37 °C)) (all from Sigma). The samples were stored overnight at 4 °C, embedded, sectioned, and stained using standard electron microscopy procedures. The samples were viewed using a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA), and images were acquired using an Advanced Microscopy Techniques imaging system (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA). CDDO Induces Apoptosis in COLO 16 Cells and Their ρ0 Clones—Previous studies have demonstrated that low micromolar (≤10 μm) concentrations of CDDO can induce apoptosis in various human tumor cell types (4Lapillonne H.

We exposed COLO 16 cells to 1, 5, and 10 μm CDDO for 24 h and examined them for DNA degradation characteristic of apoptosis (indicated by hypoploid DNA content using a hypotonic PI stain). As shown in Fig. 1A, increasing concentrations of CDDO promoted increasing amounts of hypoploid cells in the treatment populations relative to the Me2SO-treated control. The 5 and 10 μm concentrations of CDDO appeared to be equally effective in promoting apoptosis in the majority of the treatment populations. Between 12 and 24 h after exposure to CDDO, there was also a time-dependent increase in the percentages of hypoploid cells in the treatment populations (Fig. 1B). COLO 16 ρ0 cells are more resistant than COLO 16 cells to apoptosis induction following exposure to several putative cancer chemopreventive agents. These agents (i.e. 4HPR (18Hail Jr., N. Lotan R. J.

Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that ρ0 cells are more resistant than their parental counterparts to the apoptogenic effects of various cancer chemotherapeutic agents (19Singh K.K.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3139-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) implying that the disruption of mitochondrial respiration was associated with cell death. We exposed the ρ0 cells to 5 μm CDDO for 12 and 24 h and examined them for hypoploid DNA content to determine whether there was any difference in their sensitivity to CDDO-induced apoptosis relative to the parental cells. Interestingly, the ρ0 cells appeared to be more sensitive to CDDO-induced apoptosis. The majority of the ρ0 cells exhibited hypoploid DNA content after a 12-h exposure to 5 μm CDDO, while a longer exposure was required for the same treatment to attain a similar response in the parental cells (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that the disruption of mitochondrial respiration was not directly associated with CDDO-induced apoptosis. Short term exposure of the COLO 16 cells to 5 or 10 μm CDDO promoted morphological changes indicative of early apoptosis in the majority of the treatment populations. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, a 4-h exposure to 5 μm CDDO caused the parental cells to shrink in size and round up from the tissue culture plate relative to the Me2SO-treated controls (Fig. 2B). Similar morphological changes were also observed in the ρ0 clones after a 4-h exposure to 5 μm CDDO (not shown). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, CDDO promoted the rapid activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 that peaked within 2 h after treatment (7Pedersen I.M. Kitada S"
https://openalex.org/W1979002167,"hGTSE-1 (human G2 and S phase-expressed-1) is a cell cycle-regulated protein mainly localized in the cytoplasm and apparently associated with the microtubules. hGTSE-1 is able to down-regulate levels and activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein: it binds the C-terminal region of p53 and represses its ability to induce apoptosis after DNA damage. Here we report that, after DNA damage, hGTSE-1 becomes stabilized in a p53-independent way and accumulated in the nucleus. Further characterization of hGTSE-1 localization revealed increased nuclear staining in unstressed cells after treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, or when a nuclear export signal (NES) located in its C-terminal region was mutated. Finally, we provide evidence that hGTSE-1 ectopic expression, in addition to p53 protein levels down-regulation, is able to enhance cytoplasmic localization of p53. Interestingly, NES-mutated hGTSE-1 accumulates in the nucleus, binds p53 but looses its ability to enhance cytoplasmic redistribution of p53 and to regulate p53 protein levels. Similarly, when wild type hGTSE-1 functions on p53 were analyzed in cells lacking Mdm2, it failed in regulating both p53 localization and protein levels, thus indicating that hGTSE-1 requires an intact NES and functional Mdm2 for the regulation of p53. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of hGTSE-1 function, whereby its characterized nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling ability is required to regulate p53. hGTSE-1 (human G2 and S phase-expressed-1) is a cell cycle-regulated protein mainly localized in the cytoplasm and apparently associated with the microtubules. hGTSE-1 is able to down-regulate levels and activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein: it binds the C-terminal region of p53 and represses its ability to induce apoptosis after DNA damage.

The p53-mediated response pathway is among the most frequent targets of inactivation in human cancers. The tumor-suppressor p53 protein is a nuclear transcription factor that transactivates a variety of genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Failure of p53 function can be attributed to the following: (a) inactivation of p53 by mutations altering its DNA binding capability (2Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), (b) deregulation of proteins that control p53 levels or activity (i.e. cellular or viral oncogenes) (3Lin H.J.

Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 depends on nuclear export signals (NES) 1The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export signal; NLS, nuclear localization signal; ET, etoposide; TS-p53, temperature sensitive-p53; WT, wild type; LMB, Leptomycin B; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export signal; NLS, nuclear localization signal; ET, etoposide; TS-p53, temperature sensitive-p53; WT, wild type; LMB, Leptomycin B; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) located in the N and C termini of the protein (7Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The main regulator of p53 is Mdm2, which interacts with the N-terminal of p53 thus blocking p53 transcriptional activation and promoting its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (8Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 seems to be essential for its degradation by Mdm2 (9Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 10O'Keefe K. Li H. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6396-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Mdm2 expression is a key factor that efficiently promotes nuclear export of p53 (11Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat.

Important stimuli leading to p53 activation and stabilization such as DNA damage, which causes phosphorylation of the N-terminal NES (13Zhang Y. Xiong Y.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5031-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) are able to down-regulate or destabilize p53 by cytoplasmic sequestration, thus emphasizing the importance of p53 relocalization as an effective means to control its function.The C-terminal domain of p53 has been characterized as a key domain involved in the control of p53 localization (19Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Ostermeyer A.G. Runko E. Winkfield B. Ahn B. Moll U.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It has been proposed that p53 localization is mainly regulated by the NES masking/NES exposition switch (21Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Mdm2-driven ubiquitination or certain mutations of the p53 C-terminal region enhance p53 relocalization to the cytoplasm (22Gu J. Nie L. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 8521-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Mouse GTSE-1 (G2 and S phase-expressed), previously named B99, is a cell cycle-regulated protein that mainly localizes to the microtubules and is induced by WT-p53 upon DNA damage (24Utrera R. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Delia D. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Collavin L. Monte M. Verardo R. Pfleger C. Schneider C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that its human homologue, hGTSE-1 (26Monte M. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Dragani T.A. Schneider C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), is able to control DNA damage-induced apoptosis by down-regulating p53 function (27Monte M. Benetti R. Buscami G. Sandy P. Del Sal G. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30356-30364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). hGTSE-1 binds the C-terminal domain of p53 (355-393) and induces down-regulation of p53 levels and activity. Although hGTSE-1 binding to p53 seems to be required for repressing p53 activity, it is unclear how hGTSE-1 regulates p53 stability.Here we report that hGTSE-1 protein accumulates after DNA damage through a p53-independent mechanism concomitant with its relocalization from cytoplasm to the nucleus. By studying hGTSE-1 subcellular localization we found that it is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein containing an active NES in its C-terminal region. We also demonstrate that in addition to decreasing p53 levels, hGTSE-1 expression promotes p53 localization to the cytoplasm. Finally, we show that shuttling activity of hGTSE-1 as well as Mdm2 are both required for the regulation of p53 localization and levels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Treatments—Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). D4H cells are Saos-2 cells expressing the V143A TS-p53 mutant form (28Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MEF p53-/- were obtained from p53 knockout mice.Cells treated with methyl methanesulfonate (Fluka) were incubated for 4 h with the drug followed by extensive washing and medium replacement until the end of the treatment. Etoposide (ET) (Sigma) treatment consisted on the addition of ET for the indicated time. UV and γ-irradiation treatments were performed as previously described (30Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M.

MG132 (50 μm) (Sigma) was added to cell culture for 8 h after 16 h of transfection.Transfection and Vectors—Cells in mid-log growth phase were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) reagent as indicated by the manufacturer. hGTSE-1, GTSE-1, or their NES mutants were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) expression vector. hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 NES double point mutants were generated by PCR. In the hGTSE-1 NES mutant isoleucine 628 and leucine 630 were changed to alanine, whereas in the GTSE-1 NES mutant leucines 648 and 650 were changed to alanine. For p53 localization pEGFP-p53 expressing WT p53 was used. The 22.23-p53 expression vector encodes for the L22Q,W23S p53 mutant.Immunofluorescence and Cell Fractionation—For the immunofluorescence assay, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and treated with Triton X-100. The staining was performed using specific antibodies incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) as indicated. For hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 staining we used affinity purified polyclonal antibodies (24Utrera R. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Delia D. Schneider C.

Cell fractionation was performed by using the Subcellular Proteome Extraction kit (Calbiochem) as described by the manufacturer.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. After 10 min at 4 °C lysates were clarified by centrifugation and precleared with 20 μl of Protein A-Speharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). Then antibody prebound to 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was added and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. The resin was washed and bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Western blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures using the following primary antibodies: affinity purified LF1 anti-hGTSE-1 polyclonal antibody, DO-1 anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-p21Waf-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), affinity purified anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, affinity purified anti-p53 polyclonal antibody, and anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).

Nevertheless, similarly to other p53 target genes, mouse GTSE-1 is also induced by DNA damage in cells lacking functional p53 (24Utrera R. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Delia D. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).To characterize the p53-dependent regulation of hGTSE-1 protein, we used human cell lines expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 allele (TS-p53), with a mutant conformation at 37 °C and a WT conformation at 32 °C. As shown in Fig. 1A, no differences in hGTSE-1 protein levels were observed between WT or mutant p53 conformations, indicating that the expression of hGTSE-1 protein is not induced by WT-p53. This observation is supported by the fact that p53 failed to increase hGTSE-1 mRNA levels in Northern blot analysis in the same cellular system (data not shown).We then analyzed hGTSE-1 protein levels in response to DNA-damaging agents such as γ-radiation and ET in cells containing different forms of endogenous p53: MCF-7 (WT p53), T47D cells (mutant p53), and Saos-2 cells (p53 null). As shown in Fig. 1B, hGTSE-1 expression increased after γ-irradiation (400 rads) in all tested cell lines. Similar results were obtained using 100 μm ET (data not shown), suggesting that hGTSE-1 protein levels increase after genotoxic stress independently of p53 status. A time course experiment after ET treatment was performed to study the behavior of endogenous hGTSE-1 protein upon DNA damage in U2OS cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, Western blot analysis revealed that the hGTSE-1 protein increased 15-18 h after treatment with ET. Furthermore, analysis of p53 response in this context showed that hGTSE-1 becomes accumulated with a slower kinetic compared with both p53 and the p53-induced protein p21Waf-1 (32El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7888) Google Scholar), detected 3 and 6-9 h after ET treatment, respectively, indicating that hGTSE-1 increases in a late phase after DNA damage.By analyzing hGTSE-1 intracellular localization we observed that, similar to the murine protein, hGTSE-1 is a cytoplasmic protein localized to the microtubules (26Monte M. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Dragani T.A. Schneider C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Overexpression of hGTSE-1, however, revealed a small subpopulation of cells that, in addition to cytoplasmic staining, displayed nuclear staining (data not shown). This observation prompted us to analyze whether a change in hGTSE-1 localization could be associated to a DNA damage response. To this purpose, endogenous and ectopically expressed hGTSE-1 localization were analyzed in U2OS cells 24 h after ET treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, ET treatment evidenced a significant fraction of cells with nuclear-localized hGTSE-1. Scoring hGTSE-1 localization in cells treated with ET, as well as its localization in cells treated with other DNA damaging agents as methyl methanesulfonate (100 μm) or UV irradiation (20 J/m2) (see “Experimental Procedures”), indicated that DNA damage efficiently relocalized hGTSE-1 to the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Finally, the kinetics of hGTSE-1 relocalization were monitored in U2OS cells ectopically expressing hGTSE-1 at different time points after ET treatment. As shown in Fig. 2C, ET treatment strongly enhanced hGTSE-1 relocalization to the nucleus 13-18 h after damage, coincident with the previous information related to the accumulation of the endogenous protein (Fig. 1C). Altogether these observations indicate that hGTSE-1 becomes stabilized and relocalized to the nucleus in response to DNA damage signals.Fig. 2Changes in hGTSE-1 subcellular localization after DNA damage.

To this purpose, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of hGTSE-1 or its mouse homologue GTSE-1 in unstressed U2OS cells after treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB). 18 h after cell transfection with human or mouse GTSE-1, LMB was added for an additional 12 h. As shown in Fig. 3A, inhibition of nuclear export by LMB correlated with hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 accumulation in the nucleus, indicating that shuttling of these proteins could be driven by NESs.Fig. 3hGTSE-1 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein.

Monte, R. Benetti, L. Collavin, L. Marchionni, G. Del Sal, and C. Schneider, unpublished data. Analysis of the mouse GTSE-1 amino acid sequence revealed a conserved leucine-rich sequence (Fig. 3B) conforming to the criteria established for NESs, similar to that observed for HIV-1 Rev protein (33Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). We generated human and mouse GTSE-1 constructs with a double-point mutation within the putative NES (hGTSE-1 NES- and GTSE-1 NES-, respectively) by changing isoleucine 628 and leucine 630 to alanine in hGTSE-1, and leucines 648 and 650 to alanine in GTSE-1 as indicated in Fig. 3B. hGTSE-1 NES- and GTSE-1 NES- constructs were transfected in U2OS cells and 24 h later their localizations were assessed by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3C, both NES mutants displayed an enhanced nuclear localization, thus identifying the presence of an active NES within GTSE-1 proteins. This result is in accordance with the enhanced nuclear localization of hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 observed after LMB treatment, because such a drug inhibits nuclear export pathways that require the CRM1 receptor for leucine-rich NESs (34Fornerod M.

Accumulation of GTSE-1 proteins to the nucleus could imply another control at the level of nuclear entry, in addition to the described regulation of nuclear export. However, point mutation of two putative NLSs starting on amino acids 235 and 542, failed to completely abolish nuclear localization of hGTSE-1 (data not shown), indicating that other signals or other factors could be involved in such activity.hGTSE-1 Overexpression Enhances Cytoplasmic Localization of p53—We have previously reported that hGTSE-1 is able to bind the C-terminal region of p53 and down-regulate its levels and activity (27Monte M. Benetti R. Buscami G. Sandy P. Del Sal G. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30356-30364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal region of p53 has been shown to be critical in regulating its stability (37Chernov M.V. Bean L.J. Lerner N. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

We chose the GFP-tagged p53 construct because it represents a sensible and broadly used method to detect p53 localization (10O'Keefe K. Li H. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell.

As shown in Fig. 4A hGTSE-1 overexpression markedly increased cytoplasmic localization of GFP-p53. To further control this effect we performed the same experiments in p53-knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF p53-/-), GFP-p53. Importantly, mouse GTSE-1 induced similar effects on p53 cellular distribution (Fig. 4B), strengthening the relevance of these proteins on p53 function. To quantify their ability to induce cytoplasmic localization of p53, three independent experiments were performed considering at least 200 cells coexpressing GFP-p53 and hGTSE-1 or GTSE-1 per assay. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 expression significantly correlate with cells displaying increased cytoplasmic p53, thus suggesting that GTSE-1 proteins are able to promote cytoplasmic localization of p53. This result was confirmed by nucleo-cytoplasmic cell fractionation followed by Western blot (see Fig. 5C, hGTSE-1 WT). When hGTSE-1 and GFP-p53 were transfected in mouse cells, p53 relocalized to the cytoplasm as efficiently as observed in human cells, indicating that the observed effect is not cell- or species-specific (data not shown).Fig. 5Requirement of hGTSE-1 NES to relocalize and down-regulate p53.

To address this point we transfected hGTSE-1 or its NES mutant together with GFP-p53 in MEF p53-/- similarly as performed on Fig. 4. As indicated in representative images shown in Fig. 5A, hGTSE-1 NES- displayed an impaired ability in enhancing cytoplasmic relocalization of p53.

These cres form stem-loop structures sharing a common loop motif, and the HRV-14 cre can substitute functionally for the poliovirus cre in both uridylylation in vitro and RNA replication in vivo. We show, however, that the poliovirus cre is unable to support HRV-14 RNA replication. This lack of complementation maps to the stem of the poliovirus cre and was reversed by single nucleotide substitutions in the stem as well as the base of the loop.

The picornaviruses comprise a large and relatively diverse family of viruses that includes many animal and human pathogens (1Racaniello V.R. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Picornaviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, New York2001: 685-722Google Scholar). These are small, nonenveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that are currently classified into nine genera, two of which, the enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, are particularly closely related in terms of their genome organization, nucleotide and protein sequences, protein processing pattern, and protein function (2Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.L. Carstens E.B. Estes M.K. Lemon S.M. Maniloff J. Mayo M.A. McGeogh D.J. Pringle R.B. Wickner R.B. Virus Taxonomy: The Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 657-683Google Scholar). Their single-strand RNA genomes contain only one open reading frame, encoding a large polyprotein that undergoes co- and post-translational cleavage into a series of structural proteins that comprise the viral capsid (VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1) and nonstructural proteins involved in replication of the viral genome (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, and 3Cpro and 3Dpol). Of these, 3Cpro is a cysteine protease that mediates most processing events within the polyprotein, whereas 3Dpol is the catalytic core of the viral replicase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Importantly, some precursor proteins, such as the uncleaved precursor of the viral protease and polymerase, 3CD, have functions in protein processing and replication that are distinct from those of the fully processed, mature proteins (3Harris K.S.

It appears to interact with a second cellular protein, poly(A)-binding protein, which binds to the poly(A) sequence at the 3′-end of the genome, forming a protein bridge leading to circularization of the genome and mediating the initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis (11Herold J.

However, because deletion of the 3′-NTR does not completely abolish viral RNA replication, the structured 3′-NTR segment of the genome is not absolutely essential for viral replication (19Todd S.

Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although this RNA signal is located within the polyprotein (VP1) coding sequence, its role in RNA replication is independent of its protein coding function (20McKnight K.L. Lemon S.M. J.

However, more recent studies using cell-free translation-replication systems suggest that the cre is not required for negative-strand RNA synthesis and implicate a primary role for the cre in positive-strand synthesis (30Morasco B.J.

Further work will be required to reconcile these differences.Picornaviral RNA synthesis is primer-dependent, with the primer for both negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis likely to be a uridylylated form of a small viral protein, VPg (3B), which is normally found covalently linked to the 5′-terminal nucleotide of the genomic RNA (32Lee Y.F.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Studies by Paul and colleagues (34Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 35Paul A.V. Rieder E. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) suggest that the PV cre acts as a template for the uridylylation of VPg to VPg-pUpU by the 3Dpol polymerase, thereby providing the primer for viral RNA synthesis. The capacity of HRV-14 cre mutants to support RNA replication in vivo correlates strongly with their ability to function as template for VPg uridylylation in vitro (22Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of the cre in VPg uridylylation is likely to be central to its function in viral RNA replication. The addition of 3Cpro or its precursor 3CD to such in vitro reactions significantly enhances the uridylylation of VPg (28Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Paul A.V. Rieder E. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31551-31562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that the 3CD precursor may also interact functionally with the cre RNA.Interestingly, despite considerable differences in nucleotide sequence and predicted secondary structure, the HRV-14 cre can functionally replace the PV cre in cell-free uridylylation reactions mediated by the PV 3Dpol and 3CD proteins (25Gerber K. Wimmer E. Paul A.V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10979-10990Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Paul A.V. Rieder E. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the existence of a common motif within the apical loop segment of the rhinovirus and enterovirus cres and its proposed role in VPg uridylyation (22Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we describe experiments that investigate further the functional exchangeability of these two cres. Surprisingly, when we replaced the HRV-14 cre with the PV cre, it failed to support the replication of either a subgenomic HRV-14 replicon or a recombinant dicistronic virus. We mapped this lack of complementation to the stem of the PV cre and present evidence indicating that the structure of the stem plays a critical role in cre function. We also describe point mutations within the HRV-14 3Cpro protease and 3Dpol polymerase proteins which partially rescue the ability of the PV cre to support HRV-14 RNA replication. These results suggest that the cre RNA interacts directly with the 3Cpro protease and 3Dpol polymerase, or the 3CD precursor protein, and indicate that this interaction is vital for viral RNA replication.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids—The plasmids pΔP1Luc-PVcre, ΔP1Luc-PVstm and ΔP1Luc-PVlp were constructed by ligating oligonucleotides representing the PV cre or HRV-14/PV chimeric cre sequences into pΔP1Luc-Δcre (21McKnight K.L. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) after it had been digested with XhoI and NheI restriction endonucleases (Fig. 1). Recombinant dicistronic HRV-14 viral genomes were generated by modification of WREP23, a dicistronic HRV-14 genome in which the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site sequence (IRES) is inserted at the P1-P2 junction (21McKnight K.L. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The native cre sequence located within the VP1 coding region was mutated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the following oligonucleotides: (+), GCACTCACTGAAGGTTTGGGAGACGAGTTGGAGGAGGTTATTGTCGAAAAGACTAAGCAAACCGTTGCGTCCATATCCTCAGGTCCAAAACACACAC; and (-), GTGTGTGTTTTGGACCTGAGGATATGGACGCAACGGTTTGCTTAGTCTTTTCGACAATAACCTCCTCCAACTCGTCTCCCAAACCTTCAGTGAGTGC. XhoI and NheI restriction enzyme sites were engineered immediately downstream of the stop codon following the first cistron in the dicistronic construct using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange). The HRV-14 cre, PV cre, and HRV-14/PV chimeric cre sequences were inserted between these sites, resulting in pWR-HRV14cre, pWR-PVcre, and pWR-PVstm, respectively (Fig. 1). All regions subjected to PCR mutagenesis were sequenced to ensure that no additional mutations were introduced.Cells—HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained as described previously (22Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Computer-based Prediction of RNA Secondary Structure—RNA secondary structure was predicted using the MFOLD program with the Zuker energy minimization algorithm (www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold).In Vitro RNA Transcription—To produce replicon or dicistronic viral RNA transcripts, plasmids were linearized at the unique MluI restriction site downstream of the 3′-viral poly(A) sequence. RNA transcripts were synthesized by T7 polymerase-mediated transcription (T7 ME-GAscript, Ambion). The integrity and yield of the transcribed RNAs were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis.Rescue and Analysis of Revertant Viruses—HeLa cells were transfected with 5 μg of dicistronic RNA transcript using a GenePulser II electroporation apparatus (Bio-Rad) as described previously (20McKnight K.L. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1941-1952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viruses were recovered from transfected cells by picking well separated plaques followed by disruption of cells by repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Plaque harvests were passaged in HeLa cell cultures in 35-mm dishes. Viruses (cells and supernatant) were harvested before the cytopathic effect was complete and used as stocks for analysis of genotype and phenotype. For genotyping, viral RNA was isolated from cell lysates using TriZol® reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with the ThermoScript™ reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen), and cDNA was amplified with Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) utilizing HRV-14-specific oligonucleotide primers. Purified amplimers were sequenced directly on an ABI 373L sequencer.Replicon RNA Amplification Assays—HeLa cells were transfected with replicon RNA transcripts as described previously (36Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K. Roberts A.W. Sharma S.D. Yoder J.D. Arnold J.J. Gohara D.W. Barton D.J. Paul A.V. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31551-31562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), seeded into 6-well plates, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 34 °C. Cell lysates were harvested by the addition of 125 ml of passive lysis buffer (Promega) to each well and stored at -70 °C until assayed for enzymatic activity. Luciferase activity was quantified using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) as described by the supplier, with results determined using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs).Molecular Display and Modeling—Protein structures were displayed and modeled using Swiss-PDB Viewer (37Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9472) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe PV cre Does Not Support Replication of an HRV-14 Subgenomic Replicon—Although apparently sharing similar functions in replication, the cres identified in rhinoviruses and enteroviruses differ in their genomic location, primary sequence, and predicted secondary structure. Nonetheless, a detailed mutational analysis, coupled with the comparison of known and suspected cre sequences, has suggested the existence of a conserved sequence motif within the apical loop segment of the rhinovirus and enterovirus cres: RNNNAARNNNNNNR (22Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The conserved purines within this motif cannot be changed without loss of replication competence in the context of a subgenomic HRV-14 replicon (Fig. 1A), and each is present within the cre elements of HRV-14 and PV (Fig. 1B). Single nucleotide substitutions at the intervening positions have little or no effect on replication of HRV-14 RNA (22Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The shared cre loop motif may be sufficient for functional equivalence of these cres because the HRV-14 cre is able to substitute for the PV cre as a template for in vitro VPg uridylylation catalyzed by PV enzymes (35Paul A.V. Rieder E. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In further support of this hypothesis, insertion of the HRV-14 cre rescued the replication competence of both PV and a PV subgenomic replicon containing a lethal mutation within the native PV cre (28Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).To determine whether the converse is also true and whether the PV cre is able to substitute for the HRV-14 cre in rhinovirus RNA replication, we replaced the HRV-14 cre present in the subgenomic replicon, ΔP1Luc-HRV14cre (21McKnight K.L. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (previously designated ΔP1LucCRE), with the PV cre. ΔP1Luc-HRV14cre is a subgenomic replicon in which most of the HRV-14 P1 segment has been replaced by the firefly luciferase coding sequence, with the HRV-14 cre inserted between the luciferase and P2 coding regions (Fig. 1A) (21McKnight K.L. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The replication of this RNA can be monitored accurately by measuring luciferase activity after transfection of HeLa cells. An increase in luciferase activity between 3 and 24 h after transfection is indicative of viral RNA replication and is not observed in the presence of guanidine, a potent inhibitor of HRV-14 RNA replication (22Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).To test for replication competence, replicon transcripts containing the PV cre in lieu of the HRV 14 cre, designated ΔP1Luc-PVcre (Fig. 1, A and B), were transfected into HeLa cells. Control cells were transfected with the parental replicon, ΔP1Luc-HRVcre, or a cre-deficient replicon, ΔP1Luc-Δcre (previously designated ΔP1LucXN) (21McKnight K.L. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, transfection of the ΔP1Luc-PVcre transcripts gave rise to only minimal luciferase activity, with no significant increase between 3 and 24 h post-transfection (Fig. 2). Luciferase expression was not increased above that observed after transfection of ΔP1Luc-Δcre RNA (which contains no cre sequence) and thus represented only translation of the input RNA. In contrast, the amount of luciferase expressed by the replicon containing the wild-type HRV-14 cre, ΔP1Luc-HRV14cre, increased ∼100-fold between 3 and 24 h post-transfection (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the PV cre is incompatible with the HRV-14 genome and that either its sequence or structure does not allow an efficient interaction with other components of the HRV-14 RNA replication complex.Fig. 2Luciferase expression as a measure of HRV-14 replicon RNA replication in transfected HeLa cells. Bars represent the -fold increase in expressed luciferase activity between 3 and 24 h post-transfection in triplicate cultures of cells transfected with ΔP1Luc-HRV14cre, -Δcre, -PVcre, -PVlp, and -PVstm RNAs. ΔP1Luc-Δcre contains no cre sequence and was used as a negative control in all assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine which domain of the PV cre, the loop or the stem, might be responsible for this incompatibility, we constructed two additional replicons containing chimeric cres, one with the loop sequence of the PVcre fused to the HRV-14 stem (designated PVlp, Fig. 1B), and the other containing the HRV-14 loop fused to the PV stem (PVstm, Fig. 1B). HRV-14 replicons containing these chimeric cres were designated ΔP1Luc-PVlp and ΔP1Luc-PVstm, respectively. Transfection of ΔP1Luc-PVlp RNA into HeLa cells led to a significant increase in luciferase activity between 3 and 24 h after transfection (Fig. 2). This result demonstrates the replication competence of ΔP1Luc-PVlp RNA, although the expressed luciferase activity (and thus the efficiency of RNA replication) was significantly reduced compared with ΔP1Luc-HRV14cre. In contrast, transfection of ΔP1Luc-PVstm transcripts into HeLa cells resulted in no increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 2), indicating a lack of RNA replication competence. These results demonstrate that the PV cre loop is partially, but not completely, functionally exchangeable with the HRV-14 cre loop and that the stem of the PV cre is the major determinant of the incompatibility that exists between the PV and HRV-14 cre. Although these results support the validity of the RNNNAARNNNNNNR loop motif proposed previously (22Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), they also show that the sequence and/or structure of the cre stem is important determinant(s) for replication.Rescue of Revertant Dicistronic HRV-14 Viruses Containing Replication-defective cres—To characterize further the nature of the restriction underlying the lack of detectable replicon amplification when the HRV-14 cre was replaced by the PV cre, we placed the PV cre (and the chimeric PVstm and PVlp cres described above) within the sequence of a recombinant dicistronic HRV-14 virus (see below) in which the native HRV-14 cre was functionally knocked out by multiple silent nucleotide substitutions. We transfected these RNAs into HeLa cells and then sought evidence for replication-competent revertant viruses that might have accumulated mutations that reversed or compensated for the restriction posed by the PV cre. Our hypothesis was that the location and nature of these compensatory mutations would shed light on why the PV cre is unable to function efficiently within the HRV-14 background.Because the HRV-14 cre is located within the P1 coding region, simply replacing its sequence with the ∼60-nucleotide PV cre sequence would alter the HRV-14 capsid protein sequence and most likely prevent virion formation. To overcome this problem, we utilized a previously described dicistronic virus, WREP23 (21McKnight K.L. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which contains the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES inserted into the open reading frame of HRV-14 at the P1-P2 junction (Fig. 3A). The translation of the first cistron, encoding the HRV-14 capsid proteins, is thus under the control of the HRV-14 IRES, whereas translation of the second cistron, encoding the nonstructural proteins 2A-3D, is initiated by the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES. This allows for the placement of a foreign cre sequence near the center of the HRV-14 genome, between the HRV-14 P1 segment and encephalomyocarditis virus IRES sequence, in a context in which it will not alter the sequence of any expressed HRV-14 protein (Fig. 3A). To knock out the native P1 cre in WREP23, nucleotide substitutions were introduced at the third position of each of 23 amino acid codons encompassing the HRV-14 cre sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). These 23 substitutions, spanning 69 nucleotides, include an A to G substitution at one of the critical purine positions, 2368A→G in the HRV-14 cre loop motif (22Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but they do not alter the encoded amino acid sequence of VP1. An MFOLD-assisted RNA structure prediction showed complete disruption of the HRV-14 P1 cre structure in this mutant (data not shown).Fig. 3A, schematic of recombinant, dicistronic HRV-14 genomes. The native HRV-14 cre located within the VP1 coding sequence was knocked out by 23 silent nucleotide substitutions. Following a stop codon at the 3′-end of the first cistron, the HRV-14cre, PVcre, PVstm, and PVlp chimeric cres were inserted between two engineered enzyme sites, XhoI and NheI, resulting in the recombinant dicistronic viral genomes WR-HRV14cre, WR-PVcre, WR-PVstm, and WR-PVlp, respectively. WR-Δcre contained no cre sequence and was utilized as a negative control. B,5 μg of each RNA transcript was transfected into HeLa cells by electroporation. Transfected cells were diluted 100- and 1,000-fold and plated on HeLa cell monolayers. Plaques were visualized at 72 h by staining with crystal violet. The transfected recombinant dicistronic viral RNAs are indicated by the cre they c"
https://openalex.org/W2031649802,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced receptor activation has been demonstrated to entrain a wide variety of signaling modalities. Most signaling pathways are concerned with the control of serine, threonine, or tyrosine-protein kinases, however, in the current article we demonstrate that in both a model cell line and in gonadotropes, GnRH additionally mediates the activation of lipid-directed kinases. We have shown that there is a functional connection between protein-tyrosine kinase modulation and lipid kinase activation. In HEK293 cells stably expressing the Type I mammalian GnRH receptor, we employed a proteomic approach to identify novel protein binding partners for GnRH-activated c-Src. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry we identified a GnRH-induced association between c-Src and the lipid kinase, diacylglycerol kinase-zeta (DGK-zeta). Using reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation we show that there is a significant elevation of the association between catalytically active c-Src with DGK-zeta in both HEK293 cells and murine gonadotrope LbetaT2 cells. Employing lipid kinase assays we have shown that the catalytic activity of DGK-zeta is significantly heightened in both HEK293 and LbetaT2 cells by GnRH. In addition, we demonstrate that the activation of DGK-zeta exerts a functional role in the murine gonadotrope LbetaT2 cell line. Elevated expression of DGK-zeta resulted in a shortening of the time scale of ERK activation in these cells suggesting a potential role of endogenous DGK-zeta in controlling the induction of LHbeta transcription by ERK1/2."

Oncel D. Goding C.R. Yavuzer U. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, we generated mice with a functional deletion of the TB-RBP gene (20Chennathukuzhi V. Stein J.M. Abel T. Donlon S. Yang S. Miller J.P. Allman D.M. Simmons R.A. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6419-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The mice are growth retarded and show defects in behavior and fertility. Many of the germ cells in the testis cannot proceed beyond first meiotic metaphase suggesting a defect in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Using 14.5-day-old embryos from heterozygous crosses, we have developed lines of MEFs from TB-RBP null animals and from their littermates. As in TB-RBP-deficient mice, these cells lack both TB-RBP and TRAX, although TRAX mRNA levels are not reduced. We find that early passage null MEFs have slower rates of proliferation with a block in the G2 stage of the cell cycle. Reintroduction of TB-RBP increases the rate of cell proliferation and stabilizes the TRAX protein. Transgenic and transfection experiments indicate that TRAX protein is dependent upon TB-RBP for stabilization and both TB-RBP and TRAX are needed for normal cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of MEFs—TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were derived from TB-RBP null mice generated by gene trapping (20Chennathukuzhi V. Stein J.M. Abel T. Donlon S. Yang S. Miller J.P. Allman D.M. Simmons R.A. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6419-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MEFs were produced using established protocols (21Hooper M.C. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Ltd., Oxford, UK1987: 51-70Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos were removed from pregnant heterozygous mice at 14.5 days and rinsed separately in sterile PBS. Fetal membranes, placenta, head, and soft tissues were discarded, and the remaining tissues were rinsed in fresh PBS. Each embryo was minced and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. Debris was removed by passing the cell suspension through a 100-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Supernatants were plated in culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen, Rock-ville, MD). The cells were split before reaching confluency and genotyped by PCR and Western blotting. For long-term cultures, passage three MEFs were plated at 5 × 105 in 100-mm dishes and were split every 4–5 days.Plasmid Constructs—Wild type TB-RBP was subcloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) (17Chennathukuzhi V.M. Kurihara Y. Bray J.D. Hecht N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13256-13263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mouse TRAX cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR from mouse testis RNA using a pair of primers containing EcoRI and BamHI sites and subcloned into pDsRed2-N1 and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). To clone truncated forms of TB-RBP, pEGFP/TB-RBP was used as a template. PCR products were amplified with the 5′ primer, gcc gtc gac atg tct gtg agc gag, and 3′ primer, gcc gga tcc ctt cac atc gta ctt (for TB-RBP-204), or 3′ primer, gcc gga tcc att gat gaa agt aga (for TB-RBP-175), and cloned into pEGFP-C1 producing pEGFP/TB-RBP-204. The pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO constructs were cloned using the following primers: 5′ primer, cac cat ggt gag caa ggg cga g, and 3′-gcc cag tta tct aga tcc ggt gga (for EGFP); 5′ primer, cac cat gtc tgt gag cga g, and 3′-gcc gtc gac atg tct gtg agc gag or 3′-gcc gga tcc cta ctt cac atc gta ctt (for TB-RBP and TB-RBP-204); 5′-cac cat gaa cgg caa aga a and 3′-gcc gaa ttc tta aga aat gct ctc (for TRAX), respectively.Cell Culture and Transfections—The day before transfection, TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per multiwell six-culture plate. For some transfections, spontaneously immortalized null MEFs were used to verify the potential of TB-RBP to stabilize TRAX. LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) (2 μl) and plasmid (1 μg) were preincubated with 50 μl of Optimum I (Invitrogen) for 5 min and then gently vortexed and incubated at RT for 20 min. The total 100-μl mixture was added to each well of a 6-well plate, dropwise. Whole cell lysates were harvested for Western blotting. For cell lines that stably express GFP/TB-RBP, GFP/TRAX, or GFP, transfections were performed with plasmid (3 μg) and pTK-Hyg (1 μg) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) combined with 8 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000. Transfected TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were split 72 h before selection with hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). After 2 weeks, positive colonies were identified by fluorescence microscopy and picked using clone cylinders (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). To rescue slow growing early passage MEFs, passage 4–5 MEFs were plated onto 96-well plates at 1.5 × 103 per well. The next day, the MEFs were infected with a ViraPower™ Lentiviral Expression System with constructs containing TB-RBP and TB-RBP-204, respectively (Invitrogen).Western and Northern Blotting—Whole cell lysates from passage 4 MEFs were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and freshly added 1/10 volume of protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were quantitated with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Aliquots (20 μg) were mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer containing 0.35 m 2-mercaptoethanol, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The primary antibodies, mouse anti-α-tubulin and anti-β-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), affinity purified anti-TB-RBP (6Wu X.Q. Gu W. Meng X. Hecht N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5640-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and affinity purified anti-TRAX (20Chennathukuzhi V. Stein J.M. Abel T. Donlon S. Yang S. Miller J.P. Allman D.M. Simmons R.A. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6419-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were used. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, protein A, and the ECL Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) were used to visualize each protein.Total RNA from MEFs was purified, and aliquots (15 μg) were loaded in a 1.0% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel, and Northern blotting was performed using the NorthernMax kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). DNA probes encoding the open reading frames (0.6 kb for TB-RBP and 0.8 kb for TRAX) were PCR-amplified using the following primers: TB-RBP, 5′-gcc gtc gac atg tct atg ggc gag and 3′-gcc gaa ttc cta ttt ttc acc aca. TRAX, 5′-gcc ctc gag atg aac ggc aaa gaa and 3′-gcc gaa ttc tta aga aat gct ctc. The probes were labeled with Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Beads and purified through ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Biosciences). Ribosomal RNA, stained with ethidium bromide, served as a loading control.Ubiquitination Analyses—The day before transfection, TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were plated in 6-well plates and pEGFP/TRAX was delivered by LipofectAMINE 2000. Three hours after transfection, MG-132 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added. Forty-eight hours later, whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing freshly added protein inhibitor mixture. In the studies examining the recovery of endogenous TRAX, MG-132 was added 24 h before the cells were harvested. Immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (22Yang S. Sun Y. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4889-4893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, the TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer and incubated at 4 °C for at least 30 min. The lysates were passed through a 20-gauge needle multiple times to shear genomic DNA, and the samples were clarified by centrifugation. The supernatants were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 1 h. TRAX antibody (3 μg/ml) was added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C overnight with shaking. Protein A-agarose beads were added for an additional 2 h, and the extracts were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The agarose bead pellets were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween, 2× SDS loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 10 min. Following electrophoresis in a 10% SDS gel, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and primary (rabbit anti-TRAX) and secondary (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A) antibodies were added. The proteins were visualized with the ECL Detection System. To detect ubiquitinated TRAX, mouse anti-ubiquitin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) was used as the primary antibody.Immunofluorescence—TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were grown on two-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Campbell, CA). Fluorescence micrographs of live cells or cells fixed with 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde were taken 24 h after transfection and counter stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.Double Thymidine Synchronization of HeLa Cells and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—HeLa cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. When HeLa cells reached a sub-confluent density, 2 mm thymidine was added and the cells were grown for 19 h. The cells were then washed with pre-warmed PBS three times and grown 10 h in complete medium before adding 2 mm thymidine again. Seventeen hours later, the cells were washed three times, complete medium was added, and the cells were harvested. For the cell cycle analysis, the MEFs were trypsinized, resuspended in complete DMEM, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of -20 °C methanol and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were then centrifuged at 1500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, supernatants were aspirated, and 400–500 μl of propidium iodide staining solution (0.15 mm propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml RNase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)) was added. Samples were sorted using an EPICS XL (Beckman-Coulter, Inc., Miami, FL).Transgenic Expression of TRAX—A FLAG-tagged cDNA encoding the complete open reading frame of human TRAX (hTRAX) (∼0.9 kb) was inserted between 1.4 kb of the mouse PGK2 promoter and a SV40 poly(A) tail sequence (∼0.5 kb). The expression plasmid construct was amplified in Escherichia coli and purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual., 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1989Google Scholar). The purified hTRAX DNA construct was injected into pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs by the Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Facility at the University of Pennsylvania. Mouse pups were genotyped by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from their tails. Six founder lines containing the transgene (lines 1, 6, 20, 34, 36, and 37) were selected and analyzed further for expression of the TRAX transgene in testes. Homozygous male mice were generated by breeding hemizygous males and females of line 36. Males and females were selected from different litters of founder line 36. Among male progeny that harbor the transgene, potential homozygous males were identified by the production of all hemizygous offspring in the next generation when mated with wild type female mice. Total RNA and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared from the testes of transgenic animals and used for Northern and Western blotting as previously described (6Wu X.Q. Gu W. Meng X. Hecht N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5640-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mouse testes were fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and paraffin-mounted slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin were prepared by the Pathology Department of the Children's Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania.RNA Interference Treatment—siRNAs, designed to target mouse TB-RBP and TRAX mRNAs, were synthesized (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The criteria for designing and methodology to introduce the siRNAs into cells was as described previously (24Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8081) Google Scholar, 25Yang S. Tutton S. Pierce E. Yoon K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7807-7816Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each 96-well assay, the day before transfection 4–5 × 103 cells in 100 μl were plated in each well; LipofectAMINE 2000 (1 μl) and 2 μl of a 40 μm stock solution of siRNA were preincubated with 100 μl of Optimum I separately for 5 min, then mixed and vortexed gently and incubated at RT for an additional 20 min. The mixture was then evenly added to 96-well plates (30 μl per well in triplicate). Forty-eight hours later, cell proliferation was analyzed using the One Solution Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). The siRNAs used in this report are as follows: TB-RBP1, aattcttgccagtgaactgtc; TRAX1, aatcatttcagcaggagctgg; TRAX2, aaggatgccagtttgtcttcg; and GFP, aagctgaccctgaagttcatc.RESULTSTB-RBP-deficient MEFs Show a Reduced Growth Rate—TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were derived from 14.5-day embryos produced by mating mice heterozygous for the TB-RBP gene. Within 4 days of culture, MEFs from TB-RBP null embryos exhibited a reduced growth rate compared with their wild type and heterozygous littermates (Fig. 1A).The slower growth rate of TB-RBP-deficient MEFs resulted from the loss of TB-RBP as it could be reversed by the reintroduction of TB-RBP at 48 h post-transfection (left three columns, Fig. 1B) and 72 h post-transfection (right three columns, Fig. 1B) post-infection. This rescue required the full-length TB-RBP, because a truncated form of TB-RBP, TB-RBP-204, which lacks the C terminus and cannot form multimers (32Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), was unable to correct the cell proliferation deficiency of the null MEFs (Fig. 1B).TB-RBP-deficient MEFs Show a Coordinate Loss of TRAX— Among the TB-RBP-interacting proteins, Translin-associated protein X (TRAX) is its most closely related protein (16Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As seen in tissues isolated from TB-RBP null mice (20Chennathukuzhi V. Stein J.M. Abel T. Donlon S. Yang S. Miller J.P. Allman D.M. Simmons R.A. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6419-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), TB-RBP and TRAX protein levels were reduced to about 50% or to non-detectable levels in multiple cultures of MEFs from heterozygous or null littermates, respectively (Fig. 2A). Similar reductions in TB-RBP mRNA levels were seen in the MEFs from heterozygous and null littermates (Fig. 2B). However, no decreases in TRAX mRNA levels were seen in the same total RNA preparations from wild type, heterozygous or null MEFs, suggesting that the reduction of TRAX protein occurred post-transcriptionally (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Western and Northern blots of TRAX and TB-RBP from MEFs. A, TRAX is lost in TB-RBP-deficient MEFs. Passage 4 MEFs were harvested and suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and assayed by Western blotting. Wild type (+/+); heterozygous (+/-); null (-/-). The control actin and tubulin protein assays indicate equal protein loading. B, the endogenous mRNA level of TRAX is not altered in TB-RBP-deficient MEFs. Total RNA (15 μg) from multiple cultures of passage 4 MEFs. Wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), and homozygous (-/-) MEFs were analyzed by Northern blotting. The two most abundant TB-RBP mRNAs are denoted by arrows. Equal RNA loading was demonstrated by staining with ethidium bromide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TRAX Is Degraded in MEFs by the Ubiquitination Pathway—MG-132 is a cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor that reduces the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in mammalian cells (26Rock K.L.

Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). When TB-RBP null MEFs were cultured in the presence of MG-132, TRAX protein became detectable (Fig. 3). After forty-eight hours in culture, substantial levels of both transfected TRAX-GFP and endogenous TRAX were detected compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 3A). At MG-132 concentrations of 500 nm, massive cell loss was seen. In the control cells and cells incubated with MG-132, a putative breakdown product of TRAX was seen (see arrowhead in Fig. 3A). In addition to endogenous TRAX, null MEFs incubated with high concentrations of MG-132 contain slower migrating forms of TRAX (Fig. 3B). The two slower migrating forms of TRAX have estimated molecular masses of about 8 and 16 kDa greater than the 33-kDa molecular mass of TRAX. An additional high molecular weight aggregate of TRAX is also often seen in Western blots (left panel, Fig. 3C). The incremental increases of about 8 kDa and the aggregate of TRAX suggest that we could be detecting ubiquitinated forms of TRAX.Fig. 3TRAX is lost through a protein ubiquitination degradation pathway. A, exogenous and endogenous TRAX are stabilized by MG-132. Three hours after transfection with pEGFP/TRAX, MG-132 was added, and 48 h later, cell lysates were prepared and assayed by Western blotting with an affinity-purified antibody to TRAX. B, multiple forms of endogenous TRAX are stabilized following the inhibition of proteasome activity. MG-132 was added to cultures of TB-RBP-deficient MEFs, and 24 h later, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed as in A. C, TRAX is ubiquitinated. TB-RBP-deficient MEFs were incubated with MG-132 for 24 h before cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting with antibody to TRAX. The remainder of the cell lysate was pre-cleared with protein agarose beads, immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with TRAX antibody, and analyzed by Western blotting with a mouse monoclonal ubiquitin antibody. The arrowhead indicates partially degraded TRAX.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the slower migrating forms of TRAX are ubiquitinated, an aliquot of the extract analyzed in Fig. 3C was immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified TRAX antibody and immunoblotted with an ubiquitin antibody. Two ubiquitinated forms of TRAX and a polyubiquitinated high molecular form of TRAX bands were detected (right panel, Fig. 3C).Reintroduction of Full-length TB-RBP Stabilizes TRAX—Immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays have demonstrated protein-protein interactions between full-length TB-RBP and full-length TRAX but not between truncated forms of TB-RBP or TRAX (28Wu X.Q. Lefrancois S. Morales C.R. Hecht N.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11261-11270Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An intact leucine zipper in TB-RBP is essential for homo-oligomer and hetero-oligomer formation. To determine whether loss of TRAX protein was directly caused by the absence of TB-RBP protein in the MEFs from TB-RBP null mice, a construct encoding a fusion protein of the full-length TB-RBP sequence and GFP was transfected into TB-RBP-deficient MEFs (Fig. 4A). We reasoned that the expression of exogenous TB-RBP would stabilize endogenous TRAX in the TB-RBP-deficient cells. Concomitant with the appearance of TB-RBP 24 h after transfection, TRAX was detected and continued to increase 72 h after transfection (Fig. 4B). No stabilization was seen with an equally abundant GFP transfection control.Fig. 4TRAX returns in TB-RBP-deficient MEFs upon reintroduction of TB-RBP. A, schematic representation of TB-RBP protein. TB-RBP-175 and TB-RBP-204 represent truncated forms of TB-RBP with a total or partial deletion of the leucine zipper domain, respectively. B, TRAX was recovered following transient transfection of full-length TB-RBP. The mammalian expression vectors pEGFP and pEGFP/TB-RBP were transfected into cells with LipofectAMINE 2000, and whole cell lysates were harvested at the times indicated. The first lane and the last lane serve as negative and positive controls, respectively. C, truncated forms of TB-RBP fail to stabilize TRAX. GFP/TB-RBP-175 and GFP/TB-RBP-204 were transfected into TB-RBP-deficient MEFs as described. Antibody for GFP was utilized for the Western blotting. D, TRAX was detected in a stably expressing TB-RBP/GFP cell line from a spontaneously immortalized line of null MEFs. The last two lanes are cell clones expressing GFP or GFP/TB-RBP. E, the endogenous mRNA level of TRAX was not altered after overexpression of TB-RBP. Total RNA was assayed by Northern blotting from TB-RBP-deficient MEFs expressing GFP/TB-RBP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the reappearance of TRAX required interaction between TB-RBP and TRAX, additional transfections into TB-RBP null MEFs were performed with two forms of truncated TB-RBP fused to GFP (Fig. 4C). The two TB-RBP truncations lacked part of or all of the leucine zipper, a domain critical for DNA and RNA binding of TB-RBP as well as for TB-RBP-TRAX interactions (Fig. 4A) (2Kasai M. Matsuzaki T.

https://openalex.org/W2074386174,"ADAR1 is an RNA-specific adenosine deaminase that edits RNA sequences. We have demonstrated previously that different ADAR1 isoforms are induced during acute inflammation. Here we show that the mouse ADAR1 isoforms are differentially localized in cellular compartments and that their localization is controlled by several independent signals. Nuclear import of the full-length ADAR1 is predominantly regulated by a nuclear localization signal at the C terminus (NLS-c), which consists of a bipartite basic amino acid motif plus the last 39 residues of ADAR1. Deletion of the NLS-c causes the truncated ADAR1 protein to be retained in the cytoplasm. The addition of this sequence to pyruvate kinase causes the cytoplasmic protein to be localized within the nucleus. The localization of nuclear ADAR1 is determined by a dynamic balance between the nucleolar binding activity of the nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) in the middle of the protein and the exporting activity of the nuclear exporter signal (NES) near the N terminus. The NoLS consists of a typical monopartite cluster of basic residues followed by the third double-stranded RNA-binding domain. These signals act independently; however, NES function can be completely silenced by the NLS-c when a regulatory motif within the catalytic domain and the NoLS are deleted. Thus, the intracellular distribution of the various ADAR1 isoforms is determined by NLS-c, NES, NoLS, and a regulatory motif. ADAR1 is an RNA-specific adenosine deaminase that edits RNA sequences.

Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggesting that these enzymes are evolutionarily conserved. ADAR1 is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cells and tissues (6Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virology. 1998; 245: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that ADAR1 participates in the development of acute inflammation (14Yang J.H. Luo X.X. Nie Y.Z. Su Y.J.

Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), suggesting that ADAR1-mediated RNA editing is critical for normal proliferation and/or differentiation of erythrocytes during development. The sequences of ADAR1 from human, rat, and mouse are highly conserved; a Z-DNA-binding motif, three dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs), and a conserved deaminase domain have been identified. Full-length human ADAR1 protein is found in the cytoplasm; it is initially transported into the nucleus and then re-exported by a nuclear export signal (NES) near the N-terminal region (17Poulsen H. Nilsson J. Damgaard C.K. Egebjerg J. Kjems J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7862-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An atypical nuclear localization signal (NLS) with nuclear import activity occurs within dsRBDIII so that human ADAR1 displays the characteristics of a shuttling protein (18Eckmann C.R. Neunteufl A. Pfaffstetter L. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1911-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Strehblow A. Hallegger M. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3822-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A different NLS within the N-terminal 269 amino acids is reported to direct active import of human ADAR1 (17Poulsen H. Nilsson J. Damgaard C.K. Egebjerg J. Kjems J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7862-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, a human ADAR1 fragment lacking the NES has been shown to localize predominantly within the nucleus (19Strehblow A. Hallegger M. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3822-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A similar fragment of human ADAR1 was found exclusively in the nucleus, implicating another NLS at the C-terminal end of human ADAR1 (17Poulsen H. Nilsson J. Damgaard C.K. Egebjerg J. Kjems J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7862-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The existence of a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) further complicates the localization of ADAR1. The NoLS is capable of targeting ADAR1 to the nucleolus where rRNA interacts with imported ribosomal proteins to form preribosomal particles (20Melese T. Xue Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Nucleolar localization of ADARs may suggest that RNA editing occurs during transcription or RNA processing in the nucleolus. Alternatively, it may regulate protein synthesis (21Herbert A. Wagner S. Nickerson J.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1235-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Xenopus ADAR1 contains a distinctive NLS downstream from the Z-DNA-binding motif, which targets the enzyme to the nascent ribonucleoprotein matrix on lampbrush chromosomes, where it is specifically associated with active transcriptional sites (22Doyle M. Jantsch M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Eckmann C.R. Jantsch M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that RNA editing by Xenopus ADAR1 is coupled with transcriptional events or targets newly synthesized RNAs. Since human ADAR1 contains an NES that has not been identified in Xenopus ADAR1, this protein may function differently in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, it is likely that RNA editing by ADAR1 is dynamically regulated in different cellular compartments by these localization signals. Certain patterns of basic amino acid residues are necessary for proteins to be imported into the nucleus, although no precise consensus amino acid sequence has been identified (24Nigg E.A. Baeuerle P.A. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1991; 66: 15-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Many variable NLS sequences have been identified in viral and cellular proteins; these sequences are classified as monopartite or bipartite (25Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 26Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). The typical monopartite NLS is a cluster of basic residues starting with Pro and followed by 5 residues, of which at least 3 are either Lys or Arg. The bipartite pattern (e.g. KRXKKXXKX) begins with 2 basic residues (Lys or Arg) followed by a 10-residue spacer and finally a cluster in which at least 3 out of 5 residues are Lys or Arg (25Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Proteins containing these signals are transported into the nucleus by ATP-dependent translocation through the nuclear pore complexes (27Newmeyer D.D. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1988; 52: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 28Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1988; 52: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A number of NLS-binding proteins have been reported to function as cytoplasmic receptors that deliver karyophilic proteins to the transport machinery of nuclear pore complexes. No precise NoLS consensus amino acid sequence has been identified, although NoLS signals usually reside within an NLS sequence. An atypical NoLS in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 contains two stretches of basic amino acids (GRKKRRQRRRAHQN, basic residues are underlined) to target the Tat protein to the nucleolus (29Siomi H. Shida H. Maki M. Hatanaka M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1803-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that multiple short versions of ADAR1 are induced during acute inflammation (30Yang J.H. Nie Y. Zhao Q. Su Y. Pypaert M. Su H. Rabinovici R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45833-45842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Deletions often occur in these inducible isoforms within the regions that are important for nuclear export or import, suggesting that the intracellular localization of ADAR1 may be differentially regulated under various pathological conditions. Here we show that localization of the ADAR1 isoforms is regulated by several nuclear discrimination signals. Furthermore, nuclear import of the full-length ADAR1 is predominantly determined by an essential NLS within the last 56 residues of the C terminus. A regulatory motif may be required for nuclear export of the NES, and this motif can be completely silenced by the NLS. Finally, we show that a signal near the dsRBDIII mediates nucleolar recruitment of the short version of ADAR1. Western Blotting—Samples containing 60 μg of total protein derived from thymocytes of BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. ADAR1 immunoreactivity was detected using rabbit antiserum raised against the C terminus of recombinant mouse ADAR1 expressed in Escherichia coli (2765-3459, AF291050) or against the N terminus of a synthetic mouse ADAR1 peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Construction of ADAR1 Chimeras—Different mADAR1 fragments were generated by PCR using the pCRII-ADAR1Lb plasmid (AF291050) as a template. A BamHI sequence was added to each end of the amplified fragments. The 5′-primers included a start codon with a KoZak consensus sequence ((A/G)NNATGG) (31Louis B.G. Ganoza M.C. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1988; 13: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The stop codon in the 3′-primer was removed to create an in-frame fusion to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The primer sequences are shown in Table I. PCR products were then digested with BamHI and directly cloned into pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-N2 vectors (Clontech) at the N-terminal end of EGFP. For the ΔNLS and NoLS-I constructs, fragments were excised from the mADAR1 cDNA with the following restriction enzymes: HindIII or XbaI/HindIII, respectively. The resulting inserts were then ligated into the pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-N2 vector. Positive clones were identified by BamHI digestion, and the reading frames were confirmed by sequencing. ADAR1-EGFP DNAs with the correct sequences were transfected into mouse fibroblasts (3T3) or other cell lines, and the expression of protein chimeras was confirmed by the presence of green signals under fluorescence or confocal microscopy.Table IPrimers used for construction of ADAR1-EGFP chimerasName5′ primer3′ primerADAR1atcgggatccactatggctcaagggttcaggggacccgtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggΔNES-IgtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggaactcgagccaagcaggacgcagcagtgaaagccΔNES-IIaaactcgagctatggctcccaacaagatcagggtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggNESgaattctcgagaccatggggctttgctcacacttccgggagcgcggatccaaaggctccacaaaggaggtttcccNoLSaaactcgagctatggctcccaacaagatcaggtggatcccagacttgtcatccgctgaactggcNLS-IaaactcgagctatggctcccaacaagatcagggtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggNLS-cactcgagactatggagttgtctcgggtgtccaaggtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggNLS-IIIgaattctcgagaccatggcccgcagagatttactgcagctctcttatggtgaacgcggatccagtcacgggcagctttcttggcttcaccataagagagctgEN3229gaattcggatccgagttgtctcgggtgtccaagtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggEN2983gaattcggatccaccttttcagccaagggcatctgtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggEN2741gaattcggatccaccctgtctttgaaaatcccaagtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggEN2413gaattcggatccacatgggtgttgtcgtgagtttgtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggEN1975gaattcggatccatggctcccaacaagatcaggagtggatccagtcattgggtactggacagaggEO2414gaattcggatccccaacaagatcaggaggattggtgaattcggatcccctctggatctcttttcataaEO2263gaattcggatccccaacaagatcaggaggattggttggatccaacccaactgctctgccttctcgct Open table in a new tab Two chimeric pyruvate kinase constructs, Myc-PK-NLS and Myc-PK-NoLS-NLS, were generated to test the function of NLS and NoLS. The NLS fragment, which consists of the last 56 residues of ADAR1, was amplified by PCR to add EcoRI and XhoI sites at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. This fragment was then ligated into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of Myc-PK pcDNA3 (a kind gift from Dr. M. Matunis, The Johns Hopkins University) (32Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The NoLS fragment (including the P-cluster and dsRBDIII) was amplified to add an EcoRI site at both ends; this fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of Myc-PK-NLS pcDNA3. These constructs were then transfected into 3T3 cells, and localization of the chimeric proteins was evaluated by immunofluorescence with an anti-Myc antibody. Construction of Bifunctional Chimeras—The NES fragment (385-603, GenBank™ accession number AF291050), which contains the leucine-rich nuclear export consensus (cNES) consensus as well as the N-terminal bipartite signal (Bipartite N) and the Z-DNA-binding domain (Zα), was amplified by PCR using the pCRII-ADAR1Lb plasmid as a template. XhoI and BamHI sites were added to the primers to generate restriction enzyme sites at the 5′- or 3′-ends, respectively. The amplified fragment was then subcloned into the BamHI site of the pEGFP-N1 vector to generate the pEGFP-NES construct. Various NLS-c fragments, extending from 3229, 2983, 2741, 2414, or 1975 to the stop codon of mouse ADAR1, were amplified by PCR using the same template. The stop codon was replaced with TGG to generate chimeras in-frame with EGFP. A BamHI was added to each end of the amplified fragment, and the insert was then ligated into the unique BamHI site of the pEFGP-NES construct to generate pEGFP-NES-NLS bifunctional chimeras. Similarly, the NoLS fragments were amplified from 1983 to 2414 or 1983 to 2263 of mouse ADAR1 and inserted into the pEFGP-NES construct to generate pEGFP-NES-NoLS bifunctional chimeras. After transformation and purification, clones with inserts were selected by restriction enzyme digestion, and the reading frames were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse fibroblasts (3T3), mouse neuroblastoma cells (N18), human HeLa, or embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured to the logarithmic stage in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 2 × 105 cells were placed in each well of 24-well plates and cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. In a typical transfection, 2 μg of the pEGFP-ADAR1 chimeric construct was mixed with 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 0.5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM, according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, the cells were washed and recultured with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 12-24 h. Green fluorescence usually appeared 7-9 h after transfection; photographs were taken 12-24 h after transfection using a fluorescence or confocal microscope (Zeiss). Blocking CRM1-mediated Nuclear Export by Leptomycin B—To block nuclear export with leptomycin B (LMB, a kind gift of Minoru Yoshida, University of Tokyo), 3T3, N18, or 293 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were incubated for 5-6 h with 2 μg of pEGFP-ADAR1 DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), as described above. After washing, the transfected cells were cultured in appropriate medium in either the presence or the absence of LMB (1 ng/ml). Green fluorescence was examined 12-24 h after transfection. ADAR1 Variants Truncated at the N and C Termini Are Differentially Localized—We have shown that two major short forms of mouse ADAR1 truncated from the N-terminal (mADAR1 p100 and p80) are expressed in spleen and thymus during endotoxin-induced acute inflammation (30Yang J.H. Nie Y. Zhao Q. Su Y. Pypaert M. Su H. Rabinovici R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45833-45842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using an antibody directed against the N-terminal region of ADAR1, we also detected short isoforms truncated from the C-terminal (Fig. 1). The anti-C-terminal antibody detected full-length ADAR1 and isoforms truncated from the N terminus; the anti-N-terminal antibody detected full-length ADAR1 and two isoforms truncated from the C terminus. We reasoned that the isoforms derived from truncation of the N and C termini might be localized in different cellular compartments. mADAR1 chimeras containing fragments truncated from the N or C terminus of mADAR1 and fused to EGFP (Fig. 2, ΔNES and ΔNLS) were transiently expressed in various cell lines, and their localization was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Consistent with previous studies, full-length mADAR1 was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A) (18Eckmann C.R. Neunteufl A. Pfaffstetter L. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1911-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Yang J.H. Nie Y. Zhao Q. Su Y. Pypaert M. Su H. Rabinovici R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45833-45842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas the ADAR1 fragment from which the N-terminal region was deleted was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleolus (Fig. 2B, ΔNES) (17Poulsen H. Nilsson J. Damgaard C.K. Egebjerg J. Kjems J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7862-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Yang J.H. Nie Y. Zhao Q. Su Y. Pypaert M. Su H. Rabinovici R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar), at a concentration of 1 ng/ml blocked export and resulted in accumulation of full-length ADAR1 within the nucleus (Fig. 2A, +LMB). The fragment lacking the C-terminal region was found within the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C, ΔNLS); however, LMB did not cause ΔNLS to accumulate in the nucleus, even at concentrations up to 10 ng/ml (Fig. 2C, +LMB). The ADAR1 variant ΔNLS, in which the C terminus was truncated, was retained in the cytoplasm after translation without nuclear importation; deletion of the last 56 amino acid residues prevented mADAR1 from being transported into the nucleus. Nuclear Discrimination Signals Are Conserved in Mammalian ADAR1—Since NLS activity was also observed near the third dsRBD of human ADAR1 (18Eckmann C.R. Neunteufl A. Pfaffstetter L. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1911-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Strehblow A. Hallegger M. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3822-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we reasoned that multiple signals might exist within mADAR1 that function synergistically in regulating nuclear importation. Using Reinhardt's method (PSORT, bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/psort2), we identified three putative nuclear discrimination signals that are conserved in the human, rat, and mouse ADAR1 sequences (Fig. 3). Two of these are located in the N- and C-terminal regions, with the sequence KRDINRILYSLEKKGKL located at position 171 and the sequence RRDLLQLSYGEAKKAAR at position 1097, respectively. Both follow the bipartite pattern (25Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). The N-terminal bipartite signal (Bipartite N) is located within the Z-DNA-binding domain (Zα) and is adjacent to a cNES; this region was shown to mediate nuclear export of ADAR1 (17Poulsen H. Nilsson J. Damgaard C.K. Egebjerg J. Kjems J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7862-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Eckmann C.R. Neunteufl A. Pfaffstetter L. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1911-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Strehblow A. Hallegger M. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3822-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The C-terminal bipartite signal (Bipartite C) is found in the adenosine deaminase domain, within the last 56 residues of ADAR1. A similar region was shown to be important for nuclear translation (21Herbert A. Wagner S. Nickerson J.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1235-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which we show to be involved in nuclear import. The third signal (P-cluster) is a typical monopartite cluster of basic residues, with a conserved pattern starting with Pro, followed by Lys or Arg in 3 out of 5 residues (PNKIRRI) (37Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The P-cluster is adjacent to the third dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBDIII), which has been shown previously to be necessary for nuclear import of human ADAR1 (18Eckmann C.R. Neunteufl A. Pfaffstetter L. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1911-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Strehblow A. Hallegger M. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3822-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33Desterro J.M. Keegan L.P. Lafarga M. Berciano M.T. O'Connell M. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1805-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and which we show in this study is also important for nucleolar localization. These consensus sequences are not found in ADAR sequences from Xenopus, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, or fishes, indicating that the intracellular localization of ADAR1 may be uniquely regulated in mammals, as compared with other taxa. The Last 56 Residues Containing the Bipartite C Domain Predominantly Control Nuclear Importation of Mouse ADAR1—We examined the function of Bipartite C by constructing N-terminal deletions of mADAR1. In agreement with our previous findings, fragments without Bipartite N were consistently transported into the nucleus and bound to the nucleolus (Fig. 4A); fragments lacking Bipartite N and all dsRNA-binding domains were still found in the nucleus at large (Fig. 4B). This suggests that Bipartite C is functionally sufficient for nuclear accumulation of ADAR1. To identify the essential residues for nuclear localization, a fragment containing Bipartite C followed by 39 residues at the C-terminal end of ADAR1 was linked to EGFP. In the same cells, this chimera was found in the nucleus (Fig. 4C). However, the nucleolar localization was not observed when Bipartite C and its N-terminal sequences were completely removed (Fig. 4D). Thus, the sequence containing Bipartite C followed by 39 residues at the C-terminal end of ADAR1, termed NLS-c, is an independent and fully functional signal for nuclear localization. To ascertain whether the nuclear localization activity of NLS-c was mediated by nuclear import rather than nuclear retention, we fused the NLS-c fragment to pyruvate kinase (PK), a well characterized cytoplasmic protein (19Strehblow A. Hallegger M. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3822-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, PK-NLS-c-Myc was localized within the nucleus, whereas the PK-Myc control was detected in the cytoplasm. The NLS-c Interacts with NES—Since the final localization of ADAR1 may be dynamically balanced by nuclear exportation and importation, we constructed a series of bifunctional ADAR chimeras containing both the NLS-c and NES sequences. An NES fragment containing cNES and Bipartite N (385-603 bp) was linked to a C-terminal fragment containing the minimum NLS-c and followed by GFP. The NES fragment consistently formed a fully functional CRM1-mediated exporter that was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the nucleus and nucleolus when nuclear exportation was blocked by LMB (Fig. 6, NES). However, the chimeras containing both NES and NLS-c were found within the nucleus (Fig. 6, EN3229 and EN2983). The addition of LMB did not affect the nuclear localization of the EN3229 and EN2983 constructs. Thus, the NLS-c completely masked the function of CRM1-mediated nuclear exportation through an as yet unknown mechanism. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that nuclear exportation of the NES fragment was restored when the NLS-c was further extended to the catalytic domain (Fig. 6, EN2741 and EN2413). These data suggest that a regulatory motif within the catalytic domain (804-994) is involved in the interaction between the NES and the NLS-c. Since the fragment EN2741 lacking the leucine-zipper-like dimerization domain (19Strehblow A. Hallegger M. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3822-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was still predominantly exported to the cytoplasm or accumulated in the nucleus when LMB was added, the regulatory motif is more likely localized between the residues from 914 to 994. The P-cluster and dsRBDIII Provide a Fully Functional Nucleolar Localization Signal—The NLS-c was further extended to include the P-cluster and the dsRBDIII in NES-NLS-c constructs (Fig. 6, EN1975).

The role of Akt in cytokine production and helper T (Th) cell differentiation remains obscure. In this study, we found that enforced expression of the constitutively active form (E40K) of Akt rendered CD4+ T cells activated. Wild-type of Akt and E40K promoted Th1 cell differentiation in C57BL/6-derived and Th1-polarized BALB/c-derived CD4+ T cells, while both promoted Th2 cell differentiation in BALB/c-derived and Th2-polarized C57BL/6 CD4+ T cells. E40K also facilitated Th1 differentiation in CD4+ T cells from IL-4-deficient mice with the BALB/c background. E40K up-regulated expression of NF-AT and c-Myb, which may be related to the augmentation of cytokine production by E40K. These findings indicate that the mechanism by which Akt augments cytokine production via CD28 and ICOS is Th cell type-specific and reflects the intracellular status affected by the cytokine milieu. We conclude that Akt is a neutral amplifier of T cell activation and Th differentiation. Both CD28 and its relative, inducible costimulator (ICOS), have a binding motif for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in their cytoplasmic tail, and the binding of PI3K leads to activation of a serine/threonine kinase, Akt. The role of Akt in cytokine production and helper T (Th) cell differentiation remains obscure. In this study, we found that enforced expression of the constitutively active form (E40K) of Akt rendered CD4+ T cells activated. Wild-type of Akt and E40K promoted Th1 cell differentiation in C57BL/6-derived and Th1-polarized BALB/c-derived CD4+ T cells, while both promoted Th2 cell differentiation in BALB/c-derived and Th2-polarized C57BL/6 CD4+ T cells. E40K also facilitated Th1 differentiation in CD4+ T cells from IL-4-deficient mice with the BALB/c background. E40K up-regulated expression of NF-AT and c-Myb, which may be related to the augmentation of cytokine production by E40K. These findings indicate that the mechanism by which Akt augments cytokine production via CD28 and ICOS is Th cell type-specific and reflects the intracellular status affected by the cytokine milieu. We conclude that Akt is a neutral amplifier of T cell activation and Th differentiation.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The factors that influence Th cell differentiation include cytokine milieu, transcription factors, antigen dose, nature of antigen, cell cycle, dendritic cell type, genetic background, and costimulation (2Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). Among them, costimulatory molecules are thought to regulate Th differentiation by altering signal strength, providing Th-specific signals and/or biased expression of themselves on Th cells (2Lenschow D.J.

T cell costimulatory molecule CD28 plays a crucial role in the immune system in conjunction with T cell receptor signals, exerting positive effects on proliferation, cytokine production, and an anti-apoptotic effect in T cells, while suppressing anergy induction (2Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that greater CD28 signal can achieve Th2 differentiation (6Rodriguez-Palmero M. Hara T. Thumbs A. Hunig T. Eur. J.

An inducible costimulator, ICOS, also called H4 (8Buonfiglio D. Bragardo M. Redoglia V. Vaschetto R. Bottarel F. Bonissoni S. Bensi T. Mezzatesta C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Dianzani U. Eur. J.

Accumulating evidence indicates a predominant role of ICOS in Th2-type immune responses, as exemplified by its promoting effect on Th2 cell differentiation, concomitant cytokine secretion, airway hypersensitivity reaction, and Ig-class switching (14Dong C.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 5741-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, ICOS has recently been reported to be functionally involved in Th1-type immune responses as well and to regulate the severity of murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (18Rottman J.B. Smith T. Tonra J.R. Ganley K. Bloom T. Robert S. Pierce B. Gutierrez-Ramos J.-C. Ozkaynak E. Coyle A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Both CD28 and ICOS have a YXXM motif for recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in their cytoplasmic tail, whereas a YXNX motif for the Src homology 2 domain of Grb2 family members and a PXXP motif for the Src homology 3 domain of various molecules are present only in CD28. The YXNX motif seems to be responsible for IL-2 production (19Harada Y. Ohgai D. Watanabe R. Okano K. Koiwai O. Tanabe K. Toma H. Altman A. Abe R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of CD28 or ICOS with TCR/CD3 leads to activation of PI3K (4Coyle A.J. Lehar S. Lloyd C. Tian J. Delaney T. Manning S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3392-3402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PI3K in turn phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides resulting in production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which recruit pleckstrin homology domain-containing molecules including serine-threonine kinases, Akt/protein kinase B, and PDK-1 (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Akt, upon subsequent phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 by PDK-1, becomes activated and plays a critical role in cell survival and cell cycle regulation through a wide variety of downstream molecules (21Datta S.R.

The relevance of the PI3K/Akt pathway to cytokine production remains controversial. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated CD28 to promote IL-2 production independently of its association with PI3K (25Crooks M.E.C. Littman D.R. Carter R.H. Fearon D.T. Weiss A. Stein P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6820-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Truitt K.E. Shi J. Gibson S. Segal L.G. Mills G.B. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4702-4710PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PI3K inhibitors have been found to block cytokine production mediated by CD28 in primary cells (27Ward S.G. Wilson A. Turner L. Westwick J. Sansom D.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Shi J. Cinek T. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4688-4695PubMed Google Scholar). Kane et al. (29Kane L.P. Andres P.G. Howland K.C. Abbas A.K. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Akt can provide the costimulatory signal for activation of the IL-2 promoter, which is indistinguishable from the CD28 costimulatory signal. They further showed that enforced Akt expression in primary CD4+ T cells from CD28-deficient mice restored Th1, but not Th2, cytokine production upon restimulation. Previously, we showed Akt phosphorylation to be enhanced by engagement of CD28 and even more strongly by that of ICOS. Since several reports including ours have shown that the engagement of ICOS has a preferential effect on Th2 development, Akt may be involved in Th2 development as well under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the question of whether Akt is differentially required for CD28 and ICOS costimulation remains to be answered. In this report, to address the above questions, we have explored the role of Akt in T cell activation costimulated by CD28 and ICOS, and in Th cell differentiation, by examining the effect of enforced expression of Akt in primary CD4+ T cells under various Th-differentiating conditions. Animals—BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). IL-4 knock-out mice with a BALB/c background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) (30Noben-Trauth N. Kohler G. Burki K. Ledermann B. Trans. Res. 1996; 5: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All mice were bred and used in accordance with the guidelines of the Institute of Laboratory Animals, Tokyo Women's Medical University. Abs and Reagents—The C398.4A mAb specific for ICOS/H4 has been described previously (8Buonfiglio D. Bragardo M. Redoglia V. Vaschetto R. Bottarel F. Bonissoni S. Bensi T. Mezzatesta C.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 380-388PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Allison (University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA). mAbs to I-Ab/d (28-16-8S), CD3 (145-2C11), CD8 (83.12.5), and Thy1.2 (HO13) have been described previously (32Yagi J. Nakata M.

The following Abs were used: biotinylated anti-CD28 (37.51), PE-labeled anti-CD3 (145-2C11), PE-CD4 (RM4-4), biotin-labeled anti-CD69 (H1.2F3), fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-CD44 (IM7), biotin-anti-CD44 (IM7), biotin-anti-CD62L (MEL-14), and biotin-anti-CD11a (LFA-1 α chain, M17/4) mAbs (BD Biosciences); goat anti-hamster IgG (anti-HIg) (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH); PE-streptavidin, streptavidin-Cy-Chrome (BD Biosciences); rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (serine 473), and anti-phospho-ERK (Thr-202, Tyr-204) Abs (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (FL), anti-c-Maf (M-153), goat polyclonal anti-Actin (I-19) Abs, and mouse anti-GATA-3 (HG3–31) mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and mouse anti-Bcl-XL mAb (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal Ab to c-Rel (C) and murine mAbs to NF-ATc1 (7A6) and NF-ATc2 (4G6-G5) were obtained from Santa Cruz, and c-Myb mAb (clone 1-1) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Construction of Expression Vectors—Akt cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from total RNA of BALB/c mouse spleen cells by using specific primer pair 5′-GGCCACGGATACCATGAACG-3′ with a BamHI linker and 5′-GGCCTCAGGCTGTGCCACTG-3′ with an EcoRI linker. After double digestion with BamHI and EcoRI, the fragment was ligated into BamHI/EcoRI sites of the bicistronic retroviral vector pMX-IRES-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (a gift from Dr. Y. Kamogawa, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) (33Lee H.J. Takemoto N. Kurata H. Kamogawa Y. Miyatake S. O'Garra A. Arai N. J. Exp.

To create the constitutively active and kinase-inactive forms of Akt (34Blume-Jensen P. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutagenesis was conducted with the GeneEditor™ in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: 5′-ACAGGCCGCTACTATGCCATGATGATCCTCAAGAAGGAGGTCATC-3′ for the kinase-inactive form (K179M) and 5′-GGCACCTTTATTGGCTACAAGAAACGGCCTCAGGATGTGGATCAG-3′ for the active form (E40K) of Akt. GATA-3 cDNA (35Ko L.J. Yamamoto M. Leonard M.W. George K.M. Ting P. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2778-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. D.

Retrovirus-mediated Gene Transfer and in Vitro Th Cell Differentiation—Splenic CD4+ T cells and APCs were prepared as described previously (13Arimura Y. Kato H. Dianzani U. Okamoto T. Kamekura S. Buonfiglio D. Miyoshi-Akiyama T. Uchiyama Yagi J. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To obtain naive T cells, splenic CD4+ T cells were stained with anti-CD44 and anti-CD62L Abs and enriched by cell sorting with an Epics ALTRA flow cytometer (Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, FL). The purity of the CD44lowCD62Lhigh cells obtained was >99%. To overexpress the Akt constructs in mouse primary CD4+ T cells, retrovirusmediated gene transfer was conducted as described previously (37Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid expression vectors were transfected into packaging cells for retrovirus, Plat-E (a gift from Dr. T. Kitamura, University of Tokyo) (38Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar) by the calcium phosphate method. The culture supernatant containing recombinant retrovirus was collected at 1 or 2 days after transfection. To achieve infection, 2 × 106/ml CD4+ T cells (0.5 × 106/ml for naive CD4+ T cells) that had been preactivated with anti-CD3 mAb (2 μg/ml) plus syngenic APCs 1 day before were incubated with virus-containing supernatant from Plat-E supplemented with anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml), polybrene (10 μg/ml, Sigma), and human rIL-2 (50 units/ml, a gift from Shionogi Co., Osaka, Japan), and centrifuged for 1 h at 1900 rpm and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Then, an equal volume of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. The following day, the cells were reinfected as above. One day later, the infected cells were expanded/rested in the presence of rIL-2 (100 units/ml) for an additional 2 days. To polarize CD4+ T cells in vitro, 2.5 ng/ml of murine rIL-12 (Genzyme Techne, Framingham, MA) and 3 μg/ml of anti-IL-4 mAb (11B11, ATCC, Rockville, MD) were added to the culture for Th1 cells, and 2 ng/ml of murine rIL-4 (BD Biosciences) and 3 μg/ml of anti-IL-12 mAb (C17.8, Genzyme Techne) for Th2 cells, during the period of priming/infection. When required, EGFP+ (retrovirus-infected) cells were enriched by cell sorting. The purity of harvested EGFP+ cells exceeded 93%. Stimulation, Cytokine Assay, Intracellular Cytokine Staining, and Western Blot—1 × 105 CD4+ T cells were cultured for 24 h in a 96-well flat-bottomed culture plate serially coated with anti-CD3 (0.07 μg/ml) and anti-CD28, anti-ICOS, or control HIg (3 μg/ml), as described previously (13Arimura Y.

The IL-2 concentrations in culture supernatants were determined as proliferation of IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells in a bioassay. IL-4 and IFN-γ in culture supernatants were quantitated by sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate cultures, and the data were analyzed for variance by a one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer's test for multiple comparisons. Results were considered significant if p < 0.01. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed as described previously (39Chen L. Koyanagi M. Fukada K. Imanishi K. Yagi J. Kato H. Miyoshi-Akiyama T. Zhang R. Miwa K. Uchiyama T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3817-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For surface staining, CD4+ T cells collected after expansion/resting with rIL-2 for 2 days were stained with PE-labeled mAbs or combinations of biotinylated mAbs and PE-streptavidin and then analyzed with the Epics XL flow cytometer (Coulter Immunology). Transcription factors were analyzed by extracting of nuclear protein with a reagent NE-PER™ (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instruction and performing Western blot analysis as described previously (13Arimura Y.

Enforced Expression and Kinase Activity of Akt Constructs—To investigate the role of Akt in CD4+ T cells, we prepared expression constructs for three types of Akt using a bicistronic retrovirus vector and achieved retrovirus-mediated transduction of the Akt constructs into mouse primary CD4+ T cells. The constitutively active form (E40K) and the wild-type (WT) of Akt were highly phosphorylated in BALB/c CD4+ T cells before and after restimulation, although the phosphorylation level was slightly higher in the E40K-infected cells than in WT-infected cells (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the kinase-inactive form (K179M) of Akt did not show enhanced phosphorylation. These observations indicate the level of phosphorylation to be proportional to the kinase activity of the Akt construct itself. The protein expression levels of Akt and EGFP in WT and E40K were also much higher than those of K179M (Figs. 1 and 2). These differences in expression level do not appear to reflect the difference in virus titer produced but do reflect the kinase activy itself because they were observed even when the infectivity with K179M was higher than that with E40K (data not shown). In addition, as a consequence of the up-regulation of kinase activity, Bcl-XL expression, which is involved in anti-apoptosis through Akt (41Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S.F. Yeh W.-C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1721-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), was up-regulated in WT- and E40K-infected CD4+ T cells from both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK, was not affected by enforced expression of Akt (Fig. 1A). Consequently, the effects of Akt are limited and specific to particular downstream molecules of the Akt pathway examined.Fig. 2Cellular phenotypes of BALB/c CD4+ T cells introduced with Akt constructs. A, E40K and K179M were used for transfection. EGFP+ cells were enriched by cell sorting. The same number of cells from each cell type was incubated in the presence of 100 units/ml IL-2 and examined for cell aggregation by phase contrast microscopy (left) and for EGFP intensity by fluorescence microscopy (right). The dark scattered clumps in the phase contrast image represent cell aggregates. B, the cells infected with E40K (shaded histogram) or K179M (open histogram) were examined for surface molecules and cell size (FS) by flow cytometry. C, the E40K cells (shaded histogram), K179M cells (open histogram with bold line), and empty vector control cells (open histogram with thin line) were examined for CD69 expression in an activated state and rested state following 2 days in the presence of 100 units/ml IL-2. These figures are representative of at least four independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cellular Phenotypes Induced by the Constitutively Active Form of Akt—Following Akt infection, we gated EGFP+ cells to monitor infected cells and examined the phenotypes of cells with the active or the inactive form of Akt. In the cells transfected with E40K, but not K179M, increases in the number and size of cell aggregates were evident (Fig. 2A), suggesting upregulation/activation of integrins. E40K up-regulated several activation/adhesion molecules, CD69, LFA-1, and to a lesser extent, CD44, as well as increasing cell size (forward scatter (FS)) of both BALB/c and C57BL/6 CD4+ T cells, although these changes were more marked in BALB/c cells (Fig. 2, B and C, and data not shown). CD69 expression in E40K-transfected activated CD4+ T cells was consistently higher than in K179M- and empty vector-transfected cells, and a high level of CD69 expression was sustained in rested CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the expression levels of CD3 and CD4 did not differ between these transfectants. Consequently, these findings indicate that the Akt signal is involved in T cell activation and may account for the costimulation mediated by CD28 and ICOS. Akt Promotes Th1 Cell Differentiation of C57BL/6 CD4+ T Cells—In the next experiments, we explored the effects of Akt on cytokine production by CD4+ T cells prepared from C57BL/6 mice. CD4+ T cells infected with Akt constructs were enriched by cell sorting and assessed for cytokine production upon restimulation. In accordance with a previous report by another group (29Kane L.P. Andres P.G. Howland K.C. Abbas A.K. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), transfection with WT and E40K markedly enhanced IFN-γ production in response to anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 plus anti-ICOS, as compared with an empty control vector, whereas K179M had no effect (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, E40K significantly augmented IFN-γ production upon restimulation even with anti-CD3 Ab alone, corroborating that the effects of costimulation could be achieved by Akt alone in the absence of anti-CD28 (29Kane L.P.

However, the effect on IL-4 production was very small or negligible. There are two possible interpretations of the results. One is that Akt simply transactivated Th1 cytokine production, and the other is that Akt promoted Th1 differentiation resulting in elevated IFN-γ production upon restimulation. To test these possibilities, we conducted intracellular cytokine staining after anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulation. In WT- and E40K-infected CD4+ T cells, the percentage of IFN-γ-producing cells was elevated, and the ratio of IFN-γ+ to IL-4+ cells was much higher as compared with the control vector (Fig. 3, B and C, top). These changes were more marked in the EGFP+ (retrovirus-infected) cells than in the EGFP- cells (Fig. 3C, bottom). The EGFP- cells also appeared to be affected to a lesser extent by transfected Akt through the environmental cytokines produced in the same wells in a paracrine manner. In contrast, K179M-infected cells did not show any change in numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells. The difference in the percentage of IL-4-producing cells was essentially negligible in all transfectants. In addition, ICOS and CD28 surface expression levels were each consistent among transfectants (data not shown). Consequently, these results indicate that Akt activity facilitates Th1 cell differentiation of C57BL/6 CD4+ T cells. Akt Promotes Th2 Cell Differentiation of BALB/c CD4+ T Cells—We further examined whether the above findings obtained with Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice were applicable to Th2-prone BALB/c mice. Unexpectedly, infection of BALB/c CD4+ T cells with WT and E40K Akt constructs enhanced IL-4 production, as compared with the control, in response to anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (Fig. 4A). To a lesser extent, WT and E40K increased IL-4 production in response to anti-CD3 plus anti-ICOS. E40K resulted in costimulation of IL-4 production upon restimulation with anti-CD3 Ab alone. In contrast, IFN-γ production in WT and E40K cells was reduced by about half in response to both types of stimulation. IL-2 production was also reduced in WT to the same extent as IFN-γ. K179M had no effect on cytokine production. Intracellular cytokine staining yielded essentially the same results in which the percentages of IL-4-producing cells were increased and the ratios of IFN-γ+ to IL-4+ cells were much lower in EGFP+ WT- and E40K-transfected cells than in EGFP+ K179M-transfected cells, although variation was observed (Fig. 4, B and C). These changes in EGFP- cells were less marked than those in EGFP+ cells (Fig. 4C, bottom). In addition, ICOS expression of E40K was much higher than that of K179M, although CD28 expression was slightly decreased (Fig. 4D). Moreover, expressions of the Th2-specific transcription factors GATA-3 (42Zheng W. Flavell R.A.

The mRNA slips and is scanned by the peptidyl-tRNA for a suitable landing site, and standard decoding resumes at the next 3' codon. This work shows that landing sites with potentially strong base pairing between the peptidyl-tRNA anticodon and mRNA are preferred, but sites with little or no potential for Watson-Crick or wobble base pairing can also be utilized. These results have implications for re-pairing in ribosomal frameshifting. Shine-Dalgarno sequences in the mRNA can alter the distribution of landing sites observed. The bacteriophage T4 gene 60 nascent peptide, known to influence take-off in its native context, imposes stringent P-site pairing requirements, thereby limiting the number of suitable landing sites."
https://openalex.org/W1983702238,"In this study, we first cloned nlz2, a second zebrafish member of the nlz-related zinc-finger gene family. nlz2 was expressed together with nlz1 in a broad posterior domain during gastrula stages as well as at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and in the hindbrain caudal to rhombomere 4 during segmentation. nlz2 was also expressed in regions distinct from nlz1, notably in the forebrain, midbrain, and trunk. Misexpression of nlz2 in zebrafish embryos disrupted gene expression in the rostral hindbrain, similar to the effect of misexpressing nlz1. We next compared the nlz1 and nlz2 sequences to identify and characterize domains conserved within this family. We found a C-terminal domain required for nuclear localization and two conserved domains (the Sp motif and a putative C2H2 zinc finger) required for nlz1 function. We also demonstrate that Nlz1 self-associated via its C terminus, interacted with Nlz2, and bound to histone deacetylases. Last, we found two forms of Nlz1 generated from alternative translation initiation sites in vivo. These forms have distinct activities, apparently depending on the function of the N-terminal Sp motif.

These forms have distinct activities, apparently depending on the function of the N-terminal Sp motif. Our data demonstrate that nlz2 functions similarly to nlz1 and define conserved domains essential for nuclear localization, self-association, and corepressor binding in this novel family of zinc-finger genes. nlz (herein referred to as nlz1) was recently identified as a member of a novel subfamily of zinc-finger genes (1Andreazzoli M. Broccoli V. Dawid I.B. Mech. Dev. 2001; 104: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Sagerström C.G. Kao B.A. Lane M.E. Sive H. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that nlz1 functions to control segmental gene expression in the zebrafish hindbrain and likely represses transcription by recruiting the corepressor Groucho (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sequence similarities between members of this zinc-finger subfamily suggest that their functions are evolutionarily conserved and that the nlz-related genes nocA, elbow, and tlp-1 regulate embryonic development in Drosophila (4Cheah P.Y. Meng Y.B. Yang X. Kimbrell D. Ashburner M. Chia W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1487-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Dorfman R. Glazer L. Weihe U. Wernet M.F. Shilo B.Z. Development. 2002; 129: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (6Zhao X. Yang Y. Fitch D.H. Herman M.A. Development. 2002; 129: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous elbow and nocA mutants exhibit defects in tracheal development, particularly stalled and aberrant migration of the dorsal branch and lateral trunks of the trachea (5Dorfman R. Glazer L. Weihe U. Wernet M.F. Shilo B.Z. Development. 2002; 129: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, misexpression of elbow in the trachea results in the repression of genes expressed in the visceral branch and dorsal trunk, whereas the number of cells forming the dorsal branch increases (5Dorfman R. Glazer L. Weihe U. Wernet M.F. Shilo B.Z. Development. 2002; 129: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous nocA mutants also display brain abnormalities such as protrusion of the embryonic supraesophageal ganglion and a reduction of ocelli (4Cheah P.Y. Meng Y.B. Yang X. Kimbrell D. Ashburner M. Chia W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1487-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mutations in tlp-1 affect specification of asymmetric cell fates and cell fusion, resulting in abnormal tail morphogenesis in C. elegans (6Zhao X. Yang Y. Fitch D.H. Herman M.A. Development. 2002; 129: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This family also includes two hypothetical proteins each in mouse and human, which have not yet been functionally characterized (1Andreazzoli M. Broccoli V. Dawid I.B. Mech. Dev. 2001; 104: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Dorfman R. Glazer L. Weihe U. Wernet M.F. Shilo B.Z. Development. 2002; 129: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Nlz subfamily of zinc-finger proteins is related to the vertebrate Sp1-like family of transcription factors (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Zhao X. Yang Y. Fitch D.H. Herman M.A. Development. 2002; 129: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and members of both families are expressed in developing embryos. However, although nlz-related genes have restricted expression patterns, sp1-related genes are more ubiquitously expressed. Sp1-like proteins function both as transcriptional activators and repressors, depending on the context (7Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar); but to date, Nlz-related proteins have been implicated only in transcriptional repression (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Dorfman R. Glazer L. Weihe U. Wernet M.F. Shilo B.Z. Development. 2002; 129: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several domains are common to both families, including the Sp motif, the Btd (Buttonhead) box, and the C2H2 zinc-finger domain as well as serine/threonine- and glutamine-rich regions. Although some of these domains are essential for Sp1 function, their specific roles are not known, and it is not clear what role they may play in Nlz family proteins. We recently reported the presence of a second gene in this family (nlz2) in the zebrafish expressed sequence tag data base (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have now cloned nlz2 and found high homology between nlz1 and nlz2. In particular, the Sp motif, the Btd box, and the putative C2H2 zinc finger are all conserved. We found that nlz2 was expressed together with nlz1 in a broad dorsoposterior domain in the zebrafish gastrula. During segmentation, nlz1 and nlz2 were coexpressed at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, but the nlz2 expression pattern also diverged from that of nlz1. In particular, although nlz1 and nlz2 were both expressed in the caudal hindbrain, nlz2 expression never expanded rostrally to the rhombomere (r) 1The abbreviations used are: r, rhombomere; HDAC, histone deacetylase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; hpf, hours post-fertilization; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MHB, midbrain-hindbrain boundary; NLS, nuclear localization signal. 5 segment, whereas nlz1 expression encompassed most of the hindbrain up to the r2 segment. Additionally, nlz2 was expressed in the forebrain, where nlz1 expression was never observed. We found that misexpression of nlz2 in zebrafish embryos resulted in loss of r3 gene expression in the hindbrain, similar to the effect of nlz1 misexpression (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We next tested the function of domains conserved among members of the Nlz family. We found that nuclear localization of both Nlz2 and Nlz1 depended on an intact C terminus and that nuclear localization was required for optimal function. We found that Nlz1 bound Nlz2 and histone deacetylases (HDACs) and that Nlz1 self-associated, although self-association does not appear to be essential for function. Western blot analysis of endogenous Nlz1 revealed two forms, apparently generated by the use of alternative translation start sites. Further analyses determined that the two forms of Nlz1 have distinct activities in vivo and demonstrated that an N-terminal domain, shared with the Sp1 family of transcription factors, regulates Nlz1 function. Our results characterize a new member of the Nlz subfamily of zinc-finger proteins and define functionally important domains in this subfamily. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Cloning—RNA was extracted from 10-h stage embryos using the ToTally RNA isolation kit (Ambion Inc.). cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding region of nlz2 was amplified with primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGATCTATGATCACATCGCCCTC-3′ and 5′-TGCTCTAGACAATCACTGGTATCCAAGCG-3′ from cDNA using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplified nlz2 product was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc.), digested with XhoI and XbaI, and subcloned into the same sites of pCS2+MT. The nlz2 construct was then digested with HindIII and XbaI, and the coding region (including the Myc epitope tags) was subcloned into the same sites of pCS2+MT-hsp70-NLS. The hsp70-nlz1 construct was generated by excising the nlz1 coding region (including the Myc epitope tags) with HindIII and NotI and subcloned by utilizing the same sites in pCS2+MT-hsp70-NLS. Nlz1 deletions constructs were generated as described previously (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or by standard molecular biology cloning techniques into the pCS2+, pCS2+MT, or pCS2+MT-NLS vector. The N terminus of grg3 (nucleotides 1-795 of the open reading frame) was amplified with primers 5′-TAGAATTCAATGTATCCGCAGGGCCGGCAT-3′ and 5′-GAAGGCCTCTCGTTGGACACATCCACCAC-3′ from cDNA, digested with EcoRI and StuI, and subcloned into the same sites in pCS2+. In Situ Hybridization and Immunostaining—Whole- and flat-mount in situ hybridizations using digoxigenin- or fluorescein-labeled antisense RNA probes were performed as described (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Sagerström C.G. Grinblat Y. Sive H. Development. 1996; 122: 1873-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including a probe containing 1149 nucleotides of the nlz2 coding region (synthesized from expressed sequence tag fc59b07.y1, the sequence of which was cloned into the NotI and SalI sites of the pSPORT1 vector). Fluorescent immunostaining was performed as described (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Hatta K. Neuron. 1992; 9: 629-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Embryo Injections—The synthesis and injection of capped mRNA encoding nlz deletion constructs were performed as described (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Embryos were also injected with a DNA construct (hsp70-nlz2, hsp70-nlz1, or hsp70-green fluorescent protein (GFP), the coding region of which is under the control of a heat shock-inducible promoter) at the one- to two-cell stage, heat-shocked at 70% epiboly (∼7.5 h post-fertilization (hpf)) for 1 h at 37 °C, and fixed at the 10-somite stage (14 hpf). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assays and Western Analysis—GST-Nlz1 was constructed by excising the nlz1 coding region from pCS2+MT-nlz1 with EcoRI and NotI and subcloned into the pGEX-6P-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) by utilizing the same restriction sites. The GST-Nlz1 fusion protein was expressed in BL21 cells (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at room temperature by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacteria were lysed, and the GST-Nlz1 protein was purified using a GST purification module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nlz1 constructs were labeled in vitro with [35S]methionine using the TnT SP6 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). GST pull-down assays were performed as described (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Anti-Nlz1 antiserum was derived from rabbits immunized with purified Nlz1 protein (Research Genetics). Western blot analyses confirmed that prebleed serum did not give any signal and that the anti-Nlz1 antiserum specifically recognized the Nlz1 protein. For Western blot analysis, lysates of three gastrula stage embryos or protein synthesized in vitro from the TnT SP6 coupled reticulocyte lysate system were used per lane. Samples were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted, probed with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-Nlz antiserum and a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit Ig whole antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and detected using chemiluminescence. Nlz2 and Nlz1 Share Conserved Domains—We have previously reported that an nlz1-related sequence, nlz2, can be assembled from a series of expressed sequence tags (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because none of these expressed sequence tags contain the entire nlz2 open reading frame, we cloned nlz2 from mid-gastrula stage zebrafish cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sequence analysis demonstrated that Nlz2 exhibits 55.3% identity to Nlz1 and that these proteins are distantly related to Sp1 family proteins. Nlz1, Nlz2, and Sp1 family proteins also share several conserved domains (Fig. 1). These include the Sp motif (a short N-terminal region found in the vertebrate Sp1-like family of transcription factors) (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Zhao X. Yang Y. Fitch D.H. Herman M.A. Development. 2002; 129: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Btd box (an 8-11-amino acid motif that we initially identified as a potential zinc finger (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but which more closely resembles a domain from Drosophila Buttonhead (10Athanikar J.N. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)), a putative C2H2 zinc finger (11Klug A. Rhodes D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 12Berg J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6513-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Iuchi S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and serine/threonine-rich regions (14Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). nlz2 Is Coexpressed with nlz1 at the Gastrula Stages, but Expression Diverges by the Segmentation Stages—In situ hybridization analysis of zebrafish embryos revealed nlz2 mRNA early and throughout the blastomeres (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that it is maternally deposited. At early gastrula stages, nlz2 was coexpressed with nlz1 near the blastoderm margin with a gap in the dorsal midline (Fig. 2C) that was closed at mid-gastrula stages (Fig. 2D). At late gastrula stages, nlz2 was expressed in a broad posterior domain (Fig. 2E), similar to nlz1 (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At early segmentation stages (11 hpf), nlz2 was expressed in the forebrain and in the posterior hindbrain caudal to r4 (Fig. 2, F and K), and expression extended throughout the whole length of the trunk (data not shown). By the three-somite stage (12 hpf), nlz2 expression was initiated at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) (Fig. 2G). At this stage, expression of nlz2 in the forebrain also appeared to expand (Fig. 2, G and L). At the 10-somite stage (14 hpf), nlz2 expression was maintained in the forebrain, caudal hindbrain, and trunk, with expression at the MHB broadening anteriorly to encompass the midbrain (Fig. 2H). By the 14-somite stage (16 hpf), nlz2 expression in the midbrain was reduced, and expression in the forebrain extended to the optic primordium (Fig. 2I). At the 22-somite stage (20 hpf), nlz2 expression persisted in above-mentioned regions, including the optic stalk (Fig. 2J). In conclusion, we found that nlz2 was expressed similarly to nlz1 in the caudal hindbrain (although nlz2 never extended rostrally to r5) and at the MHB; however, it was also expressed in the forebrain, midbrain, and trunk. nlz2 Has Similar Activity to nlz1—We have reported that misexpression of nlz1 in zebrafish embryos disrupts gene expression in the rostral hindbrain (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine whether nlz2 has a similar function. Because injecting nlz2 mRNA did not give high level expression of the Nlz2 protein, likely due to the mRNA being unstable, we instead misexpressed nlz2 under the control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (hsp70). Embryos were injected at the one- to two-cell stage with hsp70-nlz2, hsp70-nlz1, or hsp70-GFP; heat-shocked at 70% epiboly (∼7.5 hpf) for 1 h at 37 °C; and fixed at the 10-somite stage (14 hpf). This led to efficient induction as shown by hsp70-GFP (Fig. 3A). We then assayed for defects in the rostral hindbrain by in situ analysis of krox20 expression (a marker for r3 and r5) (15Oxtoby E. Jowett T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). We found that misexpressing nlz1 under the control of the heat shock-inducible promoter repressed krox20 in r3, but not in r5 (Fig. 3C and Table I). This phenotype is identical to that observed upon injection of nlz1 mRNA (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the heat shock-inducible construct works as well as mRNA injections. We found that misexpressing nlz2 resulted in a similar phenotype (Fig. 3D and Table I) and conclude that nlz2 has the same ability as nlz1 to disrupt gene expression in the rostral hindbrain.Table IMisexpression of nlz2 disrupts r3 gene expressionConstructEmbryos affectedaPercent of embryos (with ectopic protein expression in the hindbrain) exhibiting loss of krox20 expression in r3.%hsp70-nlz252.6 (82/156)hsp70-nlz168.7 (68/99)hsp70-GFP0.0 (0/163)a Percent of embryos (with ectopic protein expression in the hindbrain) exhibiting loss of krox20 expression in r3. Open table in a new tab The alignment in Fig. 1 defines several domains conserved between Nlz1 and Nlz2, and we next set out to define the functional importance of these domains. We elected to perform much of our structure-function analysis in zebrafish embryos because they provide a physiologically relevant environment and because functional analysis can be done rapidly (within 14 h after mRNA injection). Nlz1 Function Requires the C2H2 Finger and Nuclear Translocation via a C-terminal Domain—Nlz1 is a nuclear protein (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but lacks a consensus nuclear localization signal (NLS); we therefore set out to define the domain essential for nuclear localization. To this end, we determined the subcellular distribution of a panel of Nlz1 deletion constructs (summarized in Fig. 4). Embryos were injected with 800 pg of mRNA encoding Myc epitope-tagged Nlz1 deletion constructs at the one- to two-cell stage, flat-mounted at the early gastrula stage (∼5 hpf), and examined for distribution of the Myc-tagged protein by fluorescent immunohistochemistry. We found that Nlz1Δ92C (data not shown) and Nlz1Δ173C (Fig. 5B), both of which contain C-terminal deletions, resided primarily in the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus, whereas N-terminal or internal deletions (e.g. Nlz1Δ60N, Nlz1Δ115N, Nlz1Δ116-234, Nlz1Δ238-384, and Nlz1Δ116-384) did not affect nuclear localization (summarized in Fig. 4) (data not shown). Specifically, the fact that Nlz1Δ92C is cytoplasmic, but Nlz1Δ23C is nuclear, indicates that amino acids 498-566 are important for nuclear localization of Nlz1. Because Nlz2 shows high homology to Nlz1, we reasoned that the Nlz2 C terminus might also govern nuclear localization. We found that Nlz2 is indeed a nuclear protein (Fig. 5C) and that nuclear localization is dependent on an intact C terminus because an Nlz2Δ180C construct (which lacks the C-terminal 180 amino acids) (data not shown) was primarily cytoplasmic (Fig. 5D). Several stretches of 4-7 amino acids are conserved between Nlz1 and Nlz2 in this region, but these domains do not correspond to motifs known to regulate nuclear localization (data not shown).Fig. 5Nlz1 and Nlz2 are nuclear proteins whose localization depends on their respective C termini. Embryos were injected with 800 pg of Myc-nlz1 (A), Myc-nlz1Δ173C (B), Myc-nlz2 (C), or Myc-nlz2Δ180C (D) mRNA; fixed at 5 hpf; immunostained with anti-c-Myc antibody; and flat-mounted. Embryos are shown in animal pole views (magnification ×40). A and C, Nlz1 and Nlz2 localize to the nucleus; B and D, Nlz1Δ173C and Nlz2Δ180C localize primarily to the cytoplasm. Injected RNAs are shown in the lower right-hand corners.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Nlz1 function is dependent on nuclear localization, we assayed the function of constructs that localized to the cytoplasm (summarized in Fig. 4). Embryos were injected at the one- to two-cell stage with 400 pg of mRNA encoding each construct, fixed at the 10-somite stage (14 hpf), and assayed for loss of krox20 expression in r3 (same phenotype as shown in Fig. 3, C and D). We found that Nlz1Δ92C had reduced activity (19.7% of injected embryos affected versus 64.9% for wild-type Nlz1) (Fig. 4). However, upon addition of an NLS to Nlz1Δ92C, the frequency of affected embryos became comparable to that obtained with full-length Nlz1 (79.4% versus 64.9%, respectively) (Fig. 4). This suggests that Nlz1 must reside in the nucleus to be fully active. We also found that Nlz1Δ173C was likewise inactive (6.4%) (Fig. 4) and localized primarily to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, Nlz1Δ173C remained inactive even upon addition of an NLS (<5%) (Fig. 4), suggesting that amino acids 417-497 are necessary for Nlz1 function. Accordingly, a construct lacking the C2H2 zinc finger (amino acids 461-492, Nlz1ΔZF) was less active than full-length Nlz1 (19.7% versus 64.9%, respectively) (Fig. 4), although it localized to the nucleus (Fig. 4) (data not shown). We conclude that the C terminus is required both for nuclear localization (via amino acids 498-566) and for function (via the C2H2 zinc finger). nlz1 Is Coexpressed with a groucho-related Gene and Associates with Class I Histone Deacetylases—We have demonstrated that Nlz1 associates with the Groucho corepressor in vitro (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We next used a probe for grg3 (the only zebrafish member of the groucho family isolated to date) (16Kobayashi M. Nishikawa K. Suzuki T. Yamamoto M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Wülbeck C. Campos-Ortega J.A. Dev. Genes Evol. 1997; 207: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to test whether groucho-related genes are coexpressed with nlz1 in vivo. We found that grg3 was expressed in the anterior region of the embryo, encompassing the forebrain and midbrain and extending into the rostral hindbrain (Fig. 6, A and B). This suggests that Grg3 might interact with Nlz1 in the rostral hindbrain and also raises the possibility that Nlz1 interacts with other corepressors farther caudally. We next tested whether Nlz1 binds HDACs, corepressors that function by removing acetyl groups from core histones to maintain a transcriptionally silenced chromatin state (18Chen G. Courey A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 19Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing GST pull-down assays, we found that Nlz1 associated with HDAC1 (data not shown) and HDAC2 (Fig. 6C), two class I HDACs. To determine the region of Nlz1 required for this interaction, we utilized our panel of Nlz1 deletion constructs and tested them for HDAC2 binding in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 6C). We found that Nlz1 constructs lacking the C-terminal 173 amino acids exhibited significantly weaker binding to HDAC2 (Fig. 6C, lane 2). We also found that deletions within the C-terminal 206 amino acids (Fig. 6C, lanes 4-7) or the internal region (amino acids 116-384) (data not shown) did not affect HDAC2 binding. Instead, deletions of the region between the Btd box and the C2H2 zinc finger (Fig. 6C, lanes 8 and 9) severely affected HDAC2 binding. We note that this region is also involved in Groucho binding (3Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); and because Groucho mediates repression by recruiting HDACs (18Chen G. Courey A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 19Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar), this might point to a synergistic role for Groucho and HDACs in regulating Nlz1 function. Nlz1 Self-associates and Binds to Nlz2—Because the Nlz-related protein Elbow was found to self-associate (5Dorfman R. Glazer L. Weihe U. Wernet M.F. Shilo B.Z. Development. 2002; 129: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used GST pull-down assays to test whether Nlz1 self-associates (Fig. 7A). We found that Nlz1 self-associated efficiently (Fig. 7A, lane 1). To define the domain required for association, we utilized our panel of Nlz1 deletion constructs and tested them in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 7A, lanes 2-10). We found that Nlz1 self-association was dependent on an intact C terminus. In particular, deletions within the N terminus had no effect on association (Fig. 7A, lanes 2 and 3), whereas deletions within the C terminus exhibited weaker binding (lanes 4-6, 9, and 10), except for Nlz1Δ23C (data not shown). Deletion of either the Btd box or the C2H2 zinc finger alone did not significantly decrease Nlz1 interaction (Fig. 7A, lanes 7 and 8). Taken together, these results suggest that several regions required for self-association are located within the C-terminal half of Nlz1. To determine whether self-association is important for Nlz1 function, we misexpressed Nlz1 deletion constructs exhibiting weaker association (Nlz1Δ238-384, Nlz1Δ385-460, Nlz1Δ408-460, Nlz1Δ92C, and Nlz1Δ173C) and assayed their ability to disrupt krox20 expression in r3 of the hindbrain (same phenotype as in Fig. 3, C and D; data summarized in Fig. 4). Some of these constructs were as active as full-length Nlz1 (e.g. Nlz1Δ238-384, 41.6%) (Fig. 4), suggesting that self-association is not essential for Nlz1 function. Although some deletion constructs displayed a pronounced reduction in activity (e.g. Nlz1Δ408-460, 25.7%; Nlz1Δ92C, 19.7%; Nlz1Δ173C, 6.4%; and Nlz1Δ385-460, <5%), this is likely explained by the deletion of other essential domains (such as the C2H2 zinc finger) in those constructs. Thus, we did not found a correlation between self-association and function, suggesting that self-association is not necessary for Nlz1 function under these conditions. We also examined whether Nlz1 interacts with Nlz2 utilizing GST pull-down assays and found that Nlz2 and Nlz1 did form complexes (Fig. 7B, lane 1). Because Elbow and NocA are thought to function as a complex in repressing transcription (5Dorfman R. Glazer L. Weihe U. Wernet M.F. Shilo B.Z. Development. 2002; 129: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an Nlz1-Nlz2 complex may function in the caudal hindbrain or at the MHB, where nlz1 and nlz2 are coexpressed. Two Forms of Nlz1 Are Present in Vivo—Western analysis using polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against full-length Nlz1 revealed two major bands in lysates from gastrula stage embryos (Fig. 8A, lane 1): a 72-kDa form close to the predicted size for Nlz1 and a lower molecular mass form (62 kDa). We found these two forms in embryo lysates from the 50% epiboly stage (5 hpf) to at least the 10-somite stage (14 hpf) (data not shown). We also found that in vitro translation of a plasmid containing the nlz1 cDNA yielded the same two forms, but with the smaller form predominating (Fig. 8A, lane 2). We conclude that two forms of Nlz1 are present in vivo and can be generated from the same cDNA. Alternative Translation Initiation Sites Generate the Two Forms of Nlz1—We reasoned that the two"

The signal peptide of preGP-C comprises 58 amino acids and contains two distinct hydrophobic domains. Here, we show that each hydrophobic domain alone can insert preGP-C into the ER membrane.

Signal peptides are essential for the translocation and membrane insertion of secretory and membrane resident proteins. They are cleaved by ER resident signal peptidase or remain uncleaved and serve as membrane anchors. Signal peptides display a tripartite structure as follows: (i) an N-terminal region of various lengths, usually comprising positively charged amino acids; (ii) a hydrophobic region with 7–15 amino acid residues; and (iii) a short polar C-terminal stretch with small uncharged residues in position –3 and –1, determining the signal peptide cleavage site (4von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which a signal sequence adopts a particular topology in the ER membrane still remains largely unknown. Usually, signal peptides have an Ncyt-Clum orientation to the ER membrane (5Mothes W. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3973-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but it is also possible that the N terminus of the signal peptide is translocated into the lumen of the ER (6von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Analysis of many transmembrane domains suggested that the residues flanking the hydrophobic region of the N-terminal signal anchor determine which topology is realized (6von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 7Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was proposed that the net charges of the segments flanking the transmembrane sequence dictate its orientation, leaving the more positive segment cytoplasmically oriented (9von Heijne G. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 22: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This “positive inside rule” is consistent with the topology of most proteins integrated into bacterial membranes, which is, in part, explainable by the negative inside electrical charge across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (10Cao W. Henry M.D. Borrow P. Yamada H. Elder J.H. Ravkov E.V. Nichol S.T. Compans R.W. Campbell K.P. Oldstone M.B. Science. 1998; 282: 2079-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). However, this rule has not been successful in determining the topology of eukaryotic secretory proteins (11Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Sato M.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Based on statistical analysis, Hartmann et al. (7Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) proposed the “charge difference hypothesis,” stating that the orientation of the signal anchor at the N terminus is defined by the net charge in the 15 amino acids on either side of the hydrophobic core of the sequence; this hypothesis remains controversial, however (14Andrews D.W. Young J.C. Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current view is that it is not only the net charges flanking the hydrophobic anchor that control the orientation in which a hydrophobic region is inserted into the ER membrane. Rather, the balance of sequence and flanking region properties such as hydrophobicity, charge or conformation of the hydrophobic region, and adjacent sequences dictate the orientation of the polypeptide at the translocon (13Goder V. Spiess M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E. Spiess M.

The Lassa virus is a member of the Arenaviridae, a family including the less pathogenic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as well as highly pathogenic members like the Junin virus. Lassa virus is endemic in West Africa, with ∼100,000–500,000 infections occurring annually of which around one-third result in illnesses ranging from flu-like symptoms to fulminant hemorrhagic fever with mortality rates of up to 30% (17McCormick J.B. King I.J. Webb P.A. Johnson K.M. O'Sullivan R. Smith E.S. Trippel S. Tong T.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1987; 155: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To date, no vaccine exists, and only an insufficient ribavirin therapy is available for treatment. Lassa virions consist of a nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid envelope in which viral glycoprotein spikes are embedded. The glycoprotein is synthesized as a 76-kDa precursor (preGP-C). The N-terminal portion of the Lassa virus preGP-C contains a signal peptide of highly extended length comprising 58 residues (18Eichler R. Lenz O. Strecker T. Garten W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that the signal peptide is essential for further proteolytic processing of the glycoprotein (19Eichler R. Lenz O. Strecker T. Eickmann M. Klenk H.D. Garten W. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After cotranslational cleavage of the signal peptide, GP-C is posttranslationally cleaved after non-basic residues into the distal N-terminal subunit GP-1 and the C-terminal membrane-anchored GP-2 by the subtilase SKI-1/S1P (20Lenz O. ter Meulen J. Feldmann H. Klenk H.D. Garten W. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11418-11421Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Lenz O. ter Meulen J. Klenk H.D. Seidah N.G. Garten W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12701-12705Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In this study, we demonstrate that the GP-C signal peptide contains two independent hydrophobic domains that can be used for ER translocation of preGP-C. However, topological studies show that only the N-terminal hydrophobic domain of the signal peptide of preGP-C is inserted in the ER membrane, whereas the extended C region is essential for the maturation cleavage of GP-C into GP-1 and GP-2.

Pulse-Chase Experiments and Immunoprecipitation—Plasmid-transfected Vero cells were starved 20 h post transfection for 1 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine before cells were labeled with 10 μCi [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine Premix (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min.

Non-soluble material was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min), and supernatants of the cell lysates were incubated overnight with protein A-Sepharose coupled to the desired antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography on BioMax films (Kodak) (18Eichler R. Lenz O. Strecker T. Garten W.

Selective Membrane Permeabilization and Immunocytochemistry— Vero cells were grown on coverslips and LipofectAMINE-transfected with appropriate plasmid constructs for protein expression. Twenty hours after transfection, cells were washed and either incubated for 5 min at 4 °C with intracellular buffer (20 mm HEPES buffer, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.3) containing digitonin (2 μg/ml) for selective permeabilization of plasma membrane or incubated for 5 min at room temperature with acetone/methanol (1:1) (v/v) for total permeabilization of membranes. Cells were subsequently washed and incubated for 1 h with 1:200 diluted primary rabbit antibodies followed by incubation for 45 min with 1:400 diluted anti-rabbit antibody from goat coupled to rhodamine (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Protein expression of cells was examined using an immunofluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Zeiss). Topology of the Signal Peptide—The hydrophobic plot program by Kyte and Doolittle (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16879) Google Scholar) predicts two hydrophobic transmembrane domains, designated h1 and h2, within the signal peptide ranging from positions 18 to 32 and 43 to 52, respectively (Fig. 1B). To determine which of the hydrophobic domains has an ER translocation capacity, both were deleted alternatively and together (Fig. 1C). Deletion of only one hydrophobic domain, mutant Δ18–32 or Δ43–52, still led to the N-glycosylated viral glycoprotein GP-C as confirmed by deglycosylation (Fig. 1C, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7), whereas deletion of both domains (mutant Δ18–32/Δ43–52) resulted in the non-glycosylated form of preGP-C (Fig. 1C, lane 5). The absence of N-glycans indicates that the mutated preGP-C, which lacks both hydrophobic domains, is not translocated into the ER lumen, whereas deletion of only one hydrophobic domain did not prevent translocation. According to this, mutant Δ18–32/Δ43–52 migrates slower than mutant Δ18–32 and wild type preGP-C, because signal peptide cleavage does not occur within this mutant (Fig. 1C, lanes 5, 6, and 8). Mutant Δ43–52 shows incomplete signal peptide cleavage (lane 7), most likely because a hydrophobic domain is missing in proximity to the signal peptide cleavage site for correct processing (27Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Int. J. Neural Syst. 1997; 8: 581-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the following three models are conceivable for showing how both hydrophobic domains could interact with the ER membrane (Fig. 2): (i) a double spanning transmembrane model in which the N and C termini of the signal peptide are within the ER lumen, and both hydrophobic domains (h1 and h2) serve as membrane anchors; (ii) a model with a long N-terminal cytoplasmic peptide segment that includes the N-terminal hydrophobic domain, h1, with the hydrophobic domain h2 as membrane anchor; and (iii) a model with a short N-terminal region in which the hydrophobic domain h1 serves as transmembrane anchor and the second hydrophobic domain is present within the ER lumen. Several different experimental approaches were performed to determine the topology of the signal peptide in the ER membrane. First, we applied an immunocytochemical method that was successfully used previously for determination of the topology of the hepatitis C envelope protein (28Cocquerel L. Op de Beeck A. Lambot M. Roussel J. Delgrange D. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2893-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We inserted an HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) as an antigenic epitope at different sites of the Lassa virus glycoprotein signal peptide (Fig. 3A). Cell cultures were transfected with the three different HA-tagged signal peptide constructs. All signal peptide mutants were detected after permeabilization of all cellular membranes by acetone-methanol treatment using immunofluorescence. In contrast, treatment of the cells with digitonin, which selectively permeabilizes plasma membranes but not ER membranes, resulted in fluorescence of only the N-terminally HA-tagged construct (Fig. 3A). This method allows us to distinguish between the HA epitopes of the Lassa preGP-C signal peptide, which are present on the cytosolic or the luminal side of the ER membrane. Mutant SP-HA-N indicates that the HA-epitope is oriented toward the cytoplasm, suggesting that only one hydrophobic domain is membrane-anchored in the native signal peptide. The other HA-tagged mutants, mutant SP-HA-M, carrying the HA-epitope between both hydrophobic domains, and mutant SP-HA-C, with the HA tag after the second hydrophobic region, indicate that their antigenic epitopes are not accessible for immunostaining in digitoninpermeabilized cells and, therefore, face the ER lumen. Using another antigenic epitope (FLAG tag) instead of the HA tag, we obtained the same results (data not shown). As controls for correct permeabilization, cells expressing the ER marker calnexin show, as expected, no fluorescence signal in digitonin-permeabilized cells, but a fluorescence signal is shown in acetone/methanol-treated cells using antiserum directed against the ER luminal part of calnexin. Secondly, N-glycosylation of a potential N-glycosylation site inserted into a predicted ER luminal amino acid sequence was investigated to substantiate the topology of the signal peptide. As N-glycosylation only occurs in a hydrophilic environment but not in the proximity of hydrophobic regions, attachment sites for N-glycosylation were inserted between the hydrophobic domains h1 and h2 (mutant SP-Glyc-M) flanked by an HA tag and a FLAG tag as spacers. Indeed, the signal peptide of mutant SP-Glyc-M shifted to a band near 14 kDa, which disappears after PNGase F treatment, indicating that the region between both hydrophobic domains is exposed to the ER lumen and can thus be glycosylated (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). To exclude the possibility that the insertion of the charged residues of the HA- or the FLAG-tagged epitope causes a switch in the topology, the charge of the wild type signal peptide was maintained by amino acid exchange in mutant SP-Glyc-M2. This mutant shows the same glycosylation pattern as mutant SP-Glyc-M, indicating that the topology of the signal peptide was not affected by the insertion of charges in this region (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 6). As negative controls, two mutants were generated with an N-glycosylation site inserted at the N terminus flanked by a FLAG tag (mutant SP-Glyc-N) or simply with an N-glycosylation site near the N terminus of the signal peptide (mutant SP-Glyc-N2), respectively (Fig. 3B). Both control mutants, SP-Glyc-N and SP-Glyc-N2, do not show any band shift in SDS-PAGE before or after PNGase F-treatment, confirming that the N-terminal N-glycosylation site is cytoplasmically orientated and, therefore, not accessible for the N-glycan attachment (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–9). The differences in electrophoretic mobility between all mutants (Fig. 3B, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9) are due to the differing lengths of their respective insertions. Interestingly, insertion of the charged epitopes did not alter the topology of any of the signal peptide mutants. Alternative attempts to control the topology of the signal peptide by exchanging the charges surrounding the first hydrophobic region did not result in a switch of the topology either (data not shown). The Lassa virus signal peptide forms dimers when expressed in eucaryotic cells. It contains three cysteine residues, which could play a role in dimer formation. Two are located at the C terminus of the signal peptide (residues Cys-53 and Cys-57), whereas one is located in between the h1 and h2 domain (residue Cys-41). To prove, by using a third method, that the signal peptide is inserted via the h1 domain leaving a long C-terminal part facing the ER lumen, we analyzed the role of cysteine 41 for dimerization. For this purpose, a signal peptide mutant was constructed in which the cysteine residues Cys-53 and Cys-57 were mutated to serine (SP C53S, C57S-FLAG-N). Fig. 3C shows that this mutant still forms covalently linked dimers under non-reducing conditions, indicating that the region between both hydrophobic regions is ER luminal and, thus, accessible for disulfide linkage. To avoid disulfide formation caused by artificial oxidation of free sulfhydryl groups by air, N-ethylmaleimide was added to the lysis buffer at a final concentration of 20 mm. Furthermore, a mutant with all cysteine residues changed to serine (SP C41S/C53S/C57S-FLAG-N) does not form covalently linked dimers, indicating that dimerization is strictly disulfide-dependent. Finally, a mutant with a cysteine residue introduced at the N terminus and all other cysteine residues changed to serine (SP G2C/C41S/C53S/C57S-FLAG-N) also shows no disulfide formation. Taking our topological data together, we show that the Lassa virus glycoprotein signal peptide possesses a novel topology for signal peptides, as depicted in Fig. 2C, consisting of an N-terminal cytoplasmic peptide segment (17 amino acid residues) followed by a transmembrane domain (h1) comprising the amino acids from 18 to 32 and an exceptionally extended C-terminal, ER luminal region comprising amino acids 33 to 58, including the second hydrophobic domain (h2). Role of the Topology for GP-C Cleavage—We have shown recently that the signal peptide of the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP-C is essential for the maturation cleavage of the glycoprotein as a trans-acting maturation factor (19Eichler R. Lenz O. Strecker T. Eickmann M. Klenk H.D. Garten W. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The signal peptide topology suggests that its C-terminal portion facing the ER lumen is responsible for the interaction with GP-C. Therefore, the N-terminal region of the signal peptide up to the transmembrane segment, which is cytoplasmically orientated, may well be dispensable for the cleavage of GP-C into GP-1 and GP-2. To prove this assumption, three preGP-C deletion mutants (mutant Δ2–17, truncated from the N terminus to the transmembrane domain; mutant Δ2–30; and mutant Δ2–41, truncated until position 41, leaving the second hydrophobic domain intact) were constructed and vectorially expressed in Vero cells (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis of wild type and expressed truncated preGP-C mutants shows that deletion of the N terminus of the signal peptide up to the transmembrane segment, h1, has no effect on GP-C maturation (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). Further truncations of up to 41 residues abolished cleavage of GP-C by SKI-1/S1P, whereas translocation was not affected (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). These results strengthen the topology model and further demonstrate that the interaction between the signal peptide and GP-C occurs within the ER lumen. The N-terminal cytoplasmic region of the signal peptide is dispensable for GP-C cleavage into GP-1 and GP-2. The data presented in this study show that the signal peptide of the Lassa virus glycoprotein possesses two independent hydrophobic domains, h1 and h2. Both have the potential to mediate membrane insertion and translocate GP-C into the ER lumen. However, only the N-terminal hydrophobic region (h1) is actually used as a membrane anchor and directs the glycoprotein into the exocytic pathway at the ER translocon. The data presented here provide evidence for the signal peptide topology model of Fig. 2C with a 17-amino acid-long N-terminal cytoplasmic peptide segment, the transmembrane domain h1, and an extended C-terminal region comprising the second hydrophobic region h2. This signal peptide topology is based on three independent analyses. (i) Only the N-terminal part of the recombinant signal peptide is immunocytochemically detectable on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. (ii) Only the C-terminal peptide segment (aa 33–58) is glycosylated if an N-glycosylation motif is inserted. (iii) The cysteine residue Cys-41 between both hydrophobic regions forms covalently linked dimers. The extended C-terminal segment of the signal peptide can be subdivided into three smaller regions: (i) the C-terminal hydrophobic domain h2; (ii) an h1-h2 connecting sequence (aa 33–42), which flanks h2 at its N terminus; and (iii) a short C-terminal peptide segment. The hydrophobic domain h2 may be either freely available in the ER lumen or attached to the inner leaflet of the ER membrane. Membrane association of h2 seems plausible because of its hydrophobic nature and because recent findings concerning the LCMV GP-C signal peptide, which is homologous to the Lassa GP-C signal peptide, suggest that the peptide is highly resistant to protease digestion, implying a very compact structure (29Froeschke M. Basler M. Groettrup M. Dobberstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41914-41920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic region h2 is probably necessary for correct signal peptidase processing, as cleavage occurs only 2–9 residues after a hydrophobic stretch (30Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although the hydrophobic domain h2 might be inserted into the inner leaflet of the ER membrane after signal peptide cleavage from the glycoprotein, the backward folding of the signal peptide via two hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains with the N- and C termini facing the cytoplasm is excluded by the fact that that the C terminus contains the signal peptide cleavage site and is thus located in the ER lumen. This is also in accordance with our results showing that a C-terminally HA-tagged signal peptide is immunocytochemically inaccessible in cells with non-permeabilized ER membranes. This proposed topology model appears plausible, because signal peptides are directed to the translocon in a signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent manner. The SRP binds directly to the hydrophobic region of the nascent chain emerging from the ribosome. Translation is then halted, the SRP docks to its receptor at the ER translocon, the hydrophobic region is inserted into the membrane, and the elongation of the nascent chain continues into the ER lumen. As the h1 region was shown to be sufficient for ER translocation of the glycoprotein in this study, it seems highly unlikely that the SRP would dissociate from the previously recognized h1 region to bind to the h2 region. To confirm that insertion of the charged epitopes does not cause a switch in the topology of the signal peptide that would lead to an artificial insertion, several controls were implemented. First of all, the HA epitope was replaced by other epitopes of variable charge, showing that the topology was not affected by simple charge alteration. Additionally, although the net charge in the respective regions was altered by the negatively charged HA epitope, the charge relation was still consistent with the wild type situation, leaving the N region more acidic than the C region for all mutants. Furthermore, in the case of mutants SP-HA-N and SP-FLAG-N, the insertion is 16 residues away from the h1 region and, as a result, not within a distance to influence membrane insertion (7Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Finally, these mutants are still functional in regard to the proteolytic processing of Lassa GP-C into GP-1 and GP-2, which would be impossible with an altered topology. The effect of charge alterations between both hydrophobic regions was examined with the glycosylation mutants SP-Glyc-M and SP-Glyc-M2. Neutralization of all charges inserted with the epitopes still leads to a glycosylated signal peptide, indicating that the introduced charges did not affect the topology of the signal peptide. The observation that the residue Cys-41 in the h1-h2 linker region is involved in disulfide formation is consistent with the previous results concerning the proposed topology model. However, the necessity of disulfide linkage of the signal peptide for glycoprotein maturation remains unclear. Table I shows that this cysteine residue is not conserved among the signal peptides of arenavirus glycoproteins in contrast to cysteine residue Cys-57, which is conserved. As a result, disulfide-dependent dimer formation of the signal peptide does not strictly have to be dependent on the cysteine residue Cys-41 but might also be accomplished with residue Cys-57. Studies to elucidate whether dimerization of the Lassa virus glycoprotein signal peptide is a prerequisite for further maturation of the glycoprotein are in progress. In conclusion, three independent analyses of the signal peptide topology show that the region between both hydrophobic regions is already ER luminal, which clearly points to the topology model of Fig. 2C, strictly excluding the other models.Table IComparison of amino acid sequences of glycoprotein signal peptides from different arenaviruses1030↓50↓↓LassaMGQIVTFFQEVPHVIEEVMNIVLIALSVLVILKGLYNFATCGLVGLVTFLLLCGRSCTTS60MopeiaMGQIVTFFQEVPHILEEVMNIVLMTLSILAILKGIYNVMTCGIIGLITFLFLCGRSCS-S59LCMVMGQIVTMFEALPHIIDEVINIVIIVLIIITSIKAVYNFATCGILALVSFLFLAGRSCG--58WhitewaterMGQLISFFGEIPSIIHEALNIALIAVSIISILKGVINIWGSGLLQFIVFLLLAGRSCSYK60SabiaMGQLFSFFEEVPNIIHEAINIALIAVSLIAALKGMINLWKSGLFQLIFFLTLAGRSCSFR60TacaribeMGQFISFMQEIPIFLQEALNIALVAVSLICIVKGLVNLYRCGLFQLMVFLVLAGRSCSEE60JuninMGQFISFMQEIPTFLQEALNIALVAVSLIAIIKGIVNLYKSGLFQFFVFLVLAGRSCTEE60PichindeMGQVVTLIQSIPEVLQEVFNVALIIVSTLCIIKGFVNLMRCGLFQLITFLILAGRSCDGM60n***..::: :*.:.*.:*:.:: : : :*.. *..*:. :. ** *.**** Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequence of the Lassa virus glycoprotein signal peptide is highly conserved among the glycoproteins of all known arenaviruses including that of LCMV (Table I). To date, the signal peptide of the LCMV glycoprotein has been considered to be classical signal peptide with an extended N-terminal region (31Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, because the signal peptides of the Lassa virus and LCMV glycoproteins are homologous and functionally interchangeable (19Eichler R. Lenz O. Strecker T. Eickmann M. Klenk H.D. Garten W. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the signal peptides of all arenaviral glycoproteins, including LCMV GP-C, display the same topology as we found for the Lassa virus glycoprotein exhibiting an extended C-region. The glycoprotein signal peptide topology of arenaviruses is unique among glycoproteins of other virus families. Extended signal peptides have also evolved among envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, e.g. foamy viruses, HIV-1, and the Sindbis virus, as well as among non-viral proteins such as prolactin (32Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The extended foamy virus glycoprotein signal peptide is proposed to comprise ∼148 amino acids. The N-terminal 66 residues form a hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain, 24 hydrophobic amino acids span the ER membrane, and ∼58 hydrophilic amino acids are located within the lumen of the ER containing potential N-glycosylation sites (33Lindemann D. Pietschmann T. Picard-Maureau M. Berg A. Heinkelein M. Thurow J. Knaus P. Zentgraf H. Rethwilm A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5762-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Lassa virus preGP-C signal peptide has two hydrophobic domains, albeit only h1 is membrane-inserted. This characteristic clearly distinguishes it from the foamy virus signal peptide, which is involved in virus particle formation. It is also different from the Sindbis virus signal peptide. Here, the 6K protein connecting E2 and E1 in the precursor protein virus can also be regarded as a signal peptide. It spans the ER membrane twice, and its C and N termini face the lumen of the ER (34Sanz M.A. Madan V. Carrasco L. Nieva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2051-2057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a novel type of signal peptide with an extended ER luminal region. The unique topology of the Lassa virus glycoprotein signal peptide clearly differs from that of known classical N-terminal signal peptides by enabling a second function. The extended ER luminal part of the signal peptide is necessary for proteolytic activation of the glycoprotein into GP-1 and GP-2. Because of its unusual topology, it cannot be excluded that the signal peptide might even engage in additional functions after proteolytic activation of the glycoprotein. Therefore, it will be interesting to determine further potential functional aspects in the life cycle of this unusual signal peptide. We thank J. ter Meulen for stimulating discussions."

Malignant gliomas are characterized by a highly aggressive course, active angiogenesis, and endothelial cell proliferation. The most potent angiogenic factor in gliomas is fibroblast growth factor-2. To facilitate sustained signaling, this growth factor is kept in close contact with its tyrosine kinase receptor via binding to the heparan sulfate (HS) 1The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; anMan, anhydromannose; Cp, Ceruloplasmin; DFMO, α-difluoromethylornithine; GlcNH3+, glucosamine with free amino group; Gpc-1, glypican-1; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; NO, nitric oxide; PG, proteoglycan; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SNO, S-nitroso group; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SNP, sodium nitroprusside. side chains of cell surface proteoglycan (PG) co-receptors. The HS side chains of these PGs consist of a glucosamine-uronic acid backbone, variably and regionally modified by N-acetylations, N-sulfations, and O-sulfations, providing numerous binding sites for polybasic molecules, especially growth factors (for recent reviews, see Refs.1Ornitz D.M.

The cell surface HSPG glypican-1 (Gpc-1) is specifically up-regulated in glioma vessels, leading to enhanced tumor growth (6Qiao D. Meyer K. Mundhenke C. Drew S.A. Friedl A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16045-16053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Gpc-1 is also expressed by cultured glia cells, such as terminally differentiating oligodendrocytes (7Bansal R. Kumar M. Kerren M. Pfeiffer S.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and rat C6 glioma cells (8Liang Y. Häring M. Roughley P.J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Gpc-1 belongs to a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked HSPGs with six known mammalian members to date, two in Drosophila and one each in Caenorhabditis elegans and the zebrafish (for recent reviews, see Refs. 9Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 10Filmus J. Selleck S.B. J. Clin.

Mutations in genes involved in glypican expression and post-translational modification cause developmental defects, such as dysmorphic syndromes in man (Gpc-3) and delayed entry into mitosis of neural progenitor cells in Drosophila (Dally). The core proteins of glypicans have a characteristic pattern of 14 conserved Cys residues in their central domain. It has been generally assumed that the Cys residues participate in disulfide bond formation. In our studies on a recycling Gpc-1 expressed by human bladder carcinoma cells (T24), we could show that many of the Cys residues can occur as thiols and become stably S-nitrosylated (SNO) by endogenously formed nitric oxide (NO) in a reaction that is dependent on Cu(II)-to-Cu(I) reduction (12Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). During intracellular trafficking of Gpc-1 via a caveolin-1-associated endosomal pathway, NO is released from SNO, resulting in nitroxyl anion-catalyzed deaminative cleavage of HS at sites where the glucosamine residues are N-unsubstituted ( GlcNH3+). In this reaction, glucosamine is converted to anhydromannose (anMan), which remains at the reducing end of the HS oligosaccharide fragment (13Cheng F. Mani K. van den Born J. Ding K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44431-44439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In cell-free experiments, using purified Gpc-1, NO release and subsequent HS degradation can be triggered by ascorbate (12Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as outlined in Scheme 1. With a steady supply of NO and reducing agent, extensive degradation of HS can thus take place. Less extensive NO-dependent degradation of HS is obtained by using Zn(II)-loaded Gpc-1 (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As Zn(II) ions are redox inert, NO is probably generated via transnitrosation of the Gpc-1 core protein at the expense of thiol-to-disulfide conversion (Scheme 2). During this reaction, Zn(II) ion is released, and Gpc-1 should only be transiently S-nitrosylated. Moreover, Zn(II) ions inhibit copper ion-supported autodegradation (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), probably because they compete for the same binding site(s) in Gpc-1. Most of the intracellular copper ions are bound to proteins (15Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Although the Gpc-1 core protein can directly bind both Cu(II) and Cu(I) (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), copper ion redox cycles could also take place on other juxtaposed cuproproteins. We have recently provided evidence that the GPI-linked, copper-binding cellular prion protein (PrPC), which colocalizes with Gpc-1 in T24 cells, can support an ascorbate-induced, NO-dependent HS degradation in Gpc-1 (14Mani K.

Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a well known copper-binding protein with ferroxidase activity, mainly expressed and secreted by hepatocytes. However, astrocytes express a GPI-linked, cell-bound splice variant that is the major Cp in the brain (16Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Rat C6 glioma cells also express GPI-linked Cp (17Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4305-4310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The GPI-linked form arises by alternative splicing of Cp pre-mRNA such that the C-terminal 5 amino acids of the secreted form are replaced with an alternative 30 amino acids comprising the GPI signal in the membrane-bound form (17Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4305-4310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The copper binding and ferroxidase properties of the secreted and the membrane-bound Cp should thus be the same. Accordingly, individuals with a hereditary deficiency of ceruloplasmin as well as Cp knock-out mice have severe iron deposition both in the liver and in the brain (18Gitlin J.D. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. Jeong S.Y. Zhu Q. Julien J.-P. David S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6578-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have examined whether the GPI-linked Cp and Gpc-1 colocalize in C6 glioma cells and investigated how copper-loaded Cp and free zinc ions participate in the NO-dependent autodegradation of HS in Gpc-1. The results show that the GPI-linked Cp and Gpc-1 colocalize in intracellular compartments and that Cu(II) ion-loaded Cp can support extensive HS degradation even in the presence of free zinc ion.

The zinc probe FluoZin-3 was obtained from Molecular Probes, iminodiacetic acid was from Fluka, and ceruloplasmin and glutathione were from Sigma.

The DFMO treatment was used to increase the content of GlcNH3+ units in HS and was carried out while cells grew to confluence, which usually took 1-2 days.

Cu(II)-loaded Cp was also exposed to 1 mm FeSO4 followed by dialysis. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—The vector pRNA-U6.1/Neo (Genscript Corporation) containing the sequence CTTACACCAAGGCGAACGA (corresponding to nucleotides 374-392 in rattus norvegicus GPI-anchored ceruloplasmin) followed by a hairpin sequence TTCAAGAGA, then the reversed complementary ceruloplasmin sequence with a stretch of six T for RNA polymerase III termination followed by GGAAA in the 3′-end, was synthesized by Genscript Corporation. A negative control vector comprising a scrambled sequence was also prepared. Transfection was accomplished by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the description of the manufacturer. Autocleavage of HS in Gpc-1—The high molecular weight Gpc-1 precursor (∼1 nm) was exposed to various combinations of metal ions, Cp, NO donor (sodium nitroprusside (SNP)), and triggered by ascorbate (1 mm for 10 min) to autodegrade its own HS chains, all in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The reactions were monitored by Superose 6 gel chromatography of the various NO-released HS fragments and the alkali-released stubs remaining on the core protein as described previously (12Ding K.

They were tagged with either fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red and appropriately combined for colocalization studies. GPI-linked Cp Colocalizes with Gpc-1, and Ascorbate Induces HS Cleavage at GlcNH3+ in Glioma Cells—As shown in Fig. 1, A-C, Gpc-1 and GPI-linked Cp colocalized in intracellular compartments of rat C6 glioma cells. SNO forms of Gpc-1, detected by mAb S1, and caveolin-1 did not colocalize (Fig. 1, D-F). However, the S1 signal was relatively weak compared with that from total Gpc-1 (cf. Fig. 1, G and H), resulting in a very faint colocalization signal in the merged panel (Fig. 1I). Thus, Gpc-1 appeared to be mainly in a non-nitrosylated state. Many of the Gpc-1 molecules were substituted with GlcNH3+-containing HS chains (mAb JM-403), as indicated by the colocalization experiment shown in Fig. 1, J-L. Treatment of cells with ascorbate should induce NO release from stable SNO groups in Gpc-1 and/or support zinc-dependent transnitrosation of Gpc-1 with subsequent cleavage of HS at GlcNH3+ in both cases (Schemes 1 and 2) (see also Refs. 12Ding K.

Fig. 1, J and M), whereas the signal from the JM-403 HS epitope was reduced (cf. Fig. 1, K and N), indicating HS degradation at the GlcNH3+ sites. However, the S1 epitope was not markedly affected (cf. Fig. 1, H and O), suggesting that NO and nitroxyl anion were not primarily derived from stable SNO groups in Gpc-1 but perhaps via Zn(II)-supported transnitrosation. Zn(II) Ion-supported Extensive, NO-dependent, Ascorbate-triggered Degradation of HS Depend on Expression of Cp—To investigate Zn(II)-supported HS degradation in glioma cells, we used a divalent metal ion chelator (iminodiacetate) supplemented with ZnCl2. In the control experiment, cells were preincubated with 1 mm iminodiacetate for 1 h to prevent S-nitrosylation/-denitrosylation and then treated with 1 mm ascorbate (Fig. 2, A and B). The signals for Gpc-1 (results not shown) and GlcNH3+-containing HS (JM-403) were largely unaffected (cf. Fig. 1K with Fig. 2A), suggesting minimal HS degradation. However, when cells that had been preincubated with 1 mm iminodiacetate and 1 mm ZnCl2 for 1 h were exposed to 1 mm ascorbate for 1 h, there was extensive degradation of HS as indicated by a significant reduction of the JM-403 signal (Fig. 2E). Simultaneously, there was an appearance of anMan-positive HS degradation products (cf. Fig. 2, B and F). We then tested the effect of Cp-specific RNA interference silencing on Zn(II)-supported, deaminative cleavage of HS. In mock-transfected (Fig. 2C) cells, Zn(II)-supported HS degradation was still going on and was similar to that in untreated cells (cf. Fig. 2, D and E). In cells transfected with a Cp-specific siRNA-producing vector, the expression of GPI-Cp was silenced (cf. Fig. 2, C and G), and Zn(II)-supported HS degradation was markedly reduced (cf. Fig. 2, D and H) and similar to that in cells not exposed to Zn(II) ion (Fig. 2A). Zn(II) Ion Release from Gpc-1 during Ascorbate-triggered Degradation of HS—In the course of the transnitrosation reaction assumed to be involved in zinc-supported, NO-dependent deaminative cleavage of HS, Zn(II) ions should be released from Gpc-1 when ascorbate triggers NO release, nitroxyl anion formation, and HS degradation (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We first tested the formation of SNO groups by using mAb S1, which is specific for this Gpc-1 form (13Cheng F. Mani K. van den Born J. Ding K. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44431-44439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells treated with NO donor and Zn(II) ions had increased content of SNO-Gpc-1 (cf. Figs. 1H and 3A). Addition of ascorbate eliminated the signal almost completely (Fig. 3B). To investigate Zn(II) ion release, we used a sensitive, specific, and fluorescent zinc probe. When the probe was used at a concentration of 2.5 μm in all of the experiments, free Zn(II) ions were barely detectable in unperturbed cells (Fig. 3C) and almost undetectable after exposure to NO donor alone, in keeping with an increased binding of Zn(II) ions to Gpc-1 (Fig. 3D). The level of free Zn(II) ion increased slightly after exposure to ascorbate alone (cf. Fig. 3, C and E) but increased significantly after exposure to both NO donor and ascorbate (cf. Fig. 3, D and F). The released free Zn(II) ions colocalized with Gpc-1 at paranuclear sites (results not shown) and, simultaneously, there was generation of anMan-containing HS oligosaccharides (Fig. 3G), which partially colocalized with Gpc-1 (Fig. 3H, yellow). Taken together, the preceding results suggested that there was extensive zinc-supported, NO- and Cp-dependent HS degradation in glioma cells. However, in previous cell-free experiments, zinc-supported HS degradation was relatively limited (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated how the presence of Cp affected zinc-supported, deaminative degradation of HS in cell-free experiments. The Mechanism of Cp-supported Autoclevage of HS in Zn(II)-Loaded Gpc-1—In these experiments, we used a purified Gpc-1 that was [3H]GlcN-labeled in the HS chains and isolated from polyamine-deprived and brefeldin A-treated C6 glioma cells. As shown previously (12Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Cheng F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this gives rise to a Gpc-1 glycoform with long and GlcNH3+-rich HS chains. The intact glioma-derived Gpc-1 PG was excluded from Superose 6 upon gel exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4A), and the HS chains released by alkaline borohydride treatment were partially included on the same gel (Fig. 4B). There was extensive depolymerization of the HS chains upon treatment with HNO2 at pH 3.9, resulting in a much retarded elution position on Superose 6. This indicates a high content of GlcNH3+ residues (Fig. 4C). When such intact Gpc-1 PG, loaded with Zn(II) ion, was exposed to NO donor alone, there was no sign of HS degradation (Fig. 4D). However, when ascorbate was included, there was a limited depolymerization of the HS chains (Fig. 4E), in keeping with previous results (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, there was a more extensive degradation of HS when Gpc-1 was first S-nitrosylated by pre-exposure to Cu(II) ion and NO donor and then treated with ascorbate (Fig. 4F). As shown previously (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), when the Gpc-1 PG contained bound Zn(II) ions, extensive, Cu(II) ion-supported HS degradation was prevented (Fig. 4G). In contrast, when Cu(II)-containing Cp and Zn(II)-loaded Gpc-1 were exposed to NO donor and ascorbate, the HS chains of Gpc-1 underwent extensive degradation (Fig. 4H). The extent of degradation was almost the same as that obtained with free Cu(II) ion (Fig. 4F). This extensive degradation was independent of Zn(II) ions (Fig. 4I) but dependent on the presence of ascorbate (Fig. 4J). When a mixture of Zn(II)-loaded Gpc-1 and Cu(II)-containing Cp that was pre-exposed to Fe(II) ion was treated with NO donor, with or without ascorbate, the HS chains were only marginally degraded (Fig. 4, K and L). Finally, we tested the effect of glutathione. When 1 mm glutathione was included in a reaction mixture containing Cu(II)-loaded Cp, HS degradation was completely inhibited (results not shown). The present results show that the GPI-anchored splice variant of the cuproprotein Cp colocalizes with the similarly GPI-linked HSPG Gpc-1 in intracellular compartments of rat C6 glioma cells. In these cells, ascorbate induces an NO-dependent autodegradation of the HS chains in Gpc-1. The nitroxyl anion required for cleavage of HS at the GlcNH3+ residues can be generated either by denitrosylation of preformed SNO groups in Gpc-1 or by Zn(II) ion- and NO-dependent transnitrosation of Gpc-1. Stable SNO formation is dependent on a Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle (12Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In cell-free experiments, Zn(II) ion prebound to Gpc-1 precludes copper-supported HS degradation, probably because the two cations bind to the same site(s) in the Gpc-1 core protein (14Mani K. Cheng F. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, in cell-free experiments, zinc-supported degradation is less extensive than copper-supported degradation. However, in C6 cells, the ascorbate-induced HS degradation was quite extensive, despite the fact that it appeared to be mainly zinc-supported. This was apparently dependent on the expression of Cp in these cells. Cp binds seven copper atoms, three mononuclear ones and a trinuclear copper center that confers ability to serve as a ferroxidase. An additional copper is bound to the surface of the molecule near His-426. All of the copper atoms except one can be in either a Cu(II) or a Cu(I) state. Under normal conditions extracellularly, Cp binds Fe(II), oxidizes it, and loads Fe(III) on to transferrin. However, within the intracellular compartments or under the cell-free conditions used here, the copper in Cp may be available for other Cu(II)-mediated reactions. This may involve only the copper bound at His-426 or also other copper atoms in Cp (21Mukhopadhyay C.K. Mazumder B. Lindley P.F. Fox P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11546-11551Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Bielli P. Calabrese L. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1413-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Machonkin T.E. Solomon. E.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12547-12560Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown here, GPI-Cp is another potential regulator of NO-dependent degradation of HS in Gpc-1. In cell-free experiments and in the presence of Cu(II)-loaded Cp, HS undergoes extensive degradation also in Zn(II)-loaded Gpc-1 exposed to NO donor and ascorbate. Hence, as shown in Scheme 3, in the presence of Cp, the limitations imposed by Zn(II) ions are overcome (cf. Scheme 2). The Cp-Cu(II) involved in S-nitrosylation of Gpc-1 should be reduced to Cu(I). As Cu(II)-loaded Cp treated with excess Fe(II) ions was ineffective, it suggests that the presence of Cu(II) ions in Cp is essential. It should be added that Cu(II)-loaded Cp has been shown to catalyze S-nitrosylation of glutathione (24Inoue K. Akakike T. Miyamoto Y. Okamoto T. Sawa T. Otagiri M. Suzuki S. Yoshimura T. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27069-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This may explain why glutathione inhibited Cp-supported HS degradation; i.e. NO was used to nitrosylate glutathione rather than Gpc-1. Although Cu(I)-containing Cp may release NO, conversion of the free radical NO to nitroxyl anion is required for the degradation of HS at the GlcNH3+ residues (12Ding K. Mani K. Cheng F. Belting M.

Liu W. Tang Z. Slusher B.S. Hediger M.A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and could thus contribute to nitroxyl anion formation and subsequent HS degradation in glioma cells. Other studies have demonstrated that Gpc-1 core protein can be detected in the nuclei of neurons, glia cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells (6Qiao D. Meyer K. Mundhenke C. Drew S.A. Friedl A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16045-16053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Belting M. Mani K. Jönsson M. Cheng F. Sandgren S. Jonsson S. Ding K. Delcros J.-G.

The nuclear appearance of Gpc-1 in C6 glioma cells varied with different phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that Gpc-1 could be involved in the regulation of cell division (6Qiao D. Meyer K. Mundhenke C. Drew S.A. Friedl A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16045-16053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In Chinese hamster ovary cells, the nuclear appearance of Gpc-1 was induced by ascorbate (20Belting M. Mani K. Jönsson M. Cheng F. Sandgren S. Jonsson S. Ding K. Delcros J.-G. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47181-47189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ascorbate has been shown to promote differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons and astrocytes while inducing expression of differentiation-specific genes (26Lee J.Y. Chang M.Y. Park C.H. Kim H.Y. Kim J.H. Son H. Lee Y.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 73: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that this is due to nuclear targeting of Gpc-1 core protein rather than to a direct effect of ascorbate.

Hydropathy analyses indicate that these proteins contain eight hydrophobic regions (HRs) that could potentially form α-helical membrane-spanning segments.

We have employed a truncation mutant approach combined with insertions of glycosylation sites into full-length TRPC1.

These chimeras were transiently expressed in the human embryonic cell line HEK-293T. Glycosylation of the tag was used to monitor its location relative to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and thereby HR orientation.

We speculate that a similar mechanism may be responsible for the formation of other ion channel pores. The TRPC ion channels are a family of Ca2+-permeable cation channels that are activated following receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C (1Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev.

Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The TRPC family belongs to the TRP superfamily of non-voltage-gated cation channels that also includes channels involved in pain transduction, epithelial Ca2+ transport, osmoregulation, mechanosensitivity, cell growth and differentiation, and other as yet uncharacterized functions (1Clapham D.E.

At least 20 TRP superfamily members including seven TRPC family members (TRPC1–7) have thus far been identified in mammals. Recent studies indicate that members of the TRPC family are candidates for the store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway activated in response to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, a pathway whose molecular identity has remained elusive. However, the details of their involvement in this process and the downstream mechanisms underlying their activation following store depletion remain controversial (1Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 2Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 3Zitt C.

Our understanding of the function and regulation of this important class of ion channels as well as the design and interpretation of experiments to probe their structure/function relationships require information concerning their transmembrane topology. There is strong evidence that the N and C termini of the TRPC channels are intracellular (1Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev.

Based on sequence similarities to other apparently structurally related ion channels (5Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 631-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), it is thought that only six of the eight HRs actually form MSSs. Specifically, four of the first five HRs are thought to span the membrane, HRs 6 and 8 are thought to span the membrane and border the ion-conducting pore, and HR 7 is thought to form a part of the pore by dipping into the membrane from the extracellular surface (1Clapham D.E.

Evidence supporting this general topology scheme has been obtained for human TRPC3 by Vannier et al. (4Vannier B. Zhu X. Brown D. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8675-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These authors inferred the intracellular or extracellular location of both native and inserted glycosylation sites in the full-length TRPC3 sequence by transiently expressing appropriate recombinant proteins in COS cells and assaying for their glycosylation. They concluded that HR 1 was left out of the membrane on the cytosolic side and that HRs 2–6 and 8 were MSSs. A site placed near the N-terminal end of HR 7 was found to be glycosylated, consistent with its proposed role as a shallowly membrane-embedded part of the ion-conducting pore. They also verified that the N and C termini of TRPC3 were intracellular by showing that HA tags inserted at these sites were not accessible to extracellular antibodies unless the cells were permeabilized. However, analysis of the TRPC1 sequence using a number of recently derived algorithms for predicting MSSs as well as a detailed comparison of the TRPC1 and TRPC3 sequences suggested to us that a complementary study of the TRPC1 topology would be worth carrying out. For example, we found that HRs 1 and 7 of TRPC1 (the HR thought to be left out of the membrane in TRPC3 and the HR thought to form a part of the ion-conducting pore, respectively) were quite hydrophobic and almost universally predicted to be MSSs in TRPC1. We also noted that sequence conservation between TRPC1 and TRPC3 was rather poor within some of the HRs and their connecting loops (overall sequence identity over the eight HRs and interconnecting loops of TRPC1 and TRPC3 is ∼28%). The integration of membrane proteins into the bilayer of the ER has been shown to occur with the aid of a large complex of membrane-bound translocation/insertion machinery termed the “translocon” (6Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 7Turner R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 192: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The functional core of this complex is a transmembrane aqueous channel sufficiently large to accommodate one or more MSS. Ribosomes that are synthesizing membrane proteins associate with the translocon in such a way that successive MSSs are fed into this channel where they are recognized and ultimately transferred laterally into the lipid bilayer in their proper transmembrane orientations (6Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 7Turner R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 192: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 8Matlack K.E.S. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 9Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the simplest case, each MSS is sequentially recognized, oriented, and integrated into the membrane by the translocon as it is synthesized. But more complex scenarios where the integration of a MSS has been shown to depend on presence of neighboring MSSs or on the structure or charge of its flanking regions have been well documented (Ref. 7Turner R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 192: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar and references therein). It also seems clear that multiple MSSs can occupy the translocon channel simultaneously and that some MSSs may exit the translocon into the bilayer en bloc (10Heinrich S.U. Mothes W. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine the biogenesis and topology of TRPC1 in intact HEK-293T cells using a truncation mutant approach (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that allows us to follow the integration/folding process described above. In contrast to results obtained with TRPC3, we find that HR 1 of TRPC1 spans the membrane consistent with its high hydrophobicity, and that HR 3 is left out of the membrane on the cytosolic side. In addition, our results suggest a mechanism by which a pore-like structure might form from HRs 6–8 during TRPC1 biogenesis. As discussed in more detail later in the paper, amino acids downstream of HR 8, including the highly conserved “TRP box” (Glu-Trp-Lys-Phe-Ala-Arg), appear to play an important role in this process. We suggest that this mechanism may be a common feature of the folding of the TRPC and related ion pores. DNA Constructs—Segments of the human TRPC1 sequence were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-β whose construction has been described previously (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This vector drives the expression of a fusion protein consisting of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) followed by BglII and HindIII restriction sites for the insertion of additional sequence and finally a C-terminal glycosylation tag. The segments of TRPC1 indicated in the text and/or figure legends were amplified by PCR and cloned directly into pEGFP-β by standard methods. The forward and reverse PCR primers, incorporating 5′- and 3′-BglII and -HindIII sites, respectively, were designed essentially as reported in previous studies from our laboratory (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In all of the fusion protein constructs, the amino acids Ser-Asp-Leu and Gly-Ser-Phe coded (in part) by BglII and HindIII, respectively, flanked the TRPC1 inserts in pEGFP-β. All of the TRPC1 inserts began at M339. The correctness of all of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing. In our early experiments, we were plagued by PCR errors in constructs extending beyond HR 4 (typically resulting in premature stop codons). This problem was resolved by growing all of the transformed bacteria at 30 °C rather than at 37 °C. We suspect that this problem was related to the production of a toxic protein that inhibited the growth of bacteria harboring correctly coded clones, but we have not explored this further. An HA-tagged human TRPC1 clone (in pcDNA3.1) was used as the template for the PCR reactions (12Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For inserts longer than K647, the template was the same vector in which the native TRPC1 Hind III site following HR 8 had been destroyed by a silent mutation. Glycosylation consensus sites (see “Results”) were inserted into the full-length HA-tagged TRPC1 sequence in pcDNA3.1 using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Growth and Transfection of HEK-293T and HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293T cells (from American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (all from Biofluids), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in 10-cm plastic dishes in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and subcultured every 2–3 days. Subconfluent (∼80%) HEK-293T monolayers were transiently transfected overnight (19–24 h) with the expression vectors indicated using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK-293 cells (from Microbix Biosystems Inc.) were cultured and transfected as above with the exception that Earle's minimal essential medium was used in place of Dulbecco's modified essential medium. To obtain stably transfected HEK-293 cells, G418 (0.9 mg/ml) was added to the medium 2 days after transfection and cells were subcultured as necessary. Confluent cultures of G418-resistant cells were harvested ∼3 weeks later. Preparation of Particulate and Membrane Fractions—Particulate and membrane fractions from HEK-293 and HEK-293T cells were obtained essentially as described previously (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized in ice-cold TEEA buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 300 μm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, ICN), 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin (all from Roche Applied Science). This material was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved. The pellet was resuspended in TEEA buffer, rehomogenized, and centrifuged as before. The combined supernates from these two homogenization steps were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting “particulate fraction” was resuspended in TEEA buffer, snap-frozen, and stored above liquid nitrogen (protein concentration was typically 5–10 mg/ml measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine IgG as the standard). The “membrane fraction” was prepared from the above particulate fraction by an alkaline floatation step (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A.

Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as follows. An aliquot of the particulate fraction containing 50–100 μg of protein was diluted to 25 μl with TEEA, and 25 μl of 200 mm Na2CO3 (pH 12.0) was added. This mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and then mixed with 90 μl of 2.5 m sucrose in 100 mm Na2CO3. 50 μl of 1.25 m sucrose and 50 μl of 0.25 m sucrose, both containing 0.2 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), were overlaid next on the alkaline mixture, and the tube was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge equipped with a TLA100.3 rotor. The 0.25 and 1.25 m sucrose layers and the interface between the 1.25 m sucrose layer and the alkaline mixture were recovered as the membrane fraction. Deglycosylation of the Membrane Fraction—Aliquots of the above membrane fractions were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, New England Biolabs) as follows. A 10-μl aliquot of the membrane fraction was diluted to 20 μl in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.5% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol (final concentrations) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. 2.22 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and 1 μl (1,000 units) of PNGase F next were added, and this mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. In control samples, PNGase F was substituted by its storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 50% glycerol). Western Blotting and Analysis—SDS-PAGE using 4–20% Tris-glycine Ready gels (Bio-Rad) and Western blotting using a rabbit antigreen fluorescent protein polyclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) were carried out as described previously (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE using 10% Tris-glycine Ready Gels (Bio-Rad) and Western blotting using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) were carried out similarly with the exception that incubation with the primary antibody was for 90 min and no secondary antibody was used. Quantitation of Western blots was done using a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer. Quantitative results shown are means ± S.E. for three or more independent experiments. Predictions of Membrane-spanning Segments—The MSSs of human TRPC1 predicted by a number of recent theoretical methods are summarized in the upper portion of Fig. 1. In each case, the positions of predicted MSSs in the amino acid sequence are indicated by horizontal lines. The results illustrated are from the DAS (15Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G.

All of these methods have been shown to be considerably more accurate in the prediction of MSSs than a simple hydropathy analysis (22Chen C.P. Kernytsky A. Rost B.

In the lower part of Fig. 1, we show a hydrophobicity plot obtained by the classical method of Kyte and Doolittle (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar) using a 19-amino acid window. The eight HRs are labeled. Note that all of the theoretical methods predict that HR 1 is a MSS, and most predict that HR 7 is membrane spanning but that HR 3 is not. There is also some disagreement among the methods concerning the integration and location of HRs 4 and 5. The amino acid sequence of the central hydrophobic domain of TRPC1 with the approximate positions of HRs 1–8 indicated is shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Amino acid sequence of human TRPC1. The “approximate” positions of HRs 1 through 8 are underlined. The amino acids marked with asterisks indicate the truncation points of the TRPC1 inserts in pEGFP-β described in the paper. The amino acids marked with pound signs are the mutated residues in the experiment shown in Fig. 4A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Experimental System—To explore the topology of TRPC1, we have used a truncation mutant approach (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) where portions of the TRPC1 sequence beginning at Met-339 and containing one or more possible MSSs are fused (see “Materials and Methods”) between EGFP and the extracellular tail (177 amino acids) of the β-subunit of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase, a glycosylation tag. This latter sequence contains five consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (24Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When translocated into the interior of the ER, it acquires ∼14 kDa of apparent molecular weight due to glycosylation (25Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40471-40477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), an increase that is easily detected by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The use of this glycosylation tag in membrane topology determinations is now well established (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol.

EGFP at the N terminus of our constructs acts as both a cytosolic anchor and a convenient marker for the detection of fusion proteins on Western blots. The Membrane Topology of HRs 1–3—In Fig. 3A, we show the results of a series of experiments where TRPC1 fragments including HR 1 (K373), HRs 1 and 2 (M416), and HRs 1, 2, and 3 (W443 and Q457) were expressed as EGFP/β-subunit fusion proteins in HEK-293T cells. In each of the panels in Fig. 3A, we show the results of a typical experiment where the membrane fraction from HEK-293T cells, transiently transfected with the truncation mutant indicated, was treated with (+) or without (–) PNGase F (see “Materials and Methods”). These membrane fractions were run on SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting to determine the extent of glycosylation of the β-subunit and thus its location inside or outside the ER lumen. The percentage of glycosylated recombinant protein is given below each panel. Thus, for example, the mutant truncated after HR 1 (K373) is highly glycosylated (∼90%), indicating that HR 1 crosses the ER membrane in a Ncyt/Clum orientation consistent with its high hydrophobicity and with the theoretical predictions discussed above (cf. Fig. 1). As detailed under “Materials and Methods,” the membrane preparations analyzed in Fig. 3A were obtained from particulate fractions of HEK-293T cells using an alkaline floatation procedure (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this procedure, the particulate fractions were first incubated in alkaline 100 mm Na2CO3. Under these conditions, any membrane vesicles present are converted to sheets and most protein-protein interactions are disrupted; however, protein-lipid (hydrophobic) interactions are not disrupted and the membrane bilayer remains intact (28Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Thus, this incubation is expected to strip away most peripheral membrane proteins but leave integrated proteins in the bilayer. Following this incubation in alkaline medium, the membrane fraction was isolated by floatation on a sucrose gradient (see “Materials and Methods”) (11Dohke Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15215-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A.

Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition to separating the membranes from the peripheral proteins removed by alkaline treatment, this step also leaves any aggregated recombinant proteins arising from overexpression in the lower phase. An analysis of the particulate and membrane fractions from cells expressing K373 showed that 73 ± 3% of this recombinant protein was glycosylated in the particulate fraction and that 24 ± 8% of the total K373 found in the particulate fraction was recovered in the membrane fraction (data not shown). From these results, one can calculate that ∼70% of the glycosylated K373 found in the particulate fraction does not copurify with the membrane fraction. Because glycosylation can only occur in the lumen of the ER, these non-membrane-associated recombinant proteins must have been formerly inserted into the membrane and then later removed, presumably for degradation. Also, because membrane proteins extracted from the ER and targeted for degradation are first deglycosylated (29Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), the percentage of glycosylated K373 in the particulate fraction (73 ± 3%) is expected to be a lower limit on the percentage of these recombinant proteins targeted to the membrane. Returning to Fig. 3A, we see that the mutant truncated after HR 2 (M416) is ∼60% glycosylated, indicating that HR 2 crosses the membrane in a Nlum/Ccyt orientation in only 40% of these recombinant proteins. Extending the length of the TRPC1 insert to W430 to include the N-terminal end of HR 3 (Fig. 2) has no significant effect on this result (data not shown); however, when the TRPC1 sequence was extended to include all of HR 3 (W443), almost no glycosylation was observed, indicating that the C terminus of this truncation mutant is mainly cytosolic. Further extension of the TRPC1 sequence to Gln-457 to include the sequence between HR 3 and HR 4 yielded a similar result (Fig. 3A). Taken together, these results indicate that HR 1 is a MSS with a Ncyt/Clum orientation and that a second MSS with a Nlum/Ccyt orientation, presuma"

It is a secreted proteinase and is present in carp head kidney, kidney, and spleen, all of which are responsible for immune and hematopoietic functions in fish. A complex formed by nephrosin and its inhibitor was purified from carp kidney extract by heparin affinity column chromatography. The presence of the nephrosin-inhibitor complex in different tissues was examined by immunoblotting with polyclonal antisera against the purified nephrosin inhibitor and nephrosin. Both nephrosin and the nephrosin inhibitor were present mainly in gill, head kidney, kidney, and spleen. In addition, we have cloned the cDNA encoding the nephrosin inhibitor. There are two different cDNA clones possibly resulting from two different genes, and the long form contains unique tandem repeat sequences in the 3′-end. The deduced primary structure of nephrosin inhibitor is similar to that of fetuin-A, a mammalian protein present in blood, liver, cerebrospinal fluid, and cerebral cortex during fetal development. Treatment with both N-glycosidase F and O-glycosidase removed the carbohydrate moiety of the nephrosin inhibitor and decreased the apparent molecular mass from 40 to 30 kDa. The nephrosin inhibitor seems to be synthesized in liver and then secreted to the blood as a precursor. When it was distributed into hematopoietic tissues, it was processed from 67 to 40 kDa and acquired inhibitory activity. This processing phenomenon of fetuin has not been reported elsewhere. Importantly, the presence of an endogenous inhibitor of nephrosin is the first report of this kind for astacin enzymes. It is very likely that endogenous tissue inhibitors may also be present for the regulation of other astacin enzymes. Nephrosin is a newly discovered member of the astacin family.

However, most members of the astacin family are involved in developmental processes, and only a few of them (meprins, astacin, and nephrosin) are expressed in mature organisms in a tissue-specific manner. Astacin enzymes are synthesized as preproprotein precursors, the signal sequence of which directs them to either membrane-bound or secreted forms (3Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Analyses of the N-terminal sequences of purified astacin, hatching enzymes, meprin A, bone morphogenetic protein-1, and nephrosin indicate that the preproproteins of these enzymes have been processed to remove the prosequence, which would give rise to precisely processed and fully active enzymes (14Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28126-28132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Together with matrix metalloproteinases (also called matrixins), adamalysins/reprolysins, and serralysins, they have been grouped into a superfamily of metzincins on the basis of almost superimposable topology and a conserved methionine residue beneath the active-site metal (15Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Rüth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The catalytic function of metzincin enzymes depends on a zinc ion in the active site. This catalytic zinc is coordinated by three histidine residues and a water molecule anchored by a glutamic acid residue in matrixins and adamalysins (16Gomis-Rüth F.X. Kress L.F. Bode W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4151-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17Gomis-Rüth F.X. Kress L.F. Kellermann J. Mayr I. Lee X. Huber R. Bode W. J. Mol.

However, in the astacins and serralysins, a tyrosine residue immediately following the conserved methionine (-MHY-) with its hydroxyl oxygen provides the fifth ligand to the catalytic zinc (21Bode W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stocker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W. Huber R. Zwilling R. Bode W. J. Mol.

As for regulation of enzyme activities, most studies have focused on matrixins among the four classes of metalloproteinases. First, most matrixins are synthesized and secreted in a form of zymogen whose activation requires precise removal of the propeptide domain (25Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3890) Google Scholar). Another important mechanism for the regulation of the activities of matrixins is mediated by endogenous inhibitors like α-macroglobulin in body fluid and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: TIMPs, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; LC, liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. in tissues (26Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Up to now, four different TIMPs (TIMP1–TIMP4) have been identified in vertebrates (26Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). All TIMPs are able to form a 1:1 tight complex with multiple matrixins, albeit with differences in binding affinity (27Taylor K.B. Windsor L.J. Caterina N.C.M. Bodden M.K. Engler J.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been predicted that snake venom zinc endopeptidase adamalysin II, but not astacins and serralysins, can also be inhibited by TIMP in a similar manner (29Gomis-Rüth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In fact, TIMP3 inhibits ADAM-17 (30Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G.

In this study, an endogenous protein inhibitor of carp nephrosin has been purified from the enzyme-inhibitor complex. N-terminal sequencing and cDNA cloning data indicate that the inhibitor is derived from fetuin by proteolytic processing. In addition, the processing activities are associated only with the tissues in which the nephrosin inhibitor can be found. This is the first demonstration of an endogenous tissue inhibitor of an astacin enzyme. Surprisingly, the nephrosin inhibitor is derived from an unexpected protein, fetuin. Purification of Nephrosin and the Nephrosin Inhibitor—Carp kidneys (20 g) were homogenized in 200 ml of TE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl containing 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) in a glass homogenizer. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The sample was then applied to a heparin-HyperD column (70-μm particle size, 2.5 × 10 cm; BioSepra Inc.) equilibrated with TE buffer and eluted stepwise by 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, and 1.0 m NaCl in TE buffer. The 0.6 m NaCl fractions were saved for further purification of nephrosin. The 0.45 m NaCl fractions containing the nephrosin-inhibitor complex were pooled, dialyzed against deionized water, lyophilized, dissolved in TE buffer, and applied to a heparin-HyperD FPLC column (20-μm particle size, 0.5 × 5 cm; BioSepra Inc.). Purification was achieved by elution with 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, and 1.0 m NaCl in TE buffer (10 min for each elution) at a constant flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The 0.45 m NaCl fractions containing the nephrosin-inhibitor complex were pooled, dialyzed against 0.1 m acetic acid, lyophilized, dissolved in TE buffer, and immediately applied to the heparin-HyperD FPLC column for a second time. The elution program was the same as described above, and the unretarded fractions (p40) containing the nephrosin inhibitor were pooled, dialyzed against deionized water, and lyophilized. The nephrosin inhibitor precursor was purified from carp serum. 10 ml of carp serum was mixed with an equal volume of TE buffer and then applied to a reactive brown-Sepharose column (1.5 × 8 cm) equilibrated with TE buffer. The bound proteins were eluted stepwise by 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 m NaCl in TE buffer. The 0.3 and 0.6 m NaCl fractions contained the nephrosin inhibitor precursor (p67). Gel Electrophoresis—Gel electrophoresis was performed using a Tricine/SDS-PAGE system as described previously (33Schägger H. von Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). The gel concentration was 7.5%, and the bisacrylamide/acrylamide ratio was 6%. The protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated nonreducing sample buffer, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and subjected directly to electrophoresis when the nephrosin-inhibitor complex was to be preserved. Otherwise, the sample in nonreducing sample buffer was boiled for 5 min to completely dissociate the complex. For reverse proteolytic zymographic assay, Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel was prepared as described, except that the gel contained 0.2% gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated twice for 30 min at 27 °C with 2% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and for 3–4 h with Tris buffer containing 0.01 mm ZnCl2 and 0.2 μg/ml nephrosin. For diagonal two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the first dimension gel electrophoresis was conventional SDS-PAGE, except that the protein mixture in the SDS sample buffer was incubated at room temperature for 5 min instead of being boiled. Before the second dimension gel electrophoresis, the gel slice was either incubated with stacking gel buffer at room temperature for 10 min or boiled in stacking gel buffer for 3 min. The second dimension gel electrophoresis was also conventional SDS-PAGE. The gel was then stained with GelCode blue solution (Pierce). Immunization and Immunoblot Analysis—Purified p67 and p40 were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and thoroughly mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant for the first injection or Freund's incomplete adjuvant for the second and third injections. Approximately 50 μg of nephrosin inhibitor was injected subcutaneously into the back of a guinea pig during each biweekly immunization. 10 days after the third injection, the blood was withdrawn by heart puncture, and serum was stored at 4 °C. Carp tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of TE buffer, pH 8.0, by a glass homogenizer. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The tissue extracts were then stored at –70 °C after glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10% for preservation of the nephrosin-inhibitor complex. Otherwise, the tissue extracts were mixed with an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and stored at –70 °C. Immunoblotting was carried out using anti-nephrosin inhibitor or anti-nephrosin antiserum (1:2000 dilution) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:10,000 dilution) after diffusion blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (34Chen H. Chang G.-D. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1894-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were detected by the NiCl2 enhancement method (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar). Cross-linking and Glycoprotein Deglycosylation—Cross-linking of nephrosin and the nephrosin inhibitor was achieved by mixing both proteins (0.5 mg/ml) and 0.125–2 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3; Pierce) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding Tris buffer to a final concentration of 50 mm. Protein deglycosylation was carried out using N-glycosidase F (recombinant enzyme from Flavobacterium meningo-septicum, Roche Applied Science) and O-glycosidase (Diplococcus pneumoniae, from Roche Applied Science) according to the procedures provided by the manufacturer. Processing of the Nephrosin Inhibitor—To 50 μg of nephrosin inhibitor precursor (p67) in 0.22 ml of 50 mm NaHCO3 was added 0.1 mg of sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) in 25 μl of N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction was carried out for 2 h on ice. Unreacted biotin was removed by dilution with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, and concentration using a Centricon centrifugal filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The processing reaction contained 10 μl of biotinylated precursor (0.1 μg), 10 μl of HEPES, 8 μl of tissue extract (10 μg), and 2 μl of 25 mm CaCl2/MgCl2. The reaction was carried out for 50 min at 28 °C and stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 2-fold concentrated SDS sample buffer. 10 μl of each reaction product was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (0.01 mg/10 ml) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Streptavidin-reactive bands were detected by the NiCl2 enhancement method (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—The purified nephrosin-inhibitor complex, the nephrosin inhibitor, and nephrosin were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with GelCode blue solution. The gel bands of the nephrosin-inhibitor complex, nephrosin, and the nephrosin inhibitor were excised, destained, reduced, carboxymethylated, and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 100% acetonitrile. The eluted peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography (LC)/electro-spray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry analysis on an integrated nano-LC/tandem mass spectrometry system (Micromass) comprising a 3-pumping Micromass/Waters CapLC® system with an autosampler, a stream select module configured for a precolumn plus an analytical capillary column, and a Micromass Q-Tof Ultima® API mass spectrometer fitted with nano-LC sprayer operated under MassLynx® 4.0 control. Isolation of Nephrosin Inhibitor cDNA from Carp Liver—N-terminal amino acid sequences (Applied Biosystems Model 477A) were obtained from the nephrosin inhibitor precursor (ASLPTGTDVVYKCQK) and from a peptide fragment copurified with the nephrosin inhibitor (HEILVTKCPDCPGLL) after transfer to a PVDF membrane. Degenerate primers corresponding to the two heptapeptide sequences (underlined) were designed as follows: 5′-GCNAGYCTNCCNACNGGNAC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GGRCARTCNGGRCAYTTNGT-3′ as the reverse primer (where R is A and G; Y is T and C; and N is A, T, C, and G). mRNA from liver was purified with the QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Complementary DNA was synthesized using Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). All of the above experiments were carried out according to the procedures included with the purchased items. PCR with 0.5 μg of both primers, 0.1 μg of cDNA, 10 μl of 10-fold concentrated Taq polymerase buffer, 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase in a final volume of 100 μl was performed at 94 °C for 3 min; at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for 35 cycles; and for a final extension at 72 °C for 15 min. A DNA fragment of ∼400 bp was synthesized in this reaction. The PCR product was purified following agarose gel electrophoresis using an Ultrafree-DA centrifugal filter (Millipore Corp.). The 5′- and 3′-ends of nephrosin inhibitor mRNA were obtained with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) using 5′-primers (5′-CTCATCACTGGAGATGGTCACATTACA-3′ and 5′-CATGGCGGTGATGGTCATTAATGAAGC-3′) and 3′ primers (5′-TCAGGACAAGATTGCTACATTAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGGAAACTGAGTGCCACATTGTG-3′). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from carp brain, gill, heart, head kidney, intestine, kidney, liver, muscle, ovary, and spleen with the RNAzol B kit (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). 20 μg of total RNA from each tissue was fractionated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel in MOPS and transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After prehybridization at 68 °C in hybridization buffer (Clontech) for 1 h, blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe for 2 h under identical conditions. Blots were washed twice with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min. After autoradiography, the blots were stripped by boiling in 0.5% SDS solution and reused for another hybridization experiment. The cDNA probes used for Northern blotting were derived from carp fetuin-L sequence corresponding to nucleotides 276–781 and 788–1305. They were synthesized with Taq polymerase and labeled with Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dATP. A cDNA probe of the carp β-actin gene (nucleotides 2419–2769) was used as an internal control. Standard procedures in molecular biology were used for preparation of plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, DNA-agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA ligation, and transformation of bacteria (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Expression of Recombinant Fetuin Proteins—We constructed expression vectors encoding the insert segment of the long form of fetuin (amino acids 261–422) and the full-length short form of fetuin (amino acids 17–300, lacking the signal peptide). The DNA fragment was prepared by PCR amplification using a 5′-primer containing a synthetic BamHI site (5′-CACGGATCCTGCTCAGTCAAGAAGA-3′, nucleotides 821–836 for the former; and 5′-ACTGGATCCGCCAGCCTCCCGACAG-3′, nucleotides 87–102 for the latter) and a 3′-primer containing a synthetic HindIII site (5′-GCTAAGCTTCAGGCACTGATTCTGG-3′, complementary to nucleotides 1290–1306 for the former; and 5′-GTGAAGCTTGTTACCAGTTGGACGT-3′, complementary to nucleotides 924–938 for the latter) with the cloned cDNA as a template. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into the corresponding sites of expression vectors pQE31 and pQE30, respectively (QIAGEN Inc.). The constructed vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15. An overnight culture carrying the expression construct was diluted 1:100 into 100 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The culture was grown at 37 °C until A600 = 0.5–0.7, and expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were incubated for an additional 4–5 h, harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min, and resuspended in 10 ml of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). The cells were sonicated on ice until the solution become clear, and the supernatant was removed after centrifugation. The pellet fraction was dissolved in column equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, and 0.3 m NaCl) and passed through TALON™ metal affinity resin (Clontech) at room temperature to purify the His-tagged proteins. The column was washed with 5 volumes of column equilibration buffer and eluted with 25, 50, 100, and 200 mm imidazole and 200 mm EDTA in column equilibration buffer. Both His-tagged proteins were eluted in the 200 mm imidazole fraction. Purification of the Nephrosin Inhibitor—Several potential heparin-binding domains are present in the sequence of carp nephrosin: 8RRCKWRKSR16, 118KHIK121, and 136KKRK139. Therefore, we tried to use heparin affinity column chromatography in our purification procedures for nephrosin. Nephrosin indeed bound to heparin-HyperD gel in TE buffer and was eluted by the addition of 0.6 m NaCl in the same buffer. However, 5–10% of the nephrosin was eluted in the earlier 0.45 m NaCl fractions along with two major proteins of 40 kDa (p40) and 65 kDa (p65) and other minor components (Fig. 1A). Rechromatography of the 0.45 m NaCl fractions (fractions 4–8) on a heparin FPLC column removed the contaminated minor proteins, but not p40 or p65 (Fig. 1B). Attempts to remove p40 and p65 from nephrosin by additional gel filtration or ion exchange column chromatography were not successful. The purified complex possessed no proteolytic activity for reduced and carboxymethylated bovine serum albumin, which can be readily digested by nephrosin (1Hung C.-H. Huang H.-R. Huang C.-J. Huang F.-L. Chang G.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (Correction (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19632): 13772-13778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The FPLC 0.45 m NaCl fractions were then dialyzed against 1% HOAc for 48 h, lyophilized, dissolved in TE buffer, and immediately applied to the same heparin FPLC column. The 40-kDa protein and nephrosin were found in the unretarded fractions and in the 0.6 m NaCl fractions, respectively (Fig. 2). However, in the 0.45 m NaCl fractions, we saw only trace amounts of any proteins. The unretarded fractions (p40) were collected, lyophilized, and used for nephrosin inhibitor assay.Fig. 2Purification of the nephrosin inhibitor from the nephrosin-inhibitor complex. A, the purified nephrosin-inhibitor complex obtained from the 0.45 m NaCl fractions in Fig. 1B was treated with 1% acetic acid; lyophilized; applied to a heparin FPLC column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with TE buffer; and eluted with 0, 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, and 1.0 m NaCl in TE buffer. Fractions were collected as indicated by the letters under each peak. B, the indicated fraction from each peak in A was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue G-250 staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) p40 as a Protein Inhibitor of Nephrosin—We noticed that p65 was completely lost in our purification procedures of p40. Interestingly, the relative molecular mass of p65 is close to the calculated sum of those of p40 and nephrosin (p23). To test the speculation that p65 is an SDS-resistant complex of p40 and nephrosin, we analyzed the purified complex by modified diagonal two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The first dimension gel electrophoresis was conventional SDS-PAGE, except that the protein mixture in the SDS sample buffer was incubated at room temperature for 3 min instead of being boiled. Before the second dimension gel electrophoresis, the gel slice was either incubated with stacking gel buffer at room temperature for 10 min (Fig. 3A) or boiled for 3 min in stacking gel buffer (Fig. 3B). The second dimension gel electrophoresis was also conventional SDS-PAGE. The original diagonal two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was designed to align disulfide bond linkage by isolating peptides linked with the disulfide bonds (37Traut R.R. Casiano C. Zecherle N. Protein Function. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 101-133Google Scholar). The modified method was designed to align protein partners associated by SDS-resistant noncovalent bonds, which can be dissociated before the second dimension electrophoresis due to the boiling treatment. Therefore, p65 was no longer detected after boiling, and spots of nephrosin (as indicated by anti-nephrosin immunoblotting in Fig. 3C) and p40 appeared, but away from the diagonal line. It is evident that the nephrosin-p40 complex partially dissociated during the first dimension electrophoresis as judged by the continuation of protein staining along the electrophoresis track. Based on these results and that the purified complex did not display proteolytic activity, we speculate that p40 serves as an inhibitor of nephrosin and that p65 is a complex of nephrosin and its inhibitor. If p65 were a co"
https://openalex.org/W1998679041,"The degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, a metabolite of oleic acid, by the purified complex of fatty acid oxidation from Escherichia coli was studied to determine how much of the metabolite is converted to 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA and thereby diverted from the classical, isomerase-dependent pathway of oleate β-oxidation. Approximately 10% of the 2,5-intermediate was converted to the 3,5-isomer. When the latter compound was allowed to accumulate, it strongly inhibited the flux through the main pathway. Since Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase was not detected in E. coli cells grown on oleate, the 3,5-intermediate cannot be metabolized via the reductase-dependent pathway. However, it was hydrolyzed by a thioesterase, which was most active with 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA as substrate and which was induced by growth of E. coli on oleate. An analysis of fatty acids present in the medium after growth of E. coli on oleate revealed the presence of 3,5-tetradecadienoate, which was not detected after cells were grown on palmitate or glucose. Altogether, these data prompt the conclusion that oleate is mostly degraded via the classical, isomerase-dependent pathway in E. coli but that a small amount of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA is diverted from the pathway via conversion to 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA by Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase. The 3,5-intermediate, which would strongly inhibit β-oxidation if allowed to accumulate, is hydrolyzed, and the resultant 3,5-tetradecadienoate is excreted into the growth medium.

One is the classical or isomerase-dependent pathway that involves only one auxiliary enzyme, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (enoyl-CoA isomerase) 1The abbreviations used are: enoyl-CoA isomerase, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase; dienoyl-CoA isomerase, Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; FAO complex, fatty acid oxidation complex; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: enoyl-CoA isomerase, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase; dienoyl-CoA isomerase, Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; FAO complex, fatty acid oxidation complex; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. (EC 5.3.3.8), in addition to the enzymes required for the degradation of saturated fatty acids (for a review, see Ref. 1Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The other is the alternative or reductase-dependent pathway that requires three auxiliary enzymes, namely enoyl-CoA isomerase, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34), and Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (dienoyl-CoA isomerase), to reductively remove the preexisting double bond of oleic acid (2Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study of the two pathways reached the conclusion that in rat heart mitochondria more than 80% of oleate is degraded via the classical pathway, whereas the alternative pathway accounts for the remainder of oleate β-oxidation (4Ren Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). That study relied on the use of a mitochondrial extract that permitted the analysis of intermediates but did not maintain the supramolecular organization of enzymes as they exist in intact mitochondria. Since the organization of these enzymes may affect the flux through one pathway relative to the other, the use of an organized β-oxidation system uncompromised by its isolation would be advantageous. Such system is present in Escherichia coli, where a multienzyme complex of fatty acid oxidation (FAO complex) is highly expressed when cells are grown on long-chain fatty acids as the sole carbon source (5Binstock J.F. Pramanik A. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The purified complex contains the cellular activities of enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, and enoyl-CoA isomerase (6Pawar S. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3894-3899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A study of fatty acid oxidation in E. coli would also reveal whether the alternative pathway of oleate β-oxidation, which requires dienoyl-CoA isomerase, exists in prokaryotes. If yes, it may be a ubiquitous process that is operative in all organisms capable of oxidizing fatty acids. These considerations prompted the following study of oleate β-oxidation in E. coli. Materials—CoASH, NAD+, NADH, NADPH, stearoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, tetradecanoyl-CoA, dodecanoyl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA were purchased from Life Science Resources (Milwaukee, WI). 5-cis-Tetradecenoic acid was synthesized by Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Oleic acid was obtained from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). BCl3-methanol (12%, w/w) was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon, MI) was the source of ethyl ether, whereas hexane was from Fisher.

Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2543-2548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were purified by published procedures. Syntheses of Substrates and Metabolites—2-trans-Dodecenoic acid and 2-trans-tetradecenoic acid were synthesized by reacting malonic acid with n-decanal and n-dodecanal, respectively, as described in principle by Linestead et al (14Linestead R.P. Noble E.G. Boorman E.J. J. Chem. Soc. 1931; : 740-751Google Scholar). Oleoyl-CoA, 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA, 2-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA, and 2-trans-dodecenoyl-CoA were synthesized from oleic acid, 5-cis-tetradecenoic acid, 2-trans-tetradecenoic acid, and 2-trans-dodecenoic acid, respectively, by the mixed anhydride method as described by Fong and Schulz (15Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 2-trans-Tetradecenoyl-CoA was partially converted to l-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA by hydration in the presence of crotonase in 0.1 m KPi (pH 8.0). The resultant l-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA was purified by HPLC. 3-cis-Tetradecenoyl-CoA (16Zhang D. Yu W. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9127-9132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and 3-ketohexadecanoyl-CoA (17Thorpe C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were synthesized as described. 2-trans-5-cis-Tetradecadienoyl-CoA, l-3-hydroxy-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA, 3-keto-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA, l-3-hydroxydodecanoyl-CoA, 3-ketododecanoyl-CoA, and 2-trans,4-trans-tetradecadienoyl-CoA were prepared as published (4Ren Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 3,5-cis-Tetradecadienoyl-CoA was synthesized by incubating 5 μmol of 5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA in 15 ml of 0.1 m KPi (pH 8.0) with 12 units of acyl-CoA oxidase at room temperature. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC. After completion of the reaction, NAD+, CoASH, 0.2 units of enoyl-CoA hydratase, 0.4 units of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 0.4 units of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase were added to remove traces of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA by converting it to 3-cis-dodecenoyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, which were removed by HPLC. All products were purified by HPLC. The pH values of the acyl-CoA preparations were adjusted to ∼3–4, and the thioester concentrations of these solutions were determined spectrophotometrically by quantification of CoASH with Ellman's reagent (18Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21218) Google Scholar) after quantitatively cleaving the thioester bond with NH2OH at pH 7.0 (15Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The concentrations of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA and 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA were also determined by converting them enzymatically to 2-trans,4-trans-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (4Ren Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and calculating the concentration of the latter compound based on its absorbance at 300 nm by using an extinction coefficient of 28,000 m–1 cm–1 (19Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14140-14144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial Growth Conditions—E. coli cells (strain B) were grown on LB medium from single colonies. The initial culture was diluted 5-fold into M9 minimal medium containing 1% (w/v) Tryptone, 2 mm MgSO4, 10 μm CaCl2, 1 μm FeCl3, and additionally either glucose (0.2–0.5%, w/v), oleic acid (0.1–0.2%, v/v), or palmitic acid (0.1%) in the presence of 0.4% Triton X-100. The cultures were grown at 37 °C in a shaker incubator to an absorbance of 1 when they were diluted 20 times into the same growth medium but without Tryptone. The final culture was harvested at an absorbance of 1 by centrifugation at 3,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were washed twice with M9 minimal medium and stored at –80 °C. Preparation and Fractionation of Bacterial Extracts—Seven g of E. coli cell paste were suspended in 14 ml of 0.1 m KPi (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10% glycerol; sonicated for a total of 2 min (10 s × 12) at 0 °C; and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was collected for enzyme assays and protein purification. The precipitate was resuspended in 0.1 m KPi (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100, or Tween 40, or Tween 80, or β-d-glucopyranoside and incubated for 30 min on ice. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for enzyme assays. The soluble E. coli extract was dialyzed overnight against 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm benzamidine. The dialyzed supernatant was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (13.5 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with dialysis buffer. The column was then developed with a linear gradient made up of 500 ml each of 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing either 50 mm NaCl or 500 mm NaCl. Fractions were assayed for thioesterase activity, and those with high activities were pooled and stored at –80 °C. Metabolic and Enzyme Assays—Rates of degradation of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA via the isomerase-dependent pathway were determined by incubating various amounts of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA in 0.2 m KPi (pH 8.0) with 0.6 μg of E. coli FAO complex in the presence of bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml), 1 mm NAD+, and 0.3 mm CoASH and measuring the rate of NADH formation spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. An extinction coefficient of 6,220 m–1 cm–1 was used to calculate rates. The conversion of 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA to 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was measured by incubating the substrate in 0.2 m KPi (pH 8.0) with 0.6 μg of E. coli FAO complex in the presence of 0.04 units of dienoyl-CoA isomerase. The absorbance change at 300 nm was recorded, and an extinction coefficient of 28,000 m–1 cm–1 was used to calculate rates. When the time-dependent formation of metabolites was studied, 20 μm 2-trans-5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was incubated in 0.2 m KPi (pH 8.0) with 0.6 μg of E. coli FAO complex, 1 mm NAD+, 0.3 mm CoASH and in the presence or absence of dienoyl-CoA isomerase (0.04 units/ml). Reactions were terminated by adjusting the pH to 1.5 with 6 n HCl. The pH was readjusted to 4.5 with 4 n KOH before the reaction mixtures were clarified by filtration through 0.22-μm pore size membranes and analyzed by HPLC. Metabolites were quantified by the following procedure. Areas under the peaks were obtained by integration with Millennium software from Waters Corp. Peak areas were normalized by use of extinction coefficients of 15,000, 19,650, and 28,800 m–1 cm–1 that had been determined for acyl-CoA thioesters with a saturated α carbon, one double bond, and two double bonds in conjugation with the thioester function, respectively, at 254 nm (4Ren Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The sum of all normalized peak areas remained fairly constant throughout the experiment. Hence, the sum of all metabolites was 20 μm, the concentration of the substrate that was added to the incubation mixture. The normalized area of one peak relative to the sum of all normalized areas gives the percentage of substrate converted to the indicated metabolite. These values are plotted in Fig. 3 and are labeled Metabolites (%). Activities of dienoyl-CoA isomerase were determined by incubating 20 μm 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA in 0.2 m KPi (pH 8.0) with various amounts of soluble cell extract or membranes solubilized with detergents (see “Preparation and Fractionation of Bacterial Extracts”) from oleate-grown or glucose-grown cells. After recording the absorbance at 300 nm for 2 min, mammalian dienoyl-CoA isomerase (18 milliunits) was added to the assay to determine whether or not the substrate was still present. An extinction coefficient of 28,000 m–1 cm–1 was used to calculate rates. Thioesterase was assayed by measuring the release of CoASH from acyl-CoAs with Ellman's reagent (18Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21218) Google Scholar). A standard assay mixture contained 0.175 m KPi (pH 8), 0.2 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent), and 20 μm acyl-CoA. The progress of the reaction was determined spectrophotometrically at 412 nm, and rates were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 13,600 m–1 cm–1. Isolation and Analysis of Fatty Acids Present in the Growth Medium—E. coli cells were grown to early exponential or to an absorbance of 1 in M9 medium containing oleate (0.1%) and Triton X-100 (0.4%) or were grown to an absorbance of 1 on M9 medium containing glucose (0.5%, w/v) plus Triton X-100 or palmitate (0.1%, w/v) plus Triton X-100. Cells were separated from the growth medium by centrifugation at 2,300 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was acidified (pH 1–2) with 2 n H2SO4 and then extracted four times with 100 ml of ether each. The organic phase was extracted with aqueous sodium bicarbonate. After acidifying the aqueous phase with 2 n H2SO4, it was extracted three times with 8 ml of ether each. The combined ether extracts were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the residual material, after removal of drying agent by filtration and ether by evaporation under a stream of N2, was methylated by reacting it with 2 ml of BCl3-methanol (12%, w/w) for 10 min at 60 °C. After allowing the reaction mixture to cool down, 1 ml of H2O and 1 ml of hexane were added. The organic layer was carefully removed and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The residue after the removal of sodium sulfate and evaporation of ether was dissolved in a minimal volume of anhydrous ethanol. This fraction, which contained the methyl esters of fatty acids that were present in the growth medium, was analyzed by gas chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). For the purpose of identifying methyl 3,5-tetradecadienoate, a sample containing 20 nmol of 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA and 20 nmol of n-pentadecanoyl-CoA (internal standard) was hydrolyzed by reacting it with 4 n KOH at 25 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was acidified (pH 1–2) with 2 n H2SO4 and extracted three times with 8 ml of ether each. The extracted fatty acids were converted to their methyl esters as described above. Aliquots of 1 μl of the fatty acid methyl esters were injected at 250 °C into a GC/MS instrument (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) consisting of a gas chromatograph (model GC-17A) interphased with a mass spectrometer (QP5000) and equipped with a capillary column (30 m; inner diameter, 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm; EC-5; Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL). The oven temperature was raised from 100 to 230 °Cat5 °C/min, to 300 °C at 20 °C/min, and then held constant for 6 min. The mass spectrometer served as a detector and was operated at 280 °C. Purification and Analyses of Acyl-CoA Thioesters by HPLC—Acyl-CoA thioesters were purified, and metabolites were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Waters μBondapak C18 column (30 cm × 3.9 mm) attached to a Waters gradient HPLC system. The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 254 nm. Separation of substrates and metabolites was achieved by washing the μBondapak C18 column with 50 mm ammonium phosphate (pH 5.5) containing 40% acetonitrile/water (9:1, v/v) for 20 min and then eluting acyl-CoAs by linearly increasing the organic phase from 40 to 70% in 20 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. All samples were cleared of particulate matter by passing them through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane before they were injected into the HPLC system. Diluted samples were concentrated by passing them through Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and eluting them with small amounts of methanol, which subsequently were removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. Degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-Tetradecadienoyl-CoA by the E. coli Fatty Acid Oxidation Complex—2-trans,5-cis-Tetradecadienoyl-CoA (compound III in Scheme 1) 2Roman numerals refer to the structures of oleate metabolites shown in Scheme 1. is an intermediate of oleate β-oxidation, which can be metabolized either by continuing on its path through the β-oxidation cycle (Scheme 1, pathway A) or by isomerization to 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (XI) (see Scheme 1). The enzymes necessary for these two divergent metabolic processes are enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, and enoyl-CoA isomerase, all of which are associated with the E. coli fatty acid oxidation complex (FAO complex) that can be isolated and purified as an intact entity. The availability of this purified multienzyme complex provides the opportunity to study in vitro the entry of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA into the classical and alternative pathways of β-oxidation, because the key reactions of both pathways, the isomerization of the 2,5- to the 3,5-isomer (III to XI) and completion of the β-oxidation cycle (III to VI), are practically irreversible (4Ren Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Rates of the flux through the classical, isomerase-dependent pathway (III to X) were determined by incubating 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA with NAD+ and CoASH in the presence of purified FAO complex (13Yang S.-Y. Li J. He X.-Y. Cosloy S. Schulz H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2543-2548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and measuring the formation of NADH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Rates of the entry into the alternative pathway were obtained by measuring at 300 nm the formation of 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, which was generated from 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (XI) by added dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Since the conversion of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA to 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA is practically irreversible (4Ren Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the rate of this reaction is a measure of the flux through the alternate pathway. The results demonstrate that ∼90% of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was degraded via the classical pathway (Fig. 1, curve 1), whereas a small but significant amount (∼10%) of this intermediate was converted to 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA as measured by conversion to 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (Fig. 1, curve 2) and thereby diverted from the main pathway. The fraction of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA entering either of the two pathways was relatively constant over a wide concentration range of this compound. Hence, subsequent studies were carried out at a fixed concentration of 20 μm 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA.Fig. 1Rates of the metabolism of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA catalyzed by the purified FAO complex from E. coli. •, rates of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA degradation via the classical pathway as a function of the substrate concentration.

All rates are means of three or four measurements ± S.D. For experimental details see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The time course for the degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA by the FAO complex in the presence of NAD+ and CoASH was determined by analyzing and quantifying metabolites by HPLC. Since 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was coeluted with its 2,5-isomer, dienoyl-CoA isomerase was added to the incubation mixture to convert the 3,5-isomer to the 2,4-isomer, which is well separated from the starting material. Shown in Fig. 2 is the spectrum of metabolites that were formed during the first minute of the incubation period. All expected metabolites of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (see Scheme 1) were detected and identified by use of authentic compounds that were synthesized by chemical and enzymatic reactions. Changes of metabolite concentrations as a function of the incubation time are shown in Fig. 3A. The rapid hydration of the starting material, 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III), led to a built-up of 3-hydroxy-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA (IV), because the latter compound seemed to be more slowly dehydrogenated than formed. Since the product of the dehydrogenation, 3-keto-5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA (V), only accumulated to a limited extent (see Fig. 2), it seems that initially the dehydrogenation step limited the flux through the pathway. The subsequent build-up of 3-dodecenoyl-CoA (VI) at 1 min followed by a more pronounced accumulation of 2-dodecenoyl-CoA (VII) at 2 min suggests that a competition between these compounds for the hydratase/isomerase active site (20Yang S.-Y. He X.-Y. Schulz H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6441-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) may restrict the flux through the pathway during the later part of the incubation period. The time course for the degradation of 2-trans,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (III) by the FAO complex was quite different when dienoyl-CoA isomerase was omitted from the incubation mixture (see Fig. 3B). Most dramatic was the much slower progress of the degradation process as illustrated by the conversion of ∼10% of the starting material to decanoyl-CoA (X) during the first 5 min of the incubation, whereas close to 80% of the substrate was converted to decanoyl-CoA (X) during the same time period when dienoyl-CoA isomerase was present (Fig. 3, compare A and B). All metabolites were more slowly formed and degraded in the absence of dienoyl-CoA isomerase. This observation prompts the suggestion that 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA inhibits the FAO complex and hence may interfere with the efficient β-oxidation of oleic acid in intact E. coli cells unless this intermediate is further metabolized. Search for Dienoyl-CoA Isomerase in Extracts of E. coli Cells—An extract of soluble proteins from E. coli cells grown on oleate as the sole carbon source was assayed for dienoyl-CoA isomerase. As shown in Table I, no activity was detected in the extract prepared from cells that express the enzymes of β-oxidation at high levels. Dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity was also not observed in an extract of membrane-bound proteins that were solubilized with Triton X-100, Tween 40, Tween 80, or β-d-glucopyranoside. As expected, cell extracts prepared from glucose-grown cells also were devoid of dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity. The lower limit of detecting the activity of this enzyme in a soluble cell extract was 0.2 milliunits/mg of protein under conditions used in this study. Since the specific activities of other β-oxidation enzymes are 2–3 orders of magnitude higher (5Binstock J.F. Pramanik A. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Pawar S. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3894-3899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely that dienoyl-CoA isomerase is expressed in E. coli at a functional level. This conclusion raises the question of how 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA is metabolized in the absence of dienoyl-CoA isomerase. A clue to an answer was the observation that the apparent activity of mammalian dienoyl-CoA isomerase was lower than expected when it was added to the assay mixture 2 min after the addition of the E. coli cell extract (see Table I). Furthermore, the observed activity of dienoyl-CoA isomerase was lower as the amount of extract was increased (see Table I) or the preincubation time was extended (data not shown). Together, these observations prompted the idea that the substrate of dienoyl-CoA isomerase, 3,5-cis-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, was used up in another reaction catalyzed by the E. coli extract.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the strictly conserved Gly-194 at the N terminus of this α helix in Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I showed that flexibility around this glycine residue is required for DNA cleavage and relaxation activity and supports a functional role for this hinge region in the enzyme conformational change.

DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination (reviewed in Refs. 1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar, 3Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the interconversion of DNA topological isomers by first cleaving one or more DNA strands and then allowing another single- or double-stranded DNA strand to pass through the cleaved DNA. After religation of the cleaved DNA, the DNA involved in strand passage has to be released from the enzyme molecule. There are therefore multiple steps in catalysis that would require changes in enzyme conformations. Type IA DNA topoisomerases catalyze the topological conversions by breaking and rejoining a single strand of DNA with the cleaved DNA forming a 5′-phosphoryltyrosine linkage with the enzyme. The current models of catalysis for this class of DNA topoisomerases (4Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Keck J.L. Berger J.M. Nat.

However, the crystal structures of the enzymes in the absence of DNA (7Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 8Mondragón A. DiGate R.

A more recent crystal structure of Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase III with an 8-base-long single-stranded oligonucleotide bound at the active site showed that an α helix making contacts with the G strand DNA has shifted relative to its position in the structure of E. coli DNA topoisomerase III with no DNA bound (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Mondragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The corresponding α helix in E. coli DNA topoisomerase I begins at position 195 (Fig. 1). The glycine residue preceding the N terminus of this α helix (Gly-194) is strictly conserved among type IA DNA topoisomerases (11Caron P.R. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. DNA Topoisomerase Protocol: DNA Topology and Enzymes. Vol. 1. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 279-316Google Scholar). The side chains of residues equivalent to Arg-195 and Gln-197 of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I make contacts with the phosphate backbone in the topoisomerase III oligonucleotide crystal structure (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Mondragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the conformational flexibility around the Gly-194 of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I may be important for the movement of this α helix within the enzyme during catalysis so that the active-site tyrosine will be in a position to carry out nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate. This was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of Gly-194 and analysis of the purified mutant enzymes. The results demonstrate that the conformational flexibility around Gly-194 is critical for DNA cleavage to take place to lead to subsequent relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA. Enzymes—E. coli DNA topoisomerase I and its mutant derivatives were expressed and purified to >95% homogeneity as described previously (12Zhu C.-X. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. DNA Topoisomerase Protocols: DNA Topology and Enzymes. Vol. 1. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 145-151Google Scholar). Single amino acid replacements in the enzyme sequence were achieved using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit with Pfu DNA polymerase I (Stratagene) using plasmid pRV10 (13Wang J.C. Peck L.J. Becherer K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 47: 85-91Crossref Google Scholar) as a template. The sequence of the top-strand oligonucleotides (custom synthesized by Sigma-Genosys) used in the random replacement of Gly-194 was 5′-GGCCTGTCTGCCVNNCGTGTGCAGTCG-3′ (V = C + G + A). This sequence did not allow selection for early termination mutations at position 194 found to be favored in other random mutagenesis experiments of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I 1S. Gadgil and Y.-C. Tse-Dinh, unpublished results. but also excluded the replacement of Gly-194 by phenylalanine, cysteine, and tyrosine. Relaxation Activity Assay—Wild-type and mutant topoisomerases were diluted serially for a relaxation activity assay in a reaction volume of 20 μl with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml gelatin, 6 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μg of CsCl gradient-purified supercoiled plasmid DNA. For the relaxation assay of activity in total E. coli soluble lysates, 10 μg of yeast tRNA was also included to inhibit the nuclease activities in the lysates. The reaction was terminated after a 30-min incubation at 37 °C by the addition of 5 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, and 0.5% (v/v) bromphenol blue. The DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel with TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA). After staining with ethidium bromide, the gel was photographed over UV light. Cleavage of Single-stranded DNA—To prepare for a cleavage substrate with a strong topoisomerase I cleavage site (14Tse Y.-C. Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5560-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kirkegaard K. Pflugfelder G. Wang J.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), PCR was carried out with the forward primer (5′-CTCTGGCGGTGATAATGGTT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTCTTCCGCATAAACGCTT-3′) using phage λ DNA as the template and Taq DNA polymerase. The forward primer was labeled prior to the PCR reaction with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP so that the top strand of the 203-bp PCR product was labeled at the 5′-end. After electrophoresis in a 1.4% agarose gel, the PCR product was gel-purified using the GenElute spin column (Sigma). The eluted DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Prior to the reaction with topoisomerase, the DNA was denatured to single strands by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. After incubation with the wild-type or mutant topoisomerase at 37 °C for 30 min, trapping of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex and cleaved DNA was achieved by the addition of 0.1 m NaOH. After neutralization (14Tse Y.-C. Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5560-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the DNA was electrophoresed in an 8% sequencing gel followed by autoradiography of the dried gel to visualize the 5′-end-labeled DNA cleavage products. Gel Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A 39-base oligonucleotide 5′-GTTATGCAATGCGCTTTGGGCAAACCAAGAGAGCATAAC-3′ (PAGE purified from Sigma-Genosys) with a strong cleavage site for E. coli DNA topoisomerase I (14Tse Y.-C.

Biol. 1984; 49: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12% glycerol, 1 pmol of the labeled 39-mer, and 0.5–4 pmol (48–388 ng) of wild-type or mutant topoisomerase I were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The formation of the gel electrophoretic mobility shift complex was measured by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel with an electrophoresis buffer of 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA as described (16Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. BMC Biochemistry. 2002; 3: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and quantitated with the PhosphorImager Storm 760. Oligonucleotide Cleavage Assay—Wild-type and mutant enzymes were incubated with the 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide used in the gel shift assay (5 pmol in 30 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) at 37 °C. At different time points, 3-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed and mixed with an equal volume of stop solution (79% formamide, 0.2 m NaOH, 0.04% bromphenol blue). The samples were heated at 80 °C for 5 min before electrophoresis in a 15% sequencing gel. The fraction of oligonucleotide cleaved by the enzyme (following CAAT↓ in the oligonucleotide sequence) was determined by quantitative analysis with the PhosphorImager Storm 760. Nuclease P1 and DNase I Digestion—Conditions were modified from those described previously (17Zhang H.L. Malpure S. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23700-23705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For nuclease P1 digestion, the 5′-end-labeled 39-base oligonucleotide (0.2 pmol) was incubated with increasing amounts of wild-type and mutant topoisomerase I in 5 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumen, 1 mm magnesium chloride for 4 min at 37 °C. Nuclease P1 (100 ng from Roche Applied Science) was added, and incubation was continued for 2 min before the addition of EDTA to 10 mm and an equal volume of 90% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue. After heating at 95 °C for 5 min, the reaction products were electrophoresed in a 15% sequencing gel and visualized with the PhosphorImager Storm 760. The same procedures were used for DNase I digestion except that 0.2 pmol of a 59-base-long oligonucleotide with the same preferred topoisomerase I cleavage site near the junction of the single- and self-complementary double-stranded regions (5′-GCCCTGAAAGATTATGCAAT↓GCGCTTTGGGCAAACCAAGAGAGCATAATCTTTCAGGGC-3′) labeled at the 5′-end was used as the substrate with 50 ng of DNase I added to each reaction. Limited Proteolytic Digestion—Limited digestion of wild-type and mutant topoisomerase I enzymes was carried out with 5 μg of protein in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol using sequencing grade Glu-C endoproteinases (Roche Applied Science) at 1:100 w/w ratio at 37 °C for the indicated lengths of time. The digestion was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× gel loading buffer for SDS gel and immersion in boiling water for 5 min. The digestion mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed with the CARY Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation and 295 nm at room temperature (∼25 °C). The spectral bandwidths were 5 and 10 nm, respectively, for excitation and emission. The wild-type and mutant topoisomerase I were present at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl. Substitution at Gly-194 in the Potential Hinge Region Resulted in Loss of Relaxation and DNA Cleavage Activities— Random substitutions were generated for Gly-194 by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis, and six different substitution mutants for Gly-194 were identified by DNA sequencing of the individual plasmid pRV10 DNA isolates (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis of the expression level of the mutated topoisomerase in the total protein lysates of E. coli GP200 (ΔtopA) cells expressing these mutant topoisomerases showed that all six mutant topoisomerases were accumulated in the soluble extracts at levels comparable with wild-type topoisomerase I (Fig. 2a), so the mutations at Gly-194 did not appear to have resulted in insoluble or unstable topoisomerase I proteins. When assayed with negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA, no relaxation activity was detectable in the total lysates of E. coli GP200 (ΔtopA) cells expressing these six mutant topoisomerases (Fig. 2b). Relaxation activity was readily detectable for the GP200 lysate expressing the wild-type topoisomerase I even after a 10-fold dilution of the lysate. The G194R and G194A mutant enzymes expressed in GP200 were purified to >95% homogeneity with procedures similar to those used for the wild-type topoisomerase I and assayed for relaxation activity (Fig. 3). The G194R mutant topoisomerase I had no detectable relaxation activity, whereas the G194A mutant enzyme had an ∼40-fold reduction in activity when compared with the wild-type topoisomerase I.Fig. 3Relaxation activity of purified G194R and G194A mutant topoisomerases.

This single-stranded DNA has a preferred topoisomerase I cleavage site identified previously (14Tse Y.-C. Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5560-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kirkegaard K. Pflugfelder G. Wang J.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interaction with up to 480 ng of the G194R and G194A mutants did not yield any detectable cleavage product (Fig. 4). The cleavage product from 7.5 ng of wild-type topoisomerase I was visible, so the cleavage activity of the mutants was reduced >50-fold. The rate of DNA cleavage activity was also assayed with a 39-base-long oligonucleotide containing the same strong topoisomerase I cleavage site found in the λ DNA sequence. The G194R mutant again had no detectable cleavage activity with this substrate (data not shown), whereas the cleavage rate of the G194A mutant topoisomerase I was found to be >100-fold less than that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5). The Non-covalent Interaction with DNA Is Only Moderately Decreased by the Gly-194 Mutations—The non-covalent binding of wild-type and mutant topoisomerases to the 5′-end-labeled 39-base oligonucleotide substrate was compared using the gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 6). Up to 4 pmol of enzyme was added to the oligonucleotide. A higher amount of enzyme was not used to limit the formation of the covalent cleavage product from the wild-type topoisomerase I. The amount of non-covalent complex formed by the G194R mutant enzyme was only slightly reduced when compared with the wild-type topoisomerase I. The G194A mutant enzyme had a greater reduction in the amount of non-covalent complex formed (∼20% of wild-type) even though it was more active than the G194R mutant enzyme in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA. Nevertheless, non-covalent DNA binding did not appear to be as significantly affected by the G194A mutation as the DNA cleavage step. The non-covalent complexes formed between wild-type and mutant topoisomerase I with the 39-base oligonucleotide were further compared using nuclease P1 digestion. In the presence of Mg2+, required for nuclease P1 activity, additional minor cleavage sites appeared for the wild-type topoisomerase I, but the major cleavage site (marked with an arrow in Fig. 7) was the same as the unique cleavage site seen in the absence of Mg2+. In agreement with the results from the gel mobility shift assay, protection of the oligonucleotide from nuclease P1 digestion by the mutant topoisomerases could be observed, although severalfold higher concentrations of the G194R and G194A mutant topoisomerases were required to observe comparable protection of the DNA around the major cleavage site from nuclease P1 digestion (Fig. 7). There was a difference in the nuclease P1 digestion patterns in the presence of the mutant topoisomerase I when compared with the wild-type topoisomerase. Digestion by nuclease P1 at the site marked with an asterisk in Fig. 7 was enhanced upon binding of the G194R and G194A mutant enzymes but not from the binding of the wild-type topoisomerase. Cleavage at this site remained high, whereas other nuclease P1 sites were protected by the binding of the mutant enzymes. The ability of the G194R and G194A mutant enzymes to bind to the DNA substrate was also compared with DNase I protection using a 59-base oligonucleotide that can form a self-complementary double-stranded region. The preferred topoisomerase I cleavage site on this substrate is near the junction of the single- and double-stranded region as described previously (15Kirkegaard K. Pflugfelder G. Wang J.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protection from DNase I digestion by the wild-type and Gly-194 mutant enzymes was very similar indicating that the mutant enzymes could bind to the region around the preferred topoisomerase I cleavage site (Fig. 8). Again there was little or no DNA cleavage observed for the Gly-194 mutant topoisomerases showing that the step affected by the loss of Gly-194 is between the transition from the non-covalent to the covalent enzyme-DNA complexes. Comparison of the G194R and G194A Mutants by Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis with Glu-C endoproteinase was carried out with wild-type topoisomerase I and these two mutants to determine whether a drastic change in protein folding might account for the reduction in DNA cleavage activity observed. The proteolysis rate and pattern of the G194A mutant were very similar to those of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 9) indicating that this mutation had a very limited effect on the overall folded structure of this mutant protein, despite the reduction in non-covalent interaction with the oligonucleotide substrate. The G194R mutant was digested at a faster rate by Glu-C than the wild-type topoisomerase I, and there were some differences in the pattern of proteolytic products generated. Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence—Intrinsic fluorescence from the tryptophan residues in the topoisomerase I molecule was measured to further assess the change in enzyme folding conformation attributable to the Gly-194 mutation. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the wild-type topoisomerase I and the G194A and G194R mutants were found to be very similar (Fig. 10a) suggesting that these mutations did not drastically alter the environments of the 10 tryptophan residues in the enzyme. The decrease in intrinsic fluorescence from the G194R mutation was greater than that of the G194A mutation, which is in agreement with the results of the limited proteolysis by Glu-C. The more bulky substitution with arginine probably had a greater effect on the folding of the enzyme than the alanine substitution. When the wild-type topoisomerase I was titrated with negatively supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA, a significant increase in the intrinsic protein fluorescence was observed (Fig. 10b). A fluorescence emission increase of 34% was achieved with 1 nm pBR322 DNA. Higher concentrations of DNA resulted in up to 44% increase in fluorescence emission (Fig. 10f). With the G194R mutant, no fluorescence emission increase could be observed upon an addition of up to 5 nm pBR322 DNA (Fig. 10, d and f). For the G194A mutant, a small (<10%) increase of fluorescence emission upon the addition of DNA could sometimes be observed in an individual experiment (Fig. 10c), but a consistent increase in fluorescence could not be found when the data from three individual experiments were analyzed for concentrations of pBR322 DNA up to 5 nm (Fig. 10f). To demonstrate that the change in fluorescence observed for the wild-type topoisomerase I precedes the DNA cleavage step, the topoisomerase I mutant with the active-site tyrosine mutated to phenylalanine was also analyzed. Its intrinsic fluorescence was found to be similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 10a). Upon the addition of pBR322 DNA, there was also an increase in intrinsic fluorescence emission at about half of the magnitude observed for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 10, e and f). Therefore this active site mutant upon binding to supercoiled DNA could also undergo a conformational change leading to the increase in fluorescence even though it cannot form the covalent complex with DNA. In contrast, the G194R and G194A mutants were found to be defective for this conformational change. A number of conserved amino acids around the active site of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I have been shown by site-directed mutagenesis studies (18Zhu C.-X. Roche C.J. Papanicolaou N. Dipietrantonio A. Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Chen S.-J. Wang J.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13237-13245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to be involved in the DNA cleavage step of catalysis by the enzyme. The proposed roles for these conserved amino acids during DNA cleavage include binding of the scissile phosphate, stabilization of the transition state, and leaving group during nucleophilic attack by the active-site tyrosine. These are directly related to the chemical functions present on the side chains of these residues. However, other amino acids in the enzyme at a greater distance from the active-site tyrosine are likely to be required for the conformational changes involved in catalysis instead of direct chemical involvement in the DNA cleavage and religation. These residues that are important for enzyme conformational changes instead of the chemical steps in the enzyme mechanism remain to be identified. Based on the crystal structure of E. coli topoisomerase III complexed to single-stranded oligonucleotide, the movement of an α helix was proposed to be important for the positioning of the scissile phosphate at the active site of type IA DNA topoisomerases (10Changela A. DiGate R.J. Mondragón A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized here that the flexibility of the conserved Gly-194 residue at the N terminus of this α helix in E. coli topoisomerase I is important for its function as a hinge for this movement. To assess the importance of the hypothesized hinge function, the Gly-194 of E. coli topoisomerase I was mutated to six other amino acids. All six substitutions were found to result in a significant loss of enzyme relaxation activity. Detailed analysis of the purified G194A and G194R mutants showed that the reduction of relaxation activity was ∼40-fold for the alanine-substituted mutant, whereas no relaxation activity was retained for the more bulky arginine substitution. The loss of relaxation activity resulted primarily from the >100-fold reduction in DNA cleavage activity. The decrease in overall non-covalent complex formation due to the mutations was relatively minor as the mutant enzymes could still form a gel mobility shift complex with the oligonucleotide substrate and protect the bound DNA from P1 nuclease and DNase I digestions. There was some difference in protein folding between the wild-type enzyme and the G194R mutant with the glycine substituted by the more bulky arginine, but the more conservative G194A mutation appeared to have little effect on the enzyme structure in the absence of DNA, as assessed by limited proteolysis and intrinsic fluorescence measurement. A comparison of the response of the intrinsic fluorescence upon the addition of negatively supercoiled DNA showed that the wild-type topoisomerase underwent a conformational change affecting the environment of the tryptophan residues. A similar increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence was also observed for the active-site Y319F mutant topoisomerase I demonstrating that the conformational change leading to the fluorescence increase preceded the formation of the cleaved covalent complex. This increase in intrinsic fluorescence was not detected with the Gly-194 mutant topoisomerases, in agreement with the Gly-194 residue being responsible for a conformational change that takes place after an initial non-covalent binding to DNA and before DNA cleavage takes place. Therefore, in the non-covalent complex formed by the G194R and G194A mutants, the DNA substrate was likely not positioned correctly for nucleophilic attack to take place on the scissile phosphate by the active-site tyrosine. The sensitivity of enzyme cleavage and relaxation activity to substitution at Gly-194 supports the importance of this residue in the overall topoisomerase I mechanism. There are many known examples of critical glycine residues acting as hinges in the enzyme conformational change required for catalysis (21Zhao G.-P. Somerville R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14921-14931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rafferty J.A. Wibley J.E. Speers P. Hickson I. Margison G.P. Moody P.C. Douglas K.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 2001; 135: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, a glycine to arginine mutation in the hinge region of E. coli tryptophan synthase also blocked the conformational switching (21Zhao G.-P. Somerville R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14921-14931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A glycine to tryptophan mutation was used to demonstrate the role of the glycine in the conformational change of human O-6-alkylguanine DNA-alkyltransferase upon DNA binding (22Rafferty J.A. Wibley J.E. Speers P. Hickson I. Margison G.P. Moody P.C. Douglas K.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Even though the Gly-194 of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I is located at a considerable distance from the active-site tyrosine, its substitution by another amino acid could still affect the DNA cleavage step drastically. It is likely to be required for shifting the α helix containing Arg-195 and Gln-197 in place to interact with the DNA substrate specifically so that the scissile phosphate could be properly aligned for nucleophilic attack by Tyr-319. The Gly-132 of vaccinia DNA topoisomerase I located at an interdomain hinge is invariant among type IB DNA topoisomerases (25Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis results obtained previously (25Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggested that this glycine residue in vaccinia DNA topoisomerase I is required for a precleavage activation step. This is similar to the role proposed for the Gly-194 of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I in this study. This conformational change involving Gly-194 as the hinge is only one of the conformational changes likely to be required for a complete cycle of linking number change catalyzed by E. coli DNA topoisomerase I. After DNA cleavage takes place, the spacing between the 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the cleaved DNA must be increased to allow DNA strand passage, and then the spacing had to be decreased again to allow DNA religation to take place. The mechanisms of these conformational changes remain to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2038713851,"Using transposon shuttle mutagenesis, we identified six Helicobacter pylori mutants from the NTUH-C1 strain that exhibited decreased adherence and cell elongation. Inverse polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing revealed that the same locus was interrupted in these six mutants. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed no homologies with H. pylori 26695 and J99 strains. This novel open reading frame contained 1617 base pairs. The amino acid sequence shared 24% identity with a putative nicking enzyme in Bacillus halodurans and 23 and 20% identity with type IIS restriction endonucleases PleI and MlyI, respectively. The purified protein, HpyC1I, showed endonuclease activity with the recognition and cleavage site 5′-CCATC(4/5)-3′. Two open reading frames were located upstream of the gene encoding HpyC1I. Together, HpyC1I and these two putative methyltransferases (M1.HpyC1I and M2.HpyC1I) function as a restriction-modification (R-M) system. The HpyC1I R-M genes were found in 9 of the 15 H. pylori strains tested. When compared with the full genome, significantly lower G + C content of HpyC1I R-M genes implied that these genes might have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Plasmid DNA transformation efficiencies and chromosomal DNA digestion assays demonstrated protection from HpyC1I digestion by the R-M system. In conclusion, we have identified a novel R-M system present in ∼60% of H. pylori strains. Disruption of this R-M system results in cell elongation and susceptibility to HpyC1I digestion.

Helicobacter pylori, a spiral, Gram-negative bacteria, was first isolated in 1982 (1Marshall B.J. Warren J.R. Lancet. 1984; 1: 1311-1315Abstract PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar). It is an important human pathogen, responsible for type B gastritis and peptic ulcer and for increasing the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the stomach in humans (2Nomura A.

Bacterial adhesins bind to specific host cell macromolecule receptors, resulting in tropism. Adherence to gastric mucosa may be advantageous to H. pylori by protecting against mucosal shedding into the gastric lumen. The most well defined H. pylori adhesin-receptor interaction to date is that between the Lewis b (Leb) 1The abbreviations used are: Leb, Lewis b; sLex, sialylated Lewis x; R-M, restriction-modification; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used are: Leb, Lewis b; sLex, sialylated Lewis x; R-M, restriction-modification; ORF, open reading frame. blood group antigen-binding adhesin, BabA, and the H, Leb, and related ABO antigens (6Boren T. Falk P. Roth K.A. Larson G. Normark S. Science. 1993; 262: 1892-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 7Ilver D. Arnqvist A. Ogren J. Frick I.M. Kersulyte D. Incecik E.T. Berg D.E. Covacci A. Engstrand L. Boren T. Science. 1998; 279: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Further, it has been suggested that the interaction between H. pylori adhesin, SabA, and cellular receptor, sialylated Lewis x (sLex), promoted persistent infection (8Mahdavi J. Sonden B. Hurtig M. Olfat F.O. Forsberg L. Roche N. Angstrom J. Larsson T. Teneberg S. Karlsson K.A. Altraja S. Wadstrom T. Kersulyte D. Berg D.E. Dubois A. Petersson C. Magnusson K.E. Norberg T. Lindh F. Lundskog B.B. Arnqvist A. Hammarstrom L. Boren T. Science. 2002; 297: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). However, Leb antigens are only abundant among individuals with the O blood type. Seroepidemiology studies revealed that infection rates are the same in patients with different blood types (9Lin J.T. Wang J.T. Wang T.H. Wu M.S. Lee T.K. Chen C.J. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1993; 28: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and some clinical H. pylori strains did not bind either Leb or sLex antigens (8Mahdavi J. Sonden B. Hurtig M. Olfat F.O. Forsberg L. Roche N. Angstrom J. Larsson T. Teneberg S. Karlsson K.A. Altraja S. Wadstrom T. Kersulyte D. Berg D.E. Dubois A. Petersson C. Magnusson K.E. Norberg T. Lindh F. Lundskog B.B. Arnqvist A. Hammarstrom L. Boren T. Science. 2002; 297: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used an H. pylori mutant library to identify genes involved in cell adhesion. After initial screening, we isolated mutants with decreased adherence. These mutants appeared elongated on Gram stain when compared with wild type controls. However, further characterization revealed that the interrupted operon was a novel restriction-modification (R-M) system in H. pylori. R-M systems in bacteria protect against invasion of foreign DNA (10Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The restriction endonuclease recognizes a specific sequence, and the cognate methyltransferase modifies the same sequence to differentiate self-DNA from foreign DNA (10Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Thousands of restriction enzymes have been purified and characterized. Restriction enzymes are traditionally divided into three types according to subunit composition, cleavage site, sequence specificity, and cofactor requirements (10Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Type II R-M systems, consisting of a restriction endonuclease and a paired methylase, are the most well known and have great practical value (10Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarities, there are more than 20 putative R-M systems in H. pylori 26695 strain. A previous study showed 14 Type II R-M systems with biochemical activity in H. pylori 26695 strain (11Lin L.F. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Kong H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Comparing the complete sequences of 26695 and J99 strains, the R-M systems of these two strains are diverse. The difference of R-M systems results in the barrier of interstrain plasmid DNA transfer (12Ando T. Xu Q. Torres M. Kusugami K. Israel D.A. Blaser M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1052-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and chromosomal DNA transformation (13Aras R.A. Small A.J. Ando T. Blaser M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5391-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but the biological significance of so many R-M systems in H. pylori is still unclear. Bacteria Strains and Culture Condition—Clinical isolates were obtained at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) as previously described (14Hsieh P.F. Yang J.C. Lin J.T. Wang J.T. J. Formos. Med. Assoc. 1998; 97: 445-452PubMed Google Scholar). H. pylori strains were grown on Columbia blood agar plates containing 5% sheep blood and chloramphenicol (4 μg/ml) or kanamycin (10 μg/ml) and incubated for 2–3 days in microaerophilic conditions (5% O2, 10% CO2, 85% N2) at 37 °C. For bacterial growth curve examination, H. pylori were grown in the Brucella broth containing 5% fetal calf serum. Cell Adherence Assay—SC-M1, a cell line established from primary human gastric cancer tissue (15Jiang S.Y. Shyu R.Y. Chen H.Y. Lee M.M. Wu K.L. Yeh M.Y. Oncology. 1996; 53: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), was used in this study. This cell line was proved to be Leb-negative and sLex-positive by monoclonal antibodies against Leb (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) and sLex (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), respectively. The cells were grown in a 24-well culture plate (RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% CO2, 37 °C) and infected with H. pylori (multiplicity of infection = 1:100). After a 30-min co-cultivation at 37 °C, nonadherent bacteria were removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline buffer. SC-M1 cells with adherent H. pylori were trypsinized, serially diluted in normal saline, and spread on the Columbia blood agar plates. Recovered adherent bacterial colonies were counted. Wild type H. pylori NTUH-C1 strain served as a positive control, and each mutant strain was compared with the wild type strain. Observation of Bacterial Morphology—The morphologies of H. pylori wild type and mutant strains were observed under a light microscope after Gram stain and captured by CoolSnap-pro software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). More than 10 fields were examined on each slide, and the lengths of bacteria were measured in 30 bacteria of 5–10 different fields by CoolSnap-pro software (Media Cybernetics). Inverse PCR and DNA Sequencing—To identify genetic loci interrupted by the transposon, genomic DNA of mutant strains were extracted and subjected to inverse PCR and DNA sequencing as previously described (16Chang K.C. Yeh Y.C. Lin T.L. Wang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Reknockout of hpyC1IR—Intragenic sequences of hpyC1IR (nucleotides 580–985) were cloned into a TA vector, pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI). A cat gene (17Wang Y. Roos K.P. Taylor D.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2485-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was ligated into the SalI site of pGEM-T easy/hpyC1IR (nucleotides 580–985). The plasmid was transformed into the wild type NTUH-C1 strain to generate the hpyC1IR reknockout mutant by integration. Complementation of hpyC1IR—The upstream 198 base pair and hpyC1IR coding sequence was cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega). A cat gene was ligated into the SalI site of pGEM-T easy/hpyC1IR (nucleotides –198 to 1617). The plasmid was transformed into a hpyC1IR mutant strain to generate the hpyC1IR complementation strain by chromosomal integration. The gene alignment of the hpyC1IR complementation strain was confirmed by PCR using different combinations of primers. Constructions of hpyC1IM1 and hpyC1IM2 Mutants—The gene encoding M1.HpyC1I was amplified from genomic DNA of wild type NTUH-C1 strain by PCR and then cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega). MA-26R (5′-CGCTTTAAAATCAGCGTCTTGCC-3′) and MA-27F (5′-CTTGAAGAACTGAAAGAATAC-3′) primers were used for perform inverse PCR with Pfu polymerase and then phosphorylated by a polynucleotide kinase. A blunt-end cat gene was ligated to the inverse PCR product to generate the hpyC1IM1 disrupted plasmid. This plasmid was then transformed into wild type to generate the hpyC1IM1 knockout mutants such that the insertion site of the cat gene is at nucleotide 26. Transposon shuttle mutagenesis was adopted for generating hpyC1IM2 knockout mutants as previously described (16Chang K.C. Yeh Y.C. Lin T.L. Wang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transformation—Plasmid pHel2 (Camr) purified from Escherichia coli strain JM109 was transformed into the wild type H. pylori NTUH-C1 strain and hpyC1IM2 and hpyC1IR knockout mutant strains by electroporation. Plasmid pHel3 (Kanr) purified from E. coli strain ET12567 was also transformed into wild type and hpyC1IM1 knockout mutant by electroporation. (Plasmids pHel2 and pHel3 were gifts from Dr. R. Haas (Max-Planck-Institute für Biologie, Tübingen, Germany) (18Heuermann D. Haas R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).) H. pylori were washed twice with electroporation buffer (9% sucrose and 15% glycerol) prior to transformation. Electroporation was performed with 1 × 109 colony-forming unit H. pylori and 1 μg of plasmid DNA as previously described (16Chang K.C. Yeh Y.C. Lin T.L. Wang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following overnight recovery, the bacteria were selected on a Columbia blood agar plate containing 10 μg/ml kanamycin and 4 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and the colony-forming units were counted. This experiment was repeated three times. On the other hand, the pHel3 and pHel2 were purified from hpyC1IM1 and hpyC1IM2 mutants, respectively, and then transformed into wild type, hpyC1IM1 mutant, and hpyC1IM2 mutant by natural transformation. Natural transformation was performed with 5 × 109 colony-forming unit H. pylori and 1 μg of plasmid DNA as previously described (16Chang K.C. Yeh Y.C. Lin T.L. Wang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of HpyC1I Protein—The gene encoding HpyC1I was amplified from DNA of wild type NTUH-C1 strain by PCR and cloned into a TA vector, pGEM-T easy (Promega). The pGEM-T easy/hpyC1IR was digested by NotI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and ligated in frame into pET28c plasmid (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). The resulting pET28c/hpyC1IR plasmid was transformed into an E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The HpyC1I protein was expressed and purified per the manufacturer's instruction under 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction at 25 °C (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Recognition and Cleavage Site of HpyC1I—To determine the recognition and cleavage site of HpyC1I, cloning and sequencing of the HpyC1I digestion products from bacteriophage λ DNA (New England Biolabs) were performed (19Skowron P.M. Majewski J. Zylicz-Stachula A. Rutkowska S.M. Jaworowska I. Harasimowicz-Slowinska R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The HpyC1I-digested fragments were blunted by T4 DNA polymerase and cloned into the EcoRV (New England Biolabs) site of pBR322 plasmid. Because the EcoRV site of pBR322 is in the tetracycline resistance gene, the Ampr, Tcs transformants were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from Ampr, Tcs colonies, and the restriction fragment-vector junctions were sequenced. Diversity of HpyC1I R-M System among H. pylori Strains—Genomic DNAs of 15 randomly selected H. pylori strains, including four ATCC strains and 11 clinical isolates were extracted. To examine the modification of CCATC sequences, the DNAs were digested with purified HpyC1I protein. To determine the presence of the HpyC1I R-M system, hpyC1IM1-F (5′-TTATGGGGCAAGACGCTGAT-3′) and hpyC1IR-R (5′-TTAAGCTTTCAAATGGTCATTGATCTG-3′) primers corresponding to the 5′-end of hpyC1IM1 and 3′-end of hpyC1IR, respectively, were used for PCR. To characterize the location of the HpyC1I R-M system, HP1498-F (5′-TCACGGCTGTTTATGTGG-3′) and HP1501-R (5′-CCTTACGCCGTCAGTATTC-3′) primers derived from the conserved region were used for PCR. RNA Expression Profiles of Wild Type and hpyC1IR Mutant—RNAs from wild type NTUH-C1 strain and hpyC1IR mutant strain were extracted, and microarray hybridization was performed as previously described (20Ang S. Lee C.Z. Peck K. Sindici M. Matrubutham U. Gleeson M.A. Wang J.T. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1679-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The density of each microarray signal was standardized with the internal control, 23 S rRNA. The up-regulated and down-regulated genes were so defined when the variations of standardized expression levels were greater than twice the S.D. Screening the Mutant Library by Adherence Assay—A total of 1500 H. pylori mutant strains were obtained from a clinical isolate NTUH-C1 by transposon shuttle mutagenesis (16Chang K.C. Yeh Y.C. Lin T.L. Wang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Diversity of these mutants has been confirmed by restriction pattern and random sequencing (16Chang K.C. Yeh Y.C. Lin T.L. Wang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To identify genes involved in adhesion, we screened each mutant strain by a 24-well culture plate in duplicate. Six mutant strains revealed a 5–10-fold decrease of the recovered adherent bacteria counts compared with wild type strain after a 30-min incubation with the SC-M1 cells (Fig. 1). Observation with Light and Electron Microscopy—To ensure the basic bacterial morphology integrity, we observed these mutant strains with decreased adherent ability under light microscopy. Light microscopic observation revealed an elongated morphology (Fig. 2). The length of wild type strain was 4.3 ± 0.82 μm, and that of the mutants was 8.7 ± 1.50 μm (mean ± S.D.). The elongated phenotype was also observed by electron microscopy (data not shown). Therefore, the decreased adherent ability might be caused by aberrant morphology or other indirect effects. Identifying the Interrupted Gene by Inverse PCR and Sequencing—By inverse PCR and sequencing, the mini-TnKm insertion site for each of the mutants was determined and compared with the NCBI BLAST data bases (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) as well as the H. pylori genome data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org). The same locus in these six mutant strains was interrupted by the mini-TnKm. The transposon insertion site of these six mutants was at nucleotide 773 of this locus. Because initial characterizations were the same in these six mutants, mutant 6 (Fig. 1) was selected for subsequent studies. This open reading frame (ORF) contained 1617 base pairs but did not have any homologies with the published sequences of H. pylori 26695 and J99 strains (21Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R.

Nature. 1999; 397: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). The nucleotide and protein sequences were compared with NCBI BLAST data bases. The nucleotide sequences only shared short partial sequences with J166 strain-specific C8 sequences (23Akopyants N.S. Fradkov A. Diatchenko L. Hill J.E. Siebert P.D. Lukyanov S.A. Sverdlov E.D. Berg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13108-13113Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences have 24% identity with a putative nicking enzyme in Bacillus halodurans, and 23 and 20% identity with two Type IIS restriction endonucleases PleI and MlyI, respectively. There were two ORFs located upstream of this locus. Both of the upstream ORFs contained a methyltransferase domain. Based on protein function predictions and gene alignments, we proposed that these three ORFs formed an operon and functioned as a R-M system (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number AB118944). This 3.3-kb fragment was absent in both 26695 and J99 strains. This DNA fragment was located between HP1498 and HP1501 of H. pylori 26695 strain and between jhp1391 and jhp1394 of J99 strain(Fig. 3). The G + C content of the 3299-bp R-M genes in NTUH-C1 strain was 30.7%. The G + C contents of HP1499-HP1500 and jhp1392-jhp1393 (the replaced regions in 26695 and J99 strains) were 32.1 and 31.1%, respectively. In contrast, the G + C content of conserved flanking regions including HP1498 and HP1501 was 37.2%, which matches the average G + C content in 26695 and J99 strains (37.3%). The significantly lower G + C content of this R-M system implied that this R-M system might have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Reknockout and Complementation of hpyC1IR—Because the transposon insertion site of these six mutants was same, we reknocked out hpyC1IR in a fresh wild type NTUH-C1 strain with a cat cassette inserted at a different site. The morphology of hpyC1IR reknockout mutant was also elongated to a same degree as mutant 6 (Fig. 2). Other phenotypic characteristics and assays of the reknockout mutant were the same as those of the original mutants. The hpyC1IR complementation strain restored the same morphology and adherence as wild type (Figs. 2 and 4). Transformation Frequency in Mutants—R-M system differences in H. pylori are a barrier to interstrain plasmid transfer (12Ando T. Xu Q. Torres M. Kusugami K. Israel D.A. Blaser M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1052-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We purified pHel2 and pHel3 from E. coli and transformed wild type and R-M knockout mutants. Plasmid pHel2 (Camr) from E. coli strain JM109 was introduced into wild type NTUH-C1 strain, and hpyC1IM2 and hpyC1IR knockout mutant strains by electroporation. Plasmid pHel3 (Kanr) from E. coli strain ET12567 was introduced into wild type NTUH-C1 strain and hpyC1IM1 knockout mutant strain. By transforming plasmids from unrelated hosts, the transformation efficiencies of hpyC1IM1 (1.3 × 10–5), hpyC1IM2 (3.2 × 10–6), and hpyC1IR (2.7 × 10–6) mutants were significantly higher than those of wild type (8.4 × 10–8, 1.0 × 10–9). The transformation efficiencies of R-M knockout mutants are 100–1000-fold higher than H. pylori wild-type strain (Table I). On the other hand, the pHel3 and pHel2 were purified from hpyC1IM1 and hpyC1IM2 mutants, respectively, and transformed wild type, and hpyC1IM1 and hpyC1IM2 mutants. The transformations into wild type (2.0 × 10–9, 3.3 × 10–7) were more difficult than back to the hpyC1IM1 (1.2 × 10–5) or the hpyC1IM2 (1.4 × 10–5) mutants. The transformation efficiency of wild type was 100–10,000-fold lower than hpyC1IM1 and hpyC1IM2 mutants (Table I, bottom). Because the HpyC1I R-M system was an operon, there was no endonuclease activity in these mutants. Therefore, plasmids isolated from either unrelated hosts or methylase mutants were easily transformed into the R-M mutants.Table IDNA transformation efficiency of hpyC1IM1, hpyC1IM2, and hpyC1IR mutantsShuttle plasmidH. pylori strainTransformation efficiencyaMeans of three experiments.pHel2 (from E. coli strain JM109)NTUH-C1 wild type8.4 × 10-8hpyC1IM2 mutant (M1+M2-R-)3.2 × 10-6pHel3 (from E. coli strain ET12567)hpyC1IR mutant (M1+M2+R-)2.7 × 10-6NTUH-C1 wild type1.0 × 10-9hpyC1IM1 mutant (M1-M2-R-)1.3 × 10-5PlasmidH. pylori strainTransformation efficiencybMeans of two experiments.pHel3 (from hpyC1IM1 mutant (M1-M2-R-))NTUH-C1 wild type2.0 × 10-9hpyC1IM1 mutant1.2 × 10-5pHel2 (from hpyC1IM2 mutant (M1+M2-R-))NTUH-C1 wild type3.3 × 10-7hpyC1IM2 mutant1.4 × 10-5a Means of three experiments.b Means of two experiments. Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Novel Restriction Endonuclease—Based on earlier crystal structures, all Type II and Type IIS restriction endonucleases have a structurally similar catalytic core that spatially brings together three essential charged residues, typically two acidic residues (Asp or Glu) and one lysine residue (Lys), forming a P(D/E)Xn(D/E)XK motif (24Kovall R.A. Matthews B.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence analysis of this novel restriction endonuclease, HpyC1I, showed such a PD-DTK motif (Pro435, Asp436, Asp441, Thr442, Lys443) in the carboxyl terminus. HpyC1I shared amino acid similarities with a putative nicking enzyme in B. halodurans and Type IIS restriction endonucleases, PleI and MlyI. Because the putative nicking enzyme of B. halodurans was not yet characterized in detail (25Roberts R.J. Vincze T. Posfai J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), PleI and MlyI were chosen to digest the chromosomal DNA of wild type NTUH-C1 strain. DNA from wild type NTUH-C1 strain was digested by both PleI and MlyI. These results indicated that the PleI and MlyI R-M system were both absent in H. pylori NTUH-C1 strain. To assay its activity, HpyC1I was expressed in E. coli. His tag fusion protein was generated by using pET28c plasmid and was purified by Ni2+-NTA agarose. The endonuclease activity of purified protein was detected by cleavage of λ DNA. The optimal reaction conditions were under 1× NEB buffer 1 (10 mm Bis-Tris propane-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0) supplemented with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated at 37 °C. About 60 ng of purified protein (0.1 μl) could digest 1 μg of λ DNA in 1 h at 37 °C. The Recognition and Cleavage Site of HpyC1I—To determine the recognition and cleavage site of HpyC1I, λ phage DNA was digested with HpyC1I and then blunted by T4 DNA polymerase (19Skowron P.M. Majewski J. Zylicz-Stachula A. Rutkowska S.M. Jaworowska I. Harasimowicz-Slowinska R.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The HpyC1I restriction fragments were cloned into a pBR322 plasmid and then sequenced. Comparisons of the 10 junction sequences indicated that HpyC1I was a Type IIS restriction endonuclease, because a putative nonpalindromic recognition sequence was identified in the cloned inserts at a constant distance from the junction (Table II). The enzyme recognized a 5-bp asymmetric sequence CCATC and cleaved DNA downstream, after nucleotides 4 and 5 in the top and the bottom strand, respectively. The double strand cleavage of HpyC1I produces a one-base 5′-protruding end. REBASE searches (available on the World Wide Web at rebase.neb.com) revealed that the recognition and cleavage site of HpyC1I was identical with restriction endonuclease BccI (25Roberts R.J. Vincze T. Posfai J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, HpyC1I was an isoschizomer of BccI. The reaction condition, R-M gene alignment, and digestion pattern of λ, pBR322, and phiX174 DNA by HpyC1I were identical with BccI (Fig. 5). DNA of wild type H. pylori NTUH-C1 strain was resistant to BccI digestion (data not shown). Therefore, the CCATC sequences of NTUH-C1 strain were modified, and these modifications were resistant to HpyC1I and BccI digestion.Table IIDetermination of the HpyC1I recognition and cleavage sequences using cloning and sequencing of HpyC1I restriction fragmentsPosition in λ DNADNA sequences flanking HpyC1I cleavage sites in λ DNAaBoldface type, the cloned λ DNA sequence digested with HpyC1I; italic type, λ DNA sequence adjacent to the cloned HpyC1I restriction fragment; underline, HpyC1I recognition sequence; vertical arrow, HpyC1I cleavage position.1325-13645′-CTGGCCAAAGTCCATCCGTG ↓ GCTCCACGCCAAAAGTGAGA-3′1596-16355′-GAAAAGACCGGGATCTGGAC ↓ CCGTGATGGCATTCTCTGGT-3′4797-48365′-TGCTCGATATGGACACGCCC ↓ GGCGGGATGGTGGCGGGGGC-3′4970-50095′-CGGACAGGCTCCATCGGCGT ↓ CATGATGGCTCACAGTAATT-3′9581-96205′-CAGTGGTATGACCATCACCG ↓ TGAACGGCGTTGCTGCAGGC-3′9855-98945′-GTGGAAGACGCCATCAGAAC ↓ CGGCGCGTTTCTGGTGGCGA-3′11833-118725′-TCCTGCAGGCGGATTACAAC ↓ ACGCTGATGGCGGCGGCGAA-3′12404-124435′-TGAAGACCAGCTTCGCGGGA ↓ ACTGGATGGCAGGCCTGAAG-3′39312-393515′-AGACTATCGCACCATCAGCC ↓ AGAAAACCGAATTTTGCTGG-3′39588-396275′-ATCTATGAAAAACATCGCCG ↓ CACAGATGGTTAACTTTGAC-3′a Boldface type, the cloned λ DNA sequence digested with HpyC1I; italic type, λ DNA sequence adjacent to the cloned HpyC1I restriction fragment; underline, HpyC1I recognition sequence; vertical arrow, HpyC1I cleavage position. Open table in a new tab The Diversity of HpyC1I R-M Systems among H. pylori Strains—Chromosomal DNAs from 15 H. pylori strains, including four ATCC strains and 11 clinical isolates, were examined for the prevalence of HpyC1I R-M systems. The chromosomal DNAs of the nine strains with HpyC1I R-M system were resistant to HpyC1I digestion (Fig. 6A), whereas those from the other six strains without the HpyC1I R-M system were digested by HpyC1I. These results of DNA digestion were consistent with PCR results of HpyC1I R-M genes. HpyC1IM1-F and hpyC1IR-R primers (corresponding to the 5′-end of the gene encoding M1.HpyC1I and 3′-end of the gene encoding HpyC1I, respectively) were used to amplify HpyC1I R-M genes (Fig. 6B). PCR products with the predicted size of 3.3 kb were only observed in the nine strains that were resistant to HpyC1I digestion and not in the other six strains. To examine the chromosomal locations of the HpyC1I R-M genes among these strains, HP1498-F and HP1501-R primers corresponding to the conserved HP1498 and HP1501 genes were used for PCR (Fig. 6C). DNAs from the nine strains (including wild type NTUH-C1 strain) yielded PCR products with a predicted size of ∼4.5 kb. These results indicated that the size and location of the integrated region were the same in the nine strains harboring the HpyC1I R-M genes. DNAs from the other six strains without the HpyC1I R-M genes yielded a predicted size of about 2.1 kb as did 26695 and J99 strains. RNA Expression Profiles of Wild Type and hpyC1IR Mutant Strain—The RNA expression profiles of wild type and hpyC1IR mutant were analyzed by microarray hybridization. Compared with the expression level of wild type, 10 genes were up-regulated and seven genes were down-regulated in hpyC1IR mutant. Five of the 17 genes had no data base match and no predicted function (Table III).Table IIIResult of RNA expression profile of NTUH-C1 and hpyC1IR mutantExpression level (20Ang S. Lee C.Z. Peck K.

However, the mutants with decreased adherence revealed elongated cell structure; the interrupted locus was predicted to be a restriction endonuclease. Therefore, this locus was unlikely to be an adhesin, and the decrease of cell adherence might be caused by changes in cell structure or other indirect changes caused by the knockout of R-M system. The transposon insertion of these six mutants was at the same site in hpyC1IR. Therefore, these six mutants might have descended from one insertion mutation event. However, reknocked out hpyC1IR in a fresh wild type strain caused the same phenotypic changes, and complementation restored the morphology of wild type; both findings indicated that disruption of hpyC1IR rather than other chromosomal mutations caused these phenotypic alterations. H. pylori is a genetically diverse species (26Wang G. Humayun M.Z. Taylor D.E. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 488-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Strain-specific genes may be of great interest biologically, and some may be associated with drug resistance, bacterial surface structure, or restriction-modification. Comparison of 26695 and J99 genome sequences revealed that more than 20 putative R-M systems could be identified in each strain (11Lin L.F. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Kong H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Unique genes of the J166 strain that were identified by PCR-based subtraction hybridization were predominantly (7 of 18) R-M genes (23Akopyants N.S. Fradkov A. Diatchenko L. Hill J.E. Siebert P.D. Lukyanov S.A. Sverdlov E.D. Berg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13108-13113Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The HpyC1I R-M genes were present in NTUH-C1 strain but absent in both 26695 and J99 strains. We also proved that the HpyC1I R-M system were present in ∼60% H. pylori strains. Compared with the G + C content of the conserved flanking regions (∼37.2%) and whole genome (∼37.3%) of 26695 and J99 strains, the integrated R-M system has significantly lower G + C content (30.7%). This R-M system might be acquired by horizontal transfer during evolution. R-M systems in bacteria were responsible for cleavage of unmodified foreign DNAs to protect their own chromosomal DNA. H. pylori strains have diverse R-M systems resulting in barriers of interstrain DNA transformation (12Ando T. Xu Q. Torres M. Kusugami K. Israel D.A. Blaser M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1052-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Transformation efficiency results also demonstrated CCATC-unmodified plasmids from E. coli, and hpyC1IM1 and hpyC1IM2 mutants were easily digested by the wild type NTUH-C1 strain. However, small amounts of unmodified plasmid DNA could still be transformed. This indicated that either some plasmids might be protected by the methylase in wild type, or a DNA recombination event might have taken place prior to digestion by the restriction endonuclease. The Type II R-M system consists of DNA methyltransferase and restriction endonuclease. An endonuclease always contains an N-terminal domain for DNA binding and a C-terminal domain for DNA cleavage. The conserved catalytic residues were identified in HpyC1I. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed 23 and 20% similarity with Type IIS restriction endonucleases PleI and MlyI, respectively. However, the HpyC1I recognition site was different from PleI and MlyI because DNA from wild type was digestible by PleI and MlyI. Detailed characterization of its activity and recognition site showed HpyC1I to be a BccI isoschizomer; however, NCBI BLAST and REBASE data base searches did not find nucleotide or amino acid similarities with BccI. Knockout mutants of hpyC1IR showed cell elongation and decreased adherence to the gastric cancer cell line (SC-M1). The mechanism for the morphological change remained unclear. However, R-M systems could affect many cellular genes as shown by microarray study. There were 10 genes with increased expression and seven genes with decreased RNA expression levels in the hpyC1IR mutant. These results may shed light on the regulatory role of HpyC1I R-M system. Interestingly, a methylase gene of the Type I R-M system, hsdM, was up-regulated in the hpyC1IR mutant. On the other hand, a restriction endonuclease of the Type IIS R-M system, mboIIR, had a decreased expression level in hpyC1IR mutant. In conclusion, we have identified a novel HpyC1I R-M system in H. pylori and have documented its R-M function and recognition site. This R-M system is present in ∼60% of the H. pylori isolates. Inactivation of HpyC1I resulted in cell elongation."
