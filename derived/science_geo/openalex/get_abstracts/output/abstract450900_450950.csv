https://openalex.org/W2171213306,"The PARKIN ubiquitin ligase (also known as PARK2) and its regulatory kinase PINK1 (also known as PARK6), often mutated in familial early-onset Parkinson's disease, have central roles in mitochondrial homeostasis and mitophagy. Whereas PARKIN is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) upon depolarization via PINK1 action and can ubiquitylate porin, mitofusin and Miro proteins on the MOM, the full repertoire of PARKIN substrates--the PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylome--remains poorly defined. Here we use quantitative diGly capture proteomics (diGly) to elucidate the ubiquitylation site specificity and topology of PARKIN-dependent target modification in response to mitochondrial depolarization. Hundreds of dynamically regulated ubiquitylation sites in dozens of proteins were identified, with strong enrichment for MOM proteins, indicating that PARKIN dramatically alters the ubiquitylation status of the mitochondrial proteome. Using complementary interaction proteomics, we found depolarization-dependent PARKIN association with numerous MOM targets, autophagy receptors, and the proteasome. Mutation of the PARKIN active site residue C431, which has been found mutated in Parkinson's disease patients, largely disrupts these associations. Structural and topological analysis revealed extensive conservation of PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylation sites on cytoplasmic domains in vertebrate and Drosophila melanogaster MOM proteins. These studies provide a resource for understanding how the PINK1-PARKIN pathway re-sculpts the proteome to support mitochondrial homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2066005598,"A role for macrophages in erythropoiesis was suggested several decades ago when erythroblastic islands in the bone marrow, composed of a central macrophage surrounded by developing erythroblasts, were described. However, the in vivo role of macrophages in erythropoiesis under homeostatic conditions or in disease remains unclear. We found that specific depletion of CD169(+) macrophages markedly reduced the number of erythroblasts in the bone marrow but did not result in overt anemia under homeostatic conditions, probably because of concomitant alterations in red blood cell clearance. However, CD169(+) macrophage depletion significantly impaired erythropoietic recovery from hemolytic anemia, acute blood loss and myeloablation. Furthermore, macrophage depletion normalized the erythroid compartment in a JAK2(V617F)-driven mouse model of polycythemia vera, suggesting that erythropoiesis in polycythemia vera remains under the control of macrophages in the bone marrow and splenic microenvironments. These results indicate that CD169(+) macrophages promote late erythroid maturation and that modulation of the macrophage compartment may be a new strategy to treat erythropoietic disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2100994932,"Maresins are produced by macrophages from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and exert potent proresolving and tissue homeostatic actions. Maresin 1 (MaR1; 7R,14S-dihydroxy-docosa-4Z,8E,10E,12Z,16Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid) is the first identified maresin. Here, we investigate formation, stereochemistry, and precursor role of 13,14-epoxy-docosahexaenoic acid, an intermediate in MaR1 biosynthesis. The 14-lipoxygenation of DHA by human macrophage 12-lipoxygenase (hm12-LOX) gave 14-hydro(peroxy)-docosahexaenoic acid (14-HpDHA), as well as several dihydroxy-docosahexaenoic acids, implicating an epoxide intermediate formation by this enzyme. Using a stereo-controlled synthesis, enantiomerically pure 13S,14S-epoxy-docosa-4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid (13S,14S-epoxy-DHA) was prepared, and its stereochemistry was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. When this 13S,14S-epoxide was incubated with human macrophages, it was converted to MaR1. The synthetic 13S,14S-epoxide inhibited leukotriene B4 (LTB4) formation by human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) ~40% (P<0.05) to a similar extent as LTA4 (~50%, P<0.05) but was not converted to MaR1 by this enzyme. 13S,14S-epoxy-DHA also reduced (~60%; P<0.05) arachidonic acid conversion by hm12-LOX and promoted conversion of M1 macrophages to M2 phenotype, which produced more MaR1 from the epoxide than M1. Together, these findings establish the biosynthesis of the 13 S,14S-epoxide, its absolute stereochemistry, its precursor role in MaR1 biosynthesis, and its own intrinsic bioactivity. Given its actions and role in MaR1 biosynthesis, this epoxide is now termed 13,14-epoxy-maresin (13,14-eMaR) and exhibits new mechanisms in resolution of inflammation in its ability to inhibit proinflammatory mediator production by LTA4 hydrolase and to block arachidonate conversion by human 12-LOX rather than merely terminating phagocyte involvement.—Dalli, J., Zhu, M., Vlasenko, N. A., Deng, B., Haeggström, J. Z., Petasis, N. A., Serhan, C. N. The novel 13S,14S-epoxy-maresin is converted by human macrophages to maresin 1 (MaR1), inhibits leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) and shifts macrophage phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2023747882,"Regulation of erythropoiesis is achieved by the integration of distinct signals. Among them, macrophages are emerging as erythropoietin-complementary regulators of erythroid development, particularly under stress conditions. We investigated the contribution of macrophages to physiological and pathological conditions of enhanced erythropoiesis. We used mouse models of induced anemia, polycythemia vera and β-thalassemia in which macrophages were chemically depleted. Our data indicate that macrophages contribute decisively to recovery from induced anemia, as well as the pathological progression of polycythemia vera and β-thalassemia, by modulating erythroid proliferation and differentiation. We validated these observations in primary human cultures, showing a direct impact of macrophages on the proliferation and enucleation of erythroblasts from healthy individuals and patients with polycythemia vera or β-thalassemia. The contribution of macrophages to stress and pathological erythropoiesis, which we have termed stress erythropoiesis macrophage-supporting activity, may have therapeutic implications."

https://openalex.org/W2062830884,"The cryptochrome (CRY) flavoproteins act as blue-light receptors in plants and insects, but perform light-independent functions at the core of the mammalian circadian clock. To drive clock oscillations, mammalian CRYs associate with the Period proteins (PERs) and together inhibit the transcription of their own genes. The SCF(FBXL3) ubiquitin ligase complex controls this negative feedback loop by promoting CRY ubiquitination and degradation. However, the molecular mechanisms of their interactions and the functional role of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding in CRYs remain poorly understood. Here we report crystal structures of mammalian CRY2 in its apo, FAD-bound and FBXL3-SKP1-complexed forms. Distinct from other cryptochromes of known structures, mammalian CRY2 binds FAD dynamically with an open cofactor pocket. Notably, the F-box protein FBXL3 captures CRY2 by simultaneously occupying its FAD-binding pocket with a conserved carboxy-terminal tail and burying its PER-binding interface. This novel F-box-protein-substrate bipartite interaction is susceptible to disruption by both FAD and PERs, suggesting a new avenue for pharmacological targeting of the complex and a multifaceted regulatory mechanism of CRY ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W1969029468,"The World Register of Marine Species is an over 90% complete open-access inventory of all marine species names. Here we illustrate the scale of the problems with species names, synonyms, and their classification, and describe how WoRMS publishes online quality assured information on marine species. Within WoRMS, over 100 global, 12 regional and 4 thematic species databases are integrated with a common taxonomy. Over 240 editors from 133 institutions and 31 countries manage the content. To avoid duplication of effort, content is exchanged with 10 external databases. At present WoRMS contains 460,000 taxonomic names (from Kingdom to subspecies), 368,000 species level combinations of which 215,000 are currently accepted marine species names, and 26,000 related but non-marine species. Associated information includes 150,000 literature sources, 20,000 images, and locations of 44,000 specimens. Usage has grown linearly since its launch in 2007, with about 600,000 unique visitors to the website in 2011, and at least 90 organisations from 12 countries using WoRMS for their data management. By providing easy access to expert-validated content, WoRMS improves quality control in the use of species names, with consequent benefits to taxonomy, ecology, conservation and marine biodiversity research and management. The service manages information on species names that would otherwise be overly costly for individuals, and thus minimises errors in the application of nomenclature standards. WoRMS' content is expanding to include host-parasite relationships, additional literature sources, locations of specimens, images, distribution range, ecological, and biological data. Species are being categorised as introduced (alien, invasive), of conservation importance, and on other attributes. These developments have a multiplier effect on its potential as a resource for biodiversity research and management. As a consequence of WoRMS, we are witnessing improved communication within the scientific community, and anticipate increased taxonomic efficiency and quality control in marine biodiversity research and management."

We identified GPR99 using a reporter gene expression assay to screen candidate cDNAs selected from the P2Y gene family that recognize dicarboxylic acids. We confirmed the nmol range binding of [3H]LTE4 onto microsome membranes from GPR99-transfected cells. We then generated triple-deficient Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice to show the loss of permeability-enhancing function to all three cys-LT ligands in contrast to their sustained function in the presence of GPR99 but absence of the classical receptors in the Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− strain. Finally, a dose-dependent loss of edema responses to LTE4, but not to LTC4 or LTD4, in Gpr99−/− mice as compared with WT mice shows a preference of GPR99 for LTE4 even in the presence of the classic receptors. A trans-activator reporter gene assay system (Stratagene) was used to examine whether GPR91 or GPR99 can mediate LTE4-specific signaling in transfectants. pFA-CMV-trans-activator plasmids contain a fusion cDNA of the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 with an activation domain derived from CREB or Elk-1. When co-transfected with a gene that activates adenylate cyclase or MAPK, the activation domain from CREB or Elk-1 is phosphorylated, respectively, and binds to the GAL4 DNA-binding elements. A co-transfected pFA-Luc reporter plasmid that contains GAL4-binding sites upstream of the firefly luciferase gene is then induced. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pCXN vector (a mammalian expression vector) control, pCXN-GPR91, or pCXN-GPR99 along with pFA-CMV-CREB or pFA-CMV-Elk-1 and pFA-Luc. After a 4-h incubation, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM. The next day, various concentrations of LTE4, succinate (100 μm), or oxoglutarate (100 μm) were added to the medium, and the cells were further incubated for 16 h. Then, the cells were lysed, and the firefly luciferase activity was measured. A Renilla luciferase plasmid was used as an internal control to assess the transfection efficiency as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). [3H]LTE4 binding to the microsomal membranes from the CHO cell transfectants was assayed as described with modifications (16Maekawa A. Kanaoka Y. Lam B.K. Austen K.F.

[3H]LTE4 was prepared from [3H]LTD4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by incubation with 10% FBS that contains dipeptidases, and the conversion was confirmed by reverse phase HPLC (24Lam B.K. Owen Jr., W.F. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. The identification of a distinct export step following the biosynthesis of leukotriene C4 by human eosinophils.J. Biol.

The LTE4-specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding, which was determined in the presence of 1 μm cold LTE4, from total binding. For competition assays, various concentrations of LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, MK-571, or oxoglutarate were added before incubation of the membrane protein with 2 nm [3H]LTE4. When LTC4 and LTD4 were used as competitors, 50 mm serine borate and 20 mm l-penicillamine were included, respectively, to prevent conversion of the peptide adduct. Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice were generated by crossbreeding of BALB/c Cysltr1−/− and Cysltr2−/− mice as described (19Maekawa A. Kanaoka Y. Xing W. Austen K.F. Functional recognition of a distinct receptor preferential for leukotriene E4 in mice lacking the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 and 2 receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16695-16700Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 Gpr99−/− mice (the Knock-Out Mouse Project, University of California, Davis) were backcrossed on to the BALB/c background for four generations (N4). Because the Cysltr1 (on chromosome X) and Gpr99 (on chromosome 14) genes are on different chromosomes, BALB/c Gpr99/Cysltr1−/− mice were generated by crossbreeding as described for Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice. However, the Gpr99 and Cysltr2 genes are both on chromosome 14, and they are ∼47 megabase pairs apart; we first bred BALB/c Gpr99−/− mice with Cysltr2−/− mice to obtain Gpr99+/−/Cysltr2+/− mice. We then bred Gpr99+/−/Cysltr2+/− mice with BALB/c WT mice to obtain Gpr99+/−/Cysltr2+/− (N5) mice with both mutant alleles on the same sister chromatid. These Gpr99+/−/Cysltr2+/− mice were intercrossed to obtain Gpr99/Cysltr2−/− mice. Finally, Gpr99/Cysltr1−/− mice were crossbred with Gpr99/Cysltr2−/− mice to obtain the triple null (Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/−) strain. Gpr99−/− and Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice were viable and had no apparent abnormalities based on fertility, behavior, and gross findings at autopsy. 2–4-month-old, male Gpr99−/−, Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/−, and Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice were used. WT littermates from the intercrossing of Gpr99+/− or Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2+/− mice were used as controls. Mice received intradermal injections of various concentrations of LTC4, LTD4, or LTE4 in 25 μl of saline/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle) in the right ear and 25 μl of vehicle in the left ear. At 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after the intradermal injection, ear thickness was measured with calipers (Dyer Co.). The results are presented as the difference of ear thickness between the right ear and left ear. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used for the statistical analysis. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Based on their amino acid sequence, CysLT1R and CysLT2R belong to the nucleotide P2Y G protein-coupled receptor family (25Schöneberg T. Hermsdorf T. Engemaier E. Engel K. Liebscher I. Thor D. Zierau K. Römpler H. Schulz A. Structural and functional evolution of the P2Y12-like receptor group.Purinergic Signal. 2007; 3: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Within the P2Y1 subgroup, GPR91 and GPR99 do not bind to nucleotides but do bind to the glucose metabolism intermediates, succinate and oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate), respectively (23He W. Miao F.J. Lin D.C. Schwandner R.T. Wang Z. Gao J. Chen J.L. Tian H. Ling L. Citric acid cycle intermediates as ligands for orphan G-protein-coupled receptors.Nature. 2004; 429: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Because both succinate and oxoglutarate are dicarboxylic acids, and two carboxylic acid groups are also present in LTE4, we used a trans-activator reporter gene assay system to examine whether GPR91 or GPR99 can mediate LTE4-specific signaling in transfectants. Cells transfected with pCXN-GPR91 or a control vector alone did not respond to LTE4 in either assay. In contrast, cells transfected with pCXN-GPR99 responded to LTE4 in a dose-dependent manner in both assays beginning at a submicromolar concentration (Fig. 1A). As expected, oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) at a concentration of 0.1 mm also activated cells transfected with GPR99. We then sought to show that GPR99 directly bound [3H]LTE4 using microsomal membranes from CHO cells transiently expressing GPR99. The [3H]LTE4 binding in the absence and presence of cold LTE4 revealed a specific dose-dependent binding to GPR99 with a Kd of 2,499 pm and a Bmax of 274.6 fmol/mg of protein (Fig. 1B). Essentially no specific binding was obtained with vector-only transfected cells. By competition assays with 2 nm [3H]LTE4, cold LTE4 provided a dose-dependent inhibition (Fig. 1C). LTE4 showed 80% inhibition at 10 nm, whereas inhibition at this concentration was 60% for LTC4, 40% for LTD4 and for oxoglutarate, and negligible for MK-571, a CysLT1R antagonist. Oxoglutarate completely inhibited the binding at 100 μm (not shown), whereas LTE4 did so at 1 μm. These results suggest that GPR99 might have a preference for LTE4 and qualify as a candidate for the elusive LTE4 receptor, but they need to be extended with more comprehensive investigations of binding and signaling mechanisms. To determine whether this candidate LTE4 receptor mediates the vascular permeability responses to cys-LTs in mice lacking the classical CysLT1R and CysLT2R receptors was the critical next step. The Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− strain exhibits a markedly augmented swelling response to intracutaneous administration of LTE4 and an essentially intact response to LTC4 and LTD4 (19Maekawa A. Kanaoka Y. Xing W. Austen K.F. Functional recognition of a distinct receptor preferential for leukotriene E4 in mice lacking the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 and 2 receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16695-16700Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to verify that GPR99 is a bona fide third receptor with a preference for LTE4 by deleting it from this strain and studying skin swelling responses in the resultant triple-null mice. LTE4 (0.5 nmol/site) was injected intradermally into the ear of BALB/c WT, Gpr99−/−, Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/−, and Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice, and tissue edema was assessed by measuring ear thickness at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after the injection. Net ear swelling after correction for the left vehicle-injected ear peaked in WT mice at 30 min, and in Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice, there was an enhanced peak response at 30 min (Fig. 2A) as reported previously (19Maekawa A. Kanaoka Y. Xing W. Austen K.F. Functional recognition of a distinct receptor preferential for leukotriene E4 in mice lacking the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 and 2 receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16695-16700Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Gpr99−/− mice showed essentially the same response as WT mice, indicating an absence of a GPR99 role at this ligand dose. In contrast, Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice had a more than 90% loss of the peak response at 30 min as compared with WT, Gpr99−/−, and Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice (p < 0.01), indicating that the enhanced LTE4-induced ear edema in Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice is mediated through GPR99. To assess the dose dependence of the GPR99 response in the absence and presence of the classical receptors, we reduced the dose of LTE4 by 64-fold (0.008 nmol/site). The peak edema at 30 min with this minimal dose in WT mice was reduced by about one-half and again was exceeded by that in the Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice (Fig. 2B). As expected, the Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice showed essentially no edema response at any time point due to the absence of all three receptors. Of note, at this dose, Gpr99−/− mice had a markedly reduced peak response (p < 0.05), suggesting that GPR99 is the major LTE4 receptor when the ligand dose is below the threshold needed to activate CysLT1R or CysLT2R in vivo. To obtain further evidence supporting this suggestion, an intermediate dose of 0.0625 nmol of LTE4 was used to elicit the vascular leak. The enhanced edema relative to WT mice in the Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− strain was again virtually abolished in the Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− strain (Fig. 2C). The peak response in the Gpr99−/− strain at 30 min was also diminished to almost one-half that of the WT and absent beyond this time point. Taken together, the dose-response study with LTE4 establishes GPR99 as the preferred LTE4 receptor at one-eighth and one-sixty-fourth of the 0.5-nmol dose in the presence of the classical CysLTRs and at all doses when the classical receptors are absent. To assess whether GPR99 mediates the permeability-enhancing action of the other cys-LT ligands, we injected LTC4 and LTD4 at 0.5 or 0.008 nmol/site intradermally into the ear of BALB/c WT, Gpr99−/−, Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/−, and Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice. With the high dose of LTC4, WT mice had an ear edema response with peak at 30–60 min, and Gpr99−/− mice had a similar response (Fig. 3A). Although Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice had a slightly reduced peak response to LTC4 at 30–60 min as compared with WT mice, the Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice had a markedly reduced peak at 30 min, showing GPR99 to be a third cys-LT receptor. With the low dose of LTC4, WT mice had a reduced ear edema response with peak at 30–60 min, and Gpr99−/− mice had a similar response (Fig. 3B). As expected, although Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− and WT mice had a similar peak response at 30 min, the Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice had no response to the low dose LTC4 at any time point. These results indicate that GPR99 can mediate LTC4-induced edema responses in the absence of CysLT1R and CysLT2R. With the 0.5 nmol/site of LTD4, WT mice and Gpr99−/− mice showed peak edema responses at 30–60 min (Fig. 3C). The Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice showed a reduced peak response at 30 min, whereas there was virtually no response to LTD4 in the Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice. With the low dose of LTD4, WT mice and Gpr99−/− mice showed reduced but similar peak edema responses at 30–60 min (Fig. 3D). Although Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− and WT mice had a similar peak response at 30–60 min, the Gpr99/Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice had virtually no response. Thus, GPR99 can mediate LTD4-induced edema responses in the absence of CysLT1R and CysLT2R. The findings in the triple receptor-deficient mice indicate GPR99 as a potential CysLT3R, a receptor capable of responding to each of the cys-LTs in the absence of the classical receptors, CysLT1R and CysLT2R. A preference or greater sensitivity of GPR99 for LTE4 is shown by the enhanced response of the Cysltr1/Cysltr2−/− mice as compared with WT mice but not to LTC4 or LTD4. This is supported by the reduction of the permeability response to low and intermediate doses of LTE4 in the Gpr99−/− strain. At a high dose of LTE4, the GPR99-deficient strain is not impaired due to the dominance of the CysLT1R and CysLT2R over GPR99. The strength and sensitivity of the LTE4-mediated vascular leak in the absence of the classical receptors implies their negative regulation for GPR99 function or sensitivity. The human GPR99 gene was originally identified as an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with homology to a P2Y nucleotide receptor subfamily by searching the human genomic databases with known nucleotide receptors (26Wittenberger T. Hellebrand S. Munck A. Kreienkamp H.J. Schaller H.C. Hampe W. GPR99, a new G protein-coupled receptor with homology to a new subgroup of nucleotide receptors.BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Human GPR99 shares 36% identical amino acids both with the ATP receptor, P2Y1, and with GPR91, which had been identified as another orphan GPCR at that time. Mouse GPR99 shares 85% identical amino acids with human GPR99. The motif YXVTRPL, which is unique to the P2Y1 subfamily, and the motif HXX(R/K), which is found in all nucleotide-binding GPCRs, are conserved between mouse and human GPR99. Mouse GPR99 is 33% identical to mouse GPR91, 32% identical to mouse CysLT2R, and 27% identical to mouse CysLT1R. The HXX(R/K) motif is conserved in GPR99, GPR91, CysLT2R, and CysLT1R, and the YXVTRPL motif is conserved only in GPR99 and GPR91 (supplemental Fig. 1). The positively charged arginine residues in both motifs are required for succinate-elicited GPR91 activation as assessed by site-directed mutagenesis and functional reporter gene assays (23He W. Miao F.J. Lin D.C. Schwandner R.T. Wang Z. Gao J. Chen J.L. Tian H. Ling L. Citric acid cycle intermediates as ligands for orphan G-protein-coupled receptors.Nature. 2004; 429: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Another arginine (position 95 in mouse GPR91 and position 99 in human GPR91) and a histidine (position 99 in mouse GPR91 and position 103 in human GPR91) are also required for succinate-elicited GPR91 activation (supplemental Fig. 1). Because these four amino acids are conserved in GPR99, they may be important in binding dicarboxylic acid ligands. Particularly, the arginine in the YXVTRPL motif, which is lacking in CysLT2R and CysLT1R, might account for the preference of GPR99 for LTE4. Northern blot analysis with human tissues revealed that GPR99 mRNA is expressed in kidney and placenta (26Wittenberger T. Hellebrand S. Munck A. Kreienkamp H.J. Schaller H.C. Hampe W. GPR99, a new G protein-coupled receptor with homology to a new subgroup of nucleotide receptors.BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By a quantitative RT-PCR, human GPR99 mRNA is predominantly expressed in trachea, salivary glands, kidney, fetal brain, and lung and highly expressed in umbilical cord blood-derived mast cells (27Inbe H.

https://openalex.org/W2071649572,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has evolved exquisite controls over its host cells, human B lymphocytes, not only directing these cells during latency to proliferate and thereby expand the pool of infected cells, but also to survive and thereby persist for the lifetime of the infected individual. Although these activities ensure the virus is successful, they also make the virus oncogenic, particularly when infected people are immunosuppressed. Here we show, strikingly, that one set of EBV's microRNAs (miRNAs) both sustain Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells in the absence of other viral oncogenes and promote the transformation of primary B lymphocytes. BL cells were engineered to lose EBV and found to die by apoptosis and could be rescued by constitutively expressing viral miRNAs in them. Two of these EBV miRNAs were found to target caspase 3 to inhibit apoptosis at physiological concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2142688387,"The authors find that serotonin, acting through 5-HT1B receptors, potentiates temporoammonic pathway–to–CA1 cell excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. Chronic unpredictable stress increased the magnitude of this potentiation, and chronic treatment with fluoxetine restored normal levels of this potentiation, a process that was required for the behavioral effects of chronic fluoxetine. The causes of major depression remain unknown. Antidepressants elevate concentrations of monoamines, particularly serotonin, but it remains uncertain which downstream events are critical to their therapeutic effects. We found that endogenous serotonin selectively potentiated excitatory synapses formed by the temporoammonic pathway with CA1 pyramidal cells via activation of serotonin receptors (5-HT1BRs), without affecting nearby Schaffer collateral synapses. This potentiation was expressed postsynaptically by AMPA-type glutamate receptors and required calmodulin-dependent protein kinase–mediated phosphorylation of GluA1 subunits. Because they share common expression mechanisms, long-term potentiation and serotonin-induced potentiation occluded each other. Long-term consolidation of spatial learning, a function of temporoammonic-CA1 synapses, was enhanced by 5-HT1BR antagonists. Serotonin-induced potentiation was quantitatively and qualitatively altered in a rat model of depression, restored by chronic antidepressants, and required for the ability of chronic antidepressants to reverse stress-induced anhedonia. Changes in serotonin-mediated potentiation, and its recovery by antidepressants, implicate excitatory synapses as a locus of plasticity in depression."

https://openalex.org/W2054223020,"Cancer and proliferating cells exhibit an increased demand for glutamine-derived carbons to support anabolic processes. In addition, reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) was recently shown to be a major source of citrate synthesis from glutamine. The role of NAD(P)H/NAD(P)(+) cofactors in coordinating glucose and glutamine utilization in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is not well understood, with the source(s) of NADPH for the reductive carboxylation reaction remaining unexplored. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) is a mitochondrial enzyme that transfers reducing equivalents from NADH to NADPH. Here, we show that knockdown of NNT inhibits the contribution of glutamine to the TCA cycle and activates glucose catabolism in SkMel5 melanoma cells. The increase in glucose oxidation partially occurred through pyruvate carboxylase and rendered NNT knockdown cells more sensitive to glucose deprivation. Importantly, knocking down NNT inhibits reductive carboxylation in SkMel5 and 786-O renal carcinoma cells. Overexpression of NNT is sufficient to stimulate glutamine oxidation and reductive carboxylation, whereas it inhibits glucose catabolism in the TCA cycle. These observations are supported by an impairment of the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)(+) ratios. Our findings underscore the role of NNT in regulating central carbon metabolism via redox balance, calling for other mechanisms that coordinate substrate preference to maintain a functional TCA cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2090333731,"Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) likely has wide-ranging roles in gene expression and facilitation of tumor cell growth. SRSF3 knockdown induced G1 arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells (HCT116) in association with altered expression of 833 genes. Pathway analysis revealed ‘G1/S Checkpoint Regulation’ as the most highly enriched category in the affected genes. SRSF3 knockdown did not induce p53 or stimulate phosphorylation of p53 or histone H2A.X in wild-type HCT116 cells. Furthermore, the knockdown induced G1 arrest in p53-null HCT116 cells, suggesting that p53-dependent DNA damage responses did not mediate the G1 arrest. Real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and western blotting confirmed that SRSF3 knockdown reduced mRNA and protein levels of cyclins (D1, D3 and E1), E2F1 and E2F7. The decreased expression of cyclin D and E2F1 likely impaired the G1-to-S-phase progression. Consequently, retinoblastoma protein remained hypophosphorylated in SRSF3 knockdown cells. The knockdown also induced apoptosis in association with reduction of BCL2 protein levels. We also found that SRSF3 knockdown facilitated skipping of 81 5′-nucleotides (27 amino acids) from exon 8 of homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) and produced a HIPK2 Δe8 isoform. Full-length HIPK2 (HIPK2 FL) is constantly degraded through association with an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Siah-1), whereas HIPK2 Δe8, lacking the 27 amino acids, lost Siah-1-binding ability and became resistant to proteasome digestion. Interestingly, selective knockdown of HIPK2 FL induced apoptosis in various colon cancer cells expressing wild-type or mutated p53. Thus, these findings disclose an important role of SRSF3 in the regulation of the G1-to-S-phase progression and alternative splicing of HIPK2 in tumor growth."

Metaxin deficiency alters mitochondrial membrane permeability and leads to resistance to TNF-induced cell killing.Protein Cell. 2010; 1: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TNFα is mainly produced in activated macrophages and natural killer cells, whereas lower expression is found in a variety of other cells, including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and tumor cells (5van Horssen R. Ten Hagen T.L. Eggermont A.M. TNF-α in cancer treatment: molecular insights, antitumor effects, and clinical utility.Oncologist. 2006; 11: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Human TNFα is translated as a 26-kDa membrane-associated form and is then cleaved in the extracellular domain through the action of matrix metalloproteases to release a mature soluble 17-kDa protein (6Chiou H.L.

TNFβ (also known as lymphotoxin) is another important TNF member, and its primary sequence shares high sequence and structural similarities with TNFα (7Perez C. Albert I. DeFay K. Zachariades N.

Both TNFα and TNFβ affect a number of normal and neoplastic cell processes. The correct functioning of TNF requires effective communication with TNF receptors (TNFRs). 4The abbreviations used are: TNFRTNF receptorr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationCDRcomplementarity-determining region. Currently, two structurally distinct TNFRs, named TNFR1 and TNFR2, have been identified; both bind with the released soluble form and membrane-associated form of TNFα, respectively (9Chan K.F.

Theodorakis E.A. Moldawer L.L. Anti-TNF-α therapies: the next generation.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The binding of TNFα to TNFR1 has been shown to induce apoptosis and lead to activation of transcription factors involved in cell survival and inflammatory responses as well as to initiate the pathways that lead to caspase activation through the TNFR-associated death domain and FAS-associated death domain proteins (11Aggarwal B.B.

Goeddel D.V. TNF-R1 signaling: a beautiful pathway.Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). This physiologic relevance suggests that sequestering TNFα could be used to treat human autoimmune diseases (14Moreland L.W. Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor for rheumatoid arthritis.J. Rheumatol. Suppl. 1999; 57: 7-15PubMed Google Scholar), and a number of anti-TNFα agents (drugs and mAbs) have been developed to treat patients with TNFα-associated diseases such as Crohn disease, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and persistent uveitis (15Hasegawa A. Takasaki W. Greene M.I. Murali R. Modifying TNFα for therapeutic use: a perspective on the TNF receptor system.Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). TNF receptor root mean square deviation complementarity-determining region. Therapeutic mAbs have high efficacy in treating TNFα-associated diseases. Currently, three versions of therapeutic mAbs, i.e. etanercept (Enbrel®), infliximab (Remicade®), and adalimumab (Humira®), have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Among them, infliximab is a chimeric antibody composed of a complement-fixing human IgG1 constant region (75%) and a murine-derived antigen-binding variable region (25%) (16Knight D.M. Trinh H. Le J. Siegel S. Shealy D. McDonough M. Scallon B. Moore M.A. Vilcek J. Daddona P. Ghrayeb J. Construction and initial characterization of a mouse-human chimeric anti-TNF antibody.Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 1443-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Infliximab was developed in 1993 and was first approved for treating Crohn disease. Its use has since been extended to the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and various inflammatory skin diseases (17Gupta A.K. Skinner A.R. A review of the use of infliximab to manage cutaneous dermatoses.J. Cutan. Med. Surg. 2004; 8: 77-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infliximab is known for its ability to neutralize the biological activity of TNFα by binding to the soluble (free floating in the blood) and transmembrane (located on the outer membranes of T cells and similar immune cells) forms of TNFα with high affinity, preventing it from binding to cellular receptors and inducing the lysis of cells that produce TNFα (18Ricart E.

Infliximab affects the TNFα-mediated signaling pathways of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cytokine suppression (20Tracey D. Klareskog L. Sasso E.H. Salfeld J.G. Tak P.P. Tumor necrosis factor antagonist mechanisms of action: a comprehensive review.Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 117: 244-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Although the binding avidity or affinity between TNFα and infliximab is reportedly variable because of the different measurement methods used, the high binding avidity/affinity results in the formation of stable TNFα-infliximab complexes (21Scallon B. Cai A. Solowski N. Rosenberg A. Song X.Y. Shealy D. Wagner C. Binding and functional comparisons of two types of tumor necrosis factor antagonists.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Immunol. 2009; 131: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although TNFα shares high sequence and structural similarities with TNFβ, there is no evidence to show that infliximab can neutralize TNFβ (24Buch M.H. Conaghan P.G. Quinn M.A. Bingham S.J. Veale D. Emery P. True infliximab resistance in rheumatoid arthritis: a role for lymphotoxin α?.Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2004; 63: 1344-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which indicates the high specificity of infliximab in interacting with TNFα. Although crystallographic studies on TNFα-TNFR2 and TNFβ-TNFR1 complexes in past decades provided the breakthrough for understanding how TNF functions through communicating with receptors (8Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W.

Nakagawa S. Yamagata Y. Tsutsumi Y. Solution of the structure of the TNF-TNFR2 complex.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra83Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the experimental structure of TNFα in complex with the therapeutic antibodies remains exclusive, and the precise mechanism and the epitope on TNFα is still unclear (27Kim M.S. Lee S.H. Song M.Y. Yoo T.H. Lee B.K. Kim Y.S. Comparative analyses of complex formation and binding sites between human tumor necrosis factor-α and its three antagonists elucidate their different neutralizing mechanisms.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this work, the crystal structure of TNFα in complex with the infliximab Fab fragment is reported at a resolution of 2.6 Å. The crystal structure of the TNFα-infliximab Fab together with the structures of TNFβ-TNFR1 and TNFα-TNFR2 complexes rationalizes the inhibition of TNFα-receptor interaction by overlap between the mAb- and TNFR-binding sites on the TNFα. Moreover, the distinct features of the E-F loop on TNFα in the TNFα-infliximab Fab complex suggest the molecular basis for the specific binding of infliximab to TNFα but not TNFβ. The structure of the TNFα-infliximab Fab complex also indicates the formation of an aggregated network for the inhibition of membrane-associated TNFα function and, therefore, activation of complement-dependent cytolysis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which result in the reported risk of developing granulomatous infection of TNFα blockages. These results lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of mAbs used for treating TNFα-associated diseases and provide a new focus for the design of future drugs that target TNFα with high efficacy and specificity and with fewer adverse effects. The cDNA sequence-encoding residues Val77–Leu233 of human TNFα were cloned into the pET-22b(+) vector (Novagen) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The transformed cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C until the OD 600 reached 1.5, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The bacterial cells were incubated in a lysis buffer (PBS) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice followed by sonication. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g) and filtration (0.45 μm). Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 35%, immediately mixed, and incubated on a roller at 4 °C for 2 h. The solution was then cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g). After discarding the precipitate, solid ammonium sulfate was continuously added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 60%, immediately mixed, and incubated on a roller at 4 °C for 4 h. The precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g), and the supernatant was discarded. The precipitate was dissolved in PBS (20 mm phosphate, pH 8.0 and 150 mm NaCl) and separated by gel filtration using Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare). After desalting to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the target fraction was further purified with a 20-column volume linear NaCl gradient elution from high performance Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The purity was confirmed to be >95% using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The bioactivity was measured in a cytotoxicity assay using the TNF-susceptible murine L-929 cell line in the presence of the metabolic inhibitor actinomycin D (28Matthews N. Neale M.L. Lymphokines and Interferons, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987Google Scholar). Infliximab (29Le, J. M., Vilcek, J., Dadonna, P., Ghrayeb, J., Knight, D., Siegel, S. A., (August 12, 1997) U. S. Patent 5,656,272Google Scholar) was cloned, expressed, and purified following reported procedures. Briefly, the EcoRV and XbaI sites were added to the 5′-end of the heavy chain variable region gene (VH), and an NheI site was added to the 3′-end. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and its sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. VH was excised through EcoRV and NheI digestion and then inserted into the EcoRV/NheI sites of the pAH4604 vector containing the human γ-1 constant region gene (CH). The resultant pAH4604-VH vector was cleaved with XbaI and BamHI, and then the 3.3-kb fragment containing the chimeric rodent/human antibody heavy chain gene was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen), which was digested with the same restriction enzymes, yielding the chimeric heavy chain expression vector pcDNA3.1(−)VHCH. The human κ chain constant cDNA (CL) was obtained as a 0.3-kb PCR product derived from pAG4622. The light chain variable region gene (VL) of infliximab was fused to the 5′-end of the CL using the overlapping PCR method. The resultant chimeric light chain gene (VLCL) with a HindIII site upstream of the start codon and an EcoRI site downstream of the stop codon was cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and its sequence was verified. VLCL was excised through HindIII and EcoRI digestion and ligated into the pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+) vector (Invitrogen) cleaved with the same restriction enzymes, yielding the chimeric light chain expression vector pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+)VLCL. The chimeric light and heavy chain expression vectors were co-transfected into Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were isolated by limiting dilution in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418 and 300 μg/ml Zeocin. The culture supernates from individual cell clones were analyzed for antibody production using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The assay used goat anti-human IgG Fc (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as the capture antibodies and goat anti-human κ-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) as the detecting antibodies. Purified human IgG1/κ (Sigma) was used as the standard control. The clones that produced the highest amount of recombinant antibodies were selected and grown in serum-free medium. The recombinant antibodies were purified using protein A affinity chromatography from the serum-free culture supernatant. The antibody concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, and the purity was confirmed using SDS-PAGE analysis. Bioactivity was measured in a cytotoxicity antagonist assay using the TNF-susceptible murine L-929 cell line in the presence of the metabolic inhibitor actinomycin D and TNFα. The Fab fragment of infliximab for crystallographic investigation was obtained through papain digestion of infliximab. The digested protein sample was loaded onto a protein A-Sepharose 4 FF column (GE Healthcare), and the Fab fragment eluted in the flow-through was separated from the Fc fragment and further purified using ion-exchange chromatography using a Q-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare). The protein sample was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml and then exchanged to a stock buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 100 mm NaCl. TNFα and infliximab Fab were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 and incubated for 10 h at 4 °C to form the complex before crystallization. The mixed protein was further purified using Superdex 200 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare) following the procedure suggested by the manufacturer. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the purity was >95%. The purified protein was then concentrated to 30 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 150 mm NaCl for crystallization. Crystallization of the infliximab Fab/TNFα complex was performed at 290 K using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals grew in drops consisting of 1.5 μl of protein and 1.5 μl of reservoir solution against 200 μl of reservoir solution. The initial crystal appeared after 3 days of growth in 1.4 m sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 8.2 with poor diffraction quality after initial screening. Sodium citrate (300 mm) was added to the original solution, and crystals with good diffraction quality were obtained after 5 days of growth. The crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of the reservoir solution and 25% (v/v) glycol and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for x-ray diffraction. The initial data set for the TNFα-infliximab Fab complex was collected at the BL17A beamline (Photon Factory, Japan) at a resolution of 3.1 Å. The optimized crystals with good diffraction quality were diffracted to 2.6-Å resolution at 100 K in the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility 3W1A and Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility BL17U beamlines at a wavelength of 1.0000 Å with Mar165 and Mar225 charge-coupled device detectors, respectively. The data were processed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 package (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group H3 with cell parameters a = b = 154.0 Å, c = 99.3 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°. Only one complex molecule per asymmetric unit with a Matthews coefficient of 3.7 Å3/Da was present, corresponding to 63.4% solvent content (31Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab The infliximab Fab-TNFα structure was solved by molecular replacement using the crystal structures of apo-TNFα (Protein Data Bank code 1TNF), the light chain of the mAb cetuximab/Erbitux/IMC-C225 (Protein Data Bank code 1YY8), and the heavy chain of humanized antibody C25 Fab fragment (Protein Data Bank code 2GCY) as the initial search models using the program PHASER (32McCoy A.J.

The structures of uncomplexed light chain from the mAb cetuximab/Erbitux/IMC-C225 and heavy chain from humanized antibody C25 Fab fragment were also used to represent the free form of infliximab Fab. The clear solutions in both the rotation and translation functions indicated the presence of one complex molecule, including one TNFα and one infliximab Fab molecule, in one asymmetric unit, which is consistent with the Matthews coefficient and solvent content (33Matthews B.W. Solvent content of protein crystals.J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7917) Google Scholar). Residues that differ between infliximab and the searching model were manually rebuilt in the program Coot (34Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar) under the guidance of the Fo − Fc and 2Fo − Fc electron density maps. After the refinement of the model using simulated annealing, energy minimization, restrained individual B factors, and addition of 83 solvent molecules in PHENIX (35Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Refinement was monitored by calculating Rfree based on a subset containing 5% of the total reflections. Model geometry was verified using the program PROCHECK (36Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. PROCHECK: a program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are detailed in Table 1. All structure figures were prepared using PyMOL (37DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2002Google Scholar). A 96-well plate was coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of recombinant human TNFα (5 μg/ml). Blocking treatment was performed at 37 °C for 2 h. Before addition to the coated plate, different dilutions of infliximab were incubated with 3 μg/ml biotin-labeled Yisaipu® (recombinant human TNFR2-Fc fusion protein, also known as etanercept, which is biosimilar to Enbrel; a product of CPGJ Pharmaceutical, Ltd., Shanghai, China) in PBS. Preincubation mixtures were added to the coated plate. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the wells were washed, and an appropriate dilution of HRP-conjugated avidin was used for detection. After the addition of tetramethylbenzidine and stop solution, the absorbance was read at 450 nm with a microplate reader. The percentage of inhibition was calculated using the following formula: Percent inhibition = (A450 max − A450 sample)/(A450 max − A450 blank) × 100. E-F loop replacement mutants (into GGGG and SGGSGGSGGSG) and site-directed mutants (Q67A, K112A, R138A, and Y141A) were created using PCR. The mutants were expressed and purified as described for wild-type protein. The infliximab Fab was immobilized onto the surface of a CM-5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) via amine coupling following the manufacturer's instructions. Maximal electrostatic interaction was obtained with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (data not shown). Infliximab Fab immobilization levels ranging from ∼1,000 to 1,500 resonance units were regularly obtained. For binding experiments, the BIAcore T100 (GE Healthcare) instrument was operated at 25 °C, and the assay buffer was PBS (20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0 and 150 mm NaCl). The contact time (the period during which the analyte, TNFα mutants 4 and 11, was perfused over the chip) was limited to 300 s, and the flow rate was set at 30 μl/min. For chip surface regeneration, a 10 mm glycine, pH 2.0 solution was used to dissociate the bound TNF at the end of each experiment while retaining surface integrity. The coordinates and structural factors of infliximab Fab in complex with TNFα were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 4G3Y. To elucidate the mechanism of TNFα inhibition through the therapeutic antibody infliximab, the Fab fragment of infliximab and functional TNFα were co-purified and crystallized. The crystal structure of the TNFα-infliximab Fab complex was determined using the molecular replacement method and refined to 2.6-Å resolution with a final Rwork value of 19.4% (Rfree = 23.9%) in space group H3 (Table 1). Although there is only one TNFα-infliximab Fab complex molecule in one asymmetric unit, the structure revealed a central TNFα trimer bound by three symmetrically arranged infliximab Fab molecules related through a crystallographic 3-fold axis (Fig. 1). This observation is analogous to the structures of TNFα-TNFR2 (26Mukai Y. Nakamura T. Yoshikawa M. Yoshioka Y. Tsunoda S. Nakagawa S. Yamagata Y. Tsutsumi Y.

https://openalex.org/W1974421300,"Newly discovered fossils of primitive birds from China, preserved with ovarian follicles intact, show that birds only had one functioning ovary at any given time from a very early date, but that other features, such as skeletal and sexual maturity, remained very dinosaur-like. A window on the evolving reproductive capacities of birds is opened by the analysis of newly discovered fossils of primitive birds from the Mesozoic era of China. The specimens, more than 120 million years old, are of three mother birds and are the first in which the soft tissue of the ovaries is preserved. The fossils show that birds had only one functioning ovary at any given time from a very early stage of their evolution, but that other features of the skeleton and sexual maturation remained very dinosaur-like. The two groups of archosaurs, crocodilians and birds, form an extant phylogenetic bracket for understanding the reproductive behaviour of dinosaurs. This behaviour is inferred from preserved nests and eggs, and even gravid individuals1. Data indicate that many ‘avian’ traits were already present in Paraves—the clade that includes birds and their close relatives—and that the early evolution of the modern avian form of reproduction was already well on its way2,3. Like living neornithine birds, non-avian maniraptorans had daily oviposition and asymmetrical eggs with complex shell microstructure, and were known to protect their clutches4,5,6. However, like crocodilians, non-avian maniraptorans had two active oviducts (one present in living birds), relatively smaller eggs, and may not have turned their eggs in the way that living birds do1,6. Here we report on the first discovery of fossilized mature or nearly mature ovarian follicles, revealing a previously undocumented stage in dinosaur reproduction: reproductively active females near ovulation. Preserved in a specimen of the long bony-tailed Jeholornis and two enantiornithine birds from the Early Cretaceous period lacustrine Jehol Biota in northeastern China, these discoveries indicate that basal birds only had one functional ovary, but retained primitive morphologies as a result of their lower metabolic rate relative to living birds. They also indicate that basal birds reached sexual maturity before skeletal maturity, as in crocodiles and paravian dinosaurs. Differences in follicular morphology between Jeholornis and the enantiornithines are interpreted as forming an evolutionary gradient from the reproductive condition in paravian dinosaurs towards neornithine birds. Furthermore, differences between the two enantiornithines indicate that this lineage might also have evolved advanced reproductive traits in parallel to the neornithine lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2008326956,"The androgen receptor (AR) stimulates and represses gene expression to promote the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. Here, we report that androgen represses the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster through AR and anti-androgen drugs block the androgen-repression of the miRNA cluster. AR directly binds to the host gene of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster, LINC00478. Expression of the cluster is repressed or activated by chromatin remodelers EZH2 or JMJD3 in the presence or absence of androgen, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis reveals a significant enrichment of targets of miR-99a, let-7c and miR-125b in androgen-induced gene sets, suggesting that downregulation of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster by androgen protects many of their target mRNAs from degradation and indirectly assists in the gene induction. We validated the hypothesis with 12 potential targets of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster induced by androgen: 9 out of the 12 mRNAs are downregulated by the microRNA cluster. To ascertain the biological significance of this hypothesis, we focused on IGF1R, a known prostate cancer growth factor that is induced by androgen and directly targeted by the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster. The androgen-induced cell proliferation is ameliorated to a similar extent as anti-androgen drugs by preventing the repression of the microRNAs or induction of IGF1R in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. Expression of a microRNA-resistant form of IGF1R protects these cells from inhibition by the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster. These results indicate that a thorough understanding of how androgen stimulates prostate cancer growth requires not only an understanding of genes directly induced/repressed by AR, but also of genes indirectly induced by AR through the repression of key microRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2026795663,"The endocannabinoid 2-AG is produced by the enzyme diacylglycerol lipase (DGL). The authors show that DGLα is phosphorylated and inhibited by calcium/calmodulin–dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Inhibition of CaMKII activity increases striatal DGL activity and basal 2-AG amounts, and augments short-term retrograde endocannabinoid signaling at striatal glutamatergic synapses. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) mediates activity-dependent depression of excitatory neurotransmission at central synapses, but the molecular regulation of 2-AG synthesis is not well understood. Here we identify a functional interaction between the 2-AG synthetic enzyme diacylglycerol lipase-α (DGLα) and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Activated CaMKII interacted with the C-terminal domain of DGLα, phosphorylated two serine residues and inhibited DGLα activity. Consistent with an inhibitory role for CaMKII in 2-AG synthesis, in vivo genetic inhibition of CaMKII increased striatal DGL activity and basal levels of 2-AG, and CaMKII inhibition augmented short-term retrograde endocannabinoid signaling at striatal glutamatergic synapses. Lastly, blockade of 2-AG breakdown using concentrations of JZL-184 that have no effect in wild-type mice produced a hypolocomotor response in mice with reduced CaMKII activity. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the molecular regulation of striatal endocannabinoid signaling with implications for physiological control of motor function."
https://openalex.org/W1998518875,"Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a class of lipid messengers involved in a variety of physiological processes. To understand how PA mediates cell functions in plants, we used a PA affinity membrane assay to isolate PA-binding proteins from Camelina sativa followed by mass spectrometric sequencing. A cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC) was identified to bind to PA, and detailed analysis was carried out subsequently using GAPC1 and GAPC1 from Arabidopsis. The PA and GAPC binding was abolished by the cation zinc whereas oxidation of GAPCs promoted the PA binding. PA had little impact on the GAPC catalytic activity in vitro, but the PA treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings induced proteolytic cleavage of GAPC2 and inhibited Arabidopsis seedling growth. The extent of PA inhibition was greater in GAPC-overexpressing than wild-type seedlings, but the greater PA inhibition was abolished by application of zinc to the seedling. The PA treatment also reduced the expression of genes involved in PA synthesis and utilization, and the PA-reduced gene expression was partially recovered by zinc treatment. These data suggest that PA binds to oxidized GAPDH and promotes its cleavage and that the PA and GAPC interaction may provide a signaling link coordinating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

Biological membranes are composed of different types of lipids with distinct properties and functions. Lipids in the membrane not only structurally compartmentalize the cell but also act as second messengers to transduce cellular signals.

In addition to regulating the catalytic activity, PA may tether its binding proteins to membranes. PA tethers ABI1 to the plasma membrane, resulting in prevention of ABI1 from translocation into the nucleus where it binds to ATHB6, a transcription factor that negatively regulates ABA responses (18Zhang W. Qin C. Zhao J. Wang X. Phospholipase Dα1-derived phosphatidic acid interacts with ABI1 phosphatase 2C and regulates abscisic acid signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, PA-mediated sequestration of proteins to membranes seems to be a conserved mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in response to PA turnover in different organisms. To understand how PA functions as a lipid mediator, we undertook an untargeted approach to identify PA-interacting proteins and found cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a potential PA-interacting protein. GAPDH catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in glycolysis, which provides substrate for acetyl-CoA for synthesis of various cellular compounds including lipids (28Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Lipid biosynthesis.Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis has two cytosolic GAPDHs, GAPC1 and GAPC2, and a recent study showed that both GAPCs interact with phospholipase Dδ (PLDδ), which directly produces signaling PA by hydrolyzing common membrane phospholipids (29Guo L. Devaiah S.P. Narasimhan R. Pan X. Zhang Y. Zhang W. Wang X. Cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases interact with phospholipase Dδ to transducer hydrogen peroxide signals in the Arabidopsis response to stress.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 2200-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These observations raise intriguing questions about the function and significance of PA-GAPC interactions. This report describes the identification and characterization of PA-GAPC interaction and its physiological significance in Arabidopsis seedling growth. Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (Col-0) and T-DNA insertion knock-out lines of gapc2 (SALK_016539 and SALK_070902) were obtained from ABRC (Ohio State University). The knock-out mutants were screened for homozygotes as described previously (29Guo L. Devaiah S.P. Narasimhan R. Pan X. Zhang Y. Zhang W. Wang X. Cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases interact with phospholipase Dδ to transducer hydrogen peroxide signals in the Arabidopsis response to stress.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 2200-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Transgenic lines overexpressing GAPC2 were generated by cloning GAPC2 (At1g13440) cDNA into p35S-FAST/eYFP vector and transforming the DNA constructs into Arabidopsis by floral dipping. Seeds were surface-sterilized with 70% (v/v) ethanol and 20% (v/v) bleach followed by washing four times with water. Seeds were stratified at 4 °C for 2 days and germinated in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog medium with 1.5% (w/v) sucrose under a light cycle of 12-h light/12-h dark at 22 °C. After 5 days, seedlings were transferred to 1/2 Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with various reagents depending on experiments. For lipid treatment, lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were prepared by drying the chloroform under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas and resuspending the dried lipid in water followed by sonication before being added to the medium. Approximately 1 g of 3-week-old wild-type Camelina (Camelina sativa) seedlings grown in soil was ground with liquid nitrogen. Proteins were extracted by adding 4 ml of protein extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) and cleared by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay, and ∼500 μg of total proteins was used for nitrocellulose membrane binding assay. The assay was carried out as described previously (30Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. A phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase pleckstrin homology domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Approximately 10 μg of lipid dissolved in chloroform was spotted on a piece of nitrocellulose membrane (0.45-μm pore; Whatman) and air-dried for at least 30 min. The membrane was incubated with TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA for 1 h to block the membrane, washed three times with TBST buffer, and incubated with proteins overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times with TBST buffer to remove unbound proteins, and bound proteins were either eluted or probed by immunoblotting as described below. Proteins bound to the PA-nitrocellulose membrane were eluted by incubation of the membrane with 9 m urea for 1 h and recovered as described previously (31Wessel D. Flügge U.I. A method for the quantitative recovery of protein in dilute solution in the presence of detergents and lipids.Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar). The resulting protein pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE separation. The protein bands were carefully excised from the gel, and proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C overnight following the manufacturer's instruction. The digested peptides were run on the LC-tandem MS using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The database search was done with peptide mass fingerprint data using MASCOT v2.2 database search engine (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) against the NCBI database for A. thaliana. The criteria for a significant protein identification were both at least two unique peptides per protein identified and each peptide showing a probability >80% (MASCOT ion score >30). The assay was performed as described previously (22Guo L. Mishra G. Taylor K. Wang X. Phosphatidic acid binds and stimulates Arabidopsis sphingosine kinases.J. Biol.

Liposomes were prepared according to the Avanti Polar Lipids Technical Support. PC and PA (or PE) were mixed in the molar ratio of 3:1 and with the total amount of 10 μmol and dried with a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. Lipids were rehydrated for 1 h with HBS buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide). Small unilamellar vesicles were produced by a mild sonication using a bath sonicator until the solution became nearly clear, and centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min removed large particles. The liposome pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA) and incubated with 10 μg of purified proteins for 1 h. Liposomes were harvested by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 30 min, washed three times with the binding buffer, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for immunoblotting. Protein samples were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on 10% (v/v) polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run at 100 V for ∼1 h and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 1 h, followed by washing with methanol:water:acetic acid (3:6:1, v/v/v) to remove background stain. For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane using the Semidry Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk for 1 h, followed by washing three times with TBST buffer. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies (anti-His6 from Sigma-Aldrich, anti-FLAG and anti-histone H3 from GenScript, and anti-PEPC from Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) for 1 h. After washing three times with TBST buffer, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies from mouse or rabbit conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h, followed by colorimetric detection of the proteins using alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instruction. SPR assay was performed as described previously (22Guo L. Mishra G. Taylor K. Wang X. Phosphatidic acid binds and stimulates Arabidopsis sphingosine kinases.J. Biol.

Briefly, a sensor chip preimmobilized with nitrilotriacetic acid was used to capture purified, His-tagged GAPC1 or GAPC2. Response unit (RU) was monitored using a Biacore 2000 system as liposomes composed of 18:1PA+18:1PC (1:3 in molar ratio) or 18:1PC only were injected onto the chip. The sensorgrams were plotted by Microsoft Office Excel (2007), and kinetic constants were calculated by Prism v5 (GraphPad Software). GAPC was cloned into pET-28a-c(+) vector, expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS, and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as described previously (29Guo L. Devaiah S.P. Narasimhan R.

Plant tissues were ground with extraction buffer (50 mm MES, pH 8.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mm spermidine) and centrifuged at 3,400 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with the extraction buffer without Triton X-100 four times at 2,200 × g for 10 min, 1,700 × g for 10 min, 1,700 × g for 8 min, 1,700 × g for 6 min, all at 4 °C. The final pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 5 mm EDTA) and used as a nuclear fraction. Supernatant from the centrifugation at 3,400 × g was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was used as a cytosolic fraction. Total RNA was extracted from plant tissues using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified by Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and checked for integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA was digested by RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) at 37 °C for 30 min, and the enzyme was inactivated with RQ1 DNase Stop Solution at 65 °C for 10 min. cDNA was synthesized by a qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, MD) with a blend of random and oligo(dT) primers. The reaction was at 42 °C for 30 min with preincubation at 22 °C for 5 min and enzyme inactivation at 85 °C for 5 min. The cDNA was amplified with a Taq polymerase using gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S1) through the following thermal cycling conditions: predenaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and final polymerization at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were resolved and visualized on 1% (w/v) agarose gel. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were confirmed by amplifying ubiquitin 10. For qRT-PCR, PCR progress was monitored by adding SYBR Green dye using the Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The gene expression was normalized with ubiquitin 10 as an internal standard. To discover PA-binding proteins, we used a PA-on-nitrocellulose membrane to incubate with total proteins extracted from an oilseed crop C. sativa in an initial attempt to study the PA signaling in seed lipid metabolism. Proteins bound to the membrane were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Several protein bands were present or increased in the PA affinity membrane fraction, but they were absent or detected in a lower level in the membrane applied with the carrier solvent (chloroform) only. These proteins were sequenced by mass spectrometry. Because the Camelina genome has not been fully sequenced, the protein sequences were blasted against the Arabidopsis data base based on genetic similarity between the two closely related plant species (>90% in genomic identity) (34Hutcheon C. Ditt R.F. Beilstein M. Comai L. Schroeder J. Goldstein E. Shewmaker C.K. Nguyen T. De Rocher J. Kiser J. Polyploid genome of Camelina sativa revealed by isolation of fatty acid synthesis genes.BMC Plant Biol. 2010; 10: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mass spectrometry-based protein sequencing identified several candidate PA-binding proteins. Some of them were enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as GAPDH, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, and phosphoglycerate kinase. We also identified known PA-binding proteins, such as annexin, a PA-binding protein found in animals (35Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Phosphatidic acid- and phosphatidylserine-binding proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and some isoforms of heat shock protein (Hsp81-3), and tubulins (α2/4) previously identified (36Testerink C. Dekker H.L. Lim Z.Y. Johns M.K. Holmes A.B. Koster C.G. Ktistakis N.T. Munnik T. Isolation and identification of phosphatidic acid targets from plants.Plant J. 2004; 39: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Among the protein candidates identified, GAPDH was particularly of interest because it was recently found to interact directly with PLDδ (29Guo L. Devaiah S.P. Narasimhan R. Pan X. Zhang Y. Zhang W. Wang X. Cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases interact with phospholipase Dδ to transducer hydrogen peroxide signals in the Arabidopsis response to stress.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 2200-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), an enzyme responsible for PA production. In addition, GAPDH is one of the key enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway that is critical for energy production and biosynthesis for various compounds, including acetyl-CoA and lipids (Fig. 1B). Thus, the present study is focused on the characterization of the PA and GAPDH interaction. Arabidopsis has two cytosolic GAPDHs, GAPC1 and GAPC2, which share high amino acid sequence identify (>95%; supplemental Fig. S1). GAPC1 and GAPC2 cDNAs were cloned from Arabidopsis, expressed in E. coli as recombinant proteins, and affinity-purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2A). Both purified GAPC1 and GAPC2 effectively converted their substrate (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) into product (1,3-bisphosphoglycerate), and thus they were catalytically active (Fig. 2B). The nitrocellulose membrane binding assay using the purified proteins demonstrated that both GAPCs bound to PA on the membrane, but not to other phospholipids tested, including PC, PE, PS, PI, or PG (Fig. 3, A and B). No binding was detected in the empty vector control. SPHK1, a sphingosine kinase known to bind to PA (22Guo L. Mishra G. Taylor K. Wang X. Phosphatidic acid binds and stimulates Arabidopsis sphingosine kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 13336-13345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was included as a positive control for the PA binding assay. In addition, GAPCs did not bind to either of two common polyphosphoinositides PI(4)P or PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3C). Exposure of the membrane to iodine indicated the presence of the two phosphoinositide lipids on the membrane, suggesting that the failure of detecting positive binding was not due to absence of the lipids from the membrane (Fig. 3C). We then performed a liposome binding assay to further confirm the interaction between PA and GAPC. Because liposomes are unlikely to be formed by PA alone due to the small size of its head group forming a cone-shaped structure (37Barr F.A. Shorter J. Membrane traffic: do cones mark sites for fission?.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R141-R144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we generated liposomes composed of PA and PC. Both GAPCs bound to PA-containing liposomes as SPHK1 did, but negligibly to those composed of either PC only or PC and PE (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the binding was specific to PA. The membrane binding assay using PA species with different acyl chain compositions indicated that both GAPCs bound virtually to all PA types tested except dioctanoyl (8:0) PA (Fig. 3B). However, GAPCs bound to lip"

These intracellular inclusions are largely composed of misfolded α-synuclein (AS), a neuronal protein that is abundant in the vertebrate brain. Point mutations in AS are associated with rare, early-onset forms of PD, although aggregation of the wild-type (WT) protein is observed in the more common sporadic forms of the disease. Here, we employed multidimensional solid-state NMR experiments to assess A53T and E46K mutant fibrils, in comparison to our recent description of WT AS fibrils. We made de novo chemical shift assignments for the mutants, and used these chemical shifts to empirically determine secondary structures. We observe significant perturbations in secondary structure throughout the fibril core for the E46K fibril, while the A53T fibril exhibits more localized perturbations near the mutation site. Overall, these results demonstrate that the secondary structure of A53T has some small differences from the WT and the secondary structure of E46K has significant differences, which may alter the overall structural arrangement of the fibrils."

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in the degradation of tight junction protein during infection with rat nematode lungworm Angiostrongylus cantonensis. The results showed that phosphorylation of IκB and NF-κB was increased in mice with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis. Treatment with MG132 reduced the phosphorylation of NF-κB and the activity of MMP-9, indicating upregulation of MMP-9 through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Claudin-5 was reduced in the brain but elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), implying that A. cantonensis infection caused tight junction breakdown and led to claudin-5 release into the CSF. Degradation of claudin-5 coincided with alteration of the blood-CSF barrier permeability and treatment with the MMP inhibitor GM6001 attenuated the degradation of claudin-5. These results suggested that degradation of claudin-5 was caused by MMP-9 in angiostrongyliasis meningoencephalitis. Claudin-5 could be used for the pathophysiologic evaluation of the blood-CSF barrier breakdown and tight junction disruption after infection with A. cantonensis."

We apply this approach to study variation in transcriptional responsiveness to pathogen components in dendritic cells from recombinant inbred mouse strains. We identify reQTLs that correlate with particular stimuli and position them in known pathways. For example, in response to a virus-like stimulus, a trans-acting variant responds as an activator of the antiviral response; using RNA interference, we identify Rgs16 as the likely causal gene.

https://openalex.org/W2151935808,"BACE1 and presenilin (PS)/γ-secretase play a major role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by regulating amyloid-β peptide generation. We recently showed that these secretases also regulate the processing of voltage-gated sodium channel auxiliary β-subunits and thereby modulate membrane excitability. Here, we report that KCNE1 and KCNE2, auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels, undergo sequential cleavage mediated by either α-secretase and PS/γ-secretase or BACE1 and PS/γ-secretase in cells. Elevated α-secretase or BACE1 activities increased C-terminal fragment (CTF) levels of KCNE1 and 2 in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and rat neuroblastoma (B104) cells. KCNE-CTFs were then further processed by PS/γ-secretase to KCNE intracellular domains. These KCNE cleavages were specifically blocked by chemical inhibitors of the secretases in the same cell models. We also verified our results in mouse cardiomyocytes and cultured primary neurons. Endogenous KCNE1- and KCNE2-CTF levels increased by 2-to 4-fold on PS/γ-secretase inhibition or BACE1 overexpression in these cells. Furthermore, the elevated BACE1 activity increased KCNE1 processing and shifted KCNE1/KCNQ1 channel activation curve to more positive potentials in HEK cells. KCNE1/KCNQ1 channel is a cardiac potassium channel complex, and the positive shift would lead to a decrease in membrane repolarization during cardiac action potential. Together, these results clearly showed that KCNE1 and KCNE2 cleavages are regulated by BACE1 and PS/γ-secretase activities under physiological conditions. Our results also suggest a functional role of KCNE cleavage in regulating voltage-gated potassium channels.—Sachse, C. C., Kim, Y. H., Agsten, M., Huth, T., Alzheimer, C., Kovacs, D. M., and Kim, D.

In this report, we describe the existence of a MYC-protein kinase A (PKA)-polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) signaling loop in cells. We report that sequential MYC phosphorylation by PKA and PLK1 protects MYC from proteasome-mediated degradation. Interestingly, short term pan-PKA inhibition diminishes MYC level, whereas prolonged PKA catalytic subunit α (PKACα) knockdown, but not PKA catalytic subunit β (PKACβ) knockdown, increases MYC. We show that the short term effect of pan-PKA inhibition on MYC is post-translational and the PKACα-specific long term effect on MYC is transcriptional. These data also reveal distinct functional roles among PKA catalytic isoforms in MYC regulation. We attribute this effect to differential phosphorylation selectivity among PKA catalytic subunits, which we demonstrate for multiple substrates. Further, we also show that MYC up-regulates PKACβ, transcriptionally forming a proximate positive feedback loop.

PKACβ2 protein containing the N-terminal HA and His6 tag was purified from transiently transfected COS and PC3 cells either by immunoprecipitation using an antibody against the HA tag or by Ni-affinity chromatography (further enriched by anion-exchange chromatography). Total RNA from mammalian cells was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using the Superscript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was performed as per the instruction in the iScript qRT-PCR kit (Bio-Rad). -Fold difference in gene expression was determined after normalizing against GAPDH or TATA-binding protein (TBP) (as mentioned in the legends). Primers used for qRT-PCR are: MYC (134 bp), 5′-GCTCTCCTCGACGGAGTCC-3′ and 5′-CCACAGAAACAACATCGATTTCTT-3′; PKACβ(240 bp), 5′-TGGTGGGCATTAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGTGAGTTTTTATATCACTGAC-3′; PKACβ2 (191 bp), 5′-AACCACCTTGTAACCAGTAT-3′ and 5′-TTTGGCTAGAAACTCTTTCA-3′; TBP (100 bp), 5′-GCCAGCTTCGGAGAGTTCTG-3′ and 5′-GCACGAAGTGCAATGGTCTTT-3′; GAPDH (226 bp), 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT-3′ and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′.

Kinase assay was carried out for 2 h at room temperature and stopped using 2× Laemmli buffer. After in vitro kinase assay, the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. The PVDF membrane was also stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to reveal protein loading. 50 mg/ml PKACα in 8 m urea, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Tween 20 was co-polymerized in the gel, and RIKA was performed as described previously (23Li X.

Purified recombinant MYC and MYC mutants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The proteins on the membrane were refolded using the buffer conditions used in RIKA. The membrane was incubated with purified active recombinant PLK1 (PLK1T210D) for 2 h in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm DTT) and [γ-32P]ATP. The membrane was washed with water overnight to remove nonspecifically bound ATP. Phosphorylation of MYC by PLK1 was detected by autoradiography. In-gel tryptic digestion was performed as described previously (23Li X. Guan B. Srivastava M.K. Padmanabhan A. Hampton B.S. Bieberich C.J.

Desalted tryptic peptides were analyzed by nano-LC-tandem MS on a linear ion-trap mass spectrometer (LTQ; Thermo Fisher). Acquired data were searched against a Homo sapiens protein database or phosphoproteome database using the TurboSEQUEST algorithm (Thermo Fisher). Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-treated glass coverslips in 6-well plates. PC3 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected using lipoD293T (Signagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS.

During our efforts to identify PKA substrates in prostate cancer cells, we identified α-enolase as a PKACα substrate (Table 1). An alternative in-frame internal translation initiating at +291 of the α-enolase mRNA yields an alternate product termed MYC promoter-binding protein 1 (MBP1) (24Feo S. Arcuri D. Piddini E. Passantino R. Giallongo A.

We confirmed both ENO1 and MBP1 to be substrates of PKACα by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4E). Because MBP1 is a known transcriptional repressor of MYC, we sought to determine whether phosphorylation of MBP1 by PKA has an effect on MBP1 function and steady-state MYC level (25Chaudhary D. Miller D.M. The c-myc promoter-binding protein (MBP-1) and TBP bind simultaneously in the minor groove of the c-myc P2 promoter.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We monitored changes in endogenous MYC level in prostate cancer cells treated with the PKA-selective small molecule inhibitor H89 by Western blotting. Pan-PKA inhibition using H89 resulted in decreased MYC accumulation in prostate cancer cells (Fig. 1A). This was found to be consistent in HeLa and K562 cells as well (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of PKA using the PKA-specific peptide inhibitor PKI also destabilized MYC (Fig. 1C). Conversely, activation of PKA using forskolin increased MYC levels (Fig. 1D). Although these results were consistent with our initial hypothesis, the rapid kinetics suggested that the effect could be the result of a direct interaction between PKA and MYC. To determine whether the effect of PKA on MYC is transcriptional, we evaluated changes in MYC mRNA levels upon PKA inhibition by qRT-PCR. The MYC mRNA level did not change upon H89 treatment, suggesting the effect of PKA inhibition on MYC to be post-transcriptional (Fig. 1E). Because MYC is degraded in cells via the 26S proteasome, we determined whether inhibition of proteasome activity rescues the effect of PKA inhibition on MYC accumulation. MG132 rescued the effect of PKA inhibition, thereby demonstrating that PKA protects MYC from 26S proteasome-mediated degradation (Fig. 1F).TABLE 1PKACα substrates identified by mass spectrometryProtein nameAccession numberRankMascot scorePeptides matchedSequence coveragePredicted mass kDa/pIKnown PKA substrate?%ATP synthase subunit β (ATPB)P065761124143856.5/5.2NoActin, cytoplasmic 1 (β-actin)P6070915872441.7/5.3YesTriose phosphate isomerase I (TPI I)P601741153126326.6/6.4NoElongation factor 1δP296921131103831.1/4.9NoHetrogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNP H)P3194329092149.1/5.8No40S ribosomal protein SA (p40)P0886517093832.8/4.7NoThyroid receptor-interacting protein 13 (TRIP-13)Q15645151123148.5/5.7NoUbiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L5 (UCHL5)Q9Y5K5159195237.5/5.2NoComplement component 1Q subcomponent-binding proteinQ0702116563831.3/4.7NoUbiquitin carboxyl-terminal Hydrolase isozyme L3 (UCHL3)P15374112595126.1/4.8No78-kDa glucose-regulated protein precursor (GRP 78)P110211155152672.2/5.0NoT-complex protein 1 subunit θP509901144253459.5/5.4Noα-Enolase (ENO1)P06733181245447.1/7.0NoHistone-binding protein (RBBP4)Q0902817471947.6/4.7NoPeptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B precursorP232841148125222.7/9.3NoGlucosidase 2 subunit β PrecursorP14314172102159.3/4.3NoMethyl-CpG-binding domain protein 4Q95243152202766/9.1NoHistone H2BCAB025451NAaNA, not applicable.15NAaNA, not applicable.13.9/10.3YesFamily with sequence similarity 82EAW91638185103531/6.21Noa NA, not applicable.

DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether PKA can phosphorylate MYC, we performed in vitro kinase reactions using recombinant PKACα and MYC in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. PKA efficiently phosphorylated MYC, and the phosphorylation was inhibited by H89 (Fig. 2, A and C). LC-MS2 analysis identified Ser-279 as a PKA phospho-acceptor site on MYC (Fig. 2B and supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The ability of PKA to phosphorylate a MYCS279A mutant in vitro was nearly extinguished compared with WT-MYC (MYCWT), demonstrating Ser-279 as the major PKA phospho-acceptor site on MYC (Fig. 2C). Ser-279 is a predicted PKA phosphorylation site and is situated within an evolutionarily conserved region between the N-terminal transactivation and C-terminal DNA binding domains in MYC (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, the region spanning Ser-279 is predicted to be solvent-exposed and intrinsically disordered (data not shown). Such intrinsically disordered domains have been implicated in the regulation of protein stability (26Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Intrinsically unstructured proteins and their functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar). To determine whether the site phosphorylated by PKA on MYC is accessible and able to be phosphorylated in vivo, we transfected His6-3×HA-tagged MYC in PC3 cells. The cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection, lysed (using 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and Complete protease inhibitor), and MYC was purified using Ni-affinity chromatography. The purified MYC was divided in half. One half was completely dephosphorylated by hydrogen fluoride (HF) treatment as described (27Li X. Rao V. Jin J. Guan B. Anderes K.L. Bieberich C.J. Identification and validation of inhibitor-responsive kinase substrates using a new paradigm to measure kinase-specific protein phosphorylation index.J. Proteome Res. 2012; 11: 3637-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The remaining half was left untreated and contained the pool of MYC molecules that retained their in vivo phosphorylation status. We performed a RIKA with PKA in the gel on the HF-treated and untreated purified MYC samples. If MYC is phosphorylated in vivo at the site phosphorylated by PKA in vitro (in a RIKA), then we would expect an increase in phosphorylation signal in the HF-treated samples (because these sites would be dephosphorylated upon HF treatment and become available to be phosphorylated during the RIKA). Total levels of MYC loaded in these samples were quantified by anti-HA Western blotting, and the change in phosphorylation signal was calculated after normalization as described previously (27Li X. Rao V. Jin J. Guan B. Anderes K.L. Bieberich C.J. Identification and validation of inhibitor-responsive kinase substrates using a new paradigm to measure kinase-specific protein phosphorylation index.J. Proteome Res. 2012; 11: 3637-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This process is illustrated in Fig. 3A. We observed ∼50% increase in MYC phosphorylation upon HF treatment, suggesting that 50% of the in vivo MYC population in the cells was phosphorylated at the PKA site under the given culture conditions (Fig. 3B). Importantly, endogenous PKA and MYC co-localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3C). To ascertain whether MYC phosphorylation at Ser-279 by PKA affected the MYC steady-state level, HA-tagged MYCWT and MYCS279A were transfected into PC3 cells, and the effect of PKA inhibition on their accumulation was analyzed. Whereas MYCWT was destabilized upon H89 treatment, the steady-state level of MYCS279A was unresponsive to PKA inhibition (Fig. 3D). Further, the MYCS279A steady-state level was considerably lower compared with MYCWT (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser-279 by PKA plays a role in stabilizing MYC in cells. No difference in subcellular localization between the endogenous MYC, HA-tagged MYCWT and HA-tagged MYCS279A mutant was observed (data not shown). A recent report showed the region spanning Ser-279 to constitute a phospho-degron (Fig. 4A). PLK1-mediated βtrcp binding within this region was shown to stabilize MYC (18Popov N. Schülein C. Jaenicke L.A. Eilers M. Ubiquitylation of the amino terminus of Myc by SCF(β-TrCP) antagonizes SCF(Fbw7)-mediated turnover.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, neither the events preceding PLK1 phosphorylation nor the PLK1 phospho-acceptor site(s) on MYC is known. Because both PLK1 and PKA phosphorylate residues within this phospho-degron, we sought to clarify their roles. We found that the effect of combined inhibition of PKA and PLK1 on MYC stability is more profound compared with inhibiting either kinase alone (Fig. 4B). We hypothesized three possible scenarios: (i) PKA and PLK1 phosphorylate the same residue on MYC (i.e. Ser-279) and hence elicit a similar response; (ii) PKA and PLK1 phosphorylate mutually independent residues on MYC within the phospho-degron; and (iii) PKA phosphorylates MYC at Ser-279, which primes PLK1 to phosphorylate an adjacent residue within the phospho-degron by relieving the inhibitory effect of the polo-box domain or by making an adjacent site a more favorable PLK1 phospho-acceptor (Fig. 4C). To distinguish among these models, we performed an in vitro kinase reaction using recombinant PLK1T210D and recombinant MYC, which was either prephosphorylated by PKA in vitro using nonradiolabeled ATP (primed) or not prephosphorylated by PKA (unprimed). His6-tagged MYC purified from E. coli was prephosphorylated by in vitro kinase assay using recombinant PKACα and nonradiolabeled ATP. Nonphosphorylated MYC served as the unprimed control. Subsequently, H89 (30 μm), was added to all reactions to inhibit PKA activity. The absence of radiolabeling upon further incubation (1 h at room temperature) of the reactions containing MYC, PKA and H89 with [γ-32P]ATP confirmed complete inactivation of PKA by H89. Recombinant PLK1T210D and [γ-32P]ATP was then added to these tubes containing either primed or unprimed MYC. The in vitro kinase reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature. Radioactive labeling of MYC by PLK1T210D was assessed by running the reaction on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferring to a PVDF membrane followed by autoradiography. We used the PLK1T210D mutant version of PLK1 because it was previously shown to be constitutively active. The mutation at Thr-210 mimics the phosphorylation of PLK1 at this site within the activation loop, and phosphorylation at Thr-210 is necessary for PLK1 activation (28Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Polo-like kinase-1 is a target of the DNA damage checkpoint.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We observed that the phosphorylation signal of MYC by PLK1T210D (using [γ-32P]ATP) was higher when MYC was primed by PKA (using nonradiolabeled ATP) compared with unprimed MYC (Fig. 4D). This result suggested that PKA phosphorylation at Ser-279 on MYC primes subseq"
https://openalex.org/W1978099988,"Nectin-like molecule 2 (Necl-2)/cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is shown to be down-regulated by the promoter hypermethylation and/or loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 11q23.2 in many types of cancers, including lung and breast cancers, and is proposed to serve as a tumor suppressor. However, the incidence of these epigenetic and genetic abnormalities of Necl-2 is 30-60% in these cancers, and other mechanisms for the suppression of Necl-2 are presumed to be present. We previously showed that Necl-2 interacts in cis with ErbB3 and suppresses the heregulin (HRG)-induced ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling for cell movement and death. We studied here the relationship between Necl-2 and microRNA-199a (miR-199a) that is up-regulated or down-regulated in a variety of cancers. miR-199a did not directly target the Necl-2 mRNA or affect its mRNA level in human lung cancer A549 cells and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. Necl-2 was at least sialylated by the sialyltransferase ST6 β-galactosamide α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1). miR-199a targeted ST6GAL1 and reduced both the sialylation and the protein level of Necl-2. In addition, miR-199a enhanced the HRG-induced ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling. These results indicate that the suppressive role of Necl-2 in the HRG-induced ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling is regulated by miR-199a at least through the reduction of the ST6GAL1-catalyzed sialylation of Necl-2 and/or through the reduction of the protein level of Necl-2 presumably by the protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2028041504,"The transmembrane serine protease MarP is important for pH homeostasis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Previous structural studies revealed that MarP contains a chymotrypsin fold and a disulfide bond that stabilizes the protease active site in the substrate-bound conformation. Here, we determined that MarP is located in the Mtb periplasm and showed that this localization is essential for function. Using the recombinant protease domain of MarP, we identified its substrate specificity using two independent assays: positional-scanning synthetic combinatorial library profiling and multiplex substrate profiling by mass spectrometry. These methods revealed that MarP prefers bulky residues at P4, tryptophan or leucine at P2, arginine or hydrophobic residues at P1, and alanine or asparagine at P1'. Guided by these data, we designed fluorogenic peptide substrates and characterized the kinetic properties of MarP. Finally, we tested the impact of mutating MarP cysteine residues on the peptidolytic activity of recombinant MarP and its ability to complement phenotypes of Mtb ΔMarP. Taken together, our studies provide insight into the enzymatic properties of MarP, its substrate preference, and the importance of its transmembrane helices and disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W2040951702,"Human skin largely comprises collagenous extracellular matrix. The hallmark of skin aging is fragmentation of collagen fibrils. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are largely responsible for collagen degradation. MMP-1, principally derived from dermal fibroblasts, is the major protease capable of initiating degradation of native fibrillar collagens. Presently, we report that CCN1, a secreted and extracellular matrix-associated protein, is elevated in aged human skin dermal fibroblasts in vivo and stimulates MMP-1 expression through functional interaction with αVβ3 integrin in human dermal fibroblasts. CCN1 contains four conserved structural domains. Our results indicate that the three N-terminal domains (IGFBP, VWC, and TSP1), but not the C-terminal CT domain, are required for CCN1 to stimulate MMP-1 expression. This stimulation is dependent on interaction between the active structural domains and αVβ3 integrin. The interaction of VWC domain with integrin αVβ3 is necessary and requires functional cooperation with adjacent IGFBP and TSP1 domains to stimulate MMP-1 expression. Finally, induction of MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts by CCN1 N-terminal domains resulted in fragmentation of type I collagen fibrils in a three-dimensional collagen lattice model. These data suggest that domain-specific interactions of CCN1 with αVβ3 integrin contribute to human skin aging by stimulating MMP-1-mediated collagen fibril fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2070923415,"Cellulase enzymes cleave glycosidic bonds in cellulose to produce cellobiose via either retaining or inverting hydrolysis mechanisms, which are significantly pH-dependent. Many fungal cellulases function optimally at pH ~5, and their activities decrease dramatically at higher or lower pH. To understand the molecular-level implications of pH in cellulase structure, we use a hybrid, solvent-based, constant pH molecular dynamics method combined with pH-based replica exchange to determine the pK(a) values of titratable residues of a glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 6 cellobiohydrolase (Cel6A) and a GH family 7 cellobiohydrolase (Cel7A) from the fungus Hypocrea jecorina. For both enzymes, we demonstrate that a bound substrate significantly affects the pKa values of the acid residues at the catalytic center. The calculated pK(a) values of catalytic residues confirm their proposed roles from structural studies and are consistent with the experimentally measured apparent pKa values. Additionally, GHs are known to impart a strained pucker conformation in carbohydrate substrates in active sites for catalysis, and results from free energy calculations combined with constant pH molecular dynamics suggest that the correct ring pucker is stable near the optimal pH for both Cel6A and Cel7A. Much longer molecular dynamics simulations of Cel6A and Cel7A with fixed protonation states based on the calculated pK(a) values suggest that pH affects the flexibility of tunnel loops, which likely affects processivity and substrate complexation. Taken together, this work demonstrates several molecular-level effects of pH on GH enzymes important for cellulose turnover in the biosphere and relevant to biomass conversion processes."
https://openalex.org/W2014131147,"This study provides the first direct evidence for the dual role of the metalloprotease FtsH in membrane protein biogenesis. Using the physiological substrate DrrAB, it is shown that FtsH is not only responsible for proteolysis of unassembled DrrB protein but also plays a much broader role in biogenesis of the DrrAB complex. Previous studies showed that the stable expression of DrrB in the membrane depends on simultaneous expression of DrrA. Here we show that DrrB is proteolyzed by FtsH when it is expressed alone. Moreover, DrrA and DrrB proteins expressed together in a temperature-sensitive ftsH mutant strain of Escherichia coli were found to be nonfunctional due to their incorrect assembly. Simultaneous expression of wild-type FtsH in trans resulted in normal doxorubicin efflux. Strikingly, doxorubicin efflux could be restored in mutant cells irrespective of whether FtsH was expressed simultaneously with DrrAB or expressed after these proteins had already accumulated in an inactive conformation, thus providing crucial evidence for the ability of FtsH to refold the misassembled proteins. Complementation experiments also showed that the catalytic AAA domain of FtsH contains a chaperone-like activity, however, unlike wild-type FtsH, it was unable to restore function. Our results therefore show for the first time that FtsH contains the protease as well as refolding functions, and both the AAA and the proteolytic domains of FtsH are required for each of these activities."

Nevertheless, heparanase deglycanation of the N-terminal HS-rich domain of syndecan-1 (SDC1), but not SDC2 or -4, is a prerequisite for binding of the prosecretory mitogen lacritin (Ma, P., Beck, S.

https://openalex.org/W2036297987,"Mucosally adherent Escherichia coli is frequently observed in intestinal surface of patients with colorectal cancer, but rarely in healthy control. Particularly, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is known to be closely associated with colorectal carcinogenesis in human. In this study, one consequence of EPEC infection in human intestinal cancer cells was induction of macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1), which is a multifunctional cytokine with biological activities involved in cancer cell growth, differentiation and migration. The present investigation assessed the involvement of MIC-1 protein in EPEC infection-mediated cancer cell survival. The challenge with EPEC induced cancer cell detachment via cytoskeleton rearrangement, which was positively associated with induced MIC-1 expression. Moreover, MIC-1 also mediated RhoA GTPase-linked survival of the detached cancer cells. Blocking of MIC-1 or RhoA activity increased cellular apoptosis of the detached cancer cells. In terms of signaling pathway, MIC-1 triggered transforming growth factorβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which enhanced expression of RhoA GTPase. We conclude that EPEC enhances MIC-1 gene expression in the human intestinal cancer cells, which can be associated with enhanced tumor cell resistance to anchorage-dependent tumor cell death via enhanced TAK1 and RhoA GTPase."
https://openalex.org/W2079420190,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes a transcription factor, Rta, which is required to activate the transcription of EBV lytic genes. This study demonstrates that treating P3HR1 cells with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, causes the accumulation of SUMO-Rta and promotes the expression of EA-D. GST pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation studies reveal that RNF4, a RING-domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacts with Rta. RNF4 also targets SUMO-2-conjugated Rta and promotes its ubiquitination in vitro. Additionally, SUMO interaction motifs in RNF4 are important to the ubiquitination of Rta because the RNF4 mutant with a mutation at the motifs eliminates ubiquitination. The mutation of four lysine residues on Rta that abrogated SUMO-3 conjugation to Rta also decreases the enhancement of the ubiquitination of Rta by RNF4. This finding demonstrates that RNF4 is a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase of Rta. Finally, knockdown of RNF4 enhances the expression of Rta and EA-D, subsequently promoting EBV lytic replication and virions production. Results of this study significantly contribute to efforts to elucidate a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates Rta ubiquitination to influence the lytic development of EBV."

Here, we purified ECs from tumorous and normal human breast tissues, and studied the effect of radiation on angiogenesis and relevant molecular mechanisms in these cells. We found that in normal tissue-derived ECs (NECs), 4 Gy irradiation increased tube formation, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway activation. In cancer-derived ECs (CECs), however, 4 Gy irradiation significantly reduced tube formation, increased the production of angiostatin and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and upregulated AKT and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway activation. Knockdown experiments showed that siMMP-2 efficiently inhibited tube formation by irradiated NECs, whereas siPlasminogen effectively attenuated the radiation-induced suppression of tube formation and the upregulation of angiostatin in CECs. Moreover, siIL-6 clearly inhibited the radiation-induced generation of angiostatin in CECs. Inhibition of ERK with a pharmacological inhibitor or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) markedly suppressed the radiation-induced tube formation and MMP-2 upregulation in NECs, whereas the inhibition of either AKT or JNK with pharmacological inhibitor or siRNA treatment of CECs markedly attenuated the inhibition of tube formation and the upregulation of angiostatin and IL-6 caused by 4 Gy irradiation. These observations collectively demonstrate that there are distinct differences in the radiation responses of NECs and CECs, and might provide important clues for improving the efficacy of radiation therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2050113155,"Regulatory β-subunits of large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels play an important role in generating functional diversity and control of cell surface expression of the pore forming α-subunits. However, in contrast to α-subunits, the role of reversible post-translational modification of intracellular residues on β-subunit function is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the human β4-subunit is S-acylated (palmitoylated) on a juxtamembrane cysteine residue (Cys-193) in the intracellular C terminus of the regulatory β-subunit. β4-Subunit palmitoylation is important for cell surface expression and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit of the β4-subunit alone. Importantly, palmitoylated β4-subunits promote the ER exit and surface expression of the pore-forming α-subunit, whereas β4-subunits that cannot be palmitoylated do not increase ER exit or surface expression of α-subunits. Strikingly, however, this palmitoylation- and β4-dependent enhancement of α-subunit surface expression was only observed in α-subunits that contain a putative trafficking motif (… REVEDEC) at the very C terminus of the α-subunit. Engineering this trafficking motif to other C-terminal α-subunit splice variants results in α-subunits with reduced surface expression that can be rescued by palmitoylated, but not depalmitoylated, β4-subunits. Our data reveal a novel mechanism by which palmitoylated β4-subunit controls surface expression of BK channels through masking of a trafficking motif in the C terminus of the α-subunit. As palmitoylation is dynamic, this mechanism would allow precise control of specific splice variants to the cell surface. Our data provide new insights into how complex interplay between the repertoire of post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms controls cell surface expression of BK channels.

Our data provide new insights into how complex interplay between the repertoire of post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms controls cell surface expression of BK channels. The pore-forming α-subunits of large conductance voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels assemble with a number of accessory regulatory β- and γ-subunits (1Orio P. Rojas P. Ferreira G.

These regulatory subunits provide a mechanism to increase the functional diversity of BK channels in different tissues by modifying their calcium and/or voltage sensitivity, channel kinetics, surface expression, or regulation by a range of signaling molecules and toxins. Indeed, loss of function of these regulatory subunits is associated with disruption of normal physiological processes ranging from control of vascular tone (3Brenner R. Peréz G.J. Bonev A.D.

Thus, mechanisms that dynamically control the functional regulation of α-subunits by regulatory subunits represent important determinants of physiological control. Indeed, BK channels are dynamically regulated by a diverse range of reversible post-translational modifications. However, in contrast to the extensive post-translational modification of intracellular residues of the pore-forming α-subunit, reversible post-translational modification of regulatory subunits is very poorly characterized. Increasing evidence supports an important role for the only reversible lipid post-translational modification of proteins, S-acylation (palmitoylation), as an important mechanism to control a wide diversity of ion channels, including BK channels (7Shipston M.J. Ion channel regulation by protein palmitoylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8709-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the BK channel regulatory β4-subunit is S-acylated (palmitoylated) at a cysteine residue in the C terminus juxtaposed to the second transmembrane domain. Palmitoylation of the β4-subunit controls surface expression of BK channels and thus represents an important additional regulatory step in controlling BK channel properties and function.

An N-terminal FLAG tag was generated by PCR amplification using forward and reverse primers, forward 5′-ACGGTACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGGCAAATGGTGGC-3′, and reverse 5′-CACTATCATGAGCTCAAACAC-3′, to add the FLAG tag with a KpnI digestion site upstream of its start codon.

To engineer the C-terminal heptapeptide REVEDEC from the ZERO (MDA-DEC) variant into the MAN-ERL variant to generate MAN-REVEDEC, the last 7 residues of MAN-ERL were swapped with REVEDEC using PCR primers, forward 5′-GTC CTT CCC TAC TGT TTG-3′, and reverse 5′-CCTCTAGATCAACATTCATCTTCAACTTCTCTCTTCTGTTTGTCCCGGG-3′, and the subsequent amplicon was ligated into a PacI and XbaI backbone from MAN-ERL.

The palmitoylation-deficient mutant C193A was generated using: forward 5′-TGTGGTCCTGACCATCGCTGCCAAGAGCTTGGCG-3′, and reverse 5′-ACCGCCAAGCTCTTGGCAGCGATGGTCAGGACCAC-3′ primers. The trafficking-competent mutant (KAAX), in which Lys-206 and Arg-207 were mutated to alanine, was generated by PCR amplification using a forward internal CMV primer within the vector backbone and a reverse primer 5′-ACGGGCCCTCTAGATTAAGAGAACTTGGCCGCCTTC-3′ and an NheI and XbaI fragment ligated into the β4-subunit backbone. Constructs with a C-terminal Myc tag (β4-Mycc) were also trafficking-competent and generated by PCR using forward 5′-ACTGCTTACTGGCTTATCG-3′, and reverse 5′-ACTCGAGTTAAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCAGAGAACTTGC-3′ primers, TOPO-cloned, digested with NheI and XbaI, and ligated into pcDNA3.1. To generate β4-subunits with an extracellular Myc tag (β4-Myce), the KOD mutagenesis kit (Novagen) using primer pairs forward 5′-TGGAAAGATGAGCAGAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTTGGTTCCCAGCC-3′, and reverse 5′-TGGCTGGGAACCAAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTCTGCTCATCTTTCC-3′ was used on the respective constructs. Inclusion of the Myce tag had no effect on wild-type (WT) or C193A mutant channel expression or localization. All constructs were verified by sequencing. HEK293 cells and N2a neurons were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS. For imaging experiments, cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass in 6-well cluster plates at 15–20% confluency, and 24 h later, they were transfected with the respective plasmids using ExGen 500 and used 48 h after transfection. For N2a, cells were differentiated for 48 h after transfection in DMEM containing 1% BSA. Quantitative cell surface labeling of N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged BK channel α-subunits in nonpermeabilized cells was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, 50 μg/μl) and secondary anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 543 (Invitrogen, 1:1000). Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 3% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin plus 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. For total BK channel expression, either the intracellular C-terminal HA epitope tag was probed with anti-HA polyclonal rabbit antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. 1:500) followed by Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes, 1:1000) or the FLAG tag was probed with anti-FLAG antibody with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000). To detect β4-subunits, two approaches were used. For β4-subunits lacking an epitope tag, we used a mouse monoclonal antibody targeted to an extracellular epitope of β4 (NeuroMab clone L18A/3). In nonpermeabilized and permeabilized conditions, primary antibody dilutions were 1:300 and 1:1200, respectively, with anti-mouse secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 543. For β4-subunits with a Myc epitope tag, the extracellular Myce tag was detected using rabbit anti-Myc (Immune Systems) at 1:300 prior and anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 647 prior to fixation and permeabilization. Total β4-subunit expression (Mycc) was determined following cell fixation and permeabilization as above by probing with rabbit anti-Myc (Immune Systems) at 1:1000 and anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 647 (1:1000) as appropriate. Cells were mounted in Mowiol and dried at room temperature in the dark overnight before image acquisition. Confocal images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope, using a 63× oil Plan Apochromat (NA = 1.4) objective lens, at Nyquist sampling rates in multitracking mode to minimize channel crosstalk. Three-dimensional image stacks were deconvolved using Huygens (Scientific Volume Imaging), and cell surface expression of full-length channels was determined by quantitative immunofluorescence by calculating the surface (FLAG) to total channel protein (−HA or intracellular FLAG) ratio using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).

Transfected HEK293 cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10 mg/ml fatty acid free BSA for 30 min at 37 °C before incubation with 0.25 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h at 37 °C essentially as described (11Tian L.

Cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, and centrifuged, and channel fusion proteins were captured using magnetic microbeads (μMACSTM epitope tag isolation kits, Miltenyi Biotech). Following extensive washing, captured proteins were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, dried, and exposed to light-sensitive film at −80 °C using a KODAK BioMax TranScreen LE (Amersham Biosciences). The same membrane was then reprobed with either an anti-β4 antibody (NeuroMab L18A/3) or an anti-Myc tag as appropriate. Acyl-RAC of mouse cerebellum was performed with a modification of the acyl-RAC method described by Forrester et al. (13Forrester M.T. Hess D.T. Thompson J.W. Hultman R. Moseley M.A. Stamler J.S.

Briefly, cerebellar from mice aged 8–12 weeks were rapidly isolated and immediately homogenized with a Dounce on ice in lysis buffer containing 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.5 containing a protease inhibitor mixture and further disrupted through a 25-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min with the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Protein was diluted to 2 mg/ml in blocking buffer (100 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% EDTA, pH 7.5), and free thiols blocked with 0.1% methyl methanethiosulfonate at 40 °C for 4 h. Proteins were precipitated with ice-cold acetone, the pellet was washed five times with 70% acetone, and the final pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 7.5). Half of the resuspension was incubated with 250 mm HEPES or 250 mm neutral hydroxylamine, and proteins were captured on thiopropyl-Sepharose beads for 2.5 h at room temperature. Beads were washed five times in binding buffer, and proteins were eluted in elution buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 50 mm DTT, pH 7.5. Eluates were subject to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and probed with anti-β4 antibody as above. Macropatch recordings were performed using the inside-out patch clamp configuration at room temperature essentially as described (14Petrik D. Brenner R. Regulation of STREX exon large conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels by the β4 accessory subunit.Neuroscience. 2007; 149: 789-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the extracellular recording solution was composed of 140 mm KMeSO3, 2 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3. The internal solution was composed of 140 mm KMeSO3, 2 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm HEDTA, pH 7.3, with CaCl2 added to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm. Voltage protocols and acquisition were controlled using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Digidata 1440A using pCLAMP10. Conductance-voltage (G/V) relationships were constructed from tail currents recorded using test pulses from −100 to 120 mV followed by a step to a negative voltage (−80 mV), and V0.5 max was determined from Boltzmann fits of the normalized G/V curves. Activation and deactivation time constants were determined by fitting to an exponential function. All data are presented as means ± S.E. with N = number of independent experiments and n = number of individual cells analyzed in imaging assays. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett's test with significance set at p < 0.05. Using the CSS-Palm v3.0 palmitoylation prediction algorithm at high threshold (10Ren J. Wen L. Gao X. Jin C. Xue Y. Yao X. CSS-Palm 2.0: an updated software for palmitoylation sites prediction.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we identified a single predicted cysteine residue (Cys-193, CSS-Palm prediction score = 1.67; Fig. 1A), highly conserved across species, that is juxtaposed to transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) in the intracellular C terminus of the human β4-subunit (gene name KCNMB4). To test whether β4-subunits are palmitoylated, we took two approaches. Firstly, the β4-subunit was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells that were metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate. Immunoprecipitation of the β4-subunits revealed robust incorporation of [3H]palmitate into β4-subunits (Fig. 1B). Mutation of the predicted palmitoylated cysteine residue Cys-193 to alanine (C193A) abolished [3H]palmitate incorporation without affecting protein expression of the mutated C193A β4-subunit (Fig. 1B). Secondly, using acyl-RAC (13Forrester M.T. Hess D.T. Thompson J.W. Hultman R. Moseley M.A. Stamler J.S. Casey P.J. Site-specific analysis of protein S-acylation by resin-assisted capture.J. Lipid Res. 2011; 52: 393-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) that allows determination of hydroxylamine-sensitive thioester bonds that couple S-acylated cysteine residues to their cognate lipid, we identified β4-subunit S-acylation in native mouse brain (Fig. 1C). In many proteins, S-acylation controls trafficking and surface delivery of transmembrane proteins. To examine whether palmitoylation of β4-subunits affects their surface expression and trafficking per se, we undertook quantitative immunofluorescence assays. Using an antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope expression of the WT β4-subunits in HEK cells revealed no significant surface expression (Fig. 1E) and predominant intracellular retention in the ER in agreement with previous studies (15Shruti S. Urban-Ciecko J. Fitzpatrick J.A. Brenner R. Bruchez M.P. Barth A.L. The brain-specific β4 subunit downregulates BK channel cell surface expression.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e33429Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The C193A palmitoylation-deficient mutant had no significant effect on β4-subunit expression or localization (Fig. 1E). To improve the sensitivity of β4-subunit detection at the cell surface expression, we also engineered a β4-subunit with a Myc tag (Myce) in the extracellular domain between transmembrane domains 1 and 2. Probing for the Myce tag revealed low, but detectable, levels of β4-subunit surface expression, with predominant intracellular ER retention, and surface expression was abolished below the limit of detection with the C193A mutant. β4-Subunits are retained in the ER by a putative ER retention signal (KKXX) in the C terminus of the subunit (15Shruti S. Urban-Ciecko J. Fitzpatrick J.A. Brenner R. Bruchez M.P. Barth A.L. The brain-specific β4 subunit downregulates BK channel cell surface expression.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e33429Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of our assay, we engineered two trafficking-competent β4-subunits to allow characterization of the role of palmitoylation in β4-subunit trafficking. Firstly, we mutated the central Lys-206 and Arg-207 amino acids of the KKXX ER retention motif to alanine (KAAX construct), leading to a significantly enhanced cell surface expression of the KAAX mutant when compared with WT (Fig. 1E). Secondly, we found that similar enhancement of cell surface expression of the β4-subunit was manifest in constructs in which a Myc tag (Mycc) was engineered at the very C terminus of the β4-subunit (Fig. 1, D and E). For example, surface expression of constructs that included both Mycc and Myce tags was 5.5 ± 0.7-fold greater than constructs with the Myce tag alone. Combination of the KAAX mutation and Mycc tag had no further effect on cell surface expression, suggesting that the C-terminal Mycc tag masks the ER retention signal in the β4-subunit. Importantly, cell surface expression of the trafficking-competent β4-subunits (KAAX or Mycc constructs) was dramatically reduced in palmitoylation-deficient β4-subunits with the C193A mutation (Fig. 1, D and E) with the palmitoylation-deficient subunits now predominantly localized to the ER (Fig. 1F). This suggests that palmitoylation of Cys-193 is important in controlling the exit of the β4-subunit from the ER. In accordance with trapping of the C193A β4-subunit mutant in the ER, the C193A mutation did not affect the mobility of the β4-subunit in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B), suggesting that core glycosylation of the β4-subunits, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (16Jin P. Weiger T.M. Levitan I.B. Reciprocal modulation between the β and β4 subunits of hSlo calcium-dependent potassium channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43724-43729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was unaffected by the cysteine mutation. Furthermore, palmitoylation-dependent trafficking of the trafficking-competent β4-subunits was also observed upon overexpression in N2a neurons, revealing that this effect is not restricted to cell type. For example, surface expression of β4-subunits with the palmitoylation-deficient C193A mutation was expressed at 49.1 ± 3.3% of the WT palmitoylated β4-subunits in N2a neurons. In parallel, ER retention of the C193A β4-subunit mutant was increased when compared with the WT β4-subunits (Pearson's R was 0.72 ± 0.02 and 0.62 ± 0.04, respectively). Previous studies have reported that β4-subunits may either down-regulate BK channel surface expression (15Shruti S. Urban-Ciecko J. Fitzpatrick J.A. Brenner R. Bruchez M.P. Barth A.L. The brain-specific β4 subunit downregulates BK channel cell surface expression.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e33429Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or conversely enhance surface expression of the related pH-sensitive Kcnu1 (Slo3) pore-forming subunits (17Yang C.-T. Zeng X.-H. Xia X.-M. Lingle C.J. Interactions between β subunits of the KCNMB family and Slo3: β4 selectively modulates Slo3 expression and function.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). β4-Subunits assemble with the BK channel pore-forming α-subunits in the ER (16Jin P. Weiger T.M. Levitan I.B. Reciprocal modulation between the β and β4 subunits of hSlo calcium-dependent potassium channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43724-43729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and as depalmitoylated β4-subunits are retarded in the ER, we hypothesized that β4-subunits control the surface expression of α-subunits by restricting their exit from the ER. In initial studies, we used the ZERO variant of murine BK channels that encodes from the initiator methionine MDAL … and terminates in the C-terminal variant … REVEDEC (here also referred to as MDA-DEC, see Fig. 4A). We exploited a co-expression strategy in HEK293 cells and used quantitative immunofluorescence to determine the subcellular localization and trafficking of the ZERO variant in the presence and absence of the WT and C193A mutant β4-subunit. Expression of the ZERO variant alone leads to robust expression with a proportion of the channel localizing with the ER (Fig. 2, A and B) as well as at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, A and C). Co-expression with WT β4-subunits resulted in a significant reduction of the ZERO channel variant co-localizing with the ER and subsequent increased expression at the cell surface (Fig. 2, A–C). This suggests that the WT β4-subunit facilitated ER export and trafficking of the ZERO variant to the cell surface. In contrast, expression of the C193A mutant of the β4-subunit had no significant effect on ER localization of the ZERO variant and did not result in an increased expression of the α-subunit at the cell surface (Fig. 2, A–C). Thus, the palmitoylation-deficient β4-subunit cannot facilitate ER export and surface expression of the ZERO variant. Similar data were produced either using the extracellular Myc-tagged β4-subunit constructs and staining for surface expression using anti-Myc antibody or using untagged β4-subunits and staining with an β4-subunit antibody directed to an extracellular epitope. β4-Myce and β4-C193A-Myce increased ZERO surface expression by 174.7 ± 10.3 and 112.6 ± 8.2%, respectively, when compared with ZERO, whereas labeling with anti-β4 revealed an increase of 160.4 ± 7.9 and 103.5 ± 5.8% for WT β4 and β4-C193A, respectively. However, palmitoylation-deficient β4-subunits did not significantly suppress ZERO variant expression at the cell surface or enhance ZERO retention in the ER. This suggests that the β4-subunit normally acts to promote ZERO surface expression but that this is dependent upon β4-subunits being palmitoylated. The ZERO variant itself is also palmitoylated at three cysteine residues within the intracellular S0-S1 loop (Cys-53, -54, and -56), and depalmitoylation of this site retards cell surface expression of the α-subunit (18Tian L. McClafferty H. Knaus H.-G. Ruth P. Shipston M.J. Distinct acyl protein transferases and thioesterases control surface expression of calcium-activated potassium channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14718-14725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Jeffries O. Geiger N. Rowe I.C.M. Tian L. McClafferty H. Chen L. Bi D. Knaus H.-G. Ruth P.

Chem. 2010; 285: 33307-33314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether the palmitoylated β4-subunit could override the effect of depalmitoylation of the α-subunit and enhance its cell surface expression. Expression of the ZERO-C53:54:56A mutant, which cannot be palmitoylated, results in a significant decrease (reduced by 57.8 ± 6.3%) of cell surface expression when compared with the wild-type ZERO α-subunit alone. Co-expression of the ZERO-C53:54:56A mutant with WT β4-subunits resulted in rescue of surface expression of the depalmitoylated α-subunit to levels of the WT α-subunit (Fig. 2D). Again this was dependent on palmitoylation of the β4-subunits as the C193A β4-subunit mutant failed to rescue cell surface expression of the ZERO-C53:54:56A α-subunits (Fig. 2D). Thus, palmitoylated β4-subunits can override the inhibitory effects of ZERO α-subunit depalmitoylation on cell surface expression, suggesting that in cells that express β4-subunits, this mechanism may predominate. β4-Subunits are predominantly, albeit not exclusively, expressed in many neurons and endocrine cells (6Brenner R.

https://openalex.org/W2141466842,"The Bacillus subtilis protein YybT (or GdpP) and its homologs were recently established as stress signaling proteins that exert their biological effect by degrading the bacterial messenger cyclic di-AMP. YybT homologs contain a small Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain (~80 amino acids) that can bind b-type heme with 1:1 stoichiometry despite the small size of the domain and the lack of a conserved heme iron-coordinating residue. We determined the solution structure of the PAS domain of GtYybT from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans by NMR spectroscopy to further probe its function. The solution structure confirms that PASGtYybT adopts the characteristic PAS fold composed of a five-stranded antiparallel β sheet and a few short α-helices. One α-helix and three central β-strands of PASGtYybT are noticeably shorter than those of the typical PAS domains. Despite the small size of the protein domain, a hydrophobic pocket is formed by the side chains of nonpolar residues stemming from the β-strands and α-helices. A set of residues in the vicinity of the pocket and in the C-terminal region at the dimeric interface exhibits perturbed NMR parameters in the presence of heme or zinc protoporphyrin. Together, the results unveil a compact PAS domain with a potential ligand-binding pocket and reinforce the view that the PASYybT domains function as regulatory domains in the modulation of cellular cyclic di-AMP concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2094549338,"Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is essential for adenovirus infection to target cells, and its constitutive expression in various cancerous and normal tissues has been reported. Recently, the biological role of CAR in human cancers of several different origins has been investigated with respect to tumor progression, metastasis and tumorigenesis. However, its biological function in tumor cells remains controversial. Here we report the critical role of CAR in growth regulation of oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) in vitro and in vivo via the specific interaction with Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Loss of endogenous CAR expression by knockdown using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) against CAR facilitates growth suppression of SCC cells due to cell dissociation, followed by apoptosis. The consequent morphological reaction was reminiscent of anoikis, rather than epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and the dissociation of oral SCC cells was triggered not by lack of contact with extracellular matrix, but by loss of cell-to-cell contact caused by abnormal translocation of E-cadherin from surface membrane to cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitation assays of the CAR-transfected oral SCC cell line, HSC-2, with or without ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) revealed that CAR directly associates with ROCKI and ROCKII, which results in inhibition of ROCK activity and contributes to maintenance of cell-to-cell adhesion for their growth and survival. Based on these findings, in vivo behavior of CAR-downregulated HSC-2 cells from siRNA knockdown was compared with that of normally CAR-expressing cells in intraperitoneally xenografted mouse models. The mice engrafted with CAR siRNA-pretreated HSC-2 cells showed poor formation of metastatic foci in contrast to those implanted with the control siRNA-pretreated cells. Thus, CAR substantially has an impact on growth and survival of oral SCC cells as a negative regulator of ROCK in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2097157575,"Vasovagal responses (VVRs) are characterized by transient drops in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) and increased amplitude of low-frequency oscillations in the Mayer wave frequency range. Typical VVRs were induced in anesthetized, male, Long-Evans rats by sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS). VVRs were also produced by single sinusoids that transiently increased BP and HR, by 70-90° nose-up tilts, and by 60° tilts of the gravitoinertial acceleration vector using translation while rotating (TWR). The average power of the BP signal in the Mayer wave range increased substantially when tilts were >70° (0.91 g), i.e., when linear accelerations in the x–z plane were ≥0.9–1.0 g. The standard deviations of the wavelet-filtered BP signals during tilt and TWR overlaid when they were normalized to 1 g. Thus, the amplitudes of the Mayer waves coded the magnitude of the linear acceleration ≥1 g acting on the head and body, and the average power in this frequency range was associated with the generation of VVRs. These data show that VVRs are a natural outcome of stimulation of the vestibulosympathetic reflex and are not a disease. The results also demonstrate the usefulness of the rat as a small animal model for studying human VVRs.—Cohen, B., Martinelli, G. P., Raphan, T., Schaffner, A., Xiang, Y., Holstein, G.

https://openalex.org/W1979183109,"Fcγ receptor (FcγR) clustering on monocytes/macrophages results in phagocytosis and inflammatory cytokine production, which serve to eliminate antibody-opsonized targets and activate neighboring immune cells. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which recognizes a range of both bacterial and fungal components, elicits strong proinflammatory responses in these cells when stimulated by ligands, either natural or synthetic. Thus, we explored the possibility that TLR2 agonists could strengthen FcγR activity within the context of antibody therapy. Human peripheral blood monocytes treated with the TLR2 agonist Pam2CSK4 showed significantly enhanced FcγR-mediated cytokine production as well as phagocytic ability. An examination of the molecular mechanism behind this enhancement revealed increased expression of both FcγRIIa and the common γ subunit following Pam2CSK4 treatment. Interestingly however, expression of the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb was also modestly increased. Further investigation revealed that Pam2CSK4 also dramatically decreased the expression of SHIP, the major mediator of FcγRIIb inhibitory activity. Using a murine Her2/neu solid tumor model of antibody therapy, we found that Pam2CSK4 significantly enhanced the ability of anti-Her2 antibody to reduce the rate of tumor growth. To verify that the FcγR enhancement was not unique to the diacylated Pam2CSK4, we also tested Pam3CSK4, a related triacylated TLR2 agonist. Results showed significant enhancement in FcγR function and expression. Taken together, these findings indicate that TLR2 activation can positively modulate FcγR and suggest that TLR2 agonists should be considered for testing as adjuvants for antitumor antibody therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2083953028,"Protein kinase D2 (PKD2) is a member of the PKD family of serine/threonine kinases, a subfamily of the CAMK super-family. PKDs have a critical role in cell motility, migration and invasion of cancer cells. Expression of PKD isoforms is deregulated in various tumours and PKDs, in particular PKD2, have been implicated in the regulation of tumour angiogenesis. In order to further elucidate the role of PKD2 in tumours, we investigated the signalling context of this kinase by performing an extensive substrate screen by in vitro expression cloning (IVEC). We identified a novel splice variant of calcium and integrin-binding protein 1, termed CIB1a, as a potential substrate of PKD2. CIB1 is a widely expressed protein that has been implicated in angiogenesis, cell migration and proliferation, all important hallmarks of cancer, and CIB1a was found to be highly expressed in various cancer cell lines. We identify Ser118 as the major PKD2 phosphorylation site in CIB1a and show that PKD2 interacts with CIB1a via its alanine and proline-rich domain. Furthermore, we confirm that CIB1a is indeed a substrate of PKD2 also in intact cells using a phosphorylation-specific antibody against CIB1a-Ser118. Functional analysis of PKD2-mediated CIB1a phosphorylation revealed that on phosphorylation, CIB1a mediates tumour cell invasion, tumour growth and angiogenesis by mediating PKD-induced vascular endothelial growth factor secretion by the tumour cells. Thus, CIB1a is a novel mediator of PKD2-driven carcinogenesis and a potentially interesting therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2038941715,"Conformational rearrangements in antibody·antigen recognition are essential events where kinetic discrimination of isomers expands the universe of combinations. We investigated the interaction mechanism of a monoclonal antibody, M1, raised against E7 from human papillomavirus, a prototypic viral oncoprotein and a model intrinsically disordered protein. The mapped 12-amino acid immunodominant epitope lies within a “hinge” region between the N-terminal intrinsically disordered and the C-terminal globular domains. Kinetic experiments show that despite being within an intrinsically disordered region, the hinge E7 epitope has at least two populations separated by a high energy barrier. Nuclear magnetic resonance traced the origin of this barrier to a very slow (t½ ∼4 min) trans-cis prolyl isomerization event involving changes in secondary structure. The less populated (10%) cis isomer is the binding-competent species, thus requiring the 90% of molecules in the trans configuration to isomerize before binding. The association rate for the cis isomer approaches 6 × 107 m−1 s−1, a ceiling for antigen-antibody interactions. Mutagenesis experiments showed that Pro-41 in E7Ep was required for both binding and isomerization. After a slow postbinding unimolecular rearrangement, a consolidated complex with KD = 1.2 × 10−7 m is reached. Our results suggest that presentation of this viral epitope by the antigen-presenting cells would have to be “locked” in the cis conformation, in opposition to the most populated trans isomer, in order to select the specific antibody clone that goes through affinity and kinetic maturation.

Specific recognition of foreign antigens by antibodies is the primary event in the immune system's fight against disease. Antibodies are at the center of humoral, cellular, and innate responses. The first molecular understanding of antibody·antigen recognition came from the x-ray structure of antibody molecules (1Poljak R.J. Amzel L.M. Avey H.P. Becka L.N. Structure of Fab′ New at 6 Å resolution.Nat. New Biol. 1972; 235: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To date, there are nearly 800 antigen-antibody structures (2Allcorn L.C. Martin A.C. SACS. Self-maintaining database of antibody crystal structure information.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a large body of information from bioinformatics analyses has been accumulated (3Lund O. Nielsen M. Lundegaard C. Kesmir C. Brunak S. Immunological Bioinformatics. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2005: 69-102Google Scholar), and a number of general rules were extracted together with some thermodynamic information on binding interfaces (4Sundberg E.J. Mariuzza R.A. Molecular recognition in antibody-antigen complexes.Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 119-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It was recognized early that a large number of antigen-antibody complexes underwent substantial conformational changes upon formation (5Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Antibody-antigen interactions. New structures and new conformational changes.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the fact that these structures provide exquisite detail for those changes, the comparison of structures of liganded and unliganded antibodies and epitopes cannot discriminate changes that occur after interaction between the molecules (induced fit) from those resulting of a preexisting equilibrium (conformational selection). The discrimination between these two scenarios from either the antibody or the antigen side is of utmost importance in immunological terms and requires detailed kinetic mechanistic investigation. Conformational heterogeneity in antibodies has long been known. The idea that antibodies produced by a given B-cell from a single sequence could present more than one fold or conformer was first proposed by Pauling in 1940 (6Pauling L. A theory of the structure and process formation of antibodies.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1940; 62: 2643Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and later demonstrated by Foote and Milstein in 1994 (7Foote J. Milstein C. Conformational isomerism and the diversity of antibodies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10370-10374Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Different conformations adopted by a single antibody sequence may react with different antigens, which is the basis for cross-reactivity, a fundamental phenomenon behind autoimmunity and allergy (8James L.C. Roversi P. Tawfik D.S. Antibody multispecificity mediated by conformational diversity.Science. 2003; 299: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 9Oldstone M.B. Molecular mimicry and immune-mediated diseases.FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, antibody conformational isomerism has direct implications for antibody diversity and the expansion of the immune repertoire. James et al. (8James L.C. Roversi P. Tawfik D.S.

Crystallographic and pre-steady-state kinetic analyses showed that the antibody adopted at least two different conformations (8James L.C. Roversi P. Tawfik D.S.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12730-12735Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Antigen recognition starts by selection of one of these conformers, and this first complex subsequently undergoes an induced fit conformational transition (8James L.C. Roversi P. Tawfik D.S. Antibody multispecificity mediated by conformational diversity.Science. 2003; 299: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 10James L.C. Tawfik D.S.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12730-12735Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Multiple conformations and conformational selection events on the antigen side have also been reported. In a leucine zipper model, the antibody selected a pre-existing monomeric conformer and shifted the equilibrium from a native coiled-coil to a monomeric, unfolded species (11Leder L. Berger C. Bornhauser S. Wendt H. Ackermann F. Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R.

A somehow different example comes from an epitope within the folded dimeric transcriptional regulator E2 from human papillomavirus (HPV). 5The abbreviations used are: HPVhuman papillomavirusIDPintrinsically disordered protein. In this case, the rate constant for antibody association was rather slow (104 m−1 s−1), indicative of a conformational rearrangement of the antigen as the rate-limiting step (13Cerutti M.L. Ferreiro D.U. Sanguineti S. Goldbaum F.A. de Prat-Gay G.

Peptide epitopes are mostly unstructured but show conformational tendencies in solution, and a correlation between these structural tendencies and antigenicity was observed (14Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Antigenic peptides.FASEB J. 1995; 9: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the absence of stable structure, Xaa-Pro peptide bonds can populate both the cis and trans isomers to measurable degrees. Cis-trans isomerization thus provides a molecular switch that works in the minute time scale and can expand the conformational repertoire of proteins. Recent evidence shows that proline isomerization in both disordered and globular domains can regulate the kinetics of processes such as phage infection (15Eckert B. Martin A. Balbach J. Schmid F.X.

However, in many of these cases, the evidence is indirect, and in none of them was the kinetic mechanism of recognition addressed. The HPV E7 oncoprotein is the main transforming factor of this pathogen, involved in many types of neoplasias, cervical cancer being the most significant (see Ref. 22McLaughlin-Drubin M.E. Münger K. The human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein.Virology. 2009; 384: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar for a review). E7 is also a tumor virus-transforming protein and a model protein targeting the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator (Rb). By targeting Rb for proteasomal degradation, E7 causes the release of the transcription factor E2F and forces the cells into S phase in order to use the cell machinery for DNA replication and further transcription of other early and late genes required for the completion of the virus life cycle (23Münger K. Basile J.R. Duensing S. Eichten A. Gonzalez S.L. Grace M. Zacny V.L. Biological activities and molecular targets of the human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7888-7898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the immunological point of view and as the major transforming protein, E7 is constitutively expressed at high levels in carcinoma tissues, and antibodies are found in sera at higher frequency in patients with cervical cancer (24Galloway D.A. Serological assays for the detection of HPV antibodies.IARC Sci. Publ. 1992; : 147-161PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, E7 and derivatives are being exploited both in diagnostics and therapeutic vaccination (25Cerutti, M. L., Alonso, L. G., Tatti, S., de Prat-Gay, G., Long-lasting immunoprotective and therapeutic effects of a hyperstable E7 oligomer based vaccine in a murine human papillomavirus tumor model. Int. J.

Ther. 2008; 8: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). E7 also emerges as a paradigmatic example of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) (27Uversky V.N. Roman A. Oldfield C.J.

Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 1829-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). IDPs are fully functional, most often “promiscuous binders” related to cell signaling pathways (28Boehr D.D. Nussinov R.

N., Intrinsically disordered proteins from A to Z. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 43, 1090–1103.Google Scholar), characterized by extended conformations without canonical secondary structure and by the lack of tertiary structure. IDPs are enriched in particular among viral proteins, which are often multifunctional, because viruses are required to have a minimal amount of genes (30Tokuriki N. Oldfield C.J. Uversky V.N.

HPV16 E7 was shown to be an extended, non-globular protein (31Alonso L.G. García-Alai M.M. Nadra A.D. Lapeña A.N. Almeida F.L. Gualfetti P. Prat-Gay G.D.

The reaction was dissected into a very slow pre-equilibrium isomerization followed by a fast association reaction and, finally, by a unimolecular rearrangement. Kinetic association experiments and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of the free epitope showed that the antibody specifically recognizes a cis proline isomer in the interdomain “hinge” region of E7. Thus, by making use of an important viral disease and cancer-related antigen, we reveal that binding of an epitope within an intrinsically disordered protein may depend on a slow proline isomerization process. M1 IgG was purified from ascitic fluids, and the derived Fab fragments were prepared following standard procedures with minor modifications. Briefly, after clarification of ascitic fluids, the sample was exchanged into formate buffer and loaded onto a high performance cationic exchange ceramic S-HyperD column (Pall Corp.). The desired fractions were pooled, exchanged into TBS buffer, and concentrated. Fab fragments were prepared by papain hydrolysis of the IgG molecules and purified by ionic exchange in a Q-HyperD column (Pall Corp.). M1 Fab purity was >95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant HPV16 and HPV18 E7 proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (31Alonso L.G. García-Alai M.M. Nadra A.D. Lapeña A.N. Almeida F.L. Gualfetti P. Prat-Gay G.D.

Synthetic peptides corresponding to the N terminus of HPV16 E7 and proline mutants were obtained from the Keck facility (Yale University, New Haven, CT), purified by reverse phase HPLC, and submitted to mass spectrometry. The peptides were quantified by tyrosine absorption at 273 nm in 0.1 m NaOH and UV absorption at 220 nm in HCl for the peptides without tyrosine. The different E7 synthetic peptides used in this study are shown in Fig. 1A. HPV16 E7 and synthetic peptides were labeled with FITC (Sigma catalogue no. F-3651). The coupling reaction was conducted as described previously (39Smal C. Wetzler D.E. Dantur K.I. Chemes L.B. Garcia-Alai M.M. Dellarole M. Alonso L.G. Gaston K. de Prat-Gay G.

The epitope mapping was measured by a conventional ELISA. Briefly, 96-well plates (Greiner bio-one, high binding) were sensitized overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 μg/well of E7 and E7 C-terminal domain (E7(40–98)) proteins or 1 μg/well of the different E7 fragments in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl and 600 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The ionic force of the buffer was set to 0.6 m NaCl. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (BSA/TBS), ascitic fluids and control serum samples were diluted in BSA/TBS, and their reactivity was revealed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibodies to murine IgG (Jackson). The final color was read at 492 nm in an ELISA reader (SLT Spectra). Measurements were performed in an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 spectrofluorimeter assembled in L geometry. A fixed amount of FITC-E7 protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of M1 in different tubes for 30 min prior to fluorescence measurements. A similar protocol was used to titrate FITC-E7(36–48), FITC-E7(36–53), and FITC-E7(36–48) proline mutant peptides with M1Fab. The dissociation constant (KD) of the complex was calculated by fitting the plot of observed fluorescence anisotropy (r) change of FITC-E7 or FITC-E7 peptides versus different M1 concentrations to the following equation assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry (40de Prat Gay G. Fersht A.R. Generation of a family of protein fragments for structure-folding studies. 1.

Fluorescence stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed using an SX.18MV stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). All reported concentrations are those resulting from mixing equal volumes of each syringe. The association and dissociation reactions were monitored by following the change in fluorescence intensity or fluorescence anisotropy of the FITC-E7Ep peptide. For fluorescence measurements, the excitation monochromator was set to 495 nm with a 4.6-nm band pass, and emission was collected through a 515-nm cut-off filter (Schott, Duryea, PA). For anisotropy measurements, two photomultiplier tube detectors were assembled in T-geometry, and vertically and horizontally polarized emissions were collected through 530-nm cut-off filters. The bimolecular association reaction was measured under second-order conditions by mixing equimolar amounts of M1Fab and FITC-E7Ep. Under these conditions, the data can be analyzed by the following second-order equation (41de Prat Gay G. Ruiz-Sanz J. Fersht A.R. Generation of a family of protein fragments for structure-folding studies. 2. Kinetics of association of the two chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 fragments.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7964-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), F(t)=Fo+(ΔF[M1Fab]02kont(1+[M1Fab]0kont)+c1t)(Eq. 2) where F represents the fluorescence at time t, ΔF is the change in fluorescence upon binding, Fo is the fluorescence at t = 0, [M1Fab]o is the initial concentration of M1Fab, and kon is the second-order rate constant. Signal drift was taken into account by a linear time-dependent term (c1). Dissociation traces were measured by displacing a stoichiometric FITC-E7Ep·M1Fab complex by adding a 20-fold excess of unlabeled E7Ep peptide. The traces were fit to the sum of two exponential functions to obtain the koff values, F(t)=F0+A1×ek1t+A2×ek2t(Eq. 3) where A1 and A2 are the amplitudes, Fo is the initial fluorescence value, and k1 and k2 are the dissociation rate constants for each phase. Slow association phases were measured by manual mixing using a fluorimeter. The change in anisotropy was measured after the addition of increasing concentrations of M1Fab to a cuvette containing 50 nm FITC-E7Ep or 50 nm FITC-P47A E7Ep. The individual data traces were fit to a single exponential function to obtain the observed rate constant for the reaction (supplemental Tables S1 and S6). The dependence of the observed rate constant on M1Fab concentration was fit to a previously described pre-equilibrium model (10James L.C. Tawfik D.S. Structure and kinetics of a transient antibody binding intermediate reveal a kinetic discrimination mechanism in antigen recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12730-12735Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), kobs=k1+k-1×(KD2[M1Fab]+KD2)(Eq. 4) where kobs is the observed association rate constant at each M1Fab concentration, k1 and k−1 are the forward and reverse rate constants for the pre-equilibrium reaction, and KD2 is the dissociation equilibrium constant for the bimolecular association reaction. The concentrations used yielded errors in free M1Fab concentration of less than 20 and 5% for the lowest and highest M1Fab concentrations tested, respectively (100 nm and 1 μm), allowing a reliable estimation of the fitting parameters. Using these parameters, we obtained the equilibrium association constants for the pre-equilibrium and association reactions: K1 = k1/k−1 and K2 = 1/KD2, respectively. From this, it is possible to calculate the global equilibrium dissociation constant KD(global) = (1 + K1)/(K1 × K2). Finally, using the equilibrium dissociation constant for the bimolecular association reaction (KD2) and the association rate constant obtained in the second order stopped-flow experiments (k2), one can calculate the dissociation rate constant for the bimolecular association reaction as k−2 = KD2 × k2. We considered the existence of a second unimolecular reaction with an equilibrium association constant K3, corresponding to rearrangement of the complex. The value of K3 can be estimated from the equilibrium dissociation constant KD, the equilibrium constant for the preassociation equilibrium K1, and the dissociation constant for the bimolecular association reaction K2 and the following relationship (42Chemes L.B. Sánchez I.E. de Prat-Gay G. Kinetic recognition of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor by a specific protein target.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 412: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). KD=1+K1K1×K2+K1×K2×K3(Eq. 5) The slow association phase was measured at different temperatures in the same conditions described for the concentration dependence experiments. The change in anisotropy was measured after the addition of 600 nm M1Fab to a cuvette containing 100 nm FITC-E7Ep. The individual traces were fit to a single exponential function to obtain the observed rate constant for the reaction (supplemental Table S2). Activation parameters were determined from the Eyring plot of ln(k (h/k*T)) versus 1/T, where h is the Planck constant, k* is the Boltzman constant, T is expressed in Kelvin, and k corresponds to the observed rate constants determined at the different temperatures. The enthalpy of activation was obtained from the slope −ΔH‡/R of this plot, where R is the universal gas constant. Far-UV CD measurements were conducted on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a Peltier temperature-controlled sample holder and a 0.1-cm path length cell. All measurements were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 5 mm NaCl at 20 ± 0.1 °C. For the association kinetic experiment, the ellipticity change at 203 nm was measured after mixing equal amounts of E7Ep and M1Fab (5 μm). Traces were fit to single exponential functions to obtain the kobs values. Fitting of the data was carried out using the software programs Profit (Quantumsoft) and Kaleidagraph version 4.0 (Synergy Software) to obtain parameters and their S.D. values.

https://openalex.org/W1978703550,"Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools in mammalian mitochondria are highly asymmetric, and this asymmetry probably contributes to the elevated mutation rate for the mitochondrial genome as compared with the nuclear genome. To understand this asymmetry, we must identify pathways for synthesis and accumulation of dNTPs within mitochondria. We have identified ribonucleotide reductase activity specifically associated with mammalian tissue mitochondria. Examination of immunoprecipitated proteins by mass spectrometry revealed R1, the large ribonucleotide reductase subunit, in purified mitochondria. Significant enzymatic and immunological activity was seen in rat liver mitochondrial nucleoids, isolated as described by Wang and Bogenhagen (Wang, Y., and Bogenhagen, D. F. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 25791-25802). Moreover, incubation of respiring rat liver mitochondria with [(14)C]cytidine diphosphate leads to accumulation of radiolabeled deoxycytidine and thymidine nucleotides within the mitochondria. Comparable results were seen with [(14)C]guanosine diphosphate. Ribonucleotide reduction within the mitochondrion, as well as outside the organelle, needs to be considered as a possibly significant contributor to mitochondrial dNTP pools."

Both OBRb and Isl-1 mutations result in obesity-related diabetes. However, the interactions and physiological significance of leptin and Isl-1 in pancreatic islets remain to be established. Here, we show that most of leptin target cells in pancreatic islets and NIT beta cells express Isl-1. Both in vivo and in vitro results demonstrate that leptin suppresses Isl-1 expression and insulin secretion in islet in physiological and pathophysiological conditions, e.g. high fat diet. This effect of leptin on insulin secretion is lost in leptin receptor-defective db/db and Isl-1-inducible knock-out mice. We conclude that the action of leptin on insulin secretion is at least partly mediated by Isl-1. Another new finding of this study is that Isl-1 acts as a direct downstream target of leptin signaling molecule STAT3 to influence the effect of leptin on insulin secretion, whereas inversely, insulin has feedback regulating effects on Isl-1 expression through JAK-STAT3 pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2011312468,"The human α1A voltage-dependent calcium channel (Cav2.1) is a pore-forming essential subunit embedded in the plasma membrane. Its cytoplasmic carboxyl(C)-tail contains a small poly-glutamine (Q) tract, whose length is normally 4∼19 Q, but when expanded up to 20∼33Q, the tract causes an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). A recent study has shown that a 75-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) containing the polyQ tract remains soluble in normal brains, but becomes insoluble mainly in the cytoplasm with additional localization to the nuclei of human SCA6 Purkinje cells. However, the mechanism by which the CTF aggregation leads to neurodegeneration is completely elusive, particularly whether the CTF exerts more toxicity in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. We tagged recombinant (r)CTF with either nuclear-localization or nuclear-export signal, created doxycyclin-inducible rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell lines, and found that the CTF is more toxic in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus, the observations being more obvious with Q28 (disease range) than with Q13 (normal-length). Surprisingly, the CTF aggregates co-localized both with cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and phosphorylated-CREB (p-CREB) in the cytoplasm, and Western blot analysis showed that the quantity of CREB and p-CREB were both decreased in the nucleus when the rCTF formed aggregates in the cytoplasm. In human brains, polyQ aggregates also co-localized with CREB in the cytoplasm of SCA6 Purkinje cells, but not in other conditions. Collectively, the cytoplasmic Cav2.1-CTF aggregates are sufficient to cause cell death, and one of the pathogenic mechanisms may be abnormal CREB trafficking in the cytoplasm and reduced CREB and p-CREB levels in the nuclei."

To better understand the regulation of CFTR processing, we conducted a genetic screen and identified MAST205 (a microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase with a molecular mass of 205 kDa) as a new CFTR regulator. We found that overexpression of MAST205 increased the expression of CFTR and augmented CFTR-mediated fluid transport in a dose-dependent manner.

It has dual roles in promoting angiogenesis and stabilizing blood vessels, and it has been suggested that Tie2 forms dimers and/or oligomers in the absence of angiopoietin-1 (Ang1); however, the mechanism of ligand-independent dimerization of Tie2 and its biological significance have not been clarified. Using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay and a kinase-inactive Tie2 mutant, we show here that ligand-independent Tie2 dimerization is induced without Tie2 phosphorylation. Moreover, based on the fact that Tie1 never forms heterodimers with Tie2 in the absence of Ang1 despite having high amino acid sequence homology with Tie2, we searched for ligand-independent dimerization domains of Tie2 by reference to the difference with Tie1. We found that the YIA sequence of the intracellular domain of Tie2 corresponding to the LAS sequence in Tie1 is essential for this dimerization. When the YIA sequence was replaced by LAS in Tie2 (Tie2YIA/LAS), ligand-independent dimer was not formed in the absence of Ang1.

A domain in TNF receptors that mediates ligand-independent receptor assembly and signaling.Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Ligand-independent dimerization of EGF receptor does not lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor. It has been suggested that a conformational change of the EGF receptor induces kinase activity on ligand binding. Therefore, ligand-independent dimers may mediate rapid signal transduction responses. Although Tie2 also forms ligand-independent dimers, the importance of this has not yet been determined. In the present study, we established a system for visualization of Tie2 dimers using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in living cells (26Kerppola T.K. Design and implementation of bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays for the visualization of protein interactions in living cells.Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Using this system, we sought Ang1-independent Tie2-Tie2 dimerization domains. We generated a Tie2 mutant that does not form dimers in the absence of Ang1. We investigated the biological significance of ligand-independent Tie2 dimerization using this mutant. Recombinant human Ang1 was purchased from R&D Systems. In Western blot analysis, mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and anti-Tie2 (Ab33) antibodies (Abs) (Upstate), anti-HA.11 mAb (COVANCE), anti-c-Myc (9E10) and Tie1 (C-18) mAbs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-HA-tag rabbit serum (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.), p44/42, phospho-p44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204), phospho-Tie2 (Tyr992) Abs (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and mouse anti-HA (12CA5) mAb (Roche Diagnostics) were used as the first Abs. Anti-phospho-Tie2 (Tyr992) and anti-phosphotyrosine Abs were diluted 1:500, and others were diluted 1:1000. HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as the secondary antibody (dilution: 1:1000). For the immunofluorescence analysis, HA and Myc were used as the first Abs (dilution, 1:100). Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Igs and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse Igs were used as the secondary Abs (Invitrogen) (dilution, 1:200). Mouse Tie2 and Tie1 were fused to sequences encoding full-length Venus and Venus residues 1–173 amino acids (VN) or 155–238 amino acids (VC). The coding regions were connected with linker sequences encoding RSAIT (Arg-Ser-Ala-Ile-Thr). RSAIT is a non-adhesion sequence (26Kerppola T.K. Design and implementation of bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays for the visualization of protein interactions in living cells.Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). HA or Myc epitopes were inserted as tags between linker and fluorescent genes. Genes were inserted at the multicloning site in pEGFPN1 vector or pMRX virus vector. Basing the work on the pE-Tie2-linker-Myc-Venus, pE-Tie2-linker-HA-VN and pE-Tie2-linker-Myc-VC, we cut between the BamHI and MluI sites and the Tie2 mutant (Tie2K854R, Tie2R848W) was created. Tie2 kinase-dead (Tie2K854R) or Tie2 constitutive-active (Tie2R848W) mutants were amplified from wild-type Tie2 using Tie2K854R-N, -C primers or Tie2R848W-N, -C primers, respectively (supplemental Table S1). For the generation of Tie1*, the signal sequence of Tie2 was amplified from the Tie2 plasmid using oligonucleotide primers (forward primer, 5′-GTA GGC GTG TAC GGT GGG AGG TCT-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GTT AAG TCA ACA GAG CCT TCT ACT ACT CC-3′) and 5′-Tie1 core sequence excluding signal sequence was amplified from Tie1 using oligonucleotide primers (forward primer, 5′-GGA GTA GTA GAA GGC TCT GTT GAC TTA AC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-CCA CTT CTG AGC TTC ACA GCC TCG CAC GAT-3′). These two products were amplified with the forward primer for Tie2 and the reverse primer for Tie1. This PCR product was placed into EcoRI and AgeI sites of the Tie1 plasmid. For the generation of Tie2/Tie1 chimeric plasmids, mutagenesis was performed on Tie2 and Tie1 plasmids as templates by using specific primer sets (supplemental Table S1). For generation of 1–3 amino acid mutants of each Tie2 plasmid, mutagenesis was performed using specific primers (supplemental Table S1). Plat-E cells were transfected with pMRX-Tie2-linker-Myc-Venus, pMRX-Tie2YIA/LAS-linker-Myc-Venus, pMRX-Tie2-linker-HA-VN173 and pMRX-Tie2-linker-Myc-VC155, pMRX-Tie2YIA/LAS-linker-HA-VN173 and pMRX-Tie2YIA/LAS-linker-Myc-VC155 vectors as indicated in each experiment (1.0 μg each) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C after which the medium was changed. After 12 (36 h from transfection) and 24 h (48 h from transfection), conditioned medium was harvested, sterilized by filtration, and used to infect NIH3T3 cells. 8 μg/ml polybrene was added for enhancement of infection. Stable cell lines were selected by culture in medium containing puromycin (5 μg/ml) or blasticidin (10 μg/ml) (27Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Plat-E: an efficient and stable system for transient packaging of retroviruses.Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, 28Saitoh T. Nakano H. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. Lymphotoxin-β receptor mediates NEMO-independent NF-κB activation.FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HEK293T and NIH3T3 lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Platinum-E cells (Plat-E; packaging cells) and stable cell lines transfected by pMRX virus vector were cultured in 10% FBS containing DMEM. To carry out BiFC in living cells, cells were co-transfected with the expression vectors indicated in each experiment (1.0 μg each) using Lipofectamine 2000. The fluorescence emissions were acquired in living cells 22–48 h after transfection using a fluorescence microscope with a cooled CCD camera, or by flow cytometry. Protein expression levels were assessed by Western blotting. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). The cells were incubated on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using 1–2 μg of anti-Myc Ab that had been precoupled to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). Proteins electrophoretically separated using 7.5% SDS gels were transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by a wet blotting procedure (140 V, 200 mA, 120 min). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk/TBST for 60 min, subsequently incubated with the Abs as indicated in the figures and processed for chemiluminescence detection with ECL solution. Densitometry was performed with NIH ImageJ software (version 1.43u). BiFC was analyzed by flow cytometry. After fluorescence complementation, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS. FACS analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using the 488 nm laser for excitation and a 515–545 nm band pass filter for detection. For quantitative evaluation of BiFC fluorescence, we used % Gated (fluorescent cells) × X Geo Mean (average of fluorescent intensity) as arbitrary fluorescence units. Transfected cells on 0.1% gelatin-coated glass dishes (Sigma Aldrich) were rinsed, fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS (pH 7.5), and washed with PBS. Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 1% BSA for 30 min and immunostained with first Ab (1:100) for 1 h. Protein reacting with Ab was visualized with secondary Abs (1:200). HA or Myc epitopes were inserted as tags between Tie2 or Tie2YIA/LAS and the BiFC tag (VN or VC). HA-VN fused with Tie2 or Tie2YIA/LAS was stained by rabbit anti-HA Ab (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.) and Alexa Fluor 546 (red)-conjugated anti-rabbit Igs. Myc-VC fused with Tie2 or Tie2YIA/LAS was stained with mouse anti-Myc Ab and Alexa Fluor 647 (blue)-conjugated anti-mouse Igs. BiFC fluorescence was detected using a filter for Alexa Fluor 488 (green). The slides were observed under a Leica TCS SP5 Ver1.6 (Leica Microsystems) using HCX PL APO lambda blue 63 × 1.4 oil. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended software (Adobe Systems). All data are displayed as the mean ± S.D. and were analyzed by two-tailed Student t test. A probability value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. It has been reported that Tie2 is present in the form of dimers and/or oligomers on the cell surface (19Bogdanovic E. Coombs N. Dumont D.J. Oligomerized Tie2 localizes to clathrin-coated pits in response to angiopoietin-1.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 132: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We also detected ligand-independent dimers of endogenous Tie2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (supplemental Fig. S1A). To assess Tie2 dimerization in the absence of Ang1, we utilized the BiFC assay (26Kerppola T.K. Design and implementation of bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays for the visualization of protein interactions in living cells.Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). First, we prepared amino (N)-terminal (1–173: VN173) and carboxyl (C)-terminal (155–238: VC155) components of Venus fluorescent protein, a modifier of yellow fluorescent protein, fused with the C-terminal domain of wild-type (WT) mouse Tie2 with an HA or Myc tag linked to the molecule (Fig. 1A). When Tie2 (Tie2-HAVN, Tie2-MycVC) dimerizes, the fluorescent complex should be reconstituted (Fig. 1B). As expected, when Tie2-HAVN and Tie2-MycVC were cotransfected into HEK293T cells, cells expressing both HA and Myc developed fluorescence (Fig. 1C). Flow cytometry showed that transfection with both Tie2-HAVN and Tie2-MycVC vectors, but not with either alone, resulted in cells having high FITC intensity (Fig. 1, D and E). We confirmed that these co-transfectants developed BiFC fluorescence in cells expressing physiological levels of Tie2 as observed in ECs (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Ang1 activates Tie1 indirectly, mediated by its interaction with Tie2 (11Saharinen P. Kerkelä K. Ekman N. Marron M. Brindle N. Lee G.M. Augustin H. Koh G.Y. Alitalo K. Multiple angiopoietin recombinant proteins activate the Tie1 receptor tyrosine kinase and promote its interaction with Tie2.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Yuan H.T. Venkatesha S. Chan B. Deutsch U. Mammoto T. Sukhatme V.P. Woolf A.S. Karumanchi S.A. Activation of the orphan endothelial receptor Tie1 modifies Tie2-mediated intracellular signaling and cell survival.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3171-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that co-localization of Tie2 and Tie1 is induced upon activation of Tie2 by Ang1 (6Saharinen P. Eklund L. Miettinen J. Wirkkala R. Anisimov A. Winderlich M. Nottebaum A. Vestweber D. Deutsch U. Koh G.Y. Olsen B.R. Alitalo K. Angiopoietins assemble distinct Tie2 signalling complexes in endothelial cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Tie2 and Tie1 also form heterodimers in a ligand-independent manner. Relative to Tie2, we found that the Tie1 protein was difficult to express in HEK293T cells following transfection of full-length Tie1 cDNA. However, when the original native signal sequence of Tie1 was excised and replaced with the Tie2 signal sequence (designated Tie1*), Tie1 expression was easily induced (Fig. 2A). Using this Tie1* construct, we evaluated Tie2-Tie1 and Tie1-Tie1 associations by BiFC. Although it has recently been reported that Tie2 and Tie1 associate following Ang1 stimulation and on cell-cell contact, we failed to detect any Tie2-Tie1 or Tie1-Tie1 associations (Fig. 2, B–D). This suggests that a Tie2 and Tie1 interaction is required for Ang1 binding to Tie2 and Tie1 and that Tie1 never gives rise to inactive dimers and/or oligomers in the absence of Ang1. Phosphorylation of overexpressed Tie1 and Tie2 was observed, but only Tie2 and not Tie1 was autophosphorylated in the absence of Ang1 stimulation (Fig. 2A). To test whether phosphorylation of Tie2 affects Tie2-Tie2 dimerization, we generated a kinase-inactive Tie2 mutant (Tie2K854R) (Fig. 3A). However, loss of phosphorylation did not affect Tie2 dimerization (Fig. 3, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S2A). We further confirmed that it was not until Ang1 bound Tie2 that dimerized Tie2 was internalized (supplemental Fig. S2B). Although dimerized WT Tie2 was observed in the cytoplasm, dimerized kinase-inactivated Tie2 did not internalize from the cell surface into the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). Next, we constructed a constitutively active mutant of Tie2 (Tie2R848W) (Fig. 3A) (29Vikkula M. Boon L.M. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Calvert J.T. Diamonti A.J. Goumnerov B. Pasyk K.A. Marchuk D.A. Warman M.L. Cantley L.C. Mulliken J.B. Olsen B.R. Vascular dysmorphogenesis caused by an activating mutation in the receptor tyrosine kinase TIE2.Cell. 1996; 87: 1181-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In HEK293T cells overexpressing Tie2R848W-HAVN and Tie2R848W-MycVC, more abundant Venus fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm than in wt Tie2 or Tie2K854R (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, Tie2R848W can dimerize with WT Tie2, resulting in BiFC intensity enhanced compared with Tie2-Tie2 dimers (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that our BiFC system mimics canonical receptor down-modulation only after activation of the receptor. We found that Tie2, but not Tie1, forms homodimers in a ligand-independent manner. Hence, we attempted to isolate the Tie2 ligand-independent dimerizing region. First, we sought domains responsible for Tie2-Tie2 association by replacing part of Tie2 with the Tie1 homologous domain (Fig. 4A). We found that lack of the extracellular domain of Tie2 did not affect BiFC (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that BiFC caused by Tie2-Tie2 interaction is mainly induced by the intracellular domain of Tie2 in our model. Therefore, we focused on the intracellular domain of Tie2 for dimerization in our next experiments. We transfected Tie2-HAVN and Tie2/Tie1* chimeric genes fused with Myc-tagged VC155 into HEK293T cells. When the C-terminal of Tie2 (from 975 to 1088 amino acids) was replaced by the Tie1 sequence, BiFC was significantly attenuated (Fig. 4B). There are differences in 13 amino acids between Tie2 and Tie1 (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we mutated Tie2 where its sequence is different from Tie1 domain by domain and observed Tie2-Tie2/mutant dimerization. We found that a YIA sequence within Tie2 (975–977) is critical for dimerization (Fig. 4D). Next, we introduced point mutations into this YIA domain. We found that no single mutation was responsible for reducing Tie2 dimerization, but rather the whole YIA tandem sequence was involved (Fig. 4E). We generated mutant Tie2 (Tie2YIA/LAS) in which the YIA domain of Tie2 was replaced by LAS. Tie2-Tie2YIA/LAS and Tie2YIA/LAS-Tie2YIA/LAS dimerization was not significantly different, suggesting that both Tie2 YIA domains in the cytoplasmic region are required for dimerization (Fig. 4F). When phosphorylation of Tie2YIA/LAS was assessed, it was found that mere overexpression did not induce it (supplemental Fig. S4). Tie2 can form ligand-independent inactive dimers; it has therefore been suggested that receptor dimerization and activation are mechanistically distinct and separable events (19Bogdanovic E. Coombs N. Dumont D.J. Oligomerized Tie2 localizes to clathrin-coated pits in response to angiopoietin-1.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 132: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Bogdanovic E. Nguyen V.P. Dumont D.J. Activation of Tie2 by angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 results in their release and receptor internalization.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed whether Ang1 binding to the inactive monomer mutant Tie2YIA/LAS induced dimerization and activation of Tie2. Phosphorylation of WT Tie2 by exogenous Ang1 did not increase the intensity of BiFC developed by either Tie2-Tie2 (Fig. 5A). On the contrary, Ang1 stimulation decreased BiFC intensity after 30 min. This suggests that internalization and degradation of Tie2 was induced after Tie2 phosphorylation (30Bogdanovic E. Nguyen V.P. Dumont D.J. Activation of Tie2 by angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 results in their release and receptor internalization.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that Tie2YIA/LAS prominently enhanced BiFC intensity under Ang1 stimulation for 1 h (Fig. 5B). Microscopy showed that Tie2 formed ligand-independent dimers and was internalized upon Ang1 stimulation (Fig. 6A). In contrast, Tie2YIA/LAS dimerization was not detected in the absence of Ang1. However, BiFC signals due to dimerization did occur upon stimulation with Ang1, although to a lesser extent than in WT Tie2. This suggests that YIA mutations in Tie2 did not completely prevent Tie2 dimerization (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 6Tie2YIA/LAS cannot form ligand-independent dimers but is dimerized and phosphorylated upon stimulation with Ang1. A, dimerization and localization of Tie2 were observed in Tie2-VN- and Tie2-VC-coexpressing NIH3T3 cells in the presence or absence of Ang1. Wild-type Tie2 can form dimers irrespective of Ang1 stimulation, as confirmed by BiFC. However, this dimerized Tie2 forms cluster-like aggregations and is internalized upon stimulation with Ang1. B, similar to A, dimerization and localization of Tie2YIA/LAS (Tie2LAS) is observed in Tie2YIA/LAS-VN- and Tie2YIA/LAS-VC-coexpressing NIH3T3 cells. In the absence of Ang1, Tie2LAS did not dimerize but formed cluster-like aggregations upon stimulation with Ang1. Bar indicates 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we investigated how the lack of Tie2 ligand-independent dimerization affected its phosphorylation and downstream Erk signaling. When the time course of Tie2 phosphorylation was recorded in the presence of a fixed dose of Ang1 (200 ng/ml), no significant differences between wild-type Tie2 and Tie2YIA/LAS were observed (Fig. 7A). However, when phosphorylation was measured after stimulation for 10 min with different doses of Ang1, Tie2 and Erk phosphorylation by Tie2YIA/LAS decreased at a high dose (350∼500 ng/ml) of Ang1 compared with wild-type Tie2 (Fig. 7, B and C). These findings suggest that the YIA domain of Tie2 is not indispensable for dimerization of Tie2 but is used for forming non-ligand-mediated dimerization of Tie2 to effectively react to a higher dose of Ang1. In the present study, we visualized Tie2 dimerization by the BiFC method and sought ligand-independent dimerization domains of Tie2. A previous report showed that Tie2 clusters are expressed on the apical and basolateral plasma membranes (19Bogdanovic E. Coombs N. Dumont D.J. Oligomerized Tie2 localizes to clathrin-coated pits in response to angiopoietin-1.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 132: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether Tie2 phosphorylation results in dimer formation. Here, we showed that kinase-inactive Tie2 mutants also form dimers in the absence of Ang1. Thus, Tie2 can indeed form dimers without Ang1. To analyze the role of ligand-independent dimerization of Tie2, a mutant that cannot form dimers in the absence of Ang1 is required. In the present study, we utilized a mutant with no evidence of Tie1-Tie1 dimerization even when overexpressed. Based on the amino acid sequence difference between Tie2 and Tie1, we found that YIA in the Tie2 cytoplasmic domain is important for ligand-independent Tie2 dimerization. We show that the YIA domain required to form ligand-independent Tie2 dimers is situated between the catalytic and activation loops in the intracellular region of the molecule. Previous reports show that the Tie2 C-terminal tail has a negative regulatory role in Tie2 signaling and function (31Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T.

Peters K.G. Kontos C.D. Deletion of the carboxyl terminus of Tie2 enhances kinase activity, signaling, and function. Evidence for an autoinhibitory mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31768-31773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To activate Tie2, conformational changes in the intracellular loop structure and C-terminal tail are required for ATP and substrate binding. Therefore, it is possible that YIA domains control the movement of these loop and C-terminal tails. Further structural analysis of Tie2 will be necessary to assess how the YIA domain controls ligand-independent dimerization of Tie2 for folding and Tie2-Tie2 associations. Unlike Tie2 homodimer formation, the BiFC method reveals that Tie2 and Tie1 scarcely interact. Recently, it has been reported that Tie2-Tie1 heterodimer formation is induced in the extracellular domain of Tie2 and Tie1, respectively, and that this occurs in the absence of angiopoietin ligation (33Seegar T.C. Eller B. Tzvetkova-Robev D. Kolev M.V. Henderson S.C. Nikolov D.B. Barton W.A. Tie1-Tie2 interactions mediate functional differences between angiopoietin ligands.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization was observed using Tie receptors lacking intracellular domains. At present, it is difficult to explain this discrepancy, but it may simply be due to the absence of receptor cytoplasmic regions in the previous report. Indeed, when endogenous Tie2 and Tie1 localization in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was observed in the absence of Ang1, we found that Tie2 and Tie1 did not co-localize on the cell surface (supplemental Fig. S5). However, as previously reported, upon Ang1 stimulation, co-localization of these receptors does occur. In contrast, when NIH3T3 cells expressing Tie2-VN and Tie1*-VC were stimulated with Ang1, BiFC intensity was not enhanced (supplemental Fig. S6A). In addition, Ang1 activates both Tie2 and Tie1, but we did not observe a strong physical association between Tie2 and Tie1 in the immunoprecipitation analysis (supplemental Fig. S6, B and C). It has been reported that shedding of Tie1 extracellular domain itself induces Tie2 activation and that Ang2 acts as a Tie2 agonist upon Tie1 shedding (34Yabkowitz R. Meyer S. Black T. Elliott G.

Vascular endothelial growth factor activates the Tie family of receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This suggests that Tie1 ectodomain shedding plays important roles in promoting Tie2 conformation changes and activation. Therefore, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that full-length Tie2 and Tie1 may heterodimerize under certain specific conditions in ECs. It has been reported that Tie2 forms oligomers on the cell membrane (19Bogdanovic E. Coombs N. Dumont D.J. Oligomerized Tie2 localizes to clathrin-coated pits in response to angiopoietin-1.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 132: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); however, the function of such forms of Tie2 has not been elucidated. We found that a lack of ligand-independent dimerization of Tie2 led to attenuation of high dose Ang1-mediated activation of Tie2. This suggests that ligand-independent Tie2 dimerization plays a role in the rapid clustering of Tie2 upon activation with higher doses of Ang1 or in the preformation of Tie2 oligomers to respond to higher doses of Ang1. Further precise analysis of how ligand-independent dimerization of Tie2 relates to the extent of Tie2 phosphorylation at higher Ang1 doses is still required, including elucidation of the biological significance of Tie2 oligomers. In humans, an amino acid substitution of tryptophan for arginine at residue (Tie2R849W) leads to ligand-independent constitutive activation; it is associated with familial venous malformations and causes thickness or lack of smooth muscle cells in the veins systemically (14Morris P.N.

In the present study, we showed that the intensity of BiFC signals from Tie2R848W-Tie2R848W was enhanced. Interestingly, Tie2R848W interactions with WT Tie2 were stronger than Tie2-Tie2 interactions. This suggests that Tie2R848W may heterodimerize with WT Tie2 and induce constitutive phosphorylation of WT Tie2. Therefore, analysis of regulatory mechanisms in ligand-independent dimerization domains may be useful for developing therapeutic strategies to inhibit Tie2 activation in patients suffering from venous malformation.

https://openalex.org/W2076030563,"Signaling pathways interact with one another to form dynamic networks in which the cellular response to one stimulus may depend on the presence, intensity, timing, or localization of other signals. In rare cases, two stimuli may be simultaneously required for cells to elicit a significant biological output. This phenomenon, generally termed ""coincidence detection,"" requires a downstream signaling node that functions as a Boolean AND gate to restrict biological output from a network unless multiple stimuli are received within a specific window of time. Simultaneous activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and a thrombin receptor (protease-activated receptor-1, PAR-1) increases the expression of multiple immediate early genes (IEGs) associated with growth and angiogenesis. Using a bioinformatic comparison of IEG promoter regions, we identified STAT3 as a critical transcription factor for the detection of coincident EGFR/PAR-1 activation. EGFR activation induces classical STAT3 Tyr(705) phosphorylation but also initiates an inhibitory signal through the PI3K-AKT signaling axis that prevents STAT3 Ser(727) phosphorylation. Coincident PAR-1 signaling resolves these conflicting EGF-activated pathways by blocking AKT activation and permitting GSK-3α/β-dependent STAT3 Ser(727) phosphorylation and STAT3-dependent gene expression. Functionally, combinatorial EGFR/PAR-1 signaling suppresses EGF-induced proliferation and thrombin-induced leukocyte adhesion and triggers a STAT3-dependent increase in endothelial cell migration. This study reveals a novel signaling role for STAT3 in which the simultaneous presence of extracellular EGF and thrombin is detected at the level of STAT3 post-translational modifications. Collectively, our results describe a novel regulatory mechanism in which combinatorial EGFR/PAR-1 signaling regulates STAT3-dependent IEG induction and endothelial cell migration."
