https://openalex.org/W1985775217,"When mammalian cell cultures or mice are exposed to ionizing radiation in survivable or lethal amounts, novel mass components are found in the histone H2A region of two-dimensional gels. Collectively referred to as γ, these components are formed in vivo by several procedures that introduce double-stranded breaks into DNA. γ-Components, which appeared to be the only major novel components detected by mass or 32PO4incorporation on acetic acid-urea-Triton X-100-acetic acid-urea-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or SDS-acetic acid-urea-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide gels after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation, are shown to be histone H2AX species that have been phosphorylated specifically at serine 139. γ-H2AX appears rapidly after exposure of cell cultures to ionizing radiation; half-maximal amounts are reached by 1 min and maximal amounts by 10 min. At the maximum, approximately 1% of the H2AX becomes γ-phosphorylated per gray of ionizing radiation, a finding that indicates that 35 DNA double-stranded breaks, the number introduced by each gray into the 6 × 109 base pairs of a mammalian G1 genome, leads to the γ-phosphorylation of H2AX distributed over 1% of the chromatin. Thus, about 0.03% of the chromatin appears to be involved per DNA double-stranded break. This value, which corresponds to about 2 × 106 base pairs of DNA per double-stranded break, indicates that large amounts of chromatin are involved with each DNA double-stranded break. Thus, γ-H2AX formation is a rapid and sensitive cellular response to the presence of DNA double-stranded breaks, a response that may provide insight into higher order chromatin structures.

In eucaryotes, DNA is packaged into nucleosomes, which are in turn arranged in various higher order structures to form chromatin (1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin.

The nucleosome, the crystallographic structure of which has recently been elucidated (3Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar), is composed of about 145 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); Gy, gray; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TEMED,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; AUT, acetic acid-urea-Triton X-100; AUC, acetic acid-urea-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide; DNA-PK, DNA-protein kinase. of DNA and eight histone proteins, two from each of four histone protein families, H4, H3, H2B, and H2A. In mammals, each histone family is encoded by multiple genes, which with few exceptions are expressed in concert with replication (4Heintz N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The various members of the H4, H3, and H2B families differ in few if any amino acid residues (5Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 2The HHGRI/NCBI Histone Sequence Database is available on the World Wide Web athttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Baxevani/HISTONES. In contrast, the H2A family includes three subfamilies whose members contain characteristic sequence elements that have been conserved independently throughout eucaryotic evolution (6Thatcher T.H. Gorovsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7West M.H.P. Bonner W.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3238-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The three H2A subfamiles are the H2A1-H2A2, the H2AZ, and the H2AX; in mammals the H2AZ represents about 10% of the H2A complement, the H2AX represents 2–25%, and the H2A1-H2A2 represents the balance. In addition, histone species are often modified with phosphate and acetate moieties on specific serine and lysine residues, respectively, usually near the amino or carboxyl termini. A specific role for histone acetylation has been confirmed with the finding that histone acetylases are transcription factors (8Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the finding that H4 is acetylated to higher levels in euchromatin than in heterochromatin (9O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3946-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several histone modifications are correlated with chromosome condensation and mitosis; histone H3 becomes phosphorylated on residue serine 10 (10Gurley L.R. D'Anna J.A. Barham S.S. Deaven L.L. Tobey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and linker histone H1 becomes multiply phosphorylated (11Bradbury E.M. Inglis R.J. Matthews H.R. Nature. 1974; 247: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that H2AX becomes phosphorylated on residue serine 139 in cells when double-stranded breaks are introduced into the DNA by ionizing radiation. One of the three H2A subfamilies that has been conserved throughout evolution (12Mannironi C. Bonner W.M. Hatch C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9113-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), H2AX comprises 2–10% of the H2A complement in mammalian tissues and larger fractions in lower eucaryotes where in budding yeast H2AX constitutes virtually all of the H2A (5Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our finding of a human astrocytoma cell line SF268 in which H2AX is 25% of the H2A complement shows that H2AX can be more than 10% of H2A complement in tissue culture cells. The sequence that differentiates the H2AX from the other two H2A subfamilies is the C-terminal motif SQ(D/E)(I/L/Y)-(end). In mammals, the serine in this motif is residue 139, the site of γ-phosphorylation. This report is the first demonstration of a unique in vivo function for H2AX, a function that clearly differentiates it from the other H2A species. We report that exposure of cell cultures and mice to survivable as well as lethal amounts of ionizing radiation leads to the induction of γ-H2AX. Ionizing radiation has been present during the evolution of living systems; current background levels, about 0.5 millisieverts/year, induce on the order of 105 DNA double-stranded breaks each second in the cells of a 50-kg mammal. In tissue culture, of every 40 DNA double-stranded breaks introduced per cell by ionizing radiation, approximately one major karyotypic defect is found (13Ward J.F. Glass W.A. Varma M.N. DNA Damage and Repair in Physical and Chemical Mechanisms in Molecular Radiation Biology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991Google Scholar), defects that may reflect an unbalanced genome and altered cellular metabolism, perhaps leading to cell death or neoplastic progression. We demonstrate that γ-H2AX formation is both a rapid and sensitive response to ionizing radiation. Half-maximal amounts of γ-H2AX are reached by 1 min postirradiation, and maximal amounts are reached by 10 min. At the maximum, approximately 1% of the H2AX becomes γ-phosphorylated per Gy of ionizing radiation. This value, which corresponds to about 2 × 106 bp of DNA/double-stranded break, indicates that substantial amounts of chromatin may be involved with each DNA double-stranded break. Thus, γ-H2AX formation is a rapid and sensitive cellular response to the presence of DNA double-stranded breaks, a response that may provide insight into higher order chromatin structures. The cell cultures used in this study were grown in 10-cm dishes with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Nuclei from approximately 107 cells were isolated essentially as described by Whitlock et al.(14Whitlock Jr., J.P. Galeazzi D. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1299-1304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. One ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) was added to each of the cell layers, which were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, and the nuclei were pelleted for 2 s in a microcentrifuge. The histones were extracted from the pellets with 3 volumes of 0.5m HCl for 30 min on ice and prepared for two-dimensional gel analysis. For labeling studies, nuclear pellets were resuspended in 1 volume of TMCD assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol). One μl of [γ-32PO4]ATP was added to 9 μl of each of the nuclear suspensions, and the mixtures were incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. Then 100 μl of ice-cold assay buffer was added to each of the reaction mixtures, which were spun at 1000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 5 min; the histones were extracted from the pellets with 3 volumes of 0.5 m HCl for 30 min on ice and prepared for two-dimensional gel analysis. The medium of CHO, SF268 or other cell cultures was replaced with 10 ml of ice-cold medium, and the cultures were exposed to a 137Cs source at a rate of either 5 or 17 Gy/min in a Shepherd Mark I irradiator. The temperature of the medium remained below 8 °C during the irradiation. After irradiation, the cold medium was replaced with medium at 37 °C, and the cultures were returned to the incubator for the times indicated. The nuclei and histones were then prepared for analysis. DBA/2 mice, 35 days old, were irradiated with 200 Gy for 12.5 min at 17 Gy/min or with 3.6 Gy for 1.5 min at 2.4 Gy/min. The mice were euthanized in a CO2 chamber at the appropriate times. The livers, about 0.75 g, wet weight, were removed, diced, and homogenized (Polytron, Brinkmann Instruments) in 5 ml of an ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2) for 10 s. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the suspension was homogenized another 10 s at a slow speed to minimize foaming. The nuclei were pelleted from a 2-ml aliquot of each homogenate by a 2-s spin in a microcentrifuge. Concentrated HCl was added to the pellets to a final concentration of 0.5 mHCl; histones were extracted for analysis. Nuclear suspensions were pelleted for 2 s in a microcentrifuge; the pellets were resuspended in 0.5 m HCl and extracted for 30 min on ice. Reaction mixtures containing unbound histone were made 0.5m in HCl and extracted as above. Acid-insoluble material was pelleted for 5 min in the microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were removed to other tubes. Powdered urea was added to each of the supernatants to 8 m, phenolphthalein was added to 0.002%, and concentrated ammonia was added until the solutions became pink. Acetic acid was then added to 1 m, and the samples were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels. Histone gels comprise a first acetic acid-urea-Triton X-100 (AUT) dimension followed by a second acetic acid-urea-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (AUC) dimension (15Bonner W.M. West M.H.P. Stedman J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). AUT gels were prepared in shells 36 cm wide, 45 cm high, and 0.4 mm thick. The resolving gel solution contained urea (8 m), acrylamide (12%), bisacrylamide (0.11%), acetic acid (1 m), ammonia (0.03 m), Triton X-100 (0.5%), TEMED (0.5%), and riboflavin (0.0004%). The solution was degassed, poured into the shells (leaving 4 cm at the top), overlayered with water-saturated butanol, and polymerized between two fluorescent light boxes for 30 min. The stacking gel solution contained urea (8 m), acrylamide (5%), bisacrylamide (0.16%), acetic acid (1 m), ammonia (0.03 m), TEMED (0.5%), and riboflavin (0.0004%). When the resolving gels had polymerized, the butanol was removed. The stacking gel solution was degassed and poured into the shells to the top. Sample combs with wells 9 mm wide and 20 mm deep were inserted into the shells, and the gels were polymerized between two fluorescent light boxes for 30 min. The reservoir buffer contained acetic acid (1 m), and glycine (0.1 m). After the samples were loaded, electrophoresis was performed at 10 watts overnight. Finished gels were stained in a solution containing acetic acid (5%), ethanol (40%), and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.4%) for 30 min and destained for 30 min in a solution containing acetic acid (5%) and ethanol (20%). AUC gels were prepared in shells 36 cm wide, 25 cm high, and 1 mm thick. The resolving gel solution contained urea (5 m), acrylamide (18.5%), bisacrylamide (0.11%), acetic acid (1m), ammonia (0.03 m), TEMED (0.5%), and riboflavin (0.0004%). The solution was degassed, poured into the shells (leaving 4 cm at the top), overlayered with water-saturated butanol, and polymerized between two fluorescent light boxes for 30 min. The stacking gel solution contained urea (5 m), acrylamide (5%), bisacrylamide (0.16%), acetic acid (1m), ammonia (0.03 m), TEMED (0.5%), and riboflavin (0.0004%). When the resolving gels had polymerized, the butanol was removed. The stacking gel solution was degassed, poured into the shells (leaving 2 cm at the top), and polymerized between two fluorescent light boxes for 30 min. Regions of interest were excised from the stained first dimension gels and incubated in a solution containing acetic acid (1 m), ammonia (0.03 m), and mercaptoethylamine (1%) for 30 min. The pieces were slid into the top of a second dimension gel until they rested on the stacking gel. A solution containing 1% melted agarose, acetic acid (1 m), and ammonia (0.03 m) was poured around and to the top of the inserted sample gel; the agarose was allowed to solidify. The reservoir buffer contained acetic acid (1m), glycine (0.1 m), and CTAB (0.15%; Sigma H-9151; hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide). Electrophoresis was started at 67 milliamps/gel. This was about 12 watts/gel; when the wattage reached 26 watts/gel, the setting was switched to constant wattage at 26 watts until the Coomassie Blue migrated to the bottom of the gel. The total time of electrophoresis was about 7 h. Finished gels were stained in a solution containing acetic acid (5%), ethanol (40%), and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.4%) for 2 h and destained in a solution containing acetic acid (5%) and ethanol (20%). These gel recipes were used for all of the AUT-AUC gels presented in this paper except those shown in Fig. 1, which contained 18.5% acrylamide in the first AUT dimension; this higher concentration permitted the separation of all of the histone species but with some loss of resolution in the H2A region (Fig. 1 A versus Fig. 4 A). The Coomassie Blue-stained gels were recorded as TIFF images with the Eagleeye II (Stratagene Cloning Systems), the relevant images were assembled with Paint Shop Pro (Jasc, Inc) and Powerpoint (Microsoft), and the figures were printed with an HP OfficeJet Pro 1150C printer (Hewlett Packard).Figure 4Phosphorylation of γ-components: AUT-AUC gels.

Bonner W.M. Hatch C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9113-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), maintaining the ATG codon at the 5′-end of the coding sequence, adding a HindIII site just upstream of the ATG codon and a convenient restriction site at the 3′-end so that the PCR fragments could be cloned in phase into the HindIII site of the pET17xb vector (Novagen, Inc.). This procedure permitted the histone species to be expressed as part of fusion proteins. After constructs were checked by sequencing, duplex oligonucleotides coding for the formic acid-sensitive sequence (Asp-Pro)6 followed by the nickel-binding sequence His6 were inserted in phase at the HindIII site. The constructs were expressed in bacterial strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Inc.). When expression was maximal, the bacteria were harvested; the pellets were dissolved in 3 volumes of 98% formic acid and incubated at 37 °C overnight, leading to cleavage of the fusion protein species in the (Asp-Pro)6region. The formic acid was neutralized with ammonia; the solutions were dialyzed versus 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, overnight and passed over a nickel column in the appropriate buffer (Novagen, Inc.). The histone species with their His6 tags were eluted with an imidazole gradient. The eluted material was treated with CNOBr to cleave the tagged histone species at the methionine residue of the initiation codon, lyophilized, dissolved in the appropriate buffer, and passed through a nickel column to remove the His6-containing oligopeptides. The histone species were collected in the flow-through and stored at −20 °C. The recombinant histone species can be reconstituted in vitro into nucleosomes. 3V. S. Ivanova and W. M. Bonner, unpublished observations. Histone H2AX mutant constructs were prepared by inserting appropriate duplex oligonucleotides at a SfiI site, unique in the H2AX-pET17xb expression vector and situated in the codon for residue threonine 136. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared from resuspended nuclear pellets by adding 0.1 volume of 5 m NaCl to the latter. The residual nuclei were pelleted, and the kinase extracts were used immediately. Reaction mixes (10 μl) contained 1 μl of 10 × TMCD assay buffer; 1 μg of recombinant H2A1, H2AX, or mutant H2AX construct; 1 μl of [γ-32PO4]ATP; and 1 μl of nuclear kinase extract in the appropriate assay buffer. After incubation for 20 min at 20 °C, the reactions were terminated, and the histone proteins were analyzed either by two-dimensional AUT-AUC or by one-dimensional SDS gel electrophoresis. When mammalian cell cultures are exposed to ionizing radiation and the acid-soluble nuclear proteins are analyzed on two-dimensional AUT-AUC gels, novel components that will be referred to as γ (Fig. 1, A and B) are found in the H2A region of these gels. In the first AUT dimension, histones separate according to peptide length, charge, and the ability to partition onto Triton X-100 micelles. The ability to bind Triton X-100 micelles is a property of all the known core histone species. Sensitive to single amino acid differences (16Zweidler A. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), this property enables closely related histone species to be resolved. Since the micelles are uncharged, protein molecules partitioning onto Triton X-100 micelles are retarded; this partitioning and hence the retardation can be modulated by the concentration of urea in the gel. In the second AUC dimension, the histones separate according to peptide length, charge, and shape. This combination of separation parameters resolves the histones from all other proteins on these two-dimensional gels. In addition to permitting the resolution of closely related histone gene products, these gels also permit the separation of post-translationally modified forms of the histone species (15Bonner W.M. West M.H.P. Stedman J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These species, which differ by single charges from each other, generally migrate just behind the parent species in both dimensions, thus forming a diagonal line (most apparent for H4 in Fig. 1, A and B). The charge differences arise most often from the phosphorylation of serine residues, which adds one negative charge to the protein and from the acetylation of lysine residues, which removes one positive charge from the protein (17Pantazis P. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4669-4675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2A (18Goldknopf I.L. Rosenbaum F. Steiner R. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. Busch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and to a lesser extent H2B (19West M.H.P. Bonner W.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 20: 4671-4680Google Scholar) also have ubiquitin adducts; because of the size of ubiquitin, these adducts migrate in a separate region of the gel (Fig. 1, A and B). AUT-AUC gel analysis has been performed on other mammalian cell lines after 137Cs irradiation, including normal human fibroblast IMR90, transformed human fibroblast VA13, hamster CHO, human HeLa, and human HL60; all yielded similar results. Thus, γ-components are induced by ionizing radiation in a wide variety of mammalian cells. To help elucidate the physiological relevance of γ-components, we examined whether or not they are inducible under survivable conditions. SF268 cultures were exposed to 1.2, 3.6, or 10.8 Gy of ionizing radiation and permitted to recover for 30 min. γ-Components were apparent in all three cases (Fig. 2,B–D). While irradiated cells are metabolically active for several days, they may not be able to reproduce. However, cloning analysis of duplicate SF268 cell cultures showed that there was at least 40% clonal survival at 1.2 Gy and 10% clonal survival at 3.6 Gy (data not shown). Thus, γ-components form in cell cultures under survivable conditions. To determine whether or not the induction of γ-components is a response seen in whole organisms, we exposed mice to ionizing radiation and extracted the histones from their livers. Mice were exposed to 3.6 Gy, which is 60% of the 6-Gy 30LD50 (50% mortality 30 days after exposure) (20Ueda T. Toyoshima Y. Moritani T. Ri K. Otsuki N. Kushihashi T. Yasuhara H. Hishida T. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1996; 69: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Hornsey S. Hevesy G.C. Forssberg A.G. Abbatt J.D. Advances in Radiobiology. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL1957: 248Google Scholar, 22Thomson J.F. Radiation Protection in Animals. Reinhold, New York1962Google Scholar); these mice would be expected on average to have a life span shortened by only 10–15% (23Casarett A.P. Radiation Biology. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1968Google Scholar). γ-Components were apparent 15 (Fig. 2 F) and 40 min (Fig. 2 G) after exposure to 3.6 Gy. γ-Components were more abundant when mice were exposed to 200 Gy (Fig. 2 H), which kills mice within several hours. Thus, γ-components form in living organisms at both nonlethal and lethal amounts of ionizing radiation. Since the formation of γ-components appeared to be a widespread cellular reaction to ionizing radiation among mammals, it is relevant to determine whether the cell cultures are responding directly to the ionizing radiation or to a particular type of cellular damage induced by the ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation introduces many different kinds of damage into cells, directly by collision with atoms of biological molecules and indirectly by collision with water molecules. The latter generates free radicals, of which the most abundant is the hydroxyl radical. Ionizing radiation produces high local concentrations of hydroxyl radicals that, if located next to a DNA molecule, may produce locally multiply damaged sites (13Ward J.F. Glass W.A. Varma M.N. DNA Damage and Repair in Physical and Chemical Mechanisms in Molecular Radiation Biology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991Google Scholar) containing alterations of the base and sugar residues and breaks of one or both strands of the DNA double helix. Several agents and procedures that do or do not introduce double-stranded breaks into the DNA in cells were examined (Fig. 3). Cellular DNA can be sensitized to form DNA double- and single-stranded breaks upon irradiation with ultraviolet A light (350 nm) when cell cultures are grown in the presence of BrdUrd and incubated with Hoechst dye 33258 just before irradiation (24Limoli C.L. Ward J.F. Radiation Res. 1993; 134: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Like ionizing radiation, this method introduces double-stranded breaks as well as single-stranded breaks into DNA, but unlike the former, the mechanism is nonradiolytic. The procedure was found to result in the formation of γ-components in SF268 cells (Fig. 3, A–D) but only if BrdUrd, dye, and light were all present. Since this procedure leads to the formation of DNA breaks by a nonradiolytic mechanism and without hydroxyl radical formation in cells, γ-components are not a cellular response directly to ionizing radiation or to the presence of hydroxyl radicals, but to the presence of DNA breaks. This result was substantiated by the presence of γ-components when SF268 cell cultures were incubated with bleomycin (25Chabner B. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 379-393Google Scholar), a compound that also introduces double- and single-stranded breaks into cellular DNA by a nonradiolytic mechanism (Fig. 3 E). While the above described procedures introduce DNA double- and single-stranded breaks without hydroxyl radical formation, H2O2 produces hydroxyl radicals and DNA single-stranded breaks, as does ionizing radiation, but does not produce significant amounts of DNA double-stranded breaks because the cellular distribution of the hydroxyl radicals differs between the two agents (26Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 1-58Google Scholar). With H2O2, radicals are generated homogeneously throughout the cell as contrasted to the heterogeneous distribution found with ionizing radiation. Incubation of SF268 cell cultures with 10 μm (Fig. 3 F) or 50 μm (Fig. 3 G) H2O2 for 30 min did not lead to detectable formation of γ-components, although these cultures were still able to form γ-components after exposure to ionizing radiation (Fig. 3 H). These concentrations are damaging to cells; incubation of CHO cultures with 50 μmH2O2 for 30 min at 37 °C was found to result in approximately 95% clonal lethality (27Sestili P. Cantoni O. Cattabeni F. Murray D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 31: 130-136Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Another agent that damages cellular DNA primarily by introducing single-strand lesions (26Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 1-58Google Scholar) is ultraviolet C light. When SF268 cell cultures were irradiated with 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100 J/m2 of ultraviolet C radiation, amounts of radiation that cover the range from little if any cellular effect to complete lethality, no γ-components were detected after a 30-min recovery (data not shown). Thus, it is the DNA double-stranded break from ionizing radiation that is responsible for γ-component formation. The AUT-AUC gels shown in Fig. 1 were prepared with a 18% first dimension AUT gel to resolve all histone species. The AUT-AUC gels shown in the other figures were prepared with a 12% first dimension AUT gel to optimize the separation of γ-components; however, H4, H2B, and several of the H3 isoforms migrate at the buffer front in this dimension and thus are separated only in the second. γ-Components were obtained when SF268 cultures were exposed to 50 Gy of ionizing radiation and returned to a 37 °C incubator for a 30-min recovery period (Figs. 1 B and 4 B).

To determine the physiological role of PPARα in fatty acid metabolism, levels of peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolizing enzymes were determined in the PPARα null mouse. Constitutive liver β-oxidation of the long chain fatty acid, palmitic acid, was lower in the PPARα null mice as compared with wild type mice, indicating defective mitochondrial fatty acid catabolism. In contrast, constitutive oxidation of the very long chain fatty acid, lignoceric acid, was not different between wild type and PPARα null mice, suggesting that constitutive expression of enzymes involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation is independent of PPARα. Indeed, the PPARα null mice had normal levels of the peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase, bifunctional protein (hydratase + 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and thiolase but lower constitutive expression of the D-type bifunctional protein (hydratase + 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase). Several mitochondrial fatty acid metabolizing enzymes including very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, short chain-specific 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, and long chain acyl-CoA synthetase are also expressed at lower levels in the untreated PPARα null mice, whereas other fatty acid metabolizing enzymes were not different between the untreated null mice and wild type mice. A lower constitutive expression of mRNAs encoding these enzymes was also found, suggesting that the effect was due to altered gene expression. In wild type mice, both peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzymes were induced by the peroxisome proliferator Wy-14,643; induction was not observed in the PPARα null animals. These data indicate that PPARα modulates constitutive expression of genes encoding several mitochondrial fatty acid-catabolizing enzymes in addition to mediating inducible mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation, thus establishing a role for the receptor in fatty acid homeostasis.

Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound subcellular organelles that contain a variety of enzymes involved in a number of metabolic processes (1Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The most well characterized reactions carried out by peroxisomes are those that catalyze in fatty acid β-oxidation. Since plants lack mitochondria, peroxisomes are solely responsible for their fatty acid β-oxidation. The peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation pathway produces hydrogen peroxide through the activity of acyl-CoA oxidase, thus historically accounting for the name “peroxisomes.” Typically, H2O2 is decomposed to molecular oxygen and water by catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Human genetic deficiencies in peroxisome biogenesis and individual peroxisomal enzymes have been described that result in accumulation of long chain fatty acids (2Goldfischer S.L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 282: 117-137PubMed Google Scholar). The most severe of the peroxisome deficiencies causes neurological and anatomical abnormalities.In addition to fatty acid oxidation, peroxisomes also carry out β-oxidation of the cholesterol side chain during the synthesis of bile acids and participate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol (3Krisans S.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), ether glycolipids, and dolichols. Catabolism of purines, polyamines, glyoxylate and certain amino acids have been attributed to peroxisome-localized enzymes. Thus, peroxisomes are essential organelles for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.The number of peroxisomes is increased in rodents by treatment with high fat diets, cold temperature, starvation, ACTH, and certain chemicals generically termed peroxisome proliferators (1Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferators include a structurally diverse group of chemicals that include 1) hypolipidemic drugs (clofibrate, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, benzofibrate, etofibrate, and Wy-14,643), 2) the azole antifungal compounds such as bifenazole, 3) leukotriene D4antagonists, 4) herbicides, 5) pesticides, 6) phthalate esters used in the plastics industry (di-[2-ethylhexyl] phthalate), 7) simple solvents including trichloroethylene, and 8) natural chemicals such as phenyl acetate and the steroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Among them, the most potent peroxisome proliferator is Wy-14,643.Peroxisome proliferation is most pronounced in liver, kidney, and heart. In liver, the number of peroxisomes increases from about 500–600/cell to >5,000/cell after exposure to peroxisome proliferators (1Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This is accompanied by an increase in cell volume and cell number, resulting in hepatomegaly. Coincident with an increase in the number of peroxisomes, several peroxisomal enzymes are induced by transcriptional activation (4Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 124: 29-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Transcription of genes encoding the key β-oxidation enzymes acyl-CoA oxidase, enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (bifunctional enzyme), and thiolase are markedly elevated as a result of treatment with peroxisome proliferators (5Reddy J.K. Goel S.K. Nemali M.R. Carrino J.J. Laffler T.G. Reddy M.K. Sperbeck S.J. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Lalwani N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Genes encoding the microsomal cytochrome P450 in the CYP4A family are also activated by these agents (6Hardwick J.P. Song B.J. Huberman E. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Three distinct PPARs have been found, designated PPARα, δ (also called NUC-1 and β), and γ. Tissue distribution of each receptor is different, suggesting that each has unique functions. In rodents, PPARα is abundant in the liver, kidney, and heart, all of which display peroxisome proliferation in response to PPARα activators and have high rates of lipid metabolism (7Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Expression of PPARδ is ubiquitous and is highly expressed in the central nervous system (7Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The role of PPARδ is not known. PPARγ and PPARγ2, resulting from differential mRNA splicing, are present predominantly in adipose tissue and spleen. PPARγ is responsible in part for adipocyte differentiation and regulation of adipocyte-specific genes (8Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). It is also the target for the thiazolidinedione drugs that increase insulin sensitivity of target tissues (9Willson T.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).To determine the function of PPARα and its role in peroxisome proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis, a PPARα null mouse was generated (10Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). These animals exhibit a normal phenotype and normal basal levels of hepatic peroxisomes. However, the PPARα null mouse is nonresponsive to peroxisome proliferation. Compared with wild type mice, administration of peroxisome proliferators to PPARα null mice does not cause an increase in the number of peroxisomes, hepatomegaly, nor increases in mRNA encoded by target genes. Furthermore, these mice do not display physiological, toxicological, or carcinogenic responses induced by peroxisome proliferators (11Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 12Ward J.M. Peters J.M. Perella C.M. Gonzalez F.J. Toxicol. Pathol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 13Peters J.M. Cattley R.C. Gonzalez F.J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 2023-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation was initially reported in the PPARα null mice, suggesting an alteration in lipid metabolism (10Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). To investigate the biochemical basis for altered lipid metabolism, constitutive levels of peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes were examined in the PPARα null mouse.DISCUSSIONConstitutive expression of VLCAD, LCAD, SCHAD, T1, LACS, DBF, and ME is regulated by PPARα since their abundance was significantly altered in the absence of PPARα as compared with wild type controls. With the exception of SCHAD, which was up-regulated in the PPARα null mice, all of these proteins were found at lower levels in the PPARα null mice. This shows that PPARα has an important role in regulating basal levels of these enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and ME that participates in fatty acid synthesis. Although the mechanism for this peroxisome proliferator-independent mechanism is not known, it may be a result of altered gene expression since PPARα is known to control transcription through interaction with peroxisome proliferator response elements (4Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 124: 29-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The down-regulation is selective since constitutive expression of other enzymes including MCAD, SCAD, TPα, TPβ, MH, T2, CPT II, and MTE I appear to be unaffected by loss of the receptor. This is similar to the peroxisomal enzymes AOX, PH, PT, and VLACS, where there was no difference in expression levels between the untreated wild type and PPARα null mice. The data on enzyme levels are supported by the results of total fatty acid metabolism in liver where oxidation of long chain fatty acid, palmitate, which is reflective of mitochondrial metabolism, was lower in the PPARα null mice, whereas oxidation of the very long chain fatty acid, lignocerate, was not different between the wild type and PPARα null mice. The lack of difference in metabolism of this very long chain fatty acid is almost certainly due to similar levels of the peroxisomal enzymes in the two genotypes. Lower constitutive expression of fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes and mitochondrial palmitic acid β-oxidation suggests that PPARα controls gene expression in the absence of exogenous ligands for the receptor, and mice lacking PPARα have an impaired ability to metabolize lipids.To further elucidate the role of PPARα in lipid metabolism, the effect of the prototypical peroxisome proliferator Wy-14,643 in PPARα null mice was investigated. Indeed, PPARα was shown to transactivate genes in the presence of peroxisome proliferators (40Green S. Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Toxicol. Lett. (Shannon). 1992; 65: 131-139Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41Sher T. Yi H.F. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J.

Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). In addition to the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes and microsomal fatty acid hydroxylase P450, liver fatty acid binding protein and the genes encoding MCAD (43Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11012-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (44Rodriguez J.C. Gil-Gomez G. Hegardt F.G. Haro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18767-18772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ME (45Castelein H. Gulick T. Declercq P.E. Mannaerts G.P. Moore D.D. Baes M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26754-26758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are also activated by PPARα as indicated by transactivation assays. The present study extends these observations by confirming that expression of VLCAD, LCAD, SCAD, TPα, TPβ, MTE I, CTE II, SCHAD, T1, T2, LACS, and CPT II are all higher as a result of Wy-14,643 feeding in wild type mice but not in PPARα null mice. Northern analysis of mRNA encoding some of these enzymes revealed that induction is most likely due to increases in mRNA. These observations demonstrate that changes in gene expression of proteins involved in lipid metabolism are mediated by PPARα after exposure to peroxisome proliferators. Indeed, peroxisome proliferator response elements have been found and shown to be functionally active in the MCAD (43Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11012-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and LACS (46Schoonjans K. Watanabe M. Suzuki H. Mahfoudi A. Krey G. Wahli W. Grimaldi P. Staels B. Yamamoto T. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19269-19276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) genes. A peroxisome proliferator response element has not been found in the LCAD (47Zhang Z. Zhou Y. Mendelsohn N.J. Bauer G.S. Strauss A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), even though it is induced in wild type mice by Wy-14,643 feeding. Expression of ME is also elevated at the mRNA and protein level in agreement with a role of PPARα in its regulation (45Castelein H. Gulick T. Declercq P.E. Mannaerts G.P. Moore D.D. Baes M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26754-26758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The fibrate class of drugs can also lead to suppression of gene expression of numerous proteins involved in lipid metabolism (4Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 124: 29-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Levels of apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein C-III, apolipoprotein A-IV, hepatic lipase, and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase are all lowered by treatment of mice with fibrate drugs (4Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 124: 29-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 48Saladin R. Vu-Dac N. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. Staels B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 49Staels B. Van Tol A. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 32: 490-498PubMed Google Scholar). The alterations of these proteins in addition to altered gene expression of peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidizing enzymes are thought to contribute to the lipid-lowering effects of hypolipidemic drugs (4Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 124: 29-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently shown that the down-regulation of apolipoprotein C-III mRNA and protein that contributes to the triglyceride-lowering effect of Wy-14,643 is mediated by PPARα (50Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The results presented here extend these observations by demonstrating that the peroxisome proliferator Wy-14,643 induces significant changes in many fatty acid β-oxidizing enzymes and total hepatic β-oxidation, which in turn are likely to further contribute to the triglyceride-lowering effect of the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs. Combined, these results establish that PPARα functions in the control of lipid homeostasis in mice by regulating constitutive and inducible expression of fatty acid catabolism. Since nuclear receptors usually require a ligand for gene activation, the constitutive control of the enzymes would suggest that an endogenous ligand exists in liver.The lower expression of mRNAs encoding several fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes in PPARα null mice suggests either the presence of an endogenous ligand that preferentially controls genes encoding fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes and ME or that a ligand-independent mechanism is involved. Indeed, phosphorylation of a Ser-112 in PPARγ through mitogen-activated protein kinase has been shown to modulate its activity (51Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 52Zhang B. Berger J. Zhou G. Elbrecht A. Biswas S. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This kinase recognition site is conserved between PPARγ and PPARα. Irrespective of the mechanism of PPARα activation, these results suggest that it differentially activates genes in the absence of exogenous ligands.The identification of endogenous ligands has recently been addressed. It was shown that PPARα participates in the control of the inflammatory response involving leukotriene B4 (53Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). These studies also established that leukotriene B4 can directly bind to recombinant PPARα. Possible direct binding of peroxisome proliferators was shown by induced conformational changes as detected by protease sensitivity of in vitro translated PPARα (54Dowell P. Peterson V.J. Zabriskie T.M. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2013-2020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Other indirect transactivation experiments suggest that PPARα may mediate the action of 8(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (55Yu K. Bayona W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P. Ravera C.P. McMahon G. Brown M. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23975-23983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). It is likely that other ligands for PPARα exist, including fatty acid metabolites, as first suggested by the ability of fatty acids to transactivate the receptor (56Gustafsson J.A. Gearing K. Widmark E. Tollet P. Stromstedt M. Berge R.K. Gottlicher M. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 387: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar, 57Gearing K.L. Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Banner C.D. Tollet P. Stromstedt M. Rafter J.J. Berge R.K. Gustafsson J.A. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1284-1288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence exists for the presence of endogenous PPARα activators in cultured cells used for transactivation studies. High background levels of reporter gene activation are usually found in these types of studies (41Sher T. Yi H.F. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 58Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further support for the existence of endogenous ligands was provided by the demonstration that unsaturated fatty acids can bind to PPARα (59Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Thus, constitutive regulation of genes encoding fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes and ME may be mediated by levels of one or more fatty acid metabolites. These metabolites may be important endogenous ligands that function in the control of fatty acid metabolism. Support for this idea was provide by the observation that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids induce AOX and CYP4A P450 in a PPARα-dependent mechanism (11Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that PPARα may have several endogenous ligands, which upon binding to the receptor result in the activation of fatty acid catabolism including the oxidative degradation of leukotrienes, arachidonic acid epoxides, and other fatty acid derivatives.Among the important issues that need to be addressed is the species differences in response to peroxisome proliferators (60Lake B.G. Toxicol. Lett. (Shannon). 1995; 83: 673-681Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mice and rats are highly susceptible to peroxisome proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas nonhuman primates and humans appear to be resistant. The mechanism of this species differences is not presently known, but it might be due to lower hepatic levels of PPARα (61Tugwood J.D. Aldridge T.C. Lambe K.G. Macdonald N. Woodyatt N.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 252-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 62Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Raucy J.L. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Despite the lack of demonstratable peroxisome proliferation, the fibrate drugs are highly effective lipid-lowering agents in humans (63Ginsberg H.N. Am. J. Med. 1987; 83: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, PPARα may differentially regulate expression of genes that cause peroxisome proliferation and genes encoding enzymes that are responsible for fatty acid mobilization, transport, and catabolism. For example, high cellular levels of receptor may activate genes encoding peroxisomal, mitochondrial, and microsomal fatty acid metabolism in addition to genes that directly or indirectly control the cell cycle and peroxisome proliferation. Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound subcellular organelles that contain a variety of enzymes involved in a number of metabolic processes (1Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The most well characterized reactions carried out by peroxisomes are those that catalyze in fatty acid β-oxidation. Since plants lack mitochondria, peroxisomes are solely responsible for their fatty acid β-oxidation. The peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation pathway produces hydrogen peroxide through the activity of acyl-CoA oxidase, thus historically accounting for the name “peroxisomes.” Typically, H2O2 is decomposed to molecular oxygen and water by catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Human genetic deficiencies in peroxisome biogenesis and individual peroxisomal enzymes have been described that result in accumulation of long chain fatty acids (2Goldfischer S.L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 282: 117-137PubMed Google Scholar). The most severe of the peroxisome deficiencies causes neurological and anatomical abnormalities. In addition to fatty acid oxidation, peroxisomes also carry out β-oxidation of the cholesterol side chain during the synthesis of bile acids and participate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol (3Krisans S.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), ether glycolipids, and dolichols. Catabolism of purines, polyamines, glyoxylate and certain amino acids have been attributed to peroxisome-localized enzymes. Thus, peroxisomes are essential organelles for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. The number of peroxisomes is increased in rodents by treatment with high fat diets, cold temperature, starvation, ACTH, and certain chemicals generically termed peroxisome proliferators (1Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferators include a structurally diverse group of chemicals that include 1) hypolipidemic drugs (clofibrate, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, benzofibrate, etofibrate, and Wy-14,643), 2) the azole antifungal compounds such as bifenazole, 3) leukotriene D4antagonists, 4) herbicides, 5) pesticides, 6) phthalate esters used in the plastics industry (di-[2-ethylhexyl] phthalate), 7) simple solvents including trichloroethylene, and 8) natural chemicals such as phenyl acetate and the steroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Among them, the most potent peroxisome proliferator is Wy-14,643. Peroxisome proliferation is most pronounced in liver, kidney, and heart. In liver, the number of peroxisomes increases from about 500–600/cell to >5,000/cell after exposure to peroxisome proliferators (1Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This is accompanied by an increase in cell volume and cell number, resulting in hepatomegaly. Coincident with an increase in the number of peroxisomes, several peroxisomal enzymes are induced by transcriptional activation (4Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.C. Staels B.

https://openalex.org/W2043651078,"Genetic analysis of apoptosis in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed the cell death machine to be composed of three core interacting components. CED-4 (equivalent to mammalian Apaf-1) is a nucleotide binding molecule that complexes with the zymogen form of the death protease CED-3, leading to its autoactivation and cell death. CED-9 blocks death by complexing with CED-4 and attenuating its ability to promote CED-3 activation. An equivalent ternary complex was found to be present in mammalian cells involving Apaf-1, the mammalian death protease caspase-9, and Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Consistent with a central role for caspase-9, a dominant negative form effectively inhibited cell death initiated by a wide variety of inducers."
https://openalex.org/W2022690810,"We recently reported that the rate of efflux of cholesterol from cells to high density lipoprotein (HDL) was related to the expression level of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). Moreover, the expression of this receptor in atheromatous arteries raises the possibility that SR-BI mediates cholesterol efflux in the arterial wall (Ji, Y., Jian, B., Wang, N., Sun, Y., de la Llera Moya, M., Phillips, M. C., Rothblat, G. H., Swaney, J. B., and Tall, A. R. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 20982–20985). In this paper we describe studies that suggest that the presence of phospholipid on acceptor particles plays an important role in modulating interaction with the SR-BI. Specifically, enrichment of serum with phospholipid resulted in marked stimulation of cholesterol efflux from cells that had higher levels of SR-BI expression, like Fu5AH or Y1-BS1 cells, and little or no stimulation in cells with low SR-BI levels, such as Y-1 cells. Stimulation of efflux by phospholipid enrichment was also a function of SR-BI levels in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the SR-BI gene. Efflux to protein-free vesicles prepared with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidyl-choline also correlated with SR-BI levels, suggesting that phospholipid, as well as protein, influences the interaction that results in cholesterol efflux. By contrast, cholesterol efflux from a non-cell donor showed no stimulation consequent to phospholipid enrichment of the serum acceptor. These results may help to explain observations in the literature that document an increased risk of atherosclerosis in patients with depressed levels of HDL phospholipid even in the face of normal HDL cholesterol levels.

The deposition of lipids in vessel walls and the development of atheromas are thought to be opposed by removal of the cholesterol and transport back to the liver for secretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (1Fielding C.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1991; 2: 376-378Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Efflux of cellular free cholesterol from peripheral cells to the acceptor particles is the first step of this process. Although the mechanisms of cellular cholesterol efflux remain to be clarified, certain classes of high density lipoproteins (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B type I; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CHO-high, high SR-BI expression CHO cells; DMPC, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; MLV, multilamellar vesicles; PL, phospholipid; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; CMV, cytomegalovirus. are believed to play a key role in this process (2Oram J.F. Albers J.J. Cheung M.C. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8348-8356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two general models have been proposed regarding cholesterol removal from cells: a nonspecific, aqueous diffusion pathway and a specific pathway that may involve a cell surface receptor (3Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys.

In the aqueous diffusion model, cholesterol molecules first desorb from the cell membrane and are then incorporated into acceptor particles after traversing the intervening aqueous layer by diffusion. The theoretical aspects of this mechanism have been extensively reviewed (4Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 7Phillips M.C. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 223-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Although this model was derived from the studies of free cholesterol transport between model membranes (unilamellar vesicles) (8Phillips M.C. McLean L.R. Stoudt G.W. Rothblat G.H. Atherosclerosis. 1980; 36: 409-422Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the kinetics of cholesterol transfer from living cells to phospholipid-containing acceptors can be adequately described by this model (9Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this process, free cholesterol transfers between donor and acceptors bidirectionally and, for net cholesterol removal to occur, a concentration gradient must be established between the cell surface and the acceptors. This gradient depends upon many properties of both the cell membrane and cholesterol acceptors, such as the cholesterol and phospholipid content, the arrangement of the cholesterol domains within the cell membrane, and the sizes or numbers of acceptors present in the aqueous solution (4Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 10Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Chacko G.K. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). When an acceptor particle has a large capacity to absorb cholesterol (a cholesterol “sink”) and is present in excess, the rate-limiting step for cholesterol removal is desorption of cholesterol from the plasma membrane (4Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The second model involves a pathway by which an acceptor promotes cholesterol efflux by interaction with cell surface sites (3Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Oram J.F.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid-free apoA-I or lipid-poor pre-β-HDL particles are believed to operate by this mechanism. Through reversible interactions with the plasma membrane, apoA-I not only solubilizes cholesterol and phospholipid directly from the plasma membrane but also stimulates mobilization of pools of cholesterol that are readily accessible to esterification by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (16Oram J.F. Johnson C.J. Brown T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2405-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Slotte J.P. Johnson T.F. Arterioscler.

Both lipid-free apoA-I and lipid-poor pre-β-HDL particles presumably function effectively as natural shuttles to transport cholesterol between cells and larger α-HDL, since they have a relatively lower cholesterol capacity compared with α-HDL (1Fielding C.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1991; 2: 376-378Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Atger V.M. de la Llera Moya M. Stoudt G.W. Rodrigueza W.V. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated endocytosis plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism. Although the LDL receptor is well characterized, the metabolism of HDL by any receptor-mediated pathway is still unclear. Several cell membrane proteins have been described that bind to HDL (for reviews, see Refs. 4Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar and 6Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the physiological implications are obscure. Recently, a member of the scavenger receptor family, the class B scavenger receptor SR-BI, was shown to bind HDL with high affinity (22Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). This receptor can also bind to many other ligands, such as native LDL, modified proteins (acetylated LDL, oxidized LDL, maleylated bovine serum albumin), and anionic phospholipids (23Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rigotti A. Acton S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). However, unlike other scavenger receptors such as the LDL scavenger receptor, which binds to its ligand and internalizes the whole particle, SR-BI in certain cells can bind HDL reversibly and mediate selective cholesteryl ester uptake, leaving the HDL particles largely intact (22Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). SR-BI has highest expression in the adrenal gland, ovary, testis, and liver, where the selective uptake is important to the function of these tissues (25Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 26Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that in vivo the level of SR-BI is under feedback regulation in response to changes of cholesterol stores (27Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recently, work in our laboratories showed that SR-BI overexpression can markedly enhance the bi-directional cholesterol flux in transfected CHO cells. A strong correlation between the rate of efflux to HDL or serum and the expression levels of SR-BI was also observed in several other cell lines (28Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that SR-BI mRNA is expressed in the thickened intima of atheromatous aorta, suggesting a potential role of SR-BI in cholesterol flux in the arterial wall. Since SR-BI binds to a variety of lipoproteins that contain different apolipoprotein components and binds to anionic phospholipids (23Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rigotti A. Acton S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), it is possible that phospholipids on the surface of lipoprotein particles play an important role in mediating the binding. Therefore, in this paper, we correlated the ability of PL to potentiate efflux, which was either incorporated into the lipoprotein fractions of serum or into small unilamellar vesicles, with the expression levels of SR-BI in various cell types. Pooled human serum was obtained from normolipemic volunteers. The HDL3 fraction was isolated from the 1.125–1.21 g/ml fraction of serum by sequential ultracentrifugation (29Hatch F.T. Lees R.S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1968; 6: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of HDL3 stock solution (10 mg of protein/ml; 4.8 mg of PL/ml) were stored at −70 °C and thawed before use. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was purchased from Pierce. [1,2-3H]cholesterol was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and gentamicin were purchased from Sigma. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) was either purchased from Sigma or was a gift from Cerestar USA, Inc. (Hammond, IN). Eagle's minimal essential medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F-12, Ham's F-10, RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum (FBS), calf serum, horse serum, and geneticin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The stock concentration of MβCD was 5 mm in culture medium and was diluted to a final concentration of 0.05 mm. Sandoz compound 58035 was a gift from Dr. John Heider. Tissue culture flasks and plates were obtained from Corning Glass Works (Corning, NY). DMPC was dissolved in methanol, and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of N2 at room temperature; any remaining solvent was removed by vacuum overnight. Buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris, pH 7.4) was added, and the sample was warmed to 40–50 °C. The lipid was then vortexed vigorously for 1 min, placed in a low power sonication bath for 10 min, and vortexed again for 30 s to obtain turbid dispersions of multilamellar vesicles. POPC-SUV were made using the sonication technique as described previously (9Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). POPC in chloroform was dried under a stream of N2 to form a thin film on a test tube wall and then placed in a vacuum for 2 h to remove any remaining solvent. Buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4) was added to bring the concentration of phospholipid to 10 mg/ml and vortexed to generate MLV. SUV were prepared from MLV by sonicating at 0 °C for 15 min followed by a 1-min cooling period for several cycles until the dispersion was almost clear. After sonication, the vesicle dispersion was centrifuged for 2 h at 40,000 rpm (Beckman 50 Ti fixed angle rotor) to remove any titanium particles and large multilamellar vesicles. Serum was heated at 56 °C for 30 min in the presence of 2 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to inactivate complement, which is toxic to some cell types, such as L cells (30Fedoroff S. Doerr J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1962; 29: 331-353PubMed Google Scholar) and to inhibit lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. The serum was then incubated with DMPC-MLV at 24 °C for 2 h at a ratio of 4 mg of DMPC/ml of serum. After incubation, aliquots were removed and frozen at −70 °C. The phospholipid concentration for serum and DMPC-modified serum were 1.5 and 4.8 mg/ml, respectively. Since our preliminary studies showed that freezing and heat treatment did not influence the ability of serum or DMPC-modified serum to remove cholesterol from Fu5AH cells, a large amount of serum or DMPC-modified serum were prepared and used throughout this study to minimize the experimental variability. The murine SR-BI cDNA (28Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by electroporation as described previously (28Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Stable transformants with moderate SR-BI overexpression (CHO-low) were selected with 0.8 mg/ml geneticin and maintained with 0.3 mg/ml in Ham's F-12 containing 5% FBS. The high expression cells (CHO-high) were obtained by further screening the original geneticin-resistant pool with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using HDL labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyaninepercholate (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Rat hepatoma cells (Fu5AH) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% calf serum. Mouse L cell fibroblasts were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Two lines of mouse adrenal tumor cells, Y1 and Y1-BS1, which differ in their expression levels of SR-BI (28Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) were grown in Ham's F-10 with 12.5% horse serum and 5% FBS. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were grown in Ham's F-12 with 7.5% FBS, and three transfected CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 with 5% FBS. Mouse J774 macrophages were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Mouse RAW 2.1 macrophages were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. All media were supplemented with 50 mg/ml gentamicin except for the transfected CHO cells, which were supplemented with geneticin at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Cells were plated in 24-well plates 3 days before the experiment and labeled for 2 days with 1–2 μCi of [3H]cholesterol in 1 ml of growth medium to obtain confluent radiolabeled cell monolayers. Before the experiments, the labeling medium was replaced with equilibrating medium for 18 h to allow the equilibration of labeled cholesterol among cellular pools. Sandoz 58035, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, was present at a concentration of 1 μg/ml during the labeling, equilibration, and efflux periods in all experiments to prevent sequestration of the label in an intracellular cholesteryl ester pool. More than 95% total cholesterol was in free cholesterol form in all cell types after the experiments. Y1-BS1 cells were provided by Dr. David L. Williams. The cholesterol efflux ability of the serum, DMPC-modified serum, MβCD-supplemented serum, HDL3, and POPC-SUV were evaluated by methods described previously (31de la Llera Moya M. Atger V. Paul J.L. Fournier N. Moatti N. Giral P. Friday K.E. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1056-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol acceptors included serum or DMPC-modified serum, which were customarily diluted in efflux medium to 5% that of the original concentration; SUV was diluted to 1 mg/ml and HDL3 was diluted to 75 μg/ml with medium before the experiment. In some samples, MβCD was added to the 5% serum before the experiment at a concentration of 0.05 mm. The different cholesterol acceptors were incubated with [3H]cholesterol-labeled cells for various time periods at 37 °C, and 100-μl aliquots were taken to monitor efflux at indicated time points. These aliquots were filtered through 0.45-μm Multiscreen (96 screens) filtration plates (Millipore), and 75-μl aliquots were then counted to determine the release of labeled cholesterol from the cells. The total [3H]cholesterol in the cells was extracted with isopropanol from dried cell monolayers that had been washed with phosphate-buffered saline. In some experiments, cholesterol-impregnated glass fiber filters (Corning) were used as an inert cholesterol donor. Filters were cut to fit multiwell plates, 50 μl of an ethanol cholesterol solution was applied to each filter, and the filters were dried overnight. Each filter contained 0.5 μCi of [3H]cholesterol and 5 μg of cholesterol mass, which is similar to the average cholesterol content of the cell monolayers used in the efflux assays. The filters were then exposed to 2 ml of culture medium containing the various acceptors tested with the cells. The amount of radiolabeled cholesterol released to the medium was expressed as the fraction of the total radioactive cholesterol present initially in the cells or filters; culture medium without added acceptors was used as a control for all experiments. The net movement of cholesterol mass between cells and acceptors was not monitored in this study. Each data point was the result of triplicate determinations from one or two different experiments. Cells grown in monolayers were homogenized by a N2 cavitation technique using N2 (300 p.s.i) for 30 min before the release of pressure. Protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA) were present in the homogenizing buffer (100 mm Tris). Cell membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (50 Ti rotor, 32,000 rpm for 1 h), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (28Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

The efflux data were analyzed as originally proposed by Johnson et al. (32Johnson W.J. Bamberger M.J. Latta R.A. Rapp P.E. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5766-5776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as described in detail for this system by Davidson et al. (13Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari N. Sergrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the kinetic analysis assumed a closed system where unesterified, free cholesterol exists in one of two kinetic pools, the cellular or the acceptor pool. The equilibration of cholesterol between these two pools was fitted to the single exponential equation: Y =H1 e −gt +H2. Y represents the fraction of radiolabeled cholesterol remaining in the cells, t is the incubation time, H1 is a pre-exponential term that reflects the fraction of cellular free cholesterol that is lost to the medium at steady state, g is the sum of the rate constants for efflux (ke) and influx (ki), and H2 is a constant that represents the fraction of labeled cell cholesterol that remains associated with the cells at equilibrium due to a constant retrograde flux of free cholesterol from the extracellular acceptor back into the cells. H1, g, and H2 are variables that were fitted to the experimental data by nonlinear regression. The half-times of efflux were calculated as t1/2 = ln 2/ke, where ke = g ×H1. Vmax and EC50 values for the efflux of cholesterol from CHO cells (Fig. 7) were calculated using the equation y =Vmax × x /[EC50 +x]. To compare the ability of different cells to donate cholesterol to various acceptors, human serum, HDL3and POPC-SUV were incubated with [3H]cholesterol-labeled cell monolayers for 8 h. Fig. 1shows the time course of cholesterol efflux from two cell types that represent two extreme patterns of efflux. It can be seen that after 8 h of incubation 40% of free cholesterol was released from Fu5AH cells to serum, whereas only about 20% was released from Y1 cells. Efflux to HDL3 and SUV is also faster in Fu5AH cells compared with Y1 cells. POPC-SUV, at a concentration of 1 mg of PL/ml of efflux medium, was able to promote cholesterol efflux, comparable to HDL3 at 75 μg of protein/ml. These data agree with previous work from this laboratory that demonstrated that the Fu5AH cells release free cholesterol much faster than other cells (33DeLamatre J. Wolfbauer G. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The results obtained from Fu5AH and Y1 cells suggested that similar efflux patterns were obtained whether the acceptors were serum, HDL3, or POPC-SUV. To examine this further, a variety of cell types were studied that spanned a range of efflux from fast to slow. Serum (5%), HDL3 (75 μg of protein/ml) or POPC-SUV (1 mg/ml) were incubated with cholesterol-labeled cells for 8 h at 37 °C, and aliquots were removed at various time points. Rate constants (k) for efflux to different cholesterol acceptors were obtained from the single exponential curve fit to the time course data. As shown in Fig. 2, there is a very strong linear correlation (r 2 = 0.98) between efflux to serum and to HDL3 in all the cell types examined. Surprisingly, a strong correlation was also observed between serum and POPC-SUV with a correlation coefficient of 0.94, which suggests that a common cellular component may be involved in mediating the cholesterol efflux to serum and POPC-SUV. This finding is consistent with our previous data that HDL-PL is the component of HDL that best reflects the efflux efficiency of the serum (34Fournier N. Paul J. Atger V. de la Llera Moya M.

Recently, the scavenger receptor SR-BI was found to bind HDL with high affinity (22Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Previously, data from our laboratories have suggested that this receptor might contribute to cholesterol efflux by promoting bi-directional flux (28Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M.

Having characterized the cholesterol efflux properties of a variety of cells, the SR-BI expression level was measured by preparing cell membrane proteins and total RNA for Western blot and RNase protection assays, followed by densitometry of chemiluminescence images; mouse liver membranes were used as a control in all assays. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression level of SR-BI was found to vary significantly among different cell types and appears to be correlated with the efflux of cell cholesterol to both serum and POPC-SUV. Panel A shows a combination of data previously reported for serum as acceptor (28Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Note that Y1 cells, although adrenal-derived, were found to have slow efflux in response to serum, HDL, or PL vesicles (Fig. 1) and very low SR-BI expression, whereas Fu5AH cells have the highest rate of efflux and SR-BI levels among various cell types studied (Fig. 3). Another line of the adrenal-derived Y1 cells (Y1-BS1) had a moderate SR-BI expression level and intermediate efflux values (Fig. 3). Previously we reporte"
https://openalex.org/W2054264938,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are membrane-bound transcription factors that promote lipid synthesis in animal cells. They are embedded in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a helical hairpin orientation and are released from the ER by a two-step proteolytic process. Proteolysis begins when the SREBPs are cleaved at Site-1, which is located at a leucine residue in the middle of the hydrophobic loop in the lumen of the ER. Sterols suppress Site-1 cleavage, apparently by interacting with a polytopic membrane protein designated SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). SREBPs and SCAP are joined together in ER membranes through interaction of their cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domains. Here we use an in vivo competition assay in transfected cells to show that the SREBP·SCAP complex is essential for Site-1 cleavage. Overexpression of the truncated COOH-terminal domains of either SREBP-2 or SCAP disrupted the complex between full-length SREBP-2 and SCAP as measured by co-immunoprecipitation. This resulted in a complete inhibition of Site-1 cleavage that was restored by concomitant overexpression of full-length SCAP. The transfected COOH-terminal domains also inhibited the transcription of a reporter gene driven by an SRE-containing promoter, and this, too, was restored by overexpression of full-length SCAP. We interpret these data to indicate that the SREBP·SCAP complex directs the Site-1 protease to its target in the lumenal domain of SREBP and that disruption of this complex inactivates the Site-1 cleavage reaction.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; bp, base pair(s); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A; HSV, herpes simplex virus; kb, kilobase(s); LDL, low density lipoprotein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PSS, prolactin signal sequence; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; SRE-1, sterol regulatory element-1; TK, thymidine kinase. are membrane-bound transcription factors that control the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol and fatty acids in animal cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). SREBPs comprise a family of three proteins, designated SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2, each of ∼1150 amino acids in length, that are bound intrinsically to membranes of the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In sterol-depleted cells, a two-step proteolytic sequence releases the NH2-terminal domains of the SREBPs, which travel to the nucleus where they activate transcription of genes encoding the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor; multiple enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and squalene synthase; and enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. When sterols accumulate in cells, the proteolytic processing of SREBPs is inhibited, the NH2-terminal domains remain bound to membranes, and transcription of the target genes declines. Recent experiments have begun to elucidate the details of the two-step proteolytic process and the mechanism for its regulation by sterols (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 2Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A key aspect is the three-domain structure of the SREBP precursors (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domains of the SREBPs are ∼480 amino acids in length and contain a classic basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper motif and an acidic transcription activation domain, similar to the ones that are found in numerous transcription factors. The NH2-terminal domain is followed by a membrane anchor domain consisting of two hydrophobic sequences, each of which spans the ER membrane and is separated from the other by a short hydrophilic loop of ∼30 residues. The membrane anchor domain is followed by a long COOH-terminal extension of ∼590 amino acids, which is designated as the regulatory domain. The SREBP precursors are oriented so that the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains face the cytoplasm, and only the short hydrophilic loop projects into the ER lumen (5Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In sterol-deprived cells, the proteolytic process is initiated by an enzyme that cleaves the SREBP precursors at Site-1, which is located in the middle of the hydrophilic lumenal loop (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 2Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This cleavage separates the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains, but each remains membrane-bound, owing to its transmembrane sequence. At this point a second protease cleaves the NH2-terminal fragment at Site-2 within its membrane-spanning region, liberating the NH2-terminal domain so that it can enter the nucleus (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar,2Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The Site-1 cleavage enzyme is directly regulated by sterols; it acts only in sterol-depleted cells, and it is inhibited by sterols. The Site-2 enzyme is not controlled directly by sterols, but it can act only after cleavage at Site-1, and its action is therefore restricted effectively to sterol-depleted cells (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 2Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The Site-1 enzyme recognizes the sequence RXXL, which is conserved in all known mammalian and Drosophila SREBPs. The enzyme cleaves after the leucine of this sequence (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 3Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In human SREBP-2, cleavage is abolished when the arginine of the RSVL sequence is changed to alanine. Site-1 cleavage also requires the COOH-terminal domain of SREBPs. When this domain is deleted, the Site-1 enzyme will no longer cleave SREBP-2 even though the RSVL sequence is still present (4Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For this reason, we refer to the COOH-terminal domain of the SREBPs as the regulatory domain. The activity of the Site-1 cleavage enzyme is proposed to be controlled by a membrane-bound protein called SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) (6Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). SCAP consists of two domains: 1) an NH2-terminal membrane anchor of ∼730 amino acids composed of eight putative membrane-spanning segments; and 2) a hydrophilic COOH-terminal segment of ∼546 amino acids that contains at least four “WD repeats.” These repeats, each about 40 residues in length, are found in many proteins that engage in protein-protein interactions (7Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Like the SREBPs, SCAP is bound to membranes of the ER and nuclear envelope (4Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation assays show that the WD repeat domain of SCAP is bound to the COOH-terminal regulatory domains of the SREBPs (4Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence indicates that SCAP is responsible for the sterol regulation of Site-1 cleavage. Thus, a dominantly acting point mutation in SCAP, D443N, was identified as the cause of sterol resistance in several independently derived lines of mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which Site-1 cleavage was no longer repressed by sterols (6Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 8Nohturfft A. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13709-13714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transfection of a cDNA encoding the D443N mutant version of SCAP into wild-type CHO cells reproduced the sterol-resistant phenotype (6Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that SCAP is a required cofactor in the Site-1 cleavage reaction and that sterols abolish the activity of SCAP, thereby halting Site-1 cleavage (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 6Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The D443N mutation renders SCAP resistant to the inhibitory effects of sterols, and hence the cleavage at Site-1 can no longer be down-regulated. The notion that SCAP is part of the sterol-sensing mechanism is supported by the finding that the NH2-terminal membrane attachment domain of SCAP bears significant sequence resemblance to the membrane attachment domain of HMG-CoA reductase (6Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The latter domain serves as a sterol sensor, allowing HMG-CoA reductase to be degraded rapidly when the sterol content of the ER rises (9Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 10Kumagai H. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19107-19113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A sequence resembling the putative sterol sensor is also present in the protein encoded by the gene defective in Nieman-Pick type C1 disease (11Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Sturley S.L. Ioannou Y.A. Higgins M.E. Comly M. Cooney A. Brown A. Kaneski C.R. Blanchette-Mackie J.

Pentchev P.G. Tagle D.A. Science. 1997; 277: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). A mutation in this gene prevents cholesterol from being transported normally from the lysosome to the ER. Moreover, the putative sterol sensor motif is present in the transmembrane domain of the morphen receptor Patched (11Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Sturley S.L. Ioannou Y.A. Higgins M.E. Comly M. Cooney A. Brown A. Kaneski C.R. Blanchette-Mackie J. Dwyer N.K. Neufeld E.B.

Science. 1997; 277: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), whose ligand is a signaling protein called Hedgehog that contains cholesterol covalently attached to its COOH terminus (12Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Thus, four proteins that are postulated to interact with sterols (SCAP, HMG-CoA reductase, Niemann-Pick type C1 protein, and Patched) all bear a similar membranous domain. The D443N mutation, which renders SCAP insensitive to sterols, occurs within this domain (6Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 8Nohturfft A. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13709-13714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The current studies were designed to test the hypothesis that SCAP is necessary for the cleavage of SREBPs at Site-1. For this purpose, we transfected cells with cDNAs encoding truncated proteins bearing the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of one of the SREBPs, namely SREBP-2. We predicted that the truncated proteins would form abortive complexes with endogenous SCAP, thereby preventing it from interacting with full-length SREBP-2. The data show that the truncated forms of SREBP-2 indeed prevent the cleavage of wild-type SREBP-2 and that this inhibition can be overcome by overexpression of SCAP. We also show that Site-1 processing can be inhibited by overexpression of cDNAs encoding truncated proteins containing the WD repeat domain of SCAP, which appears to act by forming abortive complexes with SREBPs, thereby preventing their interaction with full-length SCAP. All of these data support a model in which the interaction of the WD domain of SCAP and the COOH-terminal domain of SREBPs is required in order for SREBPs to be cleaved at Site-1.

All expression vectors were driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-enhancer contained in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The structures of all plasmid constructs described below were confirmed by sequencing all ligation joints. The expression vector pCMV-PSS/BP2-(504–1141) encodes a fusion protein consisting of a modified region of the bovine prolactin signal sequence (MDSKGSSQKGSRLLLLLVVSNLLLCQGVVN), followed by a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDD), two novel amino acids (VD) encoded by the restriction site for SalI, and amino acids 504–1141 of human SREBP-2. The prolactin signal sequence was modified by the substitution of an asparagine residue at −1 in place of serine, as denoted by the underline. pCMV-PSS/BP2-(504–1141) was constructed as follows. First, a 60-bp fragment encoding the prolactin signal sequence (PSS) followed by the FLAG epitope tag was isolated by KpnI and SalI digestion of a plasmid construct in pBluescript encoding a PSS/FLAG/human thrombin receptor fusion protein (Ref. 14Ishii K.

The PCR fragment was digested with SalI and EcoRI, and the 90-bp fragment was isolated. The above two fragments were cloned into the KpnI-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to yield intermediate construct I. Second, intermediate construct I was mutagenized by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to substitute serine for asparagine at amino acid residue −1 of the prolactin signal sequence (denoted by underline, see above) by the method of Kunkelet al.

Third, intermediate construct II was digested with ApaI to isolate a 6.0-kb backbone fragment, pTK-HSV-BP2 was digested withApaI to isolate a 2.5-kb fragment encoding amino acids 506–1141 of human SREBP-2, and the two fragments were ligated to generate pCMV- PSS/BP2-(504–1141). The expression vector pCMV-PSS/BP2-(504–1141)NSS/NGT encodes a FLAG epitope-tagged prolactin signal sequence/SREBP-2 fusion protein in which serine 515 in the loop region of SREBP-2 was replaced, by site-directed mutagenesis (13Hua X.

To generate pCMV-P450-TM/SCAP-(731–1276), a PCR fragment was amplified from pC1-GAL (Ref. 17Ahn K. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol.

(In this paper, pC1-GAL is referred to as pCMV-P450-TM/Gal.) PCR amplification was carried out with the following pair of primers: 5′-CCCACTTGGCAGTACATCAAG-3′ (annealing to a sequence in the CMV promoter) and 5′-ATCGTACGAAGCTTCCCTCCCCCATAGCTCTGTTTCC-3′ (containing codons 20–29 of cytochrome P450 2C1 preceded by aBsiWI restriction site).

On day 2, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using the MBS kit (Stratagene) method as described previously (5Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Apoptosis assays based on the human neuroblastoma cell line PAJU established the importance of this interaction for mediating drug-induced inhibition of programmed cell death. The cause of symptoms in Parkinson's disease is progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The reason for this neuronal loss remains elusive. Among the currently favored possible explanations are oxidative stress as cause or consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e. deficiency of the respiratory chain due to a defect in complex I), environmental toxins, NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in combination with mild mitochondrial dysfunction, and radical formation due to excessive iron accumulation in the substantia nigra (1Olanow C.W. Neurology. 1996; 47: 210-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these processes have been shown to be able to induce apoptotic cell death under appropriate circumstances (2Simonian N.A. Coyle J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 3Michel P.P. Vyas S. Anglade P. Ruberg M. Agid Y. Eur. J.

Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1987-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The presence of nigral dopaminergic cells undergoing apoptosis in the brains of parkinsonian patients has been demonstrated (5Mochizuki H. Mori H. Mizuno Y. J. Neural. Transm. Suppl. 1997; 50: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Agid Y. Bull. Acad. Natl. Med. 1995; 179 (Discussion, 1203–1207): 1193-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a crucial role of apoptosis in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease is not yet established, and the benefit of antiapoptotic treatment likewise awaits proof (7Stern G. Adv. Neurol. 1996; 69: 101-107PubMed Google Scholar). The currently prevalent drug therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease consists of levodopa (l-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine), a combination of levodopa and carbidopa (Sinemet/Sinemet CR), and monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors such as R-(−)-deprenyl (selegiline hydrochloride; Ref. 8Piccoli F. Riuggeri R.M. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 1995; 45: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar) or a variety of dopamine agonists of different subtype specificity, alone or in combination with levodopa/carbidopa (9Galler R.M. Hallas B.H. Fazzini E. J. Am. Osteopath. Assoc. 1996; 96/4: 228-232Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). While it is still debated whether the beneficial effects of (−)-deprenyl in Parkinson's disease, e.g. as documented in the DATATOP study (10The Parkinson Study Group New Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar), are symptomatic in nature or indicate a neuroprotective component (e.g. see Ref. 11Calne D.B. BMJ. 1995; 311: 1583-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar as opposed to Ref. 1Olanow C.W. Neurology. 1996; 47: 210-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neuroprotective effects of the compound have clearly been demonstrated in vivo in experimental animal models and in vitro in cellular systems. Thus, (−)-deprenyl was shown to rescue spinal motor neurons (12Iwasaki Y. Ikeda K. Shiojima T. Kobayashi T. Tagaya N. Kinoshita M. Neurol. Res. 1996; 18: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and facial motor neurons (13Salo P.T. Tatton W.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) after axotomy, nigral dopaminergic neurons after systemic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine treatment (14Tatton W.G. Greenwood C.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), or hippocampal pyramidal neurons after systemic kainate acid treatment (15Gelowitz D.L. Paterson I.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1994; 20 (Abstr. 113.2): 246Google Scholar) or after unilateral carotid occlusion/transient hypoxia (16Paterson I.A. Barber A.J. Gelowitz D.L. Voll C. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1997; 21: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In vitro, the compound has been reported to rescue PC12 cells from apoptotic cell death induced by trophic withdrawal (17Tatton W.G. Ju W.Y. Holland D.P. Tai C. Kwan M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), to rescue mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons from 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium toxicity (18Mytilineou C. Cohen G. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1951-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and glutamate excitotoxicity (19Mytilineou C. Radcliffe P. Leonardi E.K. Werner P. Olanow C.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or death by aging (20Roy E. Bédard P.J. NeuroReport. 1993; 4: 1183-1186PubMed Google Scholar), and to rescue dopaminergic neurons in a co-culture of mesencephalic and striatal cells from 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium toxicity (21Koutsilieri E. Chen T.-S. Rausch W.D. Riederer P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 306: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). While clearly monoamine oxidase type B inhibition by (−)-deprenyl is not responsible for these effects, de novo gene expression seems to be required (22Tatton W.G. Ansari K. Ju W. Salo P.T. Yu P.H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Target(s) and the mechanism of (−)-deprenyl's neuroprotective effects are not known. (−)-Deprenyl is metabolized to (−)-demethyldeprenyl and further to (−)-amphetamine and (−)-methamphetamine, principally by P450 enzymes (for a review, see Ref. 23Heinonen E.H. Anttila M.I. Lammintausta R.A.S. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 56: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The rescuing effect of (−)-deprenyl, but not that of (−)-demethyldeprenyl, in trophically withdrawn PC12 cellsin vitro and in facial motor neurons after axotomy in vivo, is blocked by P450 inhibitors, and (−)-amphetamine and (−)-methamphetamine antagonize the rescuing effect of (−)-deprenyl in these paradigms (24Tatton W.G. Chalmers-Redman R.M.E. Neurology. 1996; 47: S171-S183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, its capacity to rescue neurons after oral administration is limited, and this may relate to the rather moderate benefit observed clinically, where (−)-deprenyl was administered orally, as opposed to the more clear cut effects in the above mentioned animal experiments, where it was given parenterally (24Tatton W.G. Chalmers-Redman R.M.E. Neurology. 1996; 47: S171-S183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the complications of (−)-deprenyl's metabolism may hamper the search for target(s) and the mechanism of its neurorescuing effect. Dibenzo[b,f]oxepin-10-ylmethyl-methyl-prop-2-ynyl-amine (CGP 3466) 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: CGP 3466, dibenzo[b,f]oxepin-10-ylmethyl-methyl-prop-2-ynyl-amine; PHCGP, CGP 3466 containing a photoreactive aryl azide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; NGF, nerve growth factor; DAPI, 4,6-diamidine-2-phenylindoledihydrochloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ara-C, cytosine arabinonucleoside; pCDNA1-GAPDH, GAPDH expression construct under cytomegalovirus promoter control; pGFP, plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein uracil-DNA-glycolase. is structurally related to (−)-deprenyl but exhibits virtually no monoamine oxidase type B or type A-inhibiting properties and is not metabolized to amphetamines. It showed neurorescuing properties qualitatively similar to, but about 100-fold more potent than, those of (−)-deprenyl in the same in vivo and in vitroparadigms. 2E. Kragten, I. Lalande, L. Zimmermann, S. Roggo, P. Schindler, D. Müller, J. van Oostrum, P. Waldmeier, and P. Fürst, manuscript in preparation. It therefore seemed a useful candidate to be used for a search for potential targets for the neurorescuing properties of this type of compound. In this study, the putative molecular target responsible for mediating its antiapoptotic, neuroprotective effects was identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Compounds (see Fig. 1) were synthesized in house. Rat hippocampi were isolated from Tif:RAIf(SPF) rats (Tierfarm Sisseln, Switzerland). Chemicals used for the BIAcore® experiments were provided by Pharmacia Biotech AB. Rabbit muscle GAPDH, sequencing grade trypsin (bovine pancreas), Complete tablets, and Fast Stain were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Rotenone was obtained from Sigma, and NGF was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Phosphorothioate-modified sense (5′-CAGACACCATGGGGAAGGTG) and antisense (5′-CACCTTCCCCATGGTGTCTG) oligonucleotides were synthesized by Birsner & Grob (Germany). Hippocampi of 50 rats were washed with 100 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for 1 min, and then 2 volumes of lysis buffer were added. Lysis buffer contained 50 mm Na-HEPES, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at pH 7.5 and 20 mm or 1 m NaCl for the low salt (L1) and high salt (L2) buffer, respectively. The hippocampi were disrupted in a polytron mixer and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and the homogenates were used immediately or kept at −80 °C after freezing in dry ice. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C in a Kontron TGA-75 ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g (SW41 rotor, 25,000 rpm) for 1 h. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction, 16 ml) was collected, and aliquots of 2 ml were stored at −80 °C. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer L1 or L2 containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by collection of the supernatant (membrane fraction, 16 ml) in aliquots of 2 ml that were stored at −80 °C. To 1 ml of cytosolic or membrane fractions of rat hippocampus extract was added 50 μl of suspended resin containing 100 meq/ml demethyldeprenyl or CGP 3466 immobilized on Toyopearl AF amino 650 m resin, respectively. Alternatively, to 36 μg of rabbit muscle GAPDH in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer L1 was added 10 μl of suspended resin. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in an end-over-end mixer, the suspension was centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of 50 mm Na-HEPES, 10% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, for 20 min at 4 °C in an end-over-end mixer with intermittent centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 1 min and discarding of the supernatant. The washed resin was resuspended in 20–50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and 20 μl was loaded on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. SDS-PAGE was carried out as described (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Gels were stained using BM Fast Stain according to the manufacturer's instructions. In control experiments, affinity precipitation of the cytosolic fraction in low salt lysis buffer with underivatized and acetylated Toyopearl resin was investigated using the described procedure. Affinity-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described. The gel was silver-stained, and excised bands were prepared for nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry using a recently developed procedure (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar, 27Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gel was silver-stained using a modified procedure to prevent covalent chemical modification of the proteins in the gel. Bands of interest were excised, reduced in gel, carboxymethylated, and digested in gel with trypsin followed by extraction of the generated peptides using 100 μl of 20 mm NH4HCO3 and 3 × 100 μl of 5% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile/water (v/v). Extracted peptides were dried at reduced pressure in a SpeedVac and sequenced using a Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Toronto, Canada). Electrospray needles were obtained from the Protein Analysis Company (Odense, Denmark). Dried protein digests were redissolved in 5% formic acid, concentrated, and desalted on a capillary similar to that used for spraying. It was packed with 100 nl of POROS R2 sorbent (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) and equilibrated with 5% formic acid. After loading the dissolved peptide digest, the capillary was washed with 20 μl of 5% formic acid, 5% methanol. The sample was eluted into the spraying capillary in 2 × 1 μl of 5% formic acid, 50% methanol. Q1 scans were performed with unit mass resolution and mass steps of 0.1 Da. The orifice voltage was 65 V. For operation in the MS/MS mode, Q1 was set to transmit approximately a mass window of 2 Da. The collision energy was tuned individually for peptides of interest to obtain maximum sequence information. Molecular weight information in combination with MS/MS-derived short sequence tags were used to search the newest SWISSPROT data base release and, if necessary, the translated GenBankTM data base with PeptideSearch version 2.9.2b1 running on a Macintosh computer. CGP 3466 containing a spacer with a free amino group (see Fig. 1) was covalently linked to the surface of a flow cell on a research grade CM5 sensor chip using an amine coupling kit from Pharmacia. The flow was 10 μl/min. throughout the derivatization procedure. The sensor chip was activated by a 7-min pulse of 0.05 m N-hydrosuccinimide, 0.2m N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Then, from a stock solution of 25 μg/ml in dimethylacetamide, a 16 mm solution of CGP 3466 with spacer in dimethylacetamide/boric acid buffer, pH 9.0, 3:1 (v/v), was prepared by dilution, and 25 μl was immediately injected on the activated sensor chip. Unreacted activated sites on the chip were subsequently blocked by injecting 70 μl of 1 m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.5. The derivatized sensor chip was washed extensively with HBS (10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20). Binding experiments were done by injecting 35 μl of solutions containing rabbit muscle GAPDH plus various additives (see figure legends) at a flow of 5 μl/min. The sensor chip surface was regenerated by injection of 20 μl of 6m guanidinium HCl in HBS at 5 μl/min. Prior to injection in the BIAcore® rabbit muscle, GAPDH was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against HBS using Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer® 10 K dialysis cassettes. Unspecific binding was evaluated using flow cells on the chip with underivatized surface or surface derivatized with ethanolamine. Cytosolic and membrane extract of rat hippocampi corresponding to 100 μg of total protein or 5 μg of rabbit muscle GAPDH were incubated with 5 nm125I-PHCGP (2000 Ci/mmol) and 5 μm PHCGP (Fig. 1 F) in 50 μl of lysis buffer L1 for 30 min at 37 °C. In competition experiments, proteins were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence of photoaffinity ligand with the appropriate amounts of competitor. After incubation, samples were cooled on ice for 5–10 min and exposed to 254-nm UV light with an intensity of 3000 watts/cm2 for 120 s. Immediately after exposure, samples were quenched, diluted with 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel as described (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The gel was subsequently vacuum-dried on paper and exposed for the indicated amount of time to Kodak Bio-Max MS or Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C using an intensifying screen. Samples were separated together with prestained standard mixtures (Bio-Rad) as molecular weight standards. PAJU cell pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim). The cells were swollen on ice and lysed by repeated aspiration in a plastic syringe. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 14,000 rpm, the supernatant was kept as cytosolic fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol containing the protease inhibitor mixture and 10 units/ml DNase I. The protein concentration was estimated with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, calibrated with bovine serum albumin. 1 μg of total protein/lane was separated electrophoretically on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently blotted on to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). Immunoblots were probed with rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody from Chemicon as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PAJU tumor cell line was kindly provided by L. C. Andersson (University of Helsinki). The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, in a surface-adherent manner. The cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. 24 h after seeding, spontaneous differentiation was enhanced by the addition of NGF to 100 ng/ml. 1 day after triggering differentiation, the cells were induced in apoptosis by adding 3 μm rotenone. CGP 3466 was added at 10−9m 1 h before exposure to rotenone. Cell death was quantified microscopically by nuclear DNA analysis; the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After fixing, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidine-2-phenylindoledihydrochloride (DAPI; Boehringer Mannheim). Cells were transfected with the Superfect kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GFP-expressing cells were counted 2 days after transfection by means of fluorescence microscopy using a Leica DM IRB microscope. Deprenyl-related compounds (Fig. 1) have been reported to rescue serum-deprived cultured PC12 cells from apoptosis. In an attempt to isolate potential target proteins of these compounds, extracts of neuronal rat cells were used in affinity precipitation experiments. Cytosolic and membrane fractions of rat hippocampal lysates were incubated with CGP 3466 or (−)-demethyldeprenyl immobilized to Toyopearl resin (Fig. 1, D and E) followed by extensive washing. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Binding to immobilized CGP 3466 appeared more selective than to immobilized (−)-demethyldeprenyl. Using immobilized CGP 3466, four protein bands at approximately 38, 43, 50, and 200 kDa that were prominent in the cytosolic extracts, appeared to be enriched compared with the total extracts (Fig. 2 A). These were selected for identification by the nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry/sequence tag approach after silver staining and in gel tryptic digestion (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar, 27Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). In general, a tandem mass spectrum of a selected peptide provided a short sequence stretch, which, together with molecular weight information, enabled us to identify the respective parent protein in publicly available sequence data bases. Identification was verified by applying the same procedure to the additional peptides present in the digest. On the basis of four individual peptides (Table I), the protein band at 38 kDa was recognized to represent GAPDH. The tryptic digests of the bands at 43, 50, and 200 kDa contained peptides corresponding to α- or β-actin or a mixture of both, α- and β-tubulin, and α- and β-spectrin respectively. The amino acid sequence for α- or β-spectrin in rat was not present in publicly available data bases; identification was based upon the presence of the identified amino acid sequences in α- and β-spectrin in related species. To evaluate unspecific binding to the resin, affinity precipitation of cytosolic extract with underivatized Toyopearl resin and acetylated Toyopearl resin was performed. An intense band at approximately 50 kDa on the SDS-PAGE gel at a position corresponding to that of tubulin and a weaker band at 43 kDa at the position of actin indicated unspecific binding to both underivatized Toyopearl resin and acetylated Toyopearl (Fig. 2 B). Affinity precipitation experiments using commercially available purified rabbit muscle GAPDH were done to prove direct interaction of GAPDH with CGP 3466 and (−)-demethyldeprenyl and to exclude indirect binding via cytoskeletal proteins. Rabbit muscle GAPDH did bind to CGP 3466 immobilized on Toyopearl, whereas no binding to underivatized or acetylated Toyopearl was observed (Fig. 2 C).Table IIdentification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-derived peptides by electrospray mass spectrometryPeptideSequence1GAAQNIIPASTGAAK2VGVDGFGR3VIPELDGK4LTGMAFR Open table in a new tab To further substantiate the affinity precipitation results and to exclude artifacts arising from immobilization of ligands, photoaffinity labeling, a method relying on solution interactions, was performed. Photoaffinity labeling was carried out using a derivative of CGP 3466 containing a photoreactive aryl azide (PHCGP) substituted with 125I linked through a spacer (Fig. 1 F). Rat hippocampus extract or purified rabbit muscle GAPDH was incubated with PHCGP at 37 °C, cross-linked by photoactivation at 254 nm, and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were detected by exposing the dried SDS-PAGE gels to x-ray film. Bands with variable intensities at approximately 200, 70, 50, 38, 30, and 27 kDa in the cytosolic extract and at approximately 50, 40, and 36 kDa in the membrane extract were observed (Fig. 3 A). In the same experiment, purified rabbit muscle GAPDH generated a labeled band at the same position as the 38-kDa band in the cytosolic extract, suggesting that labeled GAPDH is present in the rat hippocampus extract. Identically treated samples that were not UV-exposed generated only very faint bands, indicating that labeling was essentially UV-dependent (Fig. 3 A). The identities of the other bands were not investigated. Since GAPDH was the only protein consistently present in both affinity precipitation and photoaffinity labeling experiments and did not show unspecific binding in the affinity precipitation experiments, this interaction was further investigated. Nonradioactive PHCGP and NAD+ were found to effectively compete with PHCGP for labeling of purified rabbit muscle GAPDH, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. (Fig. 3,B and C). The single protein consistently identified by both affinity precipitation and photoaffinity labeling as selectively interacting with CGP 3466 was GAPDH. To further characterize this interaction kinetically, purified rabbit muscle GAPDH was investigated using BIAcore®technology. A CGP 3466 derivative with an appropriate spacer (Fig. 1 G) was covalently linked by amine coupling to a CM-Sepharose chip. Experiments were started by injecting a solution of rabbit muscle GAPDH in binding buffer, allowing association to take place, followed by a pulse of eluent during which bound GAPDH could dissociate. The derivatized surface was regenerated by injecting 6m guanidinium HCl. A typical sensorgram for different concentrations of GAPDH shows concentration-dependent binding (Fig. 4 A). Using BIAcore® evaluation software (version 2.1), the dissociation phase displayed a good fit (χ2 = 0.06) with a model assuming simultaneous dissociation of two binding complexes with dissociation constants on the order of 10−2 and 10−5. The association phase of the binding curve did not fit adequately to any of the available theoretical models; therefore, an association constant could not be determined, suggesting complex association kinetics. Binding experiments in flow cells with unmodified surface or derivatized with ethanol amine indicated that unspecific binding was marginal (data not shown). Binding of GAPDH to immobilized CGP 3466 in the BIAcore® was dramatically reduced after dialysis against binding buffer containing 2 mmNAD+. A concentration-dependent increase in binding was observed after reduction of the NAD+concentration by dilution with GAPDH dialyzed against binding buffer (Fig. 4 B). The human neuroblastoma cell line PAJU was established as an in vitromodel system to investigate CGP 3466 functionally. In a typical culture of PAJU cells, a small percentage of the cells spontaneously stop to proliferate and exhibit neural sprouting (29Zhang K.Z. Westberg J.A. Hölttä E. Andersson L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4505-4508Google Scholar). The proportion of cells undergoing differentiation can be increased to almost 100% by the addition of phorbolesters (e.g. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). We examined PAJU cells in presence or absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate morphologically. More than 90% of cells in a given culture show neural sprouting in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. However, most of the remaining cells undergo apoptosis as visualized by staining of condensed chromosomal DNA with DAPI. Such spontaneous induction of apoptosis by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate rendered the semiquantitative analysis of apoptosis effectors difficult. Alternative procedures to induce differentiation were tested to reduce the background of cell death. Experimental conditions involving a 24-h exposure to NGF have proven to effectively differentiate cells with no apparent dead cells. NGF-differentiated PAJU cells were treated in a number of ways known to induce apoptosis in cellular model systems: rotenone, high concentrations of ara-C, carbamoyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, or peroxide. For most compounds, the concentration range yielding reproducible and quantifiable numbers of apoptotic cells was very narrow. The mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone was selected as the apoptosis inducer most suitable for subsequent experiments as illustrated in Fig. 5. The conditions for rotenone-induced apoptosis were optimized (3 μm) so that approximately 50% of the cells die within 20 h after toxin addition as observed by DAPI staining (Fig. 5, B and D) and by following the loss of neural processes morphologically (Fig. 5,A and C). CGP 3466 exhibits antiapoptotic effects in vitro in trophically withdrawn PC12 cells 3W. G. Tatton, R. M. Chalmers-Redman, and N. A. Tatton, manuscript in preparation. and in cerebellar granule cells treated with ara-C. 4I. A. Paterson and C. Voll, manuscript in preparation. We therefore analyzed PAJU cells partially forced into apoptosis by rotenone in the presenceversus absence of CGP 3466 by DAPI staining. Up to 40% more cells survived when treated with compound in a concentration-dependent manner. Concentrations in the range of 1 nm were most effective (Fig. 5 E). The degree of confluency of the cell culture was critically influencing CGP 3466-mediated protection. Similar protective properties of CGP 3466 were seen upon induction of apoptosis with 3 mm ara-C (not shown). The number of neural processes and the length of them seen in CGP 3466-treated cells was lower that in NGF-treated control cells, in agreement with the observation that the drug was delaying rather than preventing apoptosis. In conclusion, PAJU cells were established as a model system to investigate the mechanism of drug-mediated protection from apoptosis. Photoaffinity labeling and BIAcore®experiments established a specific interaction between CGP 3466 and GAPDH. To approach the functional relevance of this interaction with respect to regulating apoptosis, PAJU cells were treated with GAPDH antisense oligonucleotides. The antisense oligonucleotide was designed to span the ATG initiation codon. The antisense oligonucleotide was able to significantly protect PAJU cells from rotenone-induced (Fig. 6 C) and ara-C-induced apoptosis (not shown) in a concentration-dependent manner. In comparison, adding identical concentrations of the corresponding sense oligonucleotide did not significantly change the number of apoptotic cells upon rotenone challenge. The addition of CGP 3466 together with antisense oligonucleotide did not lead to further increase of surviving cells, in agreement with the hypothesis that both affect the same pathway.

The pathophysiological consequences of these mutations are unknown. We have introduced the four single mutations reported for the human α1A subunit into the conserved rabbit α1A(R192Q, T666M, V714A, and I1819L) and investigated possible changes in channel function after functional expression of mutant subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes.Changes in channel gating were observed for mutants T666M, V714A, and I1819L but not for R192Q. Ba2+ current (IBa) inactivation was slightly faster in mutants T666M and V714A than in wild type. The time course of recovery from channel inactivation was slower than in wild type in T666M and accelerated in V714A and I1819L. As a consequence, accumulation of channel inactivation during a train of 1-Hz pulses was more pronounced for mutant T666M and less pronounced for V714A and I1819A. Our data demonstrate that three of the four FHM mutations, located at the putative channel pore, alter inactivation gating and provide a pathophysiological basis for the postulated neuronal instability in patients with FHM.

This channel type is not only located on nerve cell bodies and dendrites but is also present in presynaptic terminals (3Westenbroek R.E. Sakurai T. Elliott E.M. Hell J.W. Starr T.V. Snutch T.P.

This suggests that a tight control of P/Q-type Ca2+ channel activity is a prerequisite to fine tune its physiological function. Missense mutations in the gene encoding human α1A(CACNL1A4) have recently been found to segregate with patients suffering from familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) 1The abbreviations were used: FHM, familial hemiplegic migraine; BAPTA, 1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid.

Although FHM represents a rare form of migraine, a detailed analysis of the functional consequences of this channelopathy may provide insight into the pathophysiology of migraine. Mutations in the CACNL1A4 gene could also underly more common forms of migraine with and without aura (10May A. Ophoff R.A. Terwindt G.M. Urban C. Eijk R.v. Haan J. Diener H.C. Lindhout D. Frants R.R. Sandkuijl L.A. Ferrari M.D. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The pathophysiology of migraine remains to be fully understood and the mechanisms triggering an attack are unknown. Recent advances in brain imaging techniques (positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy) support a “primary neuronal theory” where attacks originate on the basis of a neuronal hyperexcitability of unknown origin (11Schoenen J. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Flippen C. Welch K.M.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Zagami A.S. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1994; 7: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Tfelt-Hansen P. Pharmacol.

This may be the underlying cause of cortical spreading depression and hypoperfusion, phenomena associated with migraine attacks (12Flippen C. Welch K.M.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Zagami A.S. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1994; 7: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Neuronal instability within central pain-modulating serotoninergic systems could not only serve as a “brainstem generator” of attacks but also initiate the headache and the events of neurogenic inflammation in the trigeminovascular system (12Flippen C. Welch K.M.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is therefore attractive to speculate that the four single α1A mutations found in FHM patients lead to such a neuronal instability by changes in P/Q-type Ca2+ channel function. As the direct analysis of changes in α1A Ca2+channel gating in human tissue samples is not feasible, we introduced the corresponding mutations into rabbit α1 subunits, which shares 94% sequence identity with the human α1A, and analyzed the biophysical properties of the mutant channels after heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Nucleotide numbering of restriction sites is given in parentheses. Mutants were constructed by applying the “geneSOEing” technique (16Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Mutation R192Q was constructed by using aHindIII (5′-pSPCBI-2 polylinker region)-NotI (894) cassette within the subclone. The mutation was subsequently introduced into BI-II by co-ligation of the mutated subclone fragmentHindIII (5′-pSPCBI-2 polylinker region)-XhoI (1689) with fragments XhoI (1689)-SphI (5858),SphI (5858)-XbaI (3′ of polyadenylation signal), and XbaI (3′ of polyadenylation signal)-HindIII (5′-pSPCBI-2 polylinker region) from pSPCBI-2, respectively. Single mutants T666M and V714A were constructed by using aXhoI (1689)-HindIII (2503) cassette in the subclone after elimination of the 5′-polylinker HindIII restriction site. The single mutations were subsequently introduced into pSPCBI-2 by exchanging a XhoI (1689)-NheI (3543) fragment in pSPCBI-2 for the respective mutant sequence. Mutation I1819L (corresponding to the human FHM mutation I1811L) was constructed by exchanging the KpnI-BglII cassette of construct AL22 (19Döring F. Degtiar V.E. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Hering S.

All polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were sequenced completely to confirm sequence integrity. Preparation of stage V-VI oocytes from X. laevis and injection of cRNA are described in detail elsewhere (17Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H.

Capped run-off poly(A+) cRNA transcripts from XbaI-linearized cDNA templates were synthesized according to the procedures of Krieg and Melton (20Krieg P.A. Melton D.A.

To exclude effects of endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− currents on current kinetics experiments were also carried out in oocytes previously injected with 50–100 nl of a 0.1 mBAPTA solution. Inward Ba2+currents (IBa) through expressed channel complexes were measured using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique as described previously (17Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Similar current amplitudes were obtained with mutant and wild type α1A subunits. Oocytes expressing peak IBa smaller than 400 nA or larger than 1.6 μA were excluded from analysis. Data analysis and acquisition was performed by using the pClamp software package (version 6.0, Axon Instruments). Recordings were carried out at room temperature in a bath solution containing 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 40 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid. Voltage recording and current injecting microelectrodes were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 0.2 m CsOH, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl), and had resistances of 0.3–2 megohm. Recovery of IBa from inactivation was studied using a double-pulse protocol. After a 3-s depolarizing prepulse to +10 mV (holding potential −80 mV) the time course of IBa recovery was determined at −60 mV by applying 300-ms test pulses to +10 mV at various time intervals after the prepulse. Peak IBa was normalized to the peak current amplitude measured during the prepulse.IBa was then allowed to recover during 1 min at −100 mV. This double pulse protocol was repeated individually for each recovery time interval in the same oocyte. The voltage dependence of inactivation (steady state inactivation) was determined from normalized inward currents elicited during steps to +10 mV after 10-s steps to various holding potentials. The voltage dependence of activation was determined from I-V curves obtained by step depolarizations from a holding potential of −80 mV to various test potentials. The half-maximal voltage for activation (V0.5,act), the slope factor of the curve atV0.5,act (kact), the half-maximal voltage for steady state inactivation (kinact), and the slope factor of the curve (V0.5,inact) were obtained by fitting the data to the Boltzmann equation. Nonlinear least square fitting and statistical calculations were performed using OriginR(Microcal). Data are given as means ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. To study the functional consequences of single amino acid mutations associated with human FHM we introduced the corresponding mutations into the rabbit α1A subunit (BI-II, Ref. 18Mori Y. Friedrich T.

Their positions are illustrated in Fig. 1 A. Human mutation I1811L corresponds to I1819L in rabbit α1A. Wild type and mutant α1A subunits were functionally expressed in X. laevis oocytes (together with accessory β1a and α2δ subunits) and macroscopic channel properties measured using the two microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. The half-maximal voltage for activation (V0.5act) was slightly, but significantly, shifted toward more negative potentials for mutants T666M, V714A, and I1819L (Table I). The midpoint voltage for steady-state inactivation was not significantly affected (Table I). The effects of mutations on IBa decay during a 3-s pulse applied from a holding potential of −80 mV to +10 mV is illustrated in Fig. 1, B and C. For wild type and mutant channels, current decay could be well described by a double exponential time course. The fast component of current decay was significantly (p < 0.01) faster for mutants T666M and V714A but not for I1819L and R192Q (Fig. 1 C).

Open table in a new tab The mutational effects on current inactivation could affect the accumulation of channels in inactivation during frequent depolarizations at high firing rates in neurons. To test this possibility we applied trains of pulses (1 Hz) from a holding potential of −60 mV to a test potential of +10 mV. As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, IBadecreased by 18 ± 1% (n = 14) during a train of 15 pulses in wild type channels. In mutants T666M, V714A, I1819L, but not in R192Q, the amount of accumulation in an inactivated state was significantly (p < 0.01) different from wild type. Peak IBa decrease during the pulse train was about 2-fold larger in T666M (34 ± 2%, n = 15) and about 2-fold smaller in I1819L (7.2 ± 0.8%,n = 6) than in wild type. Less accumulation in inactivation was also found for mutant V714A (13.2 ± 0.5%,n = 14). At the more negative holding potential of −80 mVIBa current decay of mutants T666M (12.7 ± 1%, n = 15) and I1819L (4.5 ± 0.6%,n = 6) was also significantly different from wild type (7.5 ± 0.4%, n = 14). The accumulation of channels in inactivation during a pulse train depends on how fast inactivation is removed between pulses. We therefore investigated the effects of the mutations on the time course of recovery by employing a double pulse protocol (Fig. 3). Wild type and mutant channels were inactivated by a 3-s conditioning prepulse from −80 mV to +10 mV (Fig. 1 B). The time course of recovery from inactivation at −60 mV was determined by subsequent test pulses applied at various times after the prepulse as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In wild type and mutant channels about 90% of IBarecovered within 20 s. The time course followed a biexponential function suggesting that recovery occurs from more than one inactivated state. In wild type the fast component (τfast = 0.432 ± 0.033 s, n = 7) accounted for 68 ± 2% of recovered IBa and was about 8-fold faster than the slow component (τslow = 3.1 ± 0.34 s). Mutations T666M, V714A, and I1819L profoundly altered the time course of channel recovery from inactivation (Fig. 3, A and B). Mutant T666M slowed IBa recovery mainly by significantly increasing τfast and, to a smaller extent, also τslow (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to T666M, mutants V714A and I1819L recovered much faster than the wild type channel. These mutations significantly increased the contribution of the fast recovering component, decreased τfast 3–4-fold (Fig. 3 B) and slightly reduced τslow. The slower recovery from inactivation of T666M explains the enhanced accumulation of these channels in inactivation during pulse trains, whereas accelerated recovery of I1819L decreases such accumulation (Fig. 2). Mutation V714A also accelerated recovery from inactivation but yet exhibited a larger IBadecrease during the train than I1819L (Fig. 2 B). This can be explained by the finding that mutation V714A, but not I1819L, accelerated inactivation during a single test pulse (Fig. 1 B), which can also favor accumulation in inactivation during pulse trains. Taken together our data clearly demonstrate that FHM mutations T666M, V714A, and I1819L affect α1A Ca2+ channel inactivation kinetics. This can cause significant changes in channel availability at higher depolarization frequencies. Our data provide convincing evidence that three of the four mutations reported in FHM patients (9Ophoff R.A. Terwindt G.M. Vergouwe M.N. Eijk R.v. Oefner P.J. Hoffmann S.M.G. Lamerdin J.E. Mohrenweiser H.W. Bulman D.E. Ferrari M. Haan J. Lindhout D. van Ommen G.J.B. Hofker M.H. Ferrari M.D. Frants R.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 543-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar) affect the kinetic properties and the voltage dependence of α1A Ca2+channel activation. These mutations especially changed channel recovery from inactivation and thereby altered the extent to which mutant channels accumulate in an inactivated state during rapid depolarizations. Our experiments show that these mutations yield at least two functional phenotypes, leading to either an increase or a decrease in Ca2+ channel availability. Mutants V714A and I1819L are located at almost identical positions at the intracellular end of the homologous helices S6 in repeats II (V714) and IV (I1819). Both accelerated recovery from inactivation and slightly shifted the activation curve toward more negative potentials. Therefore these mutations should increase Ca2+ channel availability and promote voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx into neurons. Mutation T666M is located in the linker IIS5-S6. It also slightly shifted the voltage dependence of activation toward more negative potentials but simultaneously slowed channel recovery from inactivation. The latter effect can decrease channel availability at high stimulation frequency (Fig. 2). Our data are in accordance with previous findings describing changes in the inactivation properties by site-directed mutations in the S6 segments of voltage-gated Ca2+ (19Döring F. Degtiar V.E.

Neuropharmacology. 1997; 35: 761-773Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the S5-S6 linkers (containing mutation T666M) and S6 segments (containing V714A and I1819L) participate in the formation of the ion pore. Our data obtained with the FHM mutations therefore further support the hypothesis (24Hering S. Aczel S. Grabner M. Döring F. Berjukow S. Mitterdorfer J. Sinnegger M.J. Striessnig J. Degtiar V.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24471-24475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that pore-forming residues play an important role for Ca2+ channel inactivation. Mutation R192Q eliminates a conserved positive charge within the amphipathic helix IS4, one of the putative voltage sensors (31Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer, Sunderland1991Google Scholar). The finding that its mutation does not cause detectable functional changes under our experimental conditions is surprising. A recent analysis of charge neutralizing S4 mutations in a L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit (32Garcia J. Nakai J. Imoto K. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2515-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that a large number but not all conservative positive charges in S4 contribute to channel gating. Charge neutralizations with no effect onV0.5 were mainly seen in IIS4 and IVS4 but also included a residue in IS4. Our data also do not rule out possible effects of R192Q on the time course of current activation, which was not analyzed in our study. Our data obtained with FHM mutations T666M, V714A, and I1819L agree with the hypothesis (9Ophoff R.A. Terwindt G.M. Vergouwe M.N. Eijk R.v. Oefner P.J. Hoffmann S.M.G. Lamerdin J.E. Mohrenweiser H.W. Bulman D.E. Ferrari M. Haan J. Lindhout D. van Ommen G.J.B. Hofker M.H. Ferrari M.D. Frants R.R.

Neurol. 1997; 10: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that mutations in the α1Asubunit underly the neuronal instability which renders patients susceptible to migraine attacks that can be triggered by neural stimuli, such as stress or sensory afferentiation (12Flippen C. Welch K.M.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Färkkilä M. Ann. Med. 1994; 26: 7-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As FHM (and other more common hereditary forms of migraine) is an autosomal dominant disease (15Färkkilä M. Ann. Med. 1994; 26: 7-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), only a fraction of the channels should be affected by the mutations. With the exception of cerebellar degeneration, FHM (and other migraine) patients show no other major disturbances in neurological function, suggesting that the functional consequences of the mutations only become physiologically relevant under certain conditions. This assumption agrees with our observation that the functional consequences of altered inactivation properties become especially obvious only at higher stimulation frequency. Presynaptic V714A and I1819L channels can be considered “gain-of-function” mutants under these conditions. Their relative contribution to Ca2+ entry would gradually increase with firing rate because they are expected to accumulate to a smaller extent in inactivation than wild type α1A. This could result in higher than normal Ca2+ entry with even more pronounced effects on neurotransmitter release, which can rise with the fourth power of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Such an enhanced Ca2+ entry could eventually also lead to episodes of neuronal Ca2+ overloading and explain the cerebellar neurodegeneration observed in some FHM patients, including patients with the I1811L (rabbit I1819L) mutation (9Ophoff R.A. Terwindt G.M. Vergouwe M.N. Eijk R.v. Oefner P.J. Hoffmann S.M.G. Lamerdin J.E. Mohrenweiser H.W. Bulman D.E. Ferrari M. Haan J. Lindhout D. van Ommen G.J.B. Hofker M.H. Ferrari M.D. Frants R.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 543-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). The situation is even more complex because mutant P/Q-type Ca2+ channels must also be localized on cell bodies and dendrites (3Westenbroek R.E. Sakurai T. Elliott E.M. Hell J.W. Starr T.V. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6403-6418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There alterations in Ca2+ entry at high firing rates could affect neuronal Ca2+-dependent processes, such as Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and gene transcription. Decreased Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ channels (such as expected for mutant T666M) into cell bodies can also increase the firing rate of a neuron. Inhibition of Ca2+ current can diminish neuronal spike after hyperpolarizations (e.g. by decreased activation of Ca2+-activated K+-channels, 33Storm J.F. Pedarzani P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2098-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as has recently been shown,e.g. for P/Q-type channels in caudal raphe neurons (34Bayliss D.A. Li Y.-W. Talley E.M. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1362-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Among others, these neurons seem to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of migraine (12Flippen C. Welch K.M.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our data prompt further experiments to assess the pathophysiological consequences of the FHM mutations under conditions that more closely resemble neuronal activity in vivo. It will be especially important to study the effects of the mutations at 37 °C. At this temperature faster channel kinetics would allow higher stimulation rates than in our experiments in X. laevis oocytes. Higher stimulation frequency may lead to considerable accumulation in inactivation even during trains of much shorter pulses than used in our study. Although our data clearly demonstrate that three of the four FHM mutations lead to significant alterations in α1A subunit function, several questions remain to be answered. The rabbit and human α1A share high sequence identity (93.5%) with sequence heterology limited to the C-terminal tail and the long cytoplasmic loops (9Ophoff R.A. Terwindt G.M. Vergouwe M.N. Eijk R.v. Oefner P.J. Hoffmann S.M.G. Lamerdin J.E. Mohrenweiser H.W. Bulman D.E. Ferrari M. Haan J. Lindhout D. van Ommen G.J.B. Hofker M.H. Ferrari M.D. Frants R.R.

Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Only a total of 4 amino acid differences exists in the putative pore forming region (consisting of S5, S5-S6 linkers, S6 of the four repeats). Despite this high conservation quantitative or qualitative differences of mutational effects on rabbit and human α1A cannot be excluded. The three mutations affecting channel gating are located in conserved regions participating in the formation of the channel pore. They are not located within other known functional domains of the channel, such as α1 subunit interaction domains for accessory subunits (35Pragnell M. De Waard M. Tanabe T. Mori Y. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) or G-proteins (36De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P.

Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This suggests that their effects are not indirectly caused by interfering with subunit or G-protein interactions. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the mutational effects are affected by other factors such as the β subunit isoform (β1-β4) associated with the mutant α1A (8Liu H. De Waard M.

The biophysical characteristics of the mutants may also be affected by the permeating ion. Our data demonstrate that residues in putative pore-forming regions of Ca2+ channel α1A subunits determine inactivation properties. Further experiments are required to prove that FHM mutations alter Ca2+ entry and neurotransmitter release preferentially at high firing rates in intact neurons. We thank Dr. Y.

The introduction of the dominant negative mutants of TRAF2 and TRAF5 into HSB-2-OX40 cells suppressed NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the introduction of TRAF3 together with the dominant negative mutants of TRAF2 or TRAF5 further reduced NF-κB activation. These results indicate that the NF-κB activation resulting from OX40 stimulation is mediated by both TRAF2 and TRAF5, and is likely to be negatively modulated by TRAF3.

All the members of this superfamily share a characteristic repeating cysteine-rich motif in the extracellular domain, which is believed to be related to their ability to interact with the TNF-related ligands. The diverse cellular responses such as cell growth, differentiation, and programmed cell death (apoptosis) are triggered by the interaction between the members of the NGF-R/TNF-R superfamily and their ligands.

Although these observations have served to delineate OX40 as a multifunctional cell surface molecule, its physiological as well as pathophysiological significance in viral infection, inflammation (15Weinberg A.D.

In particular, intracellular signaling of OX40 has not been described to date. Recently, several types of intracellular signal transducer proteins that bind to the members of the TNF-R family and initiate distinct signal transduction have been identified.

CD30, CD40, TNF-R1, TNF-R2, and lymphotoxin-β receptor recruit several members of a second class of signal transducer family called TRAFs (TNF-R-associated factors).

Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of TRAF-mediated NF-κB activation (37Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, 38Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) or c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the intracellular events of OX40 signaling using a unique coculture system of OX40-transfected T cells and gp34-transfected adherent cells. We here demonstrate that the OX40 stimulation leads to TRAF-mediated NF-κB activation. Based on the experimental results, a possible physiological and pathophysiological significance of the OX40 signaling in activated T cells is discussed. Based on the published cDNA sequence of human gp34, cDNA of the entire coding region of gp34 was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The PCR products were ligated into an expression vector pMKIT Neo (a gift of Dr. K. Maruyama, Tokyo Medical and Dental University) to construct pMKIT Neo-gp34. The preparation of an expression vector, pMKIT Neo-OX40, was described previously (11Imura A. Hori T. Imada K. Ishikawa T. Tanaka Y. Maeda M. Imamura S. Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The constructs for OX40 cytoplasmic deletion mutants were generated by PCR method using TAG (stop codon)-tagged oligonucleotides as the primer and pMKIT Neo-OX40 as the template. The PCR products were ligated into pMKIT Neo to construct pMKIT Neo-OX40-del 1, -del 2, -del 3, -del 4, -del 5, and -del 6. The partial DNA sequences were determined for all the OX40 deletion mutants to confirm the constructs. Based on the published cDNA sequences of murine TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF5, and human TRAF3 and TRAF4, the cDNAs of TRAFs were obtained by RT-PCR. The oligonucleotides covering the entire coding regions of TRAFs and cDNAs from murine cell line DA-1 (for TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF5) or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (for TRAF3 and TRAF4) were used as the primers and the templates, respectively. The PCR products were integrated into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) or HA-tagged expression vector pCMV4-3 HA+ (pCMV-HA, a gift of Dr. W. C. Greene, Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco) to construct pcDNA3-TRAFs or pCMV-HA-TRAFs. The cDNAs of truncated TRAF2 (TRAF2 DN) and truncated TRAF5 (TRAF5 DN) were generated by PCR with the primers covering the amino acid sequence (amino acids 256–501) of TRAF2 (21Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) and (amino acids 233–558) of TRAF5 (35Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), respectively, and then integrated into pcDNA3. A construct for soluble gp34 was designed by fusing the extracellular portion of gp34 (nucleotide sequence, 187–585) to the signal sequence of OX40 (nucleotide sequence, 6–116) at the SmaI site. The fused fragments were ligated into the expression vector pME18S (11Imura A. Hori T. Imada K. Ishikawa T. Tanaka Y. Maeda M. Imamura S. Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. K. Maruyama). Four μg of pME18S-soluble gp34 were transfected into COS-7 cells (1 × 107 cells) by the DEAE-dextran method (39Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Bio Whittaker, Verviers, Belgium) for 24 h and with 1% fetal calf serum for another 48 h. The culture supernatants were collected and concentrated 10-fold with Centriprep 10 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) prior to the assay. The supernatant of COS-7 cells transfected with pME18S-soluble gp34 (soluble gp34-sup) was added to the cell culture at 25% v/v for each assay. The supernatant of COS-7 cells transfected with empty vector (mock-sup) was prepared by the same method as soluble gp34-sup and concentrated 10-fold prior to the assay. Human T cell line HSB-2 and murine epithelial cell line MMCE were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 60 mm tobramycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Human embryo kidney cell-derived cell line HEK 293T and COS-7 were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The stable transfectants of OX40 (HSB-2-OX40 cells), or OX40 deletion mutants (HSB-2-OX40-del 1, -del 2, -del 3, -del 4, -del 5, or -del 6 cells) were prepared by introducing pMKIT Neo-OX40, or pMKIT Neo-OX40-del 1, -del 2, -del 3, -del 4, -del 5, or -del 6 into HSB-2 cells by the electroporation method. The stable transfectants of gp34 (MMCE-gp34 cells) were prepared by introducing pMKIT Neo-gp34 into MMCE cells by the electroporation method. The transfected cells were dispersed in 96-well flat-bottomed plates for clonal selection and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) for 3 weeks. The expression of OX40 or gp34 on the transfected cells was examined with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) prior to the assay. The empty vector was transfected into HSB-2 cells or MMCE cells to prepare HSB-2-mock cells or MMCE-mock cells. The empty vector transfected cells (mock cells) were cultured in 10-cm dishes with RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. The intracellular events in HSB-2-OX40 cells were examined after they were cultured on the monolayer of adhesive MMCE-gp34 cells. The contamination of MMCE-gp34 cells in the harvested cells was evaluated by RT-PCR (94 °C 1 min, 60 °C 1 min, 72 °C 2 min for 25 cycles) using murine specific β-actin primers (forward 5′-CGCTGCGCTGGTCGTCGACA-3′, reverse 5′-CAGCACAGCCTGGATGGCTA-3′) and cDNA from the harvested cells. 0.5% contamination of MMCE-gp34 cells in HSB-2-OX40 cells was detected under the PCR conditions stated above. Nuclear extracts from HSB-2-OX40 cells or HSB-2-mock cells (2 × 106 cells) cocultured with either MMCE-gp34 cells or MMCE-mock cells, or cultured with either soluble gp34-sup or mock-sup for the indicated periods were prepared as described previously (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The nuclear extracts from HSB-2-OX40 cells preincubated (at 37 °C for 30 min) with either anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody (50 μg/ml) (11Imura A. Hori T. Imada K. Ishikawa T. Tanaka Y. Maeda M. Imamura S. Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) or anti-interleukin-2 receptor α chain antibody (anti-Tac, control antibody, 50 μg/ml) prior to coculture with MMCE-gp34 cells were also prepared. Eight μg of nuclear extracts were mixed with32P-labeled κB oligonucleotide containing a binding site for NF-κB/c-Rel homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or 32P-labeled mutant κB oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (Santa Cruz). The binding assay was performed as described previously with a slight modification (41Force W.R. Tillman J.B. Sprung C.N. Spindler S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8863-8871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of the induced NF-κB complex was examined by super shift assay with anti-NF-κB p50 subunit antibody or anti-NF-κB p65 subunit antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Eight μg of nuclear extracts in 10 μl of nuclear extract buffer (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) was incubated with 100 ng of anti-NF-κB antibodies at room temperature for 40 min prior to the binding assay. Two μg of pCMV-HA-TRAF1, -TRAF2, -TRAF3, -TRAF4, -TRAF5, or pCMV-HA were cotransfected with 2 μg of pME18S-OX40 or pME18S into HEK 293T (2 × 105 cells) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation, the cells were lysed in the Triton X lysing buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose 4FF (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) and anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody (11Imura A. Hori T. Imada K. Ishikawa T. Tanaka Y. Maeda M. Imamura S. Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with 7.5% gel (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and subjected to immunoblotting (11Imura A. Hori T. Imada K. Ishikawa T. Tanaka Y. Maeda M. Imamura S. Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) with anti-HA monoclonal antibody, 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim). HA-tagged TRAFs were visualized by ECL detection system (Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL). The same membrane was reused for the detection of OX40 by immunoblotting. The cDNA of cytoplasmic portion of OX40 (corresponding to amino acids 241–277), OX40-del 3 (amino acids 241–249), OX40-del 4 (amino acids 241–255), OX40-del 5 (amino acids 241–263), or OX40-del 6 (amino acids 241–271) was inserted into the GST-fusion vector pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) conjugated with GST-OX40, GST-OX40-del 3, GST-OX40-del 4, GST-OX40-del 5, GST-OX40-del 6, or GST were prepared as described previously (42Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amstr .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Four μg of pCMV-HA-TRAF1, -TRAF2, -TRAF3, -TRAF4, -TRAF5, or pCMV-HA was transfected into HEK 293T cells (2 × 105 cells) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After 48 h of incubation, the cell lysates were prepared by the same method as stated for the in vivo binding assay and mixed with either GST-OX40-, GST-OX40-del 3-, GST-OX40-del 4-, GST-OX40-del 5-, GST-OX40-del 6-, or GST-Sepharose 4B beads by rotating at 4 °C for 6 h. Protein bound to GST or GST-OX40 fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with 7.5% gel (ATTO) and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody 12CA5. Protein bound to GST-OX40-del 3, GST-OX40-del 4, GST-OX40-del 5, or GST-OX40-del 6 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with 10.5% gel (ATTO) and subjected to immunoblotting with biotin-conjugated anti-HA-monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). HA-tagged TRAFs were visualized by ECL detection system (Amersham). In the studies of NF-κB activation by overexpression of TRAFs, 1.5 μg of pcDNA3-TRAF1, -TRAF2, -TRAF3, -TRAF4, -TRAF5, -TRAF2 DN, or -TRAF5 DN were transfected into HSB-2-OX40 cells (1 × 106 cells) together with 500 ng of κB site integrated luciferase reporter gene κB-luc (43Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. W. Greene) and 250 ng of pCSK-LacZ (27Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) by the DEAE-dextran method (44Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The total amount of pcDNA3 constructs was adjusted to 3 μg by adding an empty vector. After 28 h of incubation the cells were lysed in 250 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Toyo Ink Co., Tokyo Japan). Twenty μl of cell extract from each sample were fractionated to measure the luciferase activity in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Toyo Ink) using a luminometer (Bio-Orbit Oy, Turku, Finland). Forty μl of cell extract were fractionated to measure β-galactosidase activity as an internal control (27Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The luminescence values were normalized by the individual β-galactosidase activity. In the experiments of TRAF2- and TRAF5-mediated NF-κB activation, pcDNA3-TRAF2 DN, -TRAF5 DN, -TRAF3, or pcDNA3 was cotransfected with 500 ng of κB-luc and 250 ng of pCSK-LacZ into HSB-2-OX40 cells or HSB-2 mock cells (1 × 106 cells) by the DEAE-dextran method. The total amount of pcDNA3 constructs was adjusted to 3 μg by adding an empty vector. After 24 h of incubation, the transfected cells were cocultured with either MMCE-gp34 cells or MMCE-mock cells for 24 h and then harvested to measure luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity as described above. Activation of NF-κB in HSB-2-OX40 cells was detected by EMSA when the cells were cocultured with MMCE-gp34 cells but not with MMCE-mock cells (Fig. 1 A). The activation was detected from 30 min up to 6 h (the end of culture period, data not shown) after ligand stimulation and blocked clearly by preincubation of HSB-2-OX40 cells with anti-OX40 antibody. The supershift of the band with anti-NF-κB p50 subunit antibody or anti-NF-κB p65 subunit antibody indicated the involvement of NF-κB, consisting of p50 and p65 subunits in OX40-mediated activation. Similar results were obtained when the HSB-2-OX40 cells were incubated with soluble gp34-sup, but not with mock-sup (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the studies with HSB-2-OX40 deletion mutants demonstrated that NF-κB activation was detected in HSB-2-OX40-del 5 (amino acids 1–263) cells and -OX40-del 6 (amino acids 1–271) cells, but not HSB-2-OX40-del 4 (amino acids 1–255) cells after ligand stimulation. These results indicated that the cytoplasmic portion of OX40 consisting of the amino acid sequence 256–263 (GGSFRTPI) was required for the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 1, C and D). It has been reported that TRAFs associate with the receptors of several members of the TNF-R family and initiate the signal transduction upon the ligand stimulation. We examined the association of TRAFs with OX40 using HA-tagged-TRAFs and GST-OX40 fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 2 A, HA-TRAF1, -TRAF2, -TRAF3, and -TRAF5 but not HA-TRAF4 associated with GST-OX40. HA-TRAF1, -TRAF2, -TRAF3, -TRAF4, and -TRAF5 were successfully expressed in HEK293 T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Furthermore, the studies with GST-OX40 deletion mutants demonstrated that TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 associated with GST-OX40-del 5 (amino acids 241–263) and GST-OX40-del 6 (amino acids 241–271) (data not shown), but not with GST-OX40-del 3 (amino acids 241–249) (data not shown) or GST-OX40-del 4 (amino acids 241–255) in vitro(Fig. 2 B). In other words, the cytoplasmic portion of OX40 consisting of the amino acid sequence 256–263 (GGSFRTPI) was required for the association with TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 in vitro. We next examined the association of TRAFs with OX40 in vivo. HA-TRAF2, HA-TRAF3, and HA-TRAF5 were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-OX40 antibody when coexpressed with OX40 in HEK 293T cells, indicating that these TRAFs can associate with OX40 in vivo(Fig. 3). HA-TRAF1 and HA-TRAF4 were successfully expressed in HEK 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. However, the association of HA-TRAF1 or HA-TRAF4 with OX40 in vivo was not detected under this condition (data not shown). To evaluate the ability of various TRAFs to mediate NF-κB activation in HSB-2-OX40 cells, pcDNA3-TRAFs were transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid κB-luc into HSB-2-OX40 cells. The luciferase assay of the transfected cell lysates demonstrated that TRAF2 and TRAF5 but not TRAF1, TRAF3, or TRAF4 were able to mediate NF-κB activation when overexpressed in HSB-2-OX40 cells (Fig. 4 A). Since TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 were found to associate with OX40 in vivo, we examined the effects of TRAF3 on NF-κB activation mediated by TRAF2 or TRAF5 in HSB-2-OX40 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the introduction of TRAF3 reduced the levels of NF-κB activation by overexpressed TRAF2 or TRAF5. Based on this experiment, we further examined the roles of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF3 in NF-κB activation resulting from OX40 stimulation by introducing the dominant negative forms of TRAF2 (TRAF2 DN), TRAF5 (TRAF5 DN), or wild type TRAF3 into HSB-2-OX40 cells. The transfected HSB-2-OX40 cells were stimulated by MMCE-gp34 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the introduction of TRAF2 DN or TRAF5 DN suppressed the luciferase activity in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, the introduction of both TRAF2 DN and TRAF5 DN suppressed the luciferase activity markedly to the lowest level. The introduction of TRAF3 together with TRAF2 DN or TRAF5 DN reduced NF-κB activation further, which suggests that TRAF3 modulates NF-κB activation negatively in OX40 signaling. In the present study, we demonstrated that TRAF2- and TRAF5-mediated NF-κB activation was induced by OX40 stimulation. We have had difficulties in the study of human OX40 signaling, since neither of our two anti-OX40 monoclonal antibodies (11Imura A. Hori T. Imada K. Ishikawa T. Tanaka Y. Maeda M. Imamura S. Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) could trigger OX40 signaling even when cross-linked with the second antibody. We, therefore, employed a unique coculture system of OX40-transfected HSB-2 cells and human gp34-transfected MMCE cells. The separation of HSB-2-OX40 cells from MMCE-gp34 cells was easy and the contamination of MMCE-gp34 cells in the harvested cells was estimated to be less than 0.5% by RT-PCR method using murine specific primers. We also employed the culture supernatants of COS-7 cells transfected with the soluble gp34-construct in most of the assays to confirm the data obtained from the coculture system. Although the signals triggered by soluble gp34 were somewhat weaker than those by membrane-bound gp34, the experiments with soluble gp34 gave essentially the same results. The studies with OX40 deletion mutants demonstrated that the cytoplasmic portion of OX40 consisting of the amino acid sequence 256–263 (GGSFRTPI) was required for association with TRAFs and NF-κB activation. It is notable that the potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C is included in this portion of 8 amino acid residues (4Latza U. Dürkop H. Schnittger S. Ringeling J. Eitelbach F. Hummel M. Fonatsch C. Stein H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, our preliminary studies showed the induction of c-jun mRNA by OX40 stimulation, for which the same intracytoplasmic portion GGSFRTPI was required (data not shown). Taken together, we consider that this portion of 8 amino acid residues constitutes a part of the crucial domain that initiates multiple signal transductions upon OX40 stimulation. Previous studies demonstrated that several members of TRAFs associate with the members of the TNF-R family and initiate signal transduction. For example, TNF-R2 is associated with TRAF1, TRAF2, or TRAF3 (23Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kief E.

In some of these reports, two independent motifs in the receptors, EEEGKE and PXQE, have been described as “TRAFs-binding motifs” (31Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Duckett C.S. Van Dongen J.L. Thompson C.B. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 233: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). While the EEEGKE motif that interacts with TRAF1 and TRAF2, but not with TRAF3, is not found in OX40, the PXQE motif that interacts with TRAF2 and TARF3 is conserved among CD30 (amino acids 561–564), CD40 (amino acids 250–253), and OX40 (amino acids 262–265). However, the OX40 deletion mutant HSB-2-OX40 del 5 (amino acids 1–263) cells were able to trigger intracellular signaling leading to NF-κB activation upon ligand stimulation and GST-OX40 del 5 (amino acids 241–263) was able to associate with TRAFs in vitro. We, therefore, need further evaluation to determine whether all four amino acid residues (PXQE) are indispensable for the association with TRAFs and NF-κB activation. Several reports indicate that TRAFs are recruited to the receptor by forming the complex with the receptor-associated molecules such as TRADD (21Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) and/or TRAF-associated molecules such as c-IAP (24Rothe M. Pan M.-G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V.

Med. 1997; 185: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, possible that the binding site and the binding affinity between TRAFs and the receptors are affected by such interacting molecules. In most of the members of the TNF-R family, TRAF2 and/or TRAF5 are responsible for the activation of NF-κB, while the function of TRAF1 (31Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TRAF3, or TRAF4 (47Regnier C.H. Tomassetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M.-P. Wendling C. Basset P. Rio M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) has not been clearly understood. We demonstrated that both TRAF2 and TRAF5 mediated NF-κB activation in OX40 signaling, whereas TRAF3 exerted suppressive effects on NF-κB activation as previously reported in CD30 signaling (31Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to elucidate the precise role of TRAF3 in OX40 signaling. TRAF-mediated NF-κB activation, indeed, has furnished a clue to the understanding of the signaling in the several members of the TNF-R family. However, studies of the downstream events after NF-κB activation as well as other signaling pathways would be one of the key issues to be addressed to give a satisfactory explanation of the diverse cellular responses triggered by the stimulation of the members of the TNF-R family. Recently several groups reported that the activation of NF-κB blocked apoptosis (48Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 49Van Antwerp D.J.

Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar), which may help to understand the role of the OX40/gp34 system in vivo. The conspicuous feature of the OX40/gp34 system among the TNF-R/TNF family is its ability to mediate adhesion between activated or HTLV-I-transformed T cells and endothelial cells. It is, therefore, possible that the OX40 signaling in T cells is triggered by the interaction with endothelial cells of the tissues where activated T cells expressing OX40 are infiltrating. OX40-mediated NF-κB activation in T cells may serve to protect them from apoptosis, which results in the amplification and prolongation of the immune responses, or in the case of adult T cell leukemia, prolonged survival of leukemic cells in the infiltrated tissues.

Through binding to the p55 TNF receptor (TNF-R55), TNF rapidly activates two distinct forms of SMases, a membrane-associated neutral (N-) SMase and an acid (A-) SMase (1Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), which reside in caveolae (2Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Biol.

Each type of SMase hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond of sphingomyelin to yield the neutral lipid second messenger ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Ceramide generated by N-SMase at the plasma membrane directs the activation of ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAPK) (3Mathias S. Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activated Raf-1 in turn phosphorylates and stimulates a dual specificity mitogen-activated kinase (MEK-1), which eventually phosphorylates and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). The downstream targets of endosomal-derived ceramide produced by A-SMase are not yet defined but may include protein kinase C (PKCζ), JNK, and caspases (6Müller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). N-SMase activation is mediated by neutral sphingomyelinase domain (NSD), spanning an 11-amino acid motif N-terminally adjacent to the death domain of TNF-R55 (9Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K.

The domain of TNF-R55 activating the A-SMase pathway strikingly corresponds to the death domain signaling the cytotoxic effects of TNF (1Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M.

Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic protein TRADD was recently identified to associate with the death domain of TNF-R55 in a TNF-dependent process (12Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

TRADD serves as an adapter protein that recruits other proteins to the cytoplasmic TNF receptor complex (14Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 15Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression of TRADD potently activates distinct signaling cascades leading to activation of NF-κB and induction of cell death (13Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). FADD, which directly binds to TRADD, has been shown to mediate activation of a pro-apoptotic protease, caspase-8/a (FLICE/MACH), eventually leading to apoptosis (16Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M.

Here we show that TNF-induced activation of A-SMase is mediated through TRADD and FADD. Neither caspase-8/a nor a dominant negative mutant of caspase-8/a alter the TNF-induced activation of A-SMase. However, several tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors as well as cytokine response modifier A (crmA) attenuated TNF-induced activation of A-SMase activity, suggesting that FADD mediates enhancement of A-SMase activity through activation of a protease distinct from FLICE. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Schmidt, Essen, FRG. Hela and COS7 cells were obtained from ATCC.

The expression vector pRK-FADD was generated by inserting aSalI-HindIII fragment of FADD cDNA into the pRK5 vector. Deletion mutants of FADD were generated by inserting corresponding sequences in-frame into the expression vector pRK5. For transient expression experiments, 1.5 × 106 HEK 293 cells or 1.0 × 106 COS7 or Hela cells were seeded on 100-mm dishes (Falcon, 3803). Cells were transfected the following day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). After 9 h of incubation, cells were harvested, and enzymatic SMase assays were performed. HEK 293 or COS7 cells were transfected with different TRADD expression constructs, or with identical amounts of expression vectors, either alone or in combination with other expression constructs for TNF-R55-associated proteins. After 9 h, cells were harvested either for SMase assays or Western blot analysis. The micellar SMase assay using exogenous radiolabeled sphingomyelin was performed as described previously (1Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 9 h post-transfection, cells were treated in triplicate in 0.5 ml of medium with 100 ng/ml human recombinant TNF for the indicated periods of time. To measure acid SMase, cells were homogenized in 0.2% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Radioactive phosphorylcholine produced from [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (labeled in the choline moiety, 47 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was determined in the aqueous phase by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mix Complete® (Boehringer Mannheim, FRG). Cell lysates were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred on Porablot NCL filters (0.45 μm, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, FRG) Filters were blocked overnight in Tris-bufferd saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 5% milk powder, and 1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation at room temperature with either mAb FLAG M2 (Kodak Inc.), mAb myc (Life Technologies, Inc.), rabbit anti-TRADD, rabbit anti-TRAF2 (12Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar), (M. Rothe), or mAb FADD (Transduction Laboratories), filters were washed in Tris-bufferd saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 and incubated with a 1:2400 dilution of goat anti-mouse/goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Coulter-Immunotech) in blocking buffer. Filters were washed and developed with ECL detection reagent (Amersham Corp.). Cells were washed twice with cold PBS/EDTA, 5 mm, and 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS/EDTA and fixed by adding 0.5 ml of ethanol. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS/EDTA. 20 μl of RNase A (1 μg/ml) was added, and after incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 0.5 ml staining solution (500 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS/EDTA, 5 mm) was added. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, cell cycle analyses were performed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson Calibur FACS Analyzer. 293 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of expression constructs and vector control. Cells were harvested the next day and left untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml TNF and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (20Kruppa G. Thoma B. Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3152-3157PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (21Adam D. Kessler U. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17482-17487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified a C-terminal domain, corresponding to the death domain of TNF-R55, that is responsible for activation of A-SMase and generation of the lipid second messenger ceramide (1Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 22Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). To examine whether one of the so far identified TNF-R55 death domain-associated proteins mediates the activation of A-SMase, 293 cells were first transfected with an expression vector coding for FLAG-tagged TRADD. Expression of TRADD protein was monitored by Western blotting using a specific FLAG antibody (Fig. 1 B). However, at 9 h after transfection, cells did not show any signs of apoptosis, which could be readily observed 24–36 h post-transfection (data not shown). Overexpression of TRADD enhances TNF-induced A-SMase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). Notably, basal levels of A-SMase activity remained unaffected, suggesting that the effects of TRADD on A-SMase were dependent on oligomerization of TNF receptors. Similar results were obtained in different cell lines. For example, TRADD also enhanced TNF-induced activation of A-SMase in COS7 cells (Fig. 1 C). Basal activity of N-SMase as well as TNF-induced activation of N-SMase remained unaltered in 293 cells transfected with TRADD expression constructs (data not shown). We next evaluated the effects of individual TRADD interacting proteins TRAF2, RIP, and FADD on the activation of A-SMase. TRAF2 belongs to a family of signal transducers sharing a highly conserved C-terminal TRAF domain, which binds to a N-terminal region of TRADD distinct from the death domain (13Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 23Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). TRAF2 was shown to mediate TNF-R55-induced activation of nuclear transcription factor κ B (NFκB) (13Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 15Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, TRAF2 had no effect on A-SMase activity. Similarly, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 (amino acids 87–501), lacking the N-terminal RING finger motif essential for NFκB activation, had no inhibitory effect on A-SMase activity (Fig. 2 A). Finally, co-transfection with TRADD cDNA did not reveal TRAF2 action on A-SMase (Fig. 2 D). The expression and biological function of TRAF2 cDNA were ensured by Western blot analysis and by NFκB-activation in 293 cells, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). These findings strongly suggest that TRAF2 is not involved in TNF-induced activation of A-SMase. The receptor interacting protein kinase RIP has been shown to directly interact with TRAF proteins and the death domain of TRADD (13Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) and to be capable of inducing both the activation of NFκB and apoptosis (24Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, neither overexpression of RIP nor a dominant negative deletion mutant RIP-DN, encoding only the death domain of RIP, altered TNF-induced activation of A-SMase. Notably, both expression constructs induced apoptosis when transfected into 293 cells (Fig. 3 B). The lack of the ability of RIP-DN to signal for the activation of NFκB may contribute to the greater extent of hypodiploid nuclei in HeLa cells when compared with the full-length RIP expression construct. Co-transfection of TRADD and RIP did not result in enhanced activity of A-SMase (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that RIP, like TRAF2, is not involved in TNF-induced activation of A-SMase. It has been recently reported that overexpression of FADD causes the activation of caspase-8/a (FLICE/MACH) and eventually apoptosis (16Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar,17Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of FADD cDNA in 293 cells led to enhanced A-SMase activity in a dose- and TNF-dependent manner. Basal activity of A-SMase remained unchanged. A dominant negative mutant of FADD, lacking the N-terminal death effector domain (DED), FADD-DN, was found to decrease TNF-induced activation of A-SMase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). Co-expression of FADD along with a constant amount of TRADD cDNA (Fig. 4 C) enhanced the A-SMase activity slightly over the values obtained with FADD expression constructs alone. These findings indicate, that FADD, like TRADD, can enhance TNF-induced A-SMase activation. To obtain a more detailed estimation for TRADD and FADD-mediated enhancement of A-SMase activity, we performed enzyme kinetic analysis from cells transfected with expression constructs for TRADD and FADD. Apparent Vmax and Km values were determined for the substrate [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin by fitting initial rates of SM hydrolysis at various substrate concentrations to the Michaelis-Menten equation. As shown in Fig. 5, A-SMase has a basal activity of Vmax = 21 nmol/h/mg and a Km of 11 μm for sphingomyelin in 293 cells. The maximal velocity Vmax is enhanced upon TNF treatment toVmax = 33 nmol/h/mg, whereasKm remained unchanged. Overexpression of TRADD further enhanced the activity of A-SMase, yielding a maximal velocityVmax = 45 nmol/h/mg. The highest maximal velocity was observed with TNF-treated cells previously co-transfected with expression vectors for TRADD and FADD (Vmax= 83 nmol/h/mg). In all instances, Km values remained unchanged. The kinetic profile of A-SMase activation after TNF treatment is shown in Fig. 6. After stimulation of 293 cells with TNF, the activity of A-SMase is transiently increased, peaking at 3 min, and declined over a period of 10 min to reach basal levels again. Cells transfected with expression vectors for TRADD and FADD showed enhanced A-SMase activity at any time after TNF treatment, while basal levels of A-SMase activity remained unaffected. Caspase-8/a (FLICE/MACH) is a downstream signaling molecule of FADD that transduces the TNF and FAS-induced death signal. When 293 cells were transfected with various doses of expression constructs for caspase-8/a the basal activity of A-SMase remained unchanged (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, overexpression of caspase-8/a (FLICE/MACH) did not alter the magnitude of TNF-induced A-SMase activation. However, caspase-8/a strongly induced apoptosis in these cells, within 15–24 h post-transfection, which was blocked by the coexpression of a 2-fold excess of crmA expression construct (Fig. 7 B). These findings ensured the expression of a functional caspase-8/a zymogen. A dominant negative mutant of caspase-8/a lacking 43 amino acids of the C terminus was shown to prevent TNF-induced cell death (25Hu S. Vincenz C. Ni J. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17255-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of FLICE-DN did not alter activity of A-SMase (data not shown). Similarly, overexpression of caspase-10/b (FLICE2) did not alter basal or TNF-induced A-SMase activation in 293 cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that caspase-8/a or caspase-10/b are not involved in TNF-induced A-SMase activation in 293 cells. To investigate a possible involvement of caspases other than FLICE/MACH in A-SMase activation, we finally employed a set of potent caspase inhibitors. When cow pox virus crmA was overexpressed in 293 cells, TNF-induced activation of A-SMase was markedly reduced (Fig. 8 A). As shown in Fig. 8 D, crmA also inhibited enhancing effects of TRADD and FADD on TNF-induced A-SMase activity. Again, the basal A-SMase activity in these cells remained unaltered. Similar results were obtained with tetrapeptide inhibitors of caspases, z-VAD.fmk, Ac-DEVD.CHO, and Ac-YVAD.cmk. Treatment of cells with Ac-DEVD.CHO, which preferentially inhibits caspase-3-like death proteases, resulted in reduced TNF activation of A-SMase (Fig. 8 B). A more pronounced inhibitory effect was obtained with Ac-YVAD.cmk, an inhibitor of caspase-1 (Fig. 8 C). In contrast to Ac-DEVD.CHO, Ac-YVAD.cmk also slightly reduced basal activity of A-SMase. The broad range caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk also reduced the enhanced activation of A-SMase in TRADD- and FADD-transfected 293 cells. These results suggest that FADD-mediated activation of A-SMase involves an ICE-like caspase activity distinct from caspase-8/a (FLICE/MACH) and caspase-10/b (FLICE2). Here we show that acid sphingomyelinase is activated through p55 TNF receptor-associated proteins TRADD and FADD. Overexpression of TRADD and FADD in 293 cells enhanced the TNF-induced activity of A-SMase. Activation of A-SMase could be blocked in cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of FADD. Basal velocity of A-SMase in cells transfected with TRADD/FADD expression plasmids was not altered, suggesting that cross-linking of the TNF-R55·TRADD·FADD complex is essential for the activation of A-SMase. Enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that the maximal velocity Vmax of A-SMase is enhanced in TNF-treated 293 cells overexpressing TRADD or FADD. The highest maximal velocity of A-SMase was obtained in 293 cells transfected with both TRADD and FADD expression plasmids. Notably, the Km remained unchanged, indicating that the enzyme activity of A-SMase was enhanced rather than the accessibility of the substrate. In contrast, overexpression of neither TRAF2 nor a dominant negative deletion mutant TRAF2-DN altered TNF-induced activity of A-SMase in 293 cells, suggesting that TRAF2 is not required for the activation of A-SMase by TNF. TRAF2 has been shown to mediate TNF-induced activation of SAP/JNK (26Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and NFκB (15Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), which involves a MAP3 kinase-related protein kinase, NIK, and the IκB-kinase IKKα (27Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V.

Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). In 293 cells, TRAF2 is apparently not involved in activation of a A-SMase, suggesting that the A-SMase activation pathway is distinct from that causing induction of NFκB and SAPK/JNK. These data confirm a recent report by Hannun et al. (30Gamard C.J. Dbaibo G.S. Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16474-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), who showed that ceramide is not a direct member of the NFκB activation pathway and rather may antagonize NFκB activation in some systems. The previous notion, that A-SMase and ceramide activate NFκB may be explained by tissue-specific activation and function of A-SMase or as a result of a nonspecific stress response caused by exogenous ceramide or SMase. Overexpression of the receptor interacting protein RIP has been shown to be capable of inducing both activation of NFκB and apoptosis. (26Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar,31Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Notably, RIP was found to be important for TNF-R55-mediated activation of NFκB but not for Fas/Apo-1-initiated induction of apoptosis (32Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The results of our study indicate that RIP does not alter TNF-induced activation of A-SMase, suggesting that RIP is not a component of TNF R55-triggered A-SMase activation pathway. It is well established that FADD, through its death effector domain (DED), recruits caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH) to the DISC where it is activated (16Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar, 17Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M.

However, overexpression of caspase-8/a or of its dominant negative, did not affect TNF-induced activation of A-SMase. Thus, the apoptotic signaling of caspase-8 pathway to segregate from the A-SMase activation pathway at the level of FADD. While caspase-8/a did not seem to be involved in activation of A-SMase, tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors markedly inhibited TNF-induced A-SMase activation. In addition, overexpression of crmA, a potent inhibitor of ICE-like proteases, was able to block the TRADD and/or FADD-mediated enhancement of TNF-induced activation of A-SMase. Together, these results suggest that ICE-like protease distinct from caspase-8/a are involved in A-SMase activation. Hannun and co-workers (36Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) reported that ceramide signaled apoptosis in vincristine-treated ALL-697 leukemia cells via a caspase-3 (CPP32)-like protease and that this effect was inhibitable by Bcl-2 (35Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 36Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing Bcl-2, like wild-type cells, still responded to vincristine treatment with ceramide generation but failed to show PARP cleavage and apoptosis in response to a C6-ceramide analog. Further support for the notion that ceramide may be downstream of caspases is derived from experiments which showed that REAPER-induced ceramide generation was blocked by caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk (37Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Furthermore, crmA, a pox virus serpin that is an inhibitor of ICE-like proteases but does not block caspase-3 (CPP32), abolished ceramide generation in TNF-treated cells (38Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that ceramide generation occurs downstream of caspases. However, the source of ceramide was not addressed in these studies. The data of this report indicate that overexpression of TRADD and FADD enhances TNF-induced activation of A-SMase, which favors A-SMase to be downstream of the death domain adapter complex rather than ceramide synthase and other pathways of ceramide generation. The question arises whether A-SMase is able to confer apoptosis in some instance of a specific cell type/stimulus combination. This idea is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that deletions of the death domain region of the TNF-R55 and CD95 (1Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M.

The results of the present study clearly indicate that A-SMase activation can be dissociated from caspase-8-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of caspase-8 readily induced apoptosis of 293 cells in the absence of changes of A-SMase activity levels. Thus, A-SMase does not seem to be necessary for caspase-8-driven apoptosis. A-SMase seems neither sufficient for apoptosis of 293 cells because overexpression of A-SMase did not cause cell death. 2R. Schwandner, K. Wiegmann, K. Bernardo, D. Kreder, and M. Krönke, unpublished observation. The data do not rule out, though, that A-SMase constitutes an accessory pathway that can enhance the apoptotic response of 293 cells. The role of A-SMase in apoptosis induced by various stimuli in diverse cell types remains an open issue (for review see Ref. 43Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev.

The receptors either were immunopurified from cell lines and then phosphorylated with purified PKA or were phosphorylated in intact cells after activating intracellular cAMP formation. The former studies showed that the type I receptor was a good substrate for PKA (0.65 mol Pi incorporated/mol receptor), whereas type II and III receptors were phosphorylated relatively weakly. The latter studies showed that despite these differences, each of the receptors was phosphorylated in intact cells in response to forskolin or activation of neurohormone receptors. Detailed examination of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which express ≥99% type I receptor, revealed that minor increases in cAMP concentration were sufficient to cause maximal phosphorylation. Thus, VIP and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide (acting through Gs-coupled pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide-I receptors) were potent stimuli of type I receptor phosphorylation, and remarkably, even slight increases in cAMP concentration induced by carbachol (acting through Gq-coupled muscarinic receptors) or other Ca2+mobilizing agents were sufficient to cause phosphorylation. Finally, PKA enhanced InsP3-induced Ca2+ mobilization in a range of permeabilized cell types, irrespective of whether the type I, II, or III receptor was predominant. In summary, these data show that all InsP3 receptors are phosphorylated by PKA, albeit with marked differences in stoichiometry. The ability of both Gs- and Gq-coupled cell surface receptors to effect InsP3 receptor phosphorylation by PKA suggests that this process is widespread in mammalian cells and provides multiple routes by which the cAMP signaling pathway can influence Ca2+ mobilization.

Also, from sequence analysis it is considered likely that the receptors will differ in other ways; for example, in their ability to be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (2Furuichi T.

In the present study we have examined the ability of PKA to phosphorylate type I, II, and III receptors by analyzing PKA-induced phosphorylation of purified receptors and the ability of agents that raise cAMP to cause receptor phosphorylation in intact cells. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, AR4–2J rat pancreatoma cells, and RINm5F rat insulinoma cells were obtained and cultured as monolayers in dishes (15 cm in diameter) as described (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antisera termed CT1, CT2, and CT3 were raised against the C termini of rat type I, II, and III receptors, respectively, and were affinity purified and shown to be type-specific (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. He Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and were phosphorylated in a manner similar to that described previously (23Joseph S.K. Ryan S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23059-23065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After removal of culture medium, cells were detached with 155 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (HBSE), were centrifuged (500 ×g for 2 min), and were disrupted with 12 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 8.0). After 30 min on ice, cells were centrifuged (38,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Supernatants were then incubated at 4 °C with either CT1, CT2, or CT3 for 1 h and then for a further 1 h with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. Immune complexes were then isolated by centrifugation (500 × g for 2 min), were washed twice with ice-cold phosphorylation buffer (120 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 mmMgCl2, pH 7.2), and were finally resuspended in phosphorylation buffer. Aliquots of washed beads were then placed in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes together with [γ-32P]ATP (∼5 μCi), 0–5 μm nonradioactive ATP, and 20 units of PKA catalytic subunit (final volume, 200 μl), were mixed gently, and were then incubated at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 1.3 ml of ice-cold phosphorylation buffer plus 1 mm ATP. Beads were then centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 s), were washed twice with 1.5 ml of phosphorylation buffer plus ATP, and finally were resuspended in 2× gel loading buffer (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To assess the concentration and phosphorylation of purified type I, II, and III InsP3 receptors and the composition of immunoprecipitates, samples of washed beads were electrophoresed in 4% gels and were either silver-stained or immunoblotted as described (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar,16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. He Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the molecular mass and concentration of receptors being established by comparison to standards of myosin (molecular mass, 205 kDa) and β-galactosidase (molecular mass, 116 kDa). Radioactivity associated with electrophoresed InsP3 receptors was assessed initially by autoradiography of dried gels and then quantitated by excision and scintillation counting of the ∼240–280-kDa region. Based on silver staining, equal amounts of phosphorylated type I, II, and III receptor were electrophoresed, and associated radioactivity was quantitated. The number of moles of phosphate incorporated was then calculated from the specific activity of the [γ-32P]ATP. The number of moles of InsP3 receptor loaded onto the gel was determined by measuring [3H]InsP3 binding to portions of the receptor preparations destined for phosphorylation. Briefly, washed beads in phosphorylation buffer were centrifuged (500 ×g for 2 min) and were washed and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and were then incubated with [3H]InsP3 as described (24Joseph S.K. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of specific binding sites was then determined and was assumed to equal the number of moles of InsP3 receptor. These experiments also confirmed that the equal amounts of type I, II, and III receptor defined by silver staining bound approximately equal amounts of InsP3. This was assessed either directly after labeling cells with32Pi or with a back-phosphorylation procedure (23Joseph S.K. Ryan S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23059-23065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21933-21938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), in which inhibition of PKA-catalyzed transfer of32P from [γ-32P]ATP to purified receptors reveals the degree to which PKA consensus sites are occupied by nonradioactive phosphate in intact cells. In the former procedure, cells were harvested in HBSE, were washed once with phosphate-free, 95% O2/5% CO2-gassed minimal essential medium, and were resuspended in the same medium, and 500-μl portions were incubated in microfuge tubes with ∼125 μCi of32Pi for 30–45 min at 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated, were centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 s), and were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer plus 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mmNaF, and 100 nm okadaic acid. InsP3 receptors were then purified by immunoprecipitation with CT1, CT2, or CT3 and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and were electrophoresed. In the back-phosphorylation procedure, cells were harvested in HBSE, were washed once in gassed minimal essential medium, and were resuspended in the same medium, and 500-μl portions were stimulated. Cells were then centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 s) and were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer plus 1 mmNa3VO4, 100 mm NaF, and 100 nm okadaic acid. InsP3 receptors were then purified by immunoprecipitation, were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and PKA as described above, and were electrophoresed. Cells were harvested in HBSE, were washed and resuspended in gassed minimal essential medium (containing 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) in some experiments), and were aliquotted into 100-μl portions. After 10 min at 37 °C, cells were stimulated for 2 min, and 100 μl of ice-cold 1m trichloroacetic acid was added. After 15 min on ice, samples were centrifuged (16,000 × g for 3 min), and 160 μl of supernatant was removed and thoroughly mixed with 40 μl of 10 mm EDTA and 200 μl of freon/octylamine (1:1). After centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min), 100 μl of supernatant was neutralized with 50 μl of 25 mmNaHCO3, and cAMP content was measured by radioimmunoassay. Cells (1–2 dishes) were harvested in 10 ml of HBSE, were centrifuged (500 × gfor 2 min), were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold cytosol buffer (120 mm KCl, 2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0), were centrifuged again (500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C), and were resuspended in 0.8 ml of cytosol buffer. Cells were then permeabilized with nine discharges of a 3 microfarad capacitor (field strength, 3.75 kV/cm) as described (26Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22234-22241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were diluted with cytosol buffer to 5 ml, were re-centrifuged, and were finally resuspended at 0.8–1 mg protein/ml in 1.3 ml of cytosol buffer. Suspensions were then incubated at 25 °C without or with 100 units/ml PKA for 10 min and then with ∼0.3 μCi of 45Ca2+/ml for 10 min. Aliquots of cell suspension (90 μl) were then added to tubes containing 10 μl of either InsP3 or ionomycin and were incubated at 25 °C for 1 or 2 min, respectively. Incubations were terminated by addition of 4 ml of ice-cold cytosol buffer and immediate filtration through Whatman GF/B filters; radioactivity bound to filters was assessed after addition of 4 ml of Ecoscint H and overnight extraction. Radioactivity (the amount of 45Ca2+ remaining sequestered in the permeabilized cells or “45Ca2+ content”) is expressed as a percentage of 45Ca2+ uptake (that remaining sequestered in the absence of stimulus). Importantly, uptake was unaffected by PKA; in the absence and the presence of PKA, respectively, 45Ca2+ uptake was 37 ± 5 and 38 ± 5 × 103 cpm for SH-SY5Y cells, 37 ± 1 and 35 ± 1 × 103 cpm for AR4–2J cells, and 34 ± 2 and 36 ± 2 × 103 cpm for RINm5F cells. In some experiments, control or PKA-treated permeabilized cells were centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 s), and InsP3 receptors were immunoprecipitated and back-phosphorylated exactly as described for intact cells. Peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, molecular mass markers, dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, IBMX, ionomycin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and receptor agonists/antagonists were obtained from Sigma; forskolin was from Calbiochem; okadaic acid, thapsigargin, and NaF were from Alexis Corp.; [3H]InsP3 (21 Ci/mmol),45CaCl2 (10 Ci/g), and32Pi (H3PO4, carrier-free) were from NEN Life Science Products; [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) was from Andotek; and PKA catalytic subunit was from Promega. Previous studies have shown that enrichment of type I, II, and III InsP3 receptors in SH-SY5Y, AR4–2J, and RINm5F cells, respectively, makes these cells convenient starting points for InsP3 receptor purification (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. He Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because SH-SY5Y cells contain ≥99% type I receptor, a preparation composed solely of type I receptor can be immunoprecipitated from these cells with antiserum CT1 (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. He Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Type II and III receptor preparations immunoprecipitated from AR4–2J and RINm5F cells with antisera CT2 and CT3 are, in contrast, not homogeneous because they are “contaminated” with traces of co-immunoprecipitating type I receptor, which represents 12 and 4% of total receptor in these cell lines (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. He Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A (lanes 1–9) reveals the extent to which the type I, II, and III InsP3 receptor preparations are phosphorylated by PKAin vitro. Because equal amounts of type I, II, and III receptors were loaded, it is clear that the type I receptor (lanes 1, 4, and 7) is phosphorylated more readily than type II (lanes 2, 5, and 8) or type III (lanes 3, 6, and 9) receptors. The phosphorylation seen is totally PKA-dependent, because none is detected if the kinase is omitted (lanes 10–12). Fig. 1 A also shows that two proteins are phosphorylated in the type II and III preparations, one of which (the upper band) co-migrates with type I receptor. Immunoblotting was performed to identify the different phosphoproteins (Fig. 1, B–D). Fig. 1 B (lanes 2 and 3) confirms the presence of type I receptor in the type II and III receptor preparations and that the upper phosphorylated band in the type II and III receptor preparations is indeed type I receptor. Faster migrating type II receptor (Fig. 1 C, lane 2) and type III receptor (Fig. 1 D, lane 3) correspond in size to the lower of the phosphorylated bands in the type II and III receptor preparations (Fig. 1 A). Regarding the efficiency of phosphorylation, it is remarkable that although type II receptor comprises ∼90% of the type II receptor preparation (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar,16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. He Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it accounts for only ∼20% of the total 32P incorporated (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2, 5, and 8), showing that the type II receptor is phosphorylated very poorly. For the type III receptor preparation, however, ∼90% of32P incorporated is type III receptor-associated (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3, 6, and 9), confirming that the type III receptor is phosphorylated relatively well. For each receptor, phosphorylation was maximal at 15 min, at which point 0.65 ± 0.06, 0.04 ± 0.01, and 0.14 ± 0.03 mol of Pi were incorporated/mol type I, II, and III receptor, respectively (Fig. 2).Figure 2Stoichiometry of InsP3 receptor phosphorylation. The number of moles of Piincorporated into type I, II, or III receptors was calculated from the radioactive content of the ∼240–280-kDa region of gels and the estimate that 20 and 90% of 32Pi is type II and III receptor-associated in the type II and III receptor preparations. The number of moles of receptor loaded was calculated from the number of InsP3 binding sites in the preparations. Data shown are the means ± range of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the type I receptor is a good substrate for PKAin vitro (Figs. 1 and 2), we examined whether it is phosphorylated in intact SH-SY5Y cells in response to cAMP elevation using either a back-phosphorylation procedure (23Joseph S.K.

Fig. 3 A shows that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which stimulates cAMP levels in SH-SY5Y cells (27Waschek J.A. Muller J.-M. Duan D.-S. Sadee W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), causes type I receptor phosphorylation in intact cells because back-phosphorylation was inhibited (lanes 1–5). Pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), which belongs to the same neurohormone family as VIP (28Harmer A. Lutz E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 97-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), had a similar effect (lanes 6–8). Because IC50 values for VIP and PACAP were 7 and 0.15 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 B), and PACAP-I receptors bind PACAP with ∼100-fold higher affinity than VIP (28Harmer A. Lutz E. Trends Pharmacol.

Group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and -5) mobilize intracellular Ca2+ by stimulating phosphoinositide (PI) turnover and promote cAMP accumulation; group II (mGluR2 and 3) and group III (mGluR4, -6–8) receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase. mGluRs, together with the parathyroid Ca2+-sensing receptors (PCaR1 (13Brown E.M.

Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

In mGluRs, they are relatively small compared with those of seven transmembrane domain receptors belonging to the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic family. Most importantly, there is no significant sequence homology between members of the mGluR family and other cloned GPCRs. The structure-function relationships supporting the coupling to G proteins have been well investigated for members of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic family. Although all the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors take part in G protein activation to some degree, i3 appears to harbor the structural elements that impart specificity to the interaction (20Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 167-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the structural determinants of the coupling of mGluRs to G proteins. Recently, the analysis of chimeric receptors derived from the Gi-coupled mGluR3 bearing different portions of the cytoplasmic domains of the Gq-coupled mGluR1 has shown that i2 of group I receptors is necessary, but not sufficient, for the specific activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and that both i3 and the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor appear to be also necessary for efficient coupling to this pathway (22Pin J.-P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Gomeza J. Joly C. Kuhn R. Knöpfel T. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The finding that a point mutation in i3 of the human PCaR1 is responsible for loss of receptor function (24Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Chou Y.H.W. Hebert S.C. Marx S.J. Steinmann B. Levi T. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) also suggests that this domain could be important for mGluR-G protein interaction. In heterologous systems, group I mGluRs have been shown to stimulate cAMP accumulation (25Aramori I. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 26Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the domains of the receptor and the signaling partners involved in the activation of this pathway have not been characterized. In this work, we introduced single amino acid substitutions within i2 and i3 of mGluR1 to identify specific residues that contribute to the interaction with G proteins. To gain insights on the structural elements involved in selective interaction with either pathway, we tested the mutant receptors for their ability to induce PI turnover and cAMP accumulation. Here we show that both i2 and i3 play a role in determining selective coupling to Gs and Gqclass α subunits and that mutations of single residues differentially affect the activation of the two transduction pathways. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by a modification of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique as described by Nelson and Long (27Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides required for the mutagenesis (Ransom Hill Bioscience, Ramona, CA; Table I) consisted of the following: (a) forward mutagenic primers containing single/multiple base mismatches; (b) reverse hybrid primer serving as 3′-anchor, harboring at the 5′-end 20 nucleotides randomly selected and unique and not complementary to the mGluR1α sequence and, at the 3′-end, 21 complementary nucleotides; (c) forward 5′-anchor primer; (d) reverse complementary hybrid primer (c-primer) identical to the random 20-mer. All polymerase chain reaction reactions were carried out in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 200 μm deoxynucleotides and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). In the Step 1 polymerase chain reaction reaction, 50 pmol each of mutagenic and hybrid primer were used with the template pRc-mGluR1α (pRc-CMV vector; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to yield an amplified product comprising the mutation and the unique sequence. Step 1 was 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C denaturation, 3 min at 37 °C annealing, 3 min at 74 °C elongation. The amplified DNA was fractionated on agarose gel, purified, and used together with pRC-mGluR1α in the Step 2 reaction. Step 2 was a single cycle of 5 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 37 °C, and 10 min at 74 °C. At Step 2 completion, 50 pmol each of the 5′-anchor and c-hybrid primer was added, and 30 additional cycles were completed (Step 3). Step 3 products were digested with BglII and SphI for all mutants but i2* (Table I), which were digested with NcoI and SphI and cloned into pBS-mGluR1α (pBlueScriptSK(−) vector; Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The sequence of the amplified DNAs was determined by the Sanger method (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Mutant receptors were subcloned from the pBlueScript construct into pRc-CMV by digestion with SacII and ApaI (i2 and i2* mutants) or SacII and BspEI (i3 mutants).Table IMutagenic oligodeoynucleotidesPrimerOrientationPositionSequenceMutagenic K690Ai2*1-ai2* indicates mutants that have been subcloned with different sets of restriction enzymes (see “Experimental Procedures”).Forward2062–20815′-GGCAGCGCGAAGAAGATCTG-3′1-bMismatches introduced in the sequence to direct amino acid substitutions are underlined.

Open table in a new tab HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were transfected by electroporation with an Electro Cell Manipulator (BTX, San Diego, CA) using 4-mm gap cuvettes. The DNA used in transfection experiments was purified with Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. In a standard experiment, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed 3 times with PBS; for each electroporation 5 or 10 million cells were used with either 10 or 20 μg of DNA (according to the purpose of the experiment) in 0.3-ml final volume. Electroporations were conducted at 260 V, 950 microfarads, 72 Ω, yielding 20 ms as average time constant. The transfection efficiency, about 30%, was determined by co-transfection (1:1 ratio) with the pRc-lacZ vector and subsequent chromogenic reaction. All the tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. HEK 293 were generously provided by Dr. M. Chao at Cornell University Medical College. Following electroporation, cells were left to recover in DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 2 mm GlutaMAXTM (Life Technologies Inc.) for 3–5 h and metabolically labeled for approximately 16 h with 1 μCi ml−1 [3H]myo-inositol (NEN Life Science Products) in inositol-free DMEM. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h with 2 mm pyruvate and 2 units/ml glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (Sigma) (28Prézeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 10 min in Hanks' balanced saline solution containing 10 mm LiCl; 1 mm Glu (Sigma) was then added for 20 min. Agonist stimulation was stopped by placing the cells on ice and adding 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Separation of total [3H]inositol phosphates was carried out essentially as described (29Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 472-482Google Scholar) by chromatography on AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (Bio-Rad); total inositol phosphates were eluted with 700 mm ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid. Three hours after electroporation, cells were metabolically labeled for approximately 16 h with 1 μCi ml−1 [3H]adenine (NEN Life Science Products) in DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 2 mm GlutaMAXTM. Cells were then washed with PBS, treated with glutamic-pyruvic transaminase for 2 h (see above), and preincubated for 30 min with Hanks' balanced saline solution containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma). 1 mm Glu in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was then added for 20 min. Cells were lysed with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and adenine nucleotides were fractionated according to the method of Salomon (30Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, after stimulation with Glu, unlabeled cells were lysed with 65% ethanol, 4 mm EDTA, and cAMP concentration was determined by the cyclic AMP 3H assay system (Amersham Life Science Inc.) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. For immunofluorescence studies, electroporated cells were grown for up to 18 h in serum-containing medium on gelatin-coated coverslips to facilitate adhesion. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, fixed for 2 min with ice-cold methanol, and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100. The primary antibody M5-14 made in rabbit and directed to the carboxyl terminus of the rat mGluR1α (31Reid S.N. Romano C. Hughes T. Daw N.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:400 and reacted with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Coverslips were washed, mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and analyzed using a Sarastro Phoibos 1000 confocal laser scanning system attached to a Nikon microscope. For immunoblot analysis, transfected cells were washed and incubated on ice with pre-chilled PBS containing 5 mm EDTA for 20 min. The cells were then scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman, collected by centrifugation, and lysed in alkaline sample buffer (0.12m Tris base, pH 9.5, 3.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 3.1% dithiothreitol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue). Total proteins were quantified with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay System (Bio-Rad) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Prior to 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation, the samples were heated at 60 °C for 3 min. Semi-dry protein transfer on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA) was performed as indicated by the manufacturer. The blots were then blocked with 10% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl) at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times with TBS-0.05% Tween (TBS-T), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the polyclonal antibody M5-14 diluted 1:2500 in TBS-5% dry milk. After washing with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:1000. Chemiluminescence detection was carried out with the ECLTM Detection System (Amersham Life Science) following the protocol indicated by the manufacturer, and the membranes were quickly exposed for autoradiography for 30 s, 5 min, and 1 h. Autoradiographies exposed for 5 min, all within the linear range of signal intensity, were used for the densitometric quantification. Following immunodetection, the blots were stained with india ink (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 495Google Scholar) to allow relative quantification of the transferred proteins. Images of autoradiographies and membranes were acquired with an Arcus II scanner (AGFA), and densitometric analysis was performed with the software package NIH-Image 1.60. 2Developed at the National Institutes of Health and available by anonymous ftp from zippy.nimh.nih.gov. Receptors belonging to the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic family are characterized by the presence of short amphipathic α-helices at the amino and carboxyl termini of their third intracellular loop. Amino acids within these microdomains play a key role in determining selective coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins (20Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 167-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Unlike these GPCRs, mGluR1 i3 is small, non-homologous, and well conserved among all members of the family, despite their different coupling properties (Fig. 1 a). To evaluate the contribution of single amino acid residues in i3 of mGluR1α to G protein coupling, we mutagenized Arg775(R775W and R775K), corresponding to Arg796 in PCaR1; Pro778 (P778Q); Phe781 (F781P and F781S); Asn782 (N782I); and Glu783 (E783Q). These residues are conserved among all metabotropic and calcium-sensing receptors and were substituted with amino acids designed to change the charge distribution of the loop (Fig. 1 b). The only residue in i3 that distinguishes receptors coupled to different signal transduction pathways is Ala779, which is conserved in group I mGluRs, whereas Glu is present in groups II and III receptors. Since this seems to suggest that the amino acid at this position could participate in coupling selectivity, we replaced Ala779 with Glu (A779E). Within i2 (the largest intracellular loop in mGluRs) only few amino acids are in common between groups I and II/III receptors (Fig. 1 c). The regions of homology are concentrated at the amino and carboxyl termini of the domain, which are predicted to adopt α-amphipathic conformation. The intervening stretch of residues is highly hydrophilic and therefore constitutes a potential protein interaction site. Previous studies conducted with chimeric receptors showed that the 16-amino acid region from Lys691 to Gln706 is required to impart the ability to activate PLC to Gi-coupled mGluRs (22Pin J.-P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Gomeza J. Joly C. Kuhn R. Knöpfel T. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We mutagenized residues within this region that, according to sequence alignment, are conserved among all mGluRs (Lys690, Pro698, and Ser702) and residues that are shared only by PLC-coupled receptors (Lys692, Thr695, Arg696, Lys697, and Ala705) (Fig. 1 c). Among them, the positively charged amino acids that are part of the central hydrophilic region of i2 were substituted with hydrophobic residues to perturb the charge distribution. Group I mGluRs also differ from group II and III in the size of i2 (26 versus 24 amino acids). To test whether such a difference is structurally relevant for G protein coupling, we generated two deletion mutants. In the Cys694-Thr695 mutant, Cys694 and Thr695, which are shared only by group I receptors and are located in the center of i2, were deleted. In the K692G/Cys694-Thr695 mutant, the same deletion was accompanied by the substitution of Lys692 to Gly; this substitution reduces the number of positively charged residues located in the amino terminus of i2, thus increasing the structural similarity of the mutant mGluR1 with group II and III receptors. To assess the ability of the mutant receptors to activate the PLC signaling cascade, we measured the accumulation of inositol phosphates (IPs) upon stimulation with Glu in HEK 293 cells. Wild-type receptor activation induces a 3–4-fold increase of IP production compared with basal level (not-stimulated cells); the specificity of this response is confirmed by the absence of effect of Glu in cells transfected with the reporter construct pRc-lacZ alone (Fig. 2 a). Consistent with recent reports, mGluR1α expression generates a high basal level of inositol phosphates; this effect, distinctive to the long splice variant of the receptor, has been attributed by other investigators to intrinsic (agonist-independent) activity (28Prézeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar). In HEK 293 cells, mGluR1α-mediated stimulation of the PLC pathway is insensitive to pertussis toxin (PTx) (data not shown). In contrast, both in Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the receptor activates the same signaling pathway through PTx-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins, Go and G11, respectively (25Aramori I. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 33Kasahara J. Sugiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Nakamura K. Nukada T. Haga T. Sugiyama H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 35-41Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since HEK 293 cells do not express Go (35Law S.F. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10721-10727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PLC stimulation is likely to depend solely on the interaction of the receptor with α subunits of the Gq family. Upon analysis of receptors mutated in i3, we observed that the Glu-stimulated IP accumulation is suppressed in the R775W, F781S, and F781P mutants (Fig. 2 a) and significantly reduced in the P778Q. The R775W substitution introduced in rat mGluR1 corresponds to the R796W mutation in the human PCaR1 linked to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (24Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Chou Y.H.W. Hebert S.C. Marx S.J. Steinmann B. Levi T. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar); such mutation causes loss of function of the human receptor. In an analogous fashion, the same substitution in mGluR1α leads to loss of the Glu-dependent PLC stimulation but does not affect the high basal activity of the receptor. Notably, substitution of Arg775 with Lys (R775K) produces the opposite effect; this mutation generates a receptor that retains wild-type-like Glu-dependent activity but lacks intrinsic activity. Substitution of Phe781 with either a polar (F781S) or a hydrophobic residue (F781P) completely blocks receptor-mediated activation of the PLC pathway, both Glu-dependent and constitutive. In contrast, the mutations A779E, N782I, and E783Q do not alter significantly the Glu-dependent activity of the receptor. However, both the N782I and the E783Q mutants do not possess agonist-independent basal activity. i2 mutant receptors carrying the substitutions T695A, R696G, P698R, S702T, and A705S do not differ from wild type in stimulating PI turnover (Fig. 2 b), although a significantly higher level of basal activity is observed in the P698R mutant. On the other hand, the mutations K690A, T695E, K697M, and S702R cause a significant decrease in Glu-stimulated IP production. In addition, with the exception of K690A, these receptors show a significantly reduced intrinsic activity. None of the mutations introduced in i2 results in a nonfunctional receptor. Wild-type and mutant receptors were tested for their ability to induce cAMP accumulation in HEK 293 cells. The endogenous adenylyl cyclase isoform in this cell line has not been identified yet; however, it is known to be Gs and forskolin-activated but not sensitive to Ca2+, protein kinase C, or βγ stimulation (36Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with Glu, mGluR1α induces a small but significant increase in cAMP (Fig. 3, a and b). The properties of the endogenous cyclase make it likely that such effect is generated through direct activation of Gs, although with low efficiency. This was ascertained by co-transfecting the wild-type mGluR1α together with increasing amount of the cDNA coding for Gs, which resulted in a proportional increase of Glu-induced mGluR1α-mediated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3 a). Next, we tested for cAMP accumulation those i2 mutants that are affected in their ability to stimulate PI turnover. The parallel analysis of two separate signaling cascades should help determine whether the mutations affect selectively the coupling to the Gq class α subunits or w"
https://openalex.org/W2054993296,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked hematopoietic disease that manifests itself in platelet deficiency and a compromised immune system. Analysis of hematopoietic cells from affected individuals reveals that mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) result in structural and functional abnormalities in the cell cortex, consistent with the suggestion that WASP is involved with regulation of the actin-rich cortical cytoskeleton. Here we report that WASP interacts with a recently described cytoskeletal-associated protein, PSTPIP, a molecule that is related to the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cleavage furrow regulatory protein, CDC15p. This association is mediated by an interaction between the PSTPIP SH3 domain and two polyproline-rich regions in WASP. Co-expression of PSTPIP with WASP in vivoresults in a loss of WASP-induced actin bundling activity and co-localization of the two proteins, which requires the PSTPIP SH3 domain. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of PSTPIP reveals that two sites are modified in response to v-Src co-transfection or pervanadate incubation. One of these tyrosines is found in the SH3 domain poly-proline recognition site, and mutation of this tyrosine to aspartate or glutamate to mimic this phosphorylation state results in a loss of WASP binding in vitro and a dissolution of co-localization in vivo. In addition, PSTPIP that is tyrosine phosphorylated in the SH3 domain interacts poorly with WASPin vitro. These data suggest that the PSTPIP and WASP interaction is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the PSTPIP SH3 domain, and this binding event may control aspects of the actin cytoskeleton. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked hematopoietic disease that manifests itself in platelet deficiency and a compromised immune system. Analysis of hematopoietic cells from affected individuals reveals that mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) result in structural and functional abnormalities in the cell cortex, consistent with the suggestion that WASP is involved with regulation of the actin-rich cortical cytoskeleton. Here we report that WASP interacts with a recently described cytoskeletal-associated protein, PSTPIP, a molecule that is related to the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cleavage furrow regulatory protein, CDC15p. This association is mediated by an interaction between the PSTPIP SH3 domain and two polyproline-rich regions in WASP. Co-expression of PSTPIP with WASP in vivoresults in a loss of WASP-induced actin bundling activity and co-localization of the two proteins, which requires the PSTPIP SH3 domain. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of PSTPIP reveals that two sites are modified in response to v-Src co-transfection or pervanadate incubation. One of these tyrosines is found in the SH3 domain poly-proline recognition site, and mutation of this tyrosine to aspartate or glutamate to mimic this phosphorylation state results in a loss of WASP binding in vitro and a dissolution of co-localization in vivo. In addition, PSTPIP that is tyrosine phosphorylated in the SH3 domain interacts poorly with WASPin vitro. These data suggest that the PSTPIP and WASP interaction is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the PSTPIP SH3 domain, and this binding event may control aspects of the actin cytoskeleton. PSTPIP is a recently described coiled-coil and SH3 domain-containing protein that is homologous to CDC15p, aSchizosaccharomyces pombe phosphoprotein involved with the assembly of the cytokinetic cleavage furrow (1Spencer S.

https://openalex.org/W2160427174,"Androgen plays a critical role in regulating the growth and differentiation of normal prostate epithelia, as well as the initial growth of prostate cancer cells. Nevertheless, prostate carcinomas eventually become androgen-unresponsive, and the cancer is refractory to hormonal therapy. To gain insight into the mechanism involved in this hormone-refractory phenomenon, we have examined the potential role of the androgen receptor (AR) in that process. We have investigated the expression of AR and two prostate-specific androgen-responsive antigens, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), for the functional activity of AR in LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells. Our results are as follows. (i) Clone 33 LNCaP cells express AR, PAcP, and PSA, and cell growth is stimulated by 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Stimulation of cell growth correlates with decreased cellular PAcP activity. (ii) In clone 81 LNCaP cells, the expression of PAcP decreases with a concurrent decrease in the degree of androgen stimulation of cell growth, whereas the expression of PSA mRNA level is up-regulated by DHT, as in clone 33 cells. Conversely, in PAcP cDNA-transfected clone 81 cells, an additional expression of cellular PAcP correlates with an increased stimulation by androgen, higher than the corresponding control cells. (iii) PC-3 cells express a low level of functional AR with no detectable PAcP or PSA, and the growth of PC-3 cells is not affected by DHT treatment. Nevertheless, in two PAcP cDNA-transfected PC-3 sublines, the expression of exogenous cellular PAcP correlates with androgen stimulation. This androgen stimulation of cell growth concurs with an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a phosphoprotein of 185 kDa. In summary, the data indicate that the expression of AR alone is not sufficient for androgen stimulation of cell growth. Furthermore, in AR-expressing prostate cancer cells, the expression of cellular PAcP correlates with androgen stimulation of cell proliferation.

In summary, the data indicate that the expression of AR alone is not sufficient for androgen stimulation of cell growth. Furthermore, in AR-expressing prostate cancer cells, the expression of cellular PAcP correlates with androgen stimulation of cell proliferation. Androgen plays an important role in male physiology and pathology by regulating the expression of various genes in different cells (for a review, see Ref. 1Berger F.G. Watson G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One of the target organs of androgen is the prostate. Development and maintenance of differentiated function of the normal prostate gland require androgen (2Tenniswood M. Prostate. 1986; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Androgen has also been implicated in the carcinogenesis of prostate epithelium (3Gyorkey F. Methods Cancer Res. 1973; 10: 279-368Google Scholar, 4Gittes R.T. N. Eng. J. Med. 1991; 324: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This is evidenced by observations that, at least in the early phase of prostate carcinogenesis, the growth of carcinoma cells can be stimulated by androgen and arrested by androgen withdrawal (5Huggins C. Hodges C.V. Cancer Res. 1941; 1: 293-297Google Scholar). Thus, hormonal manipulation including anti-androgen and androgen deprivation therapy is the predominant treatment of advanced cancer, being approximately 70% effective (4Gittes R.T. N. Eng. J. Med. 1991; 324: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 6Scott W.W. Menon M. Walsh P.C. Cancer. 1980; 45: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Grayhack J.T. Keeler T.C. Kozlowski J.M. Cancer. 1987; 60: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hormone therapy, however, is not curative, and disease relapse will inevitably occur, usually within 24 months (4Gittes R.T. N. Eng. J. Med. 1991; 324: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) underlying this transition from androgen-responsive to androgen-unresponsive prostate cancer is not understood. Since steroid action on target cells is mediated by an intracellular receptor protein, it has been inferred that loss of steroid response is caused by a loss of corresponding receptors. Results from several studies in different cancer cell lines demonstrate a lower level of ligand binding in steroid-insensitive cells than in steroid-sensitive cells (8Sluyser M. De Goeij C.C.J. Evers S.G. Cancer Lett. 1981; 13: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 9Isaacs J.T. Wake N. Coffey D.S. Sanberg A.A. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2353-2361PubMed Google Scholar, 10Diamond D.A.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 735-739PubMed Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that steroid depletion of initially steroid-responsive cancers may result in the selective outgrowth of tumor cells lacking steroid receptors. For androgen action, the correlation of AR 1The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; PAcP, prostatic acid phosphatase; PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; AcP, acid phosphatase; Ab, antibody; PP-1 and PP-2A, protein phosphatase-1 and -2A, respectively; RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; pp185, a phosphoprotein with a molecular mass of 185 kDa; kb, kilobase pair(s); GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. expression with androgen sensitivity of prostate cancer cells has been characterized in a Dunning rat model system. In those rat prostate cell lines, the loss of androgen binding and responsiveness correlates with the lack of AR mRNA and protein (9Isaacs J.T. Wake N. Coffey D.S. Sanberg A.A. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2353-2361PubMed Google Scholar, 10Diamond D.A. Barrack E.R. J. Urol. 1984; 132: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Quarmby V.E. Beckman Jr., W.C. Cooke D.B. Lubahn D.B. Joseph D.R. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 735-739PubMed Google Scholar). However, results from studies with human prostate carcinomas contradict these findings. Carcinomas from endocrine therapy-resistant patients following prolonged treatment with androgen deprivation do not have a significant change in the expression level of AR or the percentage of AR-positive cells (12Ruizeveld de Winter J.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Boersma W.J.A. Mulder E. Schroder F,. H. Claasen E. Van der Kwast T.H. J. Pathol. 1990; 161: 329-332Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Van der Kwast T.H. Schalken J.

Additionally, a high percentage of those hormonally manipulated tumor cells express PSA, an androgen-regulated antigen, implying the functional activity of AR in carcinomas (13Van der Kwast T.H. Schalken J. Ruizeveld de Winter J.A. Van Vroonhoven C.C.J. Mulder E. Boersma W. Trapman J. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Similarly, in several experimental systems, data have been accumulated to show that steroid-insensitive tumor cells may still express an unchanged level of corresponding receptors. In human breast cancer, for example, a considerable percentage of ER-positive breast cancers do not respond to hormonal therapy, and several estrogen-unresponsive human breast cancer cell lines do express ER (14Nawata H. Chong M.T. Bronzert D. Lippman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6895-6902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sedlacek S.M. Horwitz K.B.

Mouse mammary tumor cells may retain functional steroid receptors, while they lose their sensitivity to steroids (17Darbre P.D. King R.J.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 521-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Moncharmont B. Ramp G. De Goeij C.C.J. Sluyser M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3843-3848PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, lymphoma cells express glucocorticoid receptor but are insensitive to glucocorticoid treatments (19Miesfeld R. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C. Wrange O. Gustaffsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R.

Thus, it is imperative to investigate further the role of steroid receptor in growth regulation. In this study, we utilized human prostate carcinoma cell lines including LNCaP and PC-3 cells as model systems to investigate the role of AR expression in the androgen-stimulatory effect on cell growth. We also analyzed the expression of AR in different LNCaP cells that show different androgen responsiveness. To test the functional activity of AR, we examined the expression of PSA, since the expression of this antigen is regulated by androgens (13Van der Kwast T.H. Schalken J. Ruizeveld de Winter J.A.

Cells were harvested for preparation of total RNA and total cell lysate proteins as described below. For biochemical experiments, cells were harvested by scraping, rinsing, and pelleting in 20 mmHepes, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.0. Cell pellets were lysed in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.0, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and various protease inhibitors (30Lin M.F. Lee C.L. Clinton G.M. Mol. Cell.

The activity of serine/threonine protein phosphatase was determined as described previously (32Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 201: 389-398Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in 10 mmTris (pH 7.4) containing a mixture of various protease inhibitors, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of each supernatant was determined and adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Serial dilutions of the cellular lysates were incubated in buffer containing 32P-phosphorylase a as the substrate (1.0 μg/μl in a 30-μl total reaction volume) for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of trichloroacetic acid (10% solution), and the released radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The ratio of PP-1 to PP-2A activity was determined by the inclusion of okadaic acid (5 nm to inhibit only PP-2A) and calyculin-A (1 μm to inhibit both PP-1 and PP-2A) in the in vitro dephosphorylation reaction. PP-2A is the activity that is inhibited by okadaic acid, whereas PP-1 is the activity that is sensitive to calyculin A subtracted from the activity that is blocked by okadaic acid (although PAcP could dephosphorylate Ser(P)/Thr(P) in proteins, PAcP activity is not affected by 20 nm okadaic acid (33Lin M.F.

https://openalex.org/W2092486392,"Heterotrimeric G proteins function as molecular relays, shuttling between cell surface receptors and intracellular effectors that propagate a signal. G protein signaling is governed by the rates of GTP binding (catalyzed by the receptor) and GTP hydrolysis. RGS proteins (regulators of G protein signaling) were identified as potent negative regulators of G protein signaling pathways in simple eukaryotes and are now known to act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for G protein α-subunits in vitro. It is not known, however, if Gα GAP activity is responsible for the regulatory action of RGS proteins in vivo. We describe here a Gα mutant in yeast (gpa1 sst) that phenotypically mimics the loss of its cognate RGS protein (SST2). The gpa1 sst mutant is resistant to an activated allele of SST2 in vivo and is unresponsive to RGS GAP activityin vitro. The analogous mutation in a mammalian Gqα is also resistant to RGS action in transfected cells. These mutants demonstrate that RGS proteins act through Gα and that RGS-GAP activity is responsible for their desensitizing activity in cells. The Gαsst mutant will be useful for uncoupling RGS-mediated regulation from other modes of signal regulation in whole cells and animals."

However, apart from the cyclization reaction, the enzyme can also catalyze disproportionation, coupling, and hydrolysis reactions. All known CGTases produce a mixture of α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins. For the industrial production of pure cyclodextrins, β-CD is selectively crystallized and α- and γ-CD are complexed with organic solvents. The industrial production of cyclodextrins might be improved by the construction of mutant CGTases with improved product specificity (2Starnes R.L. Cereal Foods World. 1990; 35: 1094-1099Google Scholar, 3Pedersen S. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Jensen B.F. Jörgensen S.T. Chemtech. 1995; (Dec 19–25)Google Scholar). In the conventional commercial production of cyclodextrins, starch is first liquefied by the action of a thermostable α-amylase, whereafter cyclodextrins are produced using the mesophilic CGTase from Bacillus macerans. Two highly thermostable CGTases have been characterized that can directly be used for starch liquefaction, eliminating the need for α-amylase pretreatment (2Starnes R.L. Cereal Foods World. 1990; 35: 1094-1099Google Scholar, 3Pedersen S. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Jensen B.F. Jörgensen S.T. Chemtech. 1995; (Dec 19–25)Google Scholar). These enzymes are produced by thermophilic anaerobic bacteria belonging to the genusThermoanaerobacter (9Starnes, R. L. (July 11, 1991) International Patent WO 91/09962.Google Scholar, 10Norman B.E. Jörgensen S.T. Denpun Kagaku. 1992; 39: 101-108Google Scholar) and Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes EM1 (11Wind R.D. Liebl W. Buitelaar R.M. Penninga D. Spreinat A. Dijkhuizen L. Bahl H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overall amino acid compositions of both enzymes show relatively minor differences, and also the biochemical characteristics of both enzymes are very similar (11Wind R.D. Liebl W. Buitelaar R.M. Penninga D. Spreinat A. Dijkhuizen L. Bahl H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T. thermosulfurigenes EM1 CGTase displays maximum cyclization activity at 80–85 °C and maximum starch hydrolyzing activity at 90–95 °C. The pH optimum for cyclization is broad, in the range of pH 4.5–7.0. The three-dimensional structures of several CGTases have been solved (4Klein C. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Lawson C.L. van Montfort R. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. de Vries G.E. Penninga D. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol.

CGTase belongs to family 13 of the glycosyl hydrolases, a group of homologous (β/α)8-barrel proteins, to which also the α-amylases belong (8Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the CGTase from T. thermosulfurigenes EM1 (Tabium CGTase) was solved at 2.3-Å resolution (6Knegtel R.M.A. Wind R.D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Buitelaar R.M. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present study we describe the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme-substrate complex of Tabium CGTase. The x-ray structure of a maltohexaose inhibitor complexed with TabiumCGTase was solved at 2.6-Å resolution. The detailed information thus obtained allowed rational engineering of the cyclodextrin product specificity of Tabium CGTase. Residues Glu258, Asp329, and Asp230are directly involved in catalysis in CGTase (20Knegtel R.M.A. Strokopytov B. Penninga D. Faber O.G. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29256-29264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Glu258, together with Asp230, is believed to cleave the substrate's α(1,4)-glycosidic bonds and to form the product's α(1,4)-glycosidic bonds by a double displacement mechanism (15Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar). In the first step of the reaction the general acid Glu258protonates the oxygen of the glycosidic bond to be cleaved. After cleavage of this scissile bond, an oxocarbonium transition state is formed, which is believed to collapse into a covalently linked intermediate by nucleophilic attack of Asp230 on the anomeric C1. Subsequently, the reducing end diffuses out of the active site and an acceptor comes in, which can be a water molecule (in case of hydrolysis) or a carbohydrate C4-hydroxyl group (in case of transglycosylation). In the second step of the reaction, the acceptor hydroxyl group is activated through deprotonation by Glu258, after which the acceptor performs a nucleophilic attack on the covalent intermediate. Through another oxocarbonium transition state, the product (α(1,4)-linked) is then formed (16Strokopytov B. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2234-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,17Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). It appears from the double displacement mechanism that for optimal catalysis the nucleophile Asp230 must be deprotonated in the first step of the reaction, whereas the general acid Glu258 must be protonated in the first step, but deprotonated in the second step of the reaction. A third catalytic residue, Asp329, has been found to be hydrogen bonded to Glu258 in the unliganded CGTase, thereby elevating the pKa of Glu258 and assuring its protonation. After substrate binding, this hydrogen bond is lost, making deprotonation of Glu258 possible. It was suggested that this Glu258-Asp329 interaction is responsible for the broad pH optimum exhibited by CGTases (16Strokopytov B. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2234-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The importance of the pKa of Glu258 in the different reactions catalyzed by Tabium CGTase was further studied. By changing the electrostatic environment of Glu258 by site-directed mutagenesis, we could drastically shift the Tabium CGTase pH optimum. The biochemical characteristics of the various mutant CGTases are presented with emphasis on the effects of these mutations on the CGTase cyclization and hydrolytic activities, pH optima, and product formation from starch. Crystals of the TabiumCGTase were grown from 21% saturated ammonium sulfate in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6. The crystals were stable in the presence of carbohydrates. A double soaking experiment was started identical to that described earlier for the Bacillus circulans strain 251 CGTase (13Strokopytov B. Knegtel R.M.A. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4241-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). ATabium CGTase crystal was soaked for 20 min in a solution of 0.25% w/v acarbose in 21% saturated ammonium sulfate and 100 mm CAPS buffer, pH 9.8, followed by 7 days of soaking in a solution of 0.5% maltohexaose in 21% saturated ammonium sulfate in 100 mm CAPS buffer, pH 9.8. Data were collected to a resolution of 2.6 Å on a MacScience Dip2000K Image Plate system and processed with XDS (23Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). Refinement of the structure was done with the TNT package (24Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar), using the 2.3-Å structure of unliganded Tabium CGTase as a starting model (6Knegtel R.M.A. Wind R.D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Buitelaar R.M. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement was followed by coordinate and all parameter (coordinates and individual atomic temperature factors) refinement. A test set for calculating a free R factor (25Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) comprised 8% (1956) of the unique reflections. Ideal protein bond lengths and angles were taken from Engh and Huber (26Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar), ideal bond lengths and angles for glucose were taken from the crystal structure of maltose (27Takusagawa F. Jacobson R.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 1978; 34: 213-218Crossref Google Scholar). Planarity, van der Waals contacts, and B factor correlations were restrained, whereas torsion angles were not. Chiral centers were watched. The model was manually adjusted using O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), running on a Silicon Graphics workstation, in combination with the program OOPS (29Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. ESF/CCP4 Newsletter. 1994; 30: 20-24Google Scholar). Electron density was displayed using ςA weightedFo − Fc, 2Fo − Fc maps, and omit difference maps (30Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar, 31Bhat T.N. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 279-281Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the course of the refinement, density appeared for 6 glucose units in the active site, at subsites −3, −2, −1, 1, 2, and 3. In this naming convention, the glycosidic bond between −1 and 1 is the scissile bond, and the substrate reducing end is at position −3. In previous structures with acarbose and the acarbose derived maltononaose inhibitor (13Strokopytov B. Knegtel R.M.A. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4241-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Strokopytov B. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2234-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the valienamine moiety of acarbose was located at subsite 2 and the 6-deoxyglucose group at subsite 1. This time, clear omit Fo − Fc density showed up at the 6-hydroxyl position at subsite 1, even after thorough refinement with a hexakis 6-deoxymaltohexaose as a carbohydrate model in the active site. Refining with maltohexaose as a model removed the difference density at position 1 completely. We decided to model a valienamine group, which has a 6-OH group, at subsite 1, and according to the acarbose structure, 6-deoxyglucose at subsite −1. This resulted in the N-glycosidic linkage of acarbose being positioned at the site of hydrolytic cleavage. This binding mode of acarbose in the active site is also observed in related α-amylases (32Qian M. Haser R. Buisson G. DuJe E. Payan F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6284-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). At subsites −2 and +2 electron density indicated the presence of 6-OH groups, so glucoses were modeled in. Furthermore, also at subsites −3 and +3 glucoses were placed, resulting finally in an acarbose derived maltohexaose in the active site of CGTase. Solvent molecules were taken from the 2.3-Å Tabiumstructure (6Knegtel R.M.A. Wind R.D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Buitelaar R.M. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and runs of the program ARP (33Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to add and remove water molecules with bad electron density. Finally, water molecules with bad density, B factors larger than 50 Å2, or no hydrogen bonds were removed by hand. Furthermore, at a binding site distant from the active site, equivalent to maltose binding site 3 (MBS3) in BC251 CGTase (5Lawson C.L. van Montfort R. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. de Vries G.E. Penninga D. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), density for a maltotriose was found, which was subsequently modeled in. MBS1 and MBS2 of BC251 CGTase (5Lawson C.L. van Montfort R. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. de Vries G.E. Penninga D. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) were not occupied in Tabium CGTase. The final model was analyzed with the PROCHECK package (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). It contained all 683 amino acids, 2 Ca2+, an acarbose-based maltohexaose inhibitor in the active site, a maltotriose at MBS3, and 185 solvent oxygens.

Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst .). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) was used for recombinant DNA manipulations. E. coli PC1990 (36Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1979; 5: 411-416Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), known to leak periplasmic proteins into the supernatant because of a mutation in its tolB locus, was used for (extracellular) production of CGTase (mutant) proteins. Plasmid pCT2, a derivative of pUC18 containing the amyA (cgt) gene of T. thermosulfurigenes EM1 (37Haeckel K. Bahl H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 60: 333-338Google Scholar), was used for site-directed mutagenesis, sequencing, and expression of the CGTase (mutant) proteins (Fig. 1). Plasmid-carrying bacterial strains were grown on LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When appropriate, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at a concentration of 0.1 mm for induction of protein expression. DNA manipulations and transformation of E. coli were essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.J. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrotransformation of E. coli was performed using the Bio-Rad gene pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). The selected conditions were 2.5 kV, 25 μF, and 200 Ω. Mutant CGTase genes were constructed via a double PCR method using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands). A first PCR reaction was carried out with the mutagenesis primer for the coding strand plus a primer 195–715 base pairs downstream on the template strand. The reaction product was subsequently used as primer in a second PCR reaction together with a primer 295–815 base pairs upstream on the coding strand. The product of the last reaction was cut withNcoI and MunI and exchanged with the corresponding fragment (900 base pairs) from the vector pCT2 (Fig. 1). The resulting (mutant) plasmid was transformed to E. coliJM109 for sequencing and to E. coli PC1990 for production of the (mutant) proteins. The following oligonucleotides were used to produce the mutations: D197H, 5′-CGTAACTTATTTCATTTAGCAGATCTAAATCAACAG-3′; F284K, 5′-GTCTTTTGGACAAGAGGTTTTCTC-3′; N327D, 5′-GGTTACTTTTATTGATGATCATGATATGG-3′; D371R, 5′-GACAGGCAATGGACGTCCTTATAATAGAGC-3′. The bold codons indicate the changed amino acids. Successful mutagenesis resulted in appearance of the underlined restriction sites (BglII for D197H, BclI for N327D and AatII for D371R), which allowed rapid screening of potential mutants. It was not possible to find a convenient restriction site for mutant F284K. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar). All 900 base pairs on the MunI-NcoI fragment obtained by PCR were checked by DNA sequencing. For production of CGTase proteins, E. coli PC1990 (pCT2) was grown in a 2-liter fermentor at pH 7.0 and 30 °C. The medium contained 2% (w/w) trypton (Oxoid, Boom BV, Meppel, The Netherlands), 1% (w/w) yeast extract (Oxoid), 1% (w/w) sodium chloride, 1% (w/w) casein hydrolysate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 μg/liter ampicillin, and 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance (A) at 450 nm. At anA450 nm of 2–3, an extra amount of 50 g of trypton was added to the fermentor. Cells were harvested after 20–24 h of growth (8000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), at absorbance values of 8–12. The supernatant was directly applied to an α-CD-Sepharose-6FF affinity column (40Monma M. Mikuni K. Kainuma K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1988; 32: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) for further purification of the CGTase proteins. After washing the column with 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.5, the CGTase was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 1% (w/w) α-CD. Purity and molecular weight of the CGTase (mutant) proteins were checked on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (11Wind R.D. Liebl W. Buitelaar R.M. Penninga D. Spreinat A. Dijkhuizen L. Bahl H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar), using the Coomassie protein assay reagent of Pierce (Pierce Europe bv, Oud-Beijerland, The Netherlands). Specific assays were used to determine the activities (initial rates) of the four different reactions catalyzed by CGTases (14Penninga D. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Lawson C.L. Dijkstra B.W. Bergsma J. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the cyclization reaction the reducing end of a sugar is transferred to another sugar residue in the same oligosaccharide chain, resulting in the formation of cyclic compounds. Coupling is the reverse reaction in which a cyclodextrin molecule is linked to a linear oligosaccharide chain, producing a longer oligosaccharide chain. In the disproportionation reaction, part of a linear donor-oligosaccharide is transferred to a linear acceptor chain. The saccharifying activity is the hydrolysis of starch into linear oligosaccharides. All assays were standardly performed at pH 6.0 and 60 °C. Cyclization and saccharifying assays were performed as described by Penninga et al. (14Penninga D. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Lawson C.L. Dijkstra B.W. Bergsma J. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Coupling activity was measured essentially as described by Nakamura et al. (41Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6624-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). β-CD (2.5 mm) was used as donor substrate and methyl α-d-glucopyranoside (100 mm) as acceptor substrate. The linear oligosaccharide formed in the reaction was converted to single glucose units by the action of amyloglucosidase (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany). Glucose was detected with the glucose/GOD-Perid method of Boehringer Mannheim (Almere, The Netherlands). Disproportionation activity was measured as described by Nakamura et al. (18Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9929-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). EPS, 4-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoheptaoside-4–6-O-ethylidene (3 mm, Boehringer Mannheim), was used as donor substrate and maltose (10 mm) as acceptor substrate. The reaction product containing the nitrophenyl group was cleaved by the action of α-glucosidase (Boehringer Mannheim). For each reaction units were defined as the amount of enzyme producing/converting 1 μmol of product/substrate at pH 6.0 and 60 °C. The pH optimum for cyclization was determined by incubating 0.1 units/ml (β-CD forming activity) of the enzyme with 5% Paselli SA2 (partially hydrolyzed potato starch; AVEBE, Foxhol, The Netherlands) in a 10 mm sodium citrate solution set at a specific pH (range 4.0–8.0). For each pH a new calibration curve was prepared with 0–2 mm β-CD. The pH optimum for the saccharifying reaction was determined in a similar way. Formation of cyclodextrins was measured under industrial process conditions by incubation of 0.1 unit/ml CGTase (β-CD forming activity) with 10% Paselli WA4 (pregelatinized drum-dried starch with a high degree of polymerization; AVEBE) in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, at 60 °C for 45 h. Samples were taken at regular time intervals and boiled for 10 min. Products formed were analyzed by HPLC, using a 25-cm Econosil-NH2 10-μm column (Alltech Nederland bv, Breda, The Netherlands) eluted with acetonitrile/water (65:45) at 1 ml/min. Products were detected by a refractive index detector (Waters 410, Waters Chromatography Division, Milford, MA). The temperature of the flow cell and column was set at 50 °C, to avoid possible precipitation of starch. Formation of linear products was directly analyzed. Formation of CDs was analyzed after incubation of the samples with an appropriate amount of β-amylase (type I-B from sweet potato, Sigma, Boom BV, Meppel, The Netherlands), degrading linear sugars (but not CDs) to glucose. The retention times for α-, β-, and γ-CD were the same as those for G4, G5, and G6 linear oligosaccharides, respectively. The maltohexaose inhibitor complexed with the CGTase from T. thermosulfurigenes EM1 was bound at subsites −3 to +3 (Fig. 2). In complexes with BC251CGTase (13Strokopytov B. Knegtel R.M.A. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4241-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or other CGTases, binding at subsite −3 has never been observed. The present study thus reveals the nature of subsite −3 for the first time. The glucose at subsite −3 (overall Bfactor: 58 Å2) has long distance interactions with Glu264 O-ε1 and Thr262 N, both at 3.6 Å. A better contact is formed at 3.4 Å with the Asn591 Oδ1 from a symmetry related molecule. This stabilization by a crystal contact may explain why in BC251 CGTase crystals a glucose at subsite −3 has never been observed. The interactions that do not result from a crystal contact are very weak, indicating that subsite −3 is not of large relevance. In the vicinity of the scissile bond the active site architecture is identical in Tabium and BC251 CGTase. It is therefore not surprising that at subsites −2 to +2, the maltohexaose inhibitor is bound in the same fashion to Tabium CGTase as the maltononaose inhibitor to BC251 CGTase (13Strokopytov B. Knegtel R.M.A. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4241-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Even though the acarbose binding mode has been modeled differently, the same amino acids are providing similar interactions from subsites −2 to +2, suggesting that acarbose can adapt its conformation easily to that required by the active site. It is clear that differences in characteristics between Tabium and BC251 CGTase must originate from interactions at more distant subsites. In contrast to subsites −2 to +2, at subsite +3 the binding mode of the maltohexaose inhibitor is radically different from the maltononaose binding mode, the former being more bent. In Fig. 3, an overlay of the two inhibitor conformations can be seen. All enzyme-substrate interactions are given in Table II. The glucose at subsite 3 of the maltohexaose inhibitor occupies a position more bent toward Phe196. This conformation at subsite 3 is stabilized by Lys47. In BC251 CGTase this residue is Arg47, which so far has never been found to be involved in substrate binding. Furthermore, in the BC251 enzyme Tyr89 has strong interactions at subsite 3, but in the Tabium CGTase this residue is an Asp. The conformation of Asp89 does not allow any interactions with substrate. Apart from these two differences at subsite 3, residues in TabiumCGTase at subsites 4–7 might be unfavorable to the maltononaose binding mode (straight), although we could not find evidence for that from the structure of Tabium CGTase. The maltohexaose conformation observed is only stabilized by the protein through the contact with Lys47. The maltohexaose conformation, however, might have less internal strain because it allows the O2–O3 interglucoside hydrogen bond between subsites 2 and 3 to be formed at 2.7 Å, whereas in the straight conformation the O2–O3 distance is 4.0 Å (13Strokopytov B. Knegtel R.M.A. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4241-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) prohibiting hydrogen bond formation. In addition, the lack of interactions with the enzyme might allow for more flexibility of the maltohexaose chain, which would thus be entropically stabilized.

Instead, this organism produces CoA as its major low molecular weight thiol. We report the identification and purification of the disulfide reductase component of this thiol/disulfide redox system. Coenzyme A disulfide reductase (CoADR) catalyzes the specific reduction of CoA disulfide by NADPH. CoADR has a pH optimum of 7.5–8.0 and is a dimer of identical subunits of Mr 49,000 each. The visible absorbance spectrum is indicative of a flavoprotein with a λmax = 452 nm. The liberated flavin from thermally denatured enzyme was identified as flavin adenine dinucleotide. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that CoADR catalyzes the reduction of CoA disulfide by NADPH at pH 7.8 with a Km for NADPH of 2 μm and for CoA disulfide of 11 μm. In addition to CoA disulfide CoADR reduces 4,4′-diphosphopantethine but has no measurable ability to reduce oxidized glutathione, cystine, pantethine, or H2O2. CoADR demonstrates a sequential kinetic mechanism and employs a single active site cysteine residue that forms a stable mixed disulfide with CoA during catalysis. These data suggest that S. aureus employs a thiol/disulfide redox system based on CoA/CoA-disulfide and CoADR, an unorthodox new member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductase superfamily.

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that is a major cause of nosocomial infections. S. aureus was the first organism identified as having resistance to penicillin and has since acquired resistance to most clinically approved antibiotics (1Swartz M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).

Current therapy for MRSA infections relies upon intravenous treatment with vancomycin. There is concern that resistance to vancomycin, which has emerged in Enterococcus faecalis, may transfer to MRSA, resulting in infections for which there may be no effective therapy (2Green C.J. ASM News. 1994; 44: 231-238Google Scholar). Efforts are now being focused to identify new cellular targets and to develop new chemotherapeutics effective against MRSA. We are investigating the unique thiol metabolism of S. aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria in hopes of facilitating this process. Aerobic organisms maintain high levels of low molecular weight thiols that in combination with specific disulfide reductases support the reducing intracellular environment and the thiol/disulfide distribution of other thiol-containing molecules. Glutathione (GSH, γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) is perhaps the best studied low molecular weight thiol. It protects these organisms from oxygen toxicity by functioning as a slowly autooxidizing reserve of cysteine and as a cofactor in the detoxification of peroxides, epoxides, and other products resulting from reaction with oxygen. It is also a cofactor in the reduction of disulfides and ribonucleotides and in the isomerization of protein disulfides (3Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

Glutathione reductase (GSR, EC 1.6.4.2) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of intracellular oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and thereby maintains the high intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio (GSH/GSSG > 100). Together, GSH, GSSG, and GSR make up the primary thiol/disulfide redox system of aerobic eukaryotes and Gram-negative bacteria (4Sundquist A.R. Fahey R.C. J. Mol.

It was recently shown thatS.aureus, like many of the Gram-positive bacteria, produces no GSH but rather produces millimolar levels of reduced CoA as its predominant thiol (Fig. 1) (13Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.C. Sherrill C. delCardayré S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CoA, which is required as a cofactor in many acyl transfer reactions, likely has additional functions in S. aureus analogous to GSH. As a first step toward understanding this novel thiol metabolism, we set out to isolate and characterize the activity responsible for maintaining CoA in its reduced form. Other organisms that utilize alternative thiols produce an enzyme analogous to GSR whose preferred substrate is the disulfide of the predominant thiol in the cell (14Shames S.L. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3519-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 15Sundquist A.R. Fahey R.C. J. Biol.

All such enzymes investigated belong to a widespread family of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases that includes GSR, lipoamide dehydrogenase, and mercuric reductase. Most of these enzymes are homodimeric flavoproteins with Mr of ∼100,000 that utilize a conserved active site disulfide bond to effect catalysis. We describe here the identification, purification, and characterization of a CoA disulfide reductase (CoADR) from S. aureus that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of CoA disulfide (Equation 1). CoASSCoA+NADPH+H+⇌2CoASH+NADP+Equation 1 In this and the following paper we highlight the similarities and the striking differences between CoADR and other members of the disulfide reductase superfamily. Reduced NADPH, riboflavin, flavin adenine mononucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), coenzyme A disulfide, glutathionyl-coenzyme A mixed disulfide, 3′-dephospho-coenzyme A, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), lysostaphin, bicinchoninic acid solution, 4% copper sulfate pentahydrate solution, 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were from Sigma (Mississauga, ON, Canada). 3′-dephospho-CoA was oxidized to the disulfide by incubation at room temperature overnight in Tris-HCl (20 mm), pH 9.0, containing copper (5 μm). EDTA was added to the solution (to 10 μm) chelate the copper. 4-Phosphopantetheine was formed by incubation of CoA with nucleotide pyrophosphatase. The thiol was oxidized as described above, and the disulfide was purified by HPLC. The purity of the disulfide was confirmed by HPLC and by thiol analysis upon reaction with monobromobimane (mBBr) (described below). All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better and were used without further purification. All protein chromatography was performed on a fast phase liquid chromatography system equipped with UV and conductivity flow cells, a MonoQ 5/5 (anion exchange) column, a C 10/10 column containing 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose (5 ml), and a Superose 6HR 10/30 (gel filtration) column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed on a Mini Protean (Bio-Rad, Burlington, ON, Canada) using a Tris-glycine buffer as described (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 18.52Google Scholar). Prestained Protein Markers (New England Biolabs (Mississauga, ON, Canada) were used for SDS-PAGE molecular weight standards and contained maltose-binding protein-β-galactosidase (175 kDa), maltose-binding protein-paramycin (83 kDa), glutamic dehydrogenase (62 kDa), aldolase (47.5 kDa), and triose phosphate isomerase (32.5 kDa). Molecular weight standards for gel filtration chromatography were from Bio-Rad and were thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine gamma globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1,350 kDa). Spectrophotometric measurements were performed on a thermostatted Cary I spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc.) using quartz cuvettes (500 μl) (Hellma, Concord, ON, Canada). Concentration of protein samples was carried out using Centricon filters (Amicon). S. aureus strain R8325-4, used in all studies, was from John Iandolo (Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS) and was grown in trypticase soy broth medium. Concentrations of FAD, NADPH, and CoA disulfide (and dephospho-CoA disulfide) were measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm (ε450 = 11,000 m−1cm−1), 340 nm (ε340 = 6220m−1 cm−1), and 260 nm (ε260 = 33,600 m−1cm−1), respectively. DTNB assays were performed in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing EDTA (1 mm) and were monitored at 412 nm for the thionitrobenzoate anion (ε412 = 13,600 m−1cm−1 (18Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21218) Google Scholar)). Protein concentrations were determined by reaction with bicinchoninic acid and copper sulfate as described (19Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). During purification CoADR activity in crude extracts was monitored by the NADPH (1 mm) and CoA disulfide (1 mm)-dependent reduction of DTNB (1 mm). For kinetic analysis of purified CoADR, the oxidation of NADPH was measured as the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (Δε340 = 6,220 m−1cm−1) and was carried out in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm), pH 7.8, containing NaCl (50 mm). An analysis of the thiols produced by S. aureus was carried out as described (20Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets (250 mg) were resuspended in 50% acetonitrile in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing mBBr (2 mm) and incubated at 60 °C for 5 min in the dark. Control samples were pretreated with N-ethylmaleamide (NEM) (2 mm) under the same conditions before the addition of mBB (to 2 mm). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the samples were diluted in 10 mmaqueous methane sulfonic acid for reverse phase HPLC analysis. Thiol standards were prepared as described (20Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To determine disulfide content, cell extracts were first treated with NEM (2 mm) to block the free thiols, then with dithiothreitol (3 mm) to reduce the disulfides and titrate the remaining NEM, and finally with mBBr to derivitize the resulting thiols. The thiol/disulfide ratio within the cell was then calculated. To determine the relative stability of CoA to heavy metal catalyzed oxidation, the rates of Cu2+ catalyzed oxidation of cysteine, GSH, and CoA were compared. Each sample (2 ml) of thiol (1 mm) in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 7.5, containing CuCl2 (1 μm) was incubated at ambient temperature. Thiol determination was carried out at various times by adding aliquots (100 μl) from each sample to a solution (900 μl) of DTNB (1 mm) in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing EDTA (1 mm). The absorbance of these samples at 412 nm were then measured, and the concentration of remaining thiol was determined. An overnight culture (10 ml) of S. aureus was centrifuged (5,000 × g for 10 min), resuspended in 3 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing lysostaphin (5 μg/ml), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min until the suspension became viscous. Glass beads (1 g; 0.2 mm) and PMSF (to 1 mm) were added, and the mixture was vortexed for 2 min and then centrifuged (15,000 × g for 10 min) to remove the insoluble cellular debris. The resulting viscous lysate was dialyzed exhaustively (3,600 Mr cutoff) against Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing EDTA (1 mm). The dialysate (40 μl) was then assayed for the pyridine nucleotide (1 mm) and disulfide (1 mm)-dependent reduction of DTNB (1 mm). A typical assay was 800 μl. An overnight culture of S. aureus was grown in trypticase soy broth (10 ml) at 37 °C and was used as an inoculum (0.4 ml) for each of ten 2-liter flasks containing trypticase soy broth (1 liter). These cells were shaken (180 rpm) for 12 h at 37 °C before being harvested by centrifugation (7000 × g for 15 min). All subsequent handling of the sample prior to chromatography was carried out at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in a minimum volume of Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing PMSF (1 mm) and lysostaphin (5.0 mg), incubated at 37 °C with agitation for 1 h (or until viscous), passed twice through a French pressure cell operating at 1,500 lb/in2, and then centrifuged (15,000 × g for 20 min) to remove insoluble cellular debris. The supernatant was brought to 50% saturation with (NH4)2SO4, stirred for 15 min, and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 10 min). The resulting supernatant was brought to 80% saturation with (NH4)2SO4 and centrifuged, and the pellet containing the CoADR activity was dissolved in a minimum volume of TE buffer containing PMSF (1 mm). The resulting solution was dialyzed exhaustively (3,500 mr cutoff) against TE buffer containing PMSF (1 mm). All chromatography was carried out at room temperature on a Pharmacia fast phase liquid chromatography. The dialyzed (NH4)2SO4 fraction was applied (1.0 ml/min) to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0. The column was washed (25 ml) and then eluted with a linear gradient (35 ml) of NaCl (0–4m) in the same buffer. The fractions (1 ml) exhibiting CoADR activity were pooled, concentrated and diluted in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 9.0, twice to reduce conductivity, and applied (1.0 ml/min) to a MonoQ HR 5/5 anion exchange column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed (5 ml) and then eluted with a linear gradient (25 ml) of NaCl (0.3–0.6 mm) in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 9.0. The purity of fractions showing CoADR activity was determined by SDS-PAGE (5% stacking gel; 12% running gel) and silver staining. Purified CoADR (25 μg) was applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel exclusion column (0.5 ml/min) equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing NaCl (1 m) and then eluted isocratically in the same buffer. Fractions containing CoADR were identified by UV absorbance and by measuring enzyme activity. The native molecular weight of CoADR was calculated by comparison of its elution volume to that of protein standards as described (21Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1976: 242-243Google Scholar). The visible absorption spectrum of purified CoADR is indicative of a flavoprotein. To identify the bound flavin cofactor, CoADR (5 μg or 100 pmol in 0.1 ml) was heated to 98 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged (15,000 ×g, 10 min) to remove the denatured protein. The supernatant was then separated by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (15Sundquist A.R. Fahey R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elution of the released cofactor was then compared with that of riboflavin, flavin adenine mononucleotide, and FAD (100 pmol each). A solution of oxidized CoADR (9.5 μm) in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing EDTA (1 mm) was incubated with NADPH (0.2 mm) for 10 min at ambient temperature before being diluted (1:1) with the same buffer containing urea (8 m) and DTNB (0.2 mm). The absorbance at 412 nm was then measured and compared with that of a similar reaction in which CoADR was not incubated with NADPH. The number of thiols liberated per FAD (ε450 = 11,300 m−1cm−1) was then calculated. To determine the identity of the two thiols detected, oxidized CoADR (9.5 μm) in 100 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing NADPH (20 μm) and CoA disulfide (200 μm), 3′-dephospho-CoA disulfide (200 μm), or CoASSG (200 μm) was incubated (incubation 1) at 37 °C for 10 min, and then the reaction was filtered through a Centricon 30 (30,000Mr cutoff) to separate CoADR from the low molecular weight reaction products. The extensively washed CoADR fraction was resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 8.0, containing EDTA (1 mm) and NADPH (0.2 mm) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C (incubation 2). The reaction product was either 1) filtered as above with the thiol content of the high and low molecular weight fraction determined by DTNB assay or 2) reacted directly with NEM and/or mBBr and then separated on HPLC as described above to identify any low molecular weight thiols present. The results were then compared with similar reactions in which oxidized CoADR was incubated alone or in the presence of either CoA disulfide or NADPH but not both. Kinetic measurements were performed in a 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette maintained at 37 °C. Each assay (0.3 ml) was carried out in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm), pH 7.8, containing NaCl (50 mm), CoADR (2–10 nm; subunit concentration determined using the calculated extinction coefficient for CoADR ε452 = 12,800m−1 cm−1), NADPH (2–200 μm), and CoA disulfide (2–200 μm), 3′-dephospho-CoA A disulfide (10–500 μm), 4,4′-diphosphopantethine (2 μm to 2 mm), pantethine (10 μm to 100 mm), glutathione disulfide (10 μm to 100 mm), cystine (10 μm to 100 mm), CoA-glutathione mixed disulfide (10 μm to 1 mm), or H2O2 (10 μm to 10 mm) (EDTA (10 μm) was present in the stock solution of 3′dephospho-CoA disulfide and was thus present in the enzyme assays for this substrate up to 0.5 μm. We have found that EDTA up to 10 mm has no effect on the observed kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by CoADR.). Enzyme and NADPH were combined in buffer and equilibrated to 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of the disulfide substrate or H2O2(reduction of each substrate was monitored at ≥7 different substrate concentrations). The activity of CoADR was monitored at 340 nm as the decrease in absorbance resulting from the oxidation of NADPH. To study the kinetic mechanism of CoADR a two-substrate kinetic analysis was performed under identical conditions except for the concentrations of enzyme and substrate used: [CoADR] = 1.5 nm, [NADPH] = 4–30 μm (in reduction of CoA disulfide) and 6–10 μm (for reduction of 3′-dephospho-CoA; [CoA disulfide] = 4–80 μm; and [3′-dephospho-CoA] = 60–400 μm. All kinetic measurements were recorded in the linear range, and kinetic constants were calculated from a nonlinear least squares fit of the initial velocity data to the Michaelis-Menton equation using the program HYPERO (22Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Bimane derivatives of low molecular weight thiols separated by reverse phase HPLC are shown in Fig. 2. As described previously (13Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.C. Sherrill C. delCardayré S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),S. aureus produces CoA, H2S, and a small amount of cysteine. CoA is measured as the combination of 3′-dephospho-CoA and CoA, because the former is a hydrolysis product of CoA that arises during the acidic storage conditions prior to separation by the HPLC. Total CoA was estimated at 1.1 ± 0.1 μmol/g (dry residual weight). H2S is commonly detected in bacterial extracts (13Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.C. Sherrill C. delCardayré S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may derive from iron-sulfur proteins. The large peak running at 18 min was isolated and characterized by 1H NMR as bismethylbimane (data not shown). This compound apparently arises from reaction of mBBr with an unknown cellular factor that is inactivated by NEM. If GSH was present, it was ≤0.02 μmol/g (dry residual weight). The predominant disulfide observed was CoA disulfide, and the ratio of reduced CoA/oxidized CoA was 450 ± 50. Biological thiols found as predominant cellular thiols, such as GSH, γ-glutamylcysteine, and mycothiol have proved to be kinetically resistant to metal catalyzed auto oxidation (12Newton G.L. Bewley C.A. Dwyer T.J. Horn R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Faulkner D.J. Fahey R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Sundquist A.R. Fahey R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative resistance to Cu2+ catalyzed air oxidation for the intracellular thiols cysteine and CoA were compared with that for GSH (Fig. 3). CoA oxidized 4-fold less rapidly than GSH, whereas GSH oxidized 180-fold less rapidly than cysteine. Cysteine proved to be the least stable. S. aureus grows aerobically, yet maintains millimolar levels of reduced CoA and an intracellular CoASH/CoA disulfide ratio of >100. A comparison of enzyme activity from anS. aureus extract incubated with various disulfide substrates and pyridine nucleotide cofactors was performed to determine whether any specific disulfide reductases were present. The extract catalyzed the reduction of DTNB slowly in the presence of either NADH or NADPH. However, in the presence of both NADPH and CoA disulfide this reduction was 3-fold greater than that observed for NADPH alone and 8-fold greater than that observed for NADH alone. No disulfide enhanced the rate of NADH-dependent reduction of DTNB, nor did GSSG, cystine, or pantethine enhance the NADPH-dependent reduction of DTNB. These results suggested that S. aureusproduces a CoADR that catalyzes specifically the reduction of CoA disulfide by NADPH and does not produce detectable glutathione reductase. The purification of CoADR from S. aureus is described in Table I. The crude extract was first subjected to a 50–80% ammonium sulfate precipitation. This fraction was dialyzed and applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column, which provided a ∼250-fold purification. CoADR from the ADP column was contaminated by three other proteins that were efficiently removed by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography. CoADR eluted as two separate peaks of activity. The second peak (shown by the arrow in Fig. 4 B) had a higher specific activity than the first and was the only fraction retained for further study. The difference between the first and second peak is unknown but could be due to modification(s) (such as loss of an FAD or deamidation) incurred during the purification process. However, no efforts have been made to investigate these speculations.Table IPurification of coenzyme A disulfide reductase from S. aureusFractionTotal unitsProteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldmgunits/mgfold%Soluble extract387025601.511.010050–80% ammonium sulfate22002468.75.857Dialysate 2′–5′ ADP-Sepharose18000.842143142047MonoQ9600.214570303025 Open table in a new tab The known pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases are multimeric, most being homodimers, and have a FAD noncovalently bound to each subunit (14Shames S.L.

Purified CoADR migrates as a single polypeptide of ∼50,000 apparent molecular weight according to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 C). The native molecular weight of CoADR was estimated by its relative elution through a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column. A plot of the parameter, K, verses the log of the molecular weight of various protein standards is shown in Fig. 4 D. The parameter, K, is defined as (Ve −Vo)/Vs, whereVe is the elution volume,Vo is the column void volume, and Vs is the volume of the stationary phase (21Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1976: 242-243Google Scholar). Native CoADR elutes between chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa) and bovine gamma globulin (158 kDa) from the Superose gel filtration column, and the K value calculated for CoADR (0.49) can be extrapolated from the standard plot to a Mr of approximately 90,000. This suggests that native CoADR is a homodimer. The visible absorbance spectrum of purified CoADR is typical of that of a flavoenzyme (Fig. 5 A) and shows a λmax at 375 and 452 nm, having a shoulder at 478 nm. The flavin bound to CoADR could be released from the enzyme by thermal denaturation and was identified as FAD by reverse phase HPLC chromatography (Fig. 5 B). In addition to the peak corresponding to FAD, an additional peak running at 24 min was observed. This peak is likely a degradation product of FAD because it was obserevd for FAD run alone (data not shown) and is present in the control chromatogram (Fig. 5 A). Quantitation of the flavin released from CoADR revealed that 90 ± 10 pmol or 0.9 ± 0.1 FAD molecules/subunit CoADR were released. An extinction coefficient for a native CoADR subunit in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 9.0, at 452 nm was estimated as 12,800 m−1cm−1 from the extinction coefficient for FAD (ε450 = 11,300 m−1cm−1) using the following equation. ε(CoADR)452=[A(native CoADR)452(11,300M−1cm−1)]/A(liberated FAD)450Equation 2 The deduced amino acid sequence of CoADR contains two cysteine residues, and only one of these (Cys43) lies in the putative active site region (36delCardayré S.B.

Moreover, AdFasL/G infection resulted in the rapid activation of DEVD-specific caspases, and caspase activation was blocked by coinfection with Ad14.7/G. Cell death induced by the overexpression of Fas ligand, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD)/MORT1, or FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE)/caspase-8 in a virus-free system was efficiently blocked by 14.7K expression.

In addition, several anti-apoptotic DED-containing viral products, termed vFLIPs, have recently been identified by data base searches (5Hu S. Vincenz C. Buller M. Dixit V. J. Biol.

On the other hand, 14.7K lacks a discernible DED, interacted with FLICE, and attenuated FLICE-induced apoptosis. This suggests that the mechanism of action of 14.7K may be different from that of the vFLIPs.Since FLICE is a shared effector caspase for both TNFR1 and Fas, it is likely that 14.7K interferes with TNF-induced apoptosis through its interaction with FLICE and through its inhibition of DEVD-specific caspase activity. However, previous studies have suggested that 14.7K may inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis by blocking the activation or activity of cPLA2 (18Zilli D. Voelkel-Johnson C. Skinner T. Laster S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Thorne T.E. Voelkel-Johnson C. Casey W.M. Parks L.W. Laster S.M. J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4904-4913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of 14.7K in apoptosis appears to be further clarified by the recent finding that TNF-induced apoptosis and arachidonic acid release can occur by a mechanism involving the activation of cPLA2 by caspase cleavage (28Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Egeblad M. Poirier G. Jaattela M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5073-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that attenuation of DEVD-specific caspase activation by 14.7K may prevent the subsequent activation of cPLA2 and thus inhibit arachidonic acid release and apoptosis.The ability of 14.7K to protect cells from TNF and FasL-induced apoptosis may be involved in the establishment and maintenance of latent or persistent adenovirus infections in lymphocytes. During lytic infection, the protective effect of the 14.7K protein might be essential for optimal viral replication. Considering the lack of persistence of adenoviruses used for gene therapy applications (26Kovesdi I. Brough D.E. Bruder J.T. Wickham T.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and the functional exclusion of 14.7K from these vectors, the expression of 14.7K in future adenovirus constructs may be beneficial in a clinical setting. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a physiological process that is required for the normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms and involves the destruction of cells that are no longer required or are potentially dangerous (1Jacobson M.

On the other hand, 14.7K lacks a discernible DED, interacted with FLICE, and attenuated FLICE-induced apoptosis. This suggests that the mechanism of action of 14.7K may be different from that of the vFLIPs.Since FLICE is a shared effector caspase for both TNFR1 and Fas, it is likely that 14.7K interferes with TNF-induced apoptosis through its interaction with FLICE and through its inhibition of DEVD-specific caspase activity. However, previous studies have suggested that 14.7K may inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis by blocking the activation or activity of cPLA2 (18Zilli D. Voelkel-Johnson C. Skinner T. Laster S.M. Biochem.

The role of 14.7K in apoptosis appears to be further clarified by the recent finding that TNF-induced apoptosis and arachidonic acid release can occur by a mechanism involving the activation of cPLA2 by caspase cleavage (28Wissing D.

This finding suggests that attenuation of DEVD-specific caspase activation by 14.7K may prevent the subsequent activation of cPLA2 and thus inhibit arachidonic acid release and apoptosis.The ability of 14.7K to protect cells from TNF and FasL-induced apoptosis may be involved in the establishment and maintenance of latent or persistent adenovirus infections in lymphocytes. During lytic infection, the protective effect of the 14.7K protein might be essential for optimal viral replication. Considering the lack of persistence of adenoviruses used for gene therapy applications (26Kovesdi I. Brough D.E. Bruder J.T. Wickham T.J. Curr. Opin.

FLICE is the first caspase to be activated during apoptosis induced by Fas and TNFR1 oligomerization. FLICE becomes processed and activated within the death receptor signaling complex, possibly by an autocatalytic mechanism involving FLICE oligomerization (12Medema J. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.

In the current study, we demonstrated that α4β1 integrin binds to CSGAG. We have identified a peptide from within α4 integrin termed SG1 (KKEKDIMKKTI) that binds to cell surface melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, indicating that SG1 represents a CSGAG binding site within the α4 integrin subunit. Soluble SG1 inhibits α4β1integrin-mediated human melanoma cell adhesion to CS1. Polyclonal antibody generated against the peptide inhibits melanoma cell adhesion to CS1, and the inhibition is reversed by Mn2+ and an activating monoclonal antibody anti-β1 (8A2). Additionally, pretreatment of cells with anti-SG1 IgG inhibits the expression of the monoclonal antibody 15/7 epitope in the presence of soluble CS1 peptide, suggesting that anti-SG1 IgG prevents ligand binding by α4β1 integrin. These results demonstrate that α4β1 integrin interacts directly with CSGAG through SG1 site, and that this site can affect the ligand binding properties of the integrin.

Tumor cells must adhere to a variety of extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; CSGAG, chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan; MCSP, melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FN, fibronectin; CSPG, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; OVA, ovalbumin; EDC,l-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PG, proteoglycan. proteins and molecules on other cells as they invade and metastasize. These interactions of tumor cells have a profound effect on their phenotype (1Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 215-218PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zetter B.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 219-229PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins are a family of receptors that are fundamentally important for mediating cell adhesion to ECM proteins (3Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 443-475Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). α4β1 integrin is important in tumor cell invasion and metastasis, although its exact role is complex and not completely understood. This integrin is expressed on many hematopoietic malignancies and also on nonhematopoietic tumors, such as melanomas (4Taichman D.B. Cybulsky M.I. Djaffar I. Longenecker B.M. Teixido J. Rice G.E. Aruffo A. Bevilacqua M.P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,5Rice G.E. Gimbrone M.A. Bevilacqua M.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 204-210PubMed Google Scholar). It is unusual among integrins in that it binds to both ECM components (e.g. fibronectin (FN)) and the Ig superfamily adhesion receptor VCAM-1, which is expressed on activated endothelial cells and other cell types (4Taichman D.B. Cybulsky M.I. Djaffar I. Longenecker B.M. Teixido J. Rice G.E. Aruffo A. Bevilacqua M.P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). α4β1integrin has been implicated in tumor cell arrest and/or extravasation, because agents that interfere with α4β1integrin can inhibit tumor cell/endothelial cell interactions in vitro or experimental metastasis and pulmonary retention of injected tumor cells in mice (6McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P. Palm S.L. Furcht L.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Garafolo A. Chirivi R.G.S. Foglieni C. Pigott R. Mortarini R. Martin-Padura I. Anichini A. Gearing A.J. Sanchez-Madrid F. Dejana E. Giavazzi R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 414-419PubMed Google Scholar). α4β1integrin also binds to itself and promotes homotypic cell adhesion (8Pian F. Vaux D.L. Weismann I.L. Cell. 1995; 77: 335-347Google Scholar,9Altevogt P. Hubbe M. Ruppert M. Lohr J. Hoegen P.V. Sammer M. Andrew D.P. McEvoy L. Humphries M.J. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Various monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), divalent cations, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate can regulate α4β1integrin-mediated cell adhesion in lymphoid cell systems (10Shimizu Y. van Seventer G.A. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 11Wilkins J.A. Stupak D. Stewart S. Caicia S. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This regulation of integrin function results from conformational alterations induced by the direct binding of these reagents to integrin subunits or by indirect (so called inside-out) effects of signaling pathways on integrin conformation. Distinct conformational changes associated with α4β1 integrin activation or ligand binding have been identified by using specific mAbs. One mAb, 15/7 (anti-β1 integrin), detects an epitope that is induced by ligand binding or is exposed on activated integrins in lymphoid cells (14Yednock T.A. Cannon C. Vandevert C. Goldbach E.G. Shaw G. Ellis D.K. Liaw C. Fritz L.C. Tanner L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28740-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although a role for α4β1 integrin has clearly been established in influencing various aspects of tumor cell biology, the mechanisms by which tumor cells control the functional activity of this integrin merits further consideration. Cell surface proteoglycans (PGs) are important in modulating cell adhesion and motility (15Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Knutson J.R. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Gallagher J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 1201-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Many cell adhesion-promoting components in ECM or on cell surfaces (e.g. CD31 or PECAM) can bind PGs and support adhesion as a result of this interaction (17DeLisser H.M. Yan H.C. Newman P.J. Muller W.A. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16037-16046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGs act as co-receptors for integrins and play a role in transducing signals. Cell surface proteoglycans interact with ECM proteins and often colocalize with integrins and/or may stimulate integrin-mediated signaling through outside-in/inside-out mechanisms. Syndecan-4 localizes in focal contacts (18Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas syndecan-1 associates with stress fibers (22Yamagata M. Saga S. Kato M. Bernfield M. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 55-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been reported that Raji cells transfected with syndecan-1 spread on substrata coated with fibronectin, whereas mock transfectants failed to spread (23Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transfectants adhered and spread on substrata coated with an anti-syndecan-1 core protein monoclonal antibody (23Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the core protein of certain proteoglycans can modulate integrin-mediated cell spreading as a result of intracellular signaling events that are stimulated by clustering of the core proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP) might play a role in melanoma cell adhesion and invasion. For example, certain mAbs against MCSP will partially inhibit melanoma cell adhesion to cultured endothelial cells (24De Vries J.E. Keizer G.D. Te Velde A.A. Voordouw A. Ruiter D. Rumke P. Spits H. Figdor C.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1986; 38: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Harperet al. (25Harper J.R. Bumol T.F. Reisfeld R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 132: 2096-2104Google Scholar, 26Harper J.R. Reisfeld R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1983; 71: 259-263PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that mAb 9.2.27 inhibits human melanoma cell adhesion and cytoplasmic spreading on ECM proteins, such as collagen, or on collagen-fibronectin complexes and that this mAb can also inhibit anchorage-independent cell growth. Additionally, at least one anti-NG2 mAb (NG2, the rat homologue of human MCSP (27Nishiyama A. Dahlin K.J. Prince J.T. Johnstone S.R. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)) has been demonstrated to inhibit melanoma cell invasion through reconstituted basement membranes in vitro (28Chattopadhyay P. Starky J. Morrow W.J. Raychaudhuri S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2684-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, human MCSP was cloned by Pluschke et al. (29Pluschke G. Vanek M. Evans A. Dittmar T. Schmid P. Itin P. Filardo E.J. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9710-9715Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that clustering of MCSP stimulates α4β1integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal contact formation in melanoma cells (30Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar), implying a role for the MCSP core protein in modulating integrin function by an inside-out signaling mechanism. Furthermore, we have previously shown that removal of cell surface chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CSGAG) by chondroitinase ABC or inhibition of synthesis of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) byp-nitrophenyl β-d-xyloside inhibits α4β1 but not α5β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion, suggesting an important role for cell surface CSGAG in enhancing α4β1 integrin function (31Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated that α4β1 integrin can bind to CSGAG. Furthermore, we used a synthetic peptide approach for identifying potential CSGAG binding site(s) within the α4 integrin subunit. One site, defined by synthetic peptide SG1 (KKEKDIMKKTI), directly binds to MCSP proteoglycan, and when used as a soluble antagonist, it inhibits melanoma cell adhesion to CS1. Polyclonal antibody generated against this peptide (anti-SG1 IgG) also inhibits α4β1 integrin-mediated melanoma cell adhesion, and the inhibition can be reversed by Mn2+ and mAb 8A2. Furthermore, anti-SG1 IgG prevents the CS1-induced exposure of the mAb 15/7 epitope. These results demonstrate that α4β1 integrin interacts directly with CSGAG through the SG1 site and that this interaction can regulate the ligand binding properties of the integrin. Highly metastatic human melanoma cells (A375SM), which were selected by in vivo experimental metastasis assays of parent A375P cells in nude mice, were kindly provided by Dr. I. J. Fidler (M. D.

Ramos cells were kindly given by Dr. Tucker Lebien (Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were routinely used after fewer than 15 passages from frozen stocks. P4C2 (anti-α4), P1D6 (anti-α5), and P5D2 (anti-β1) were provided by Dr. Elizabeth A. Wayner (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The specificity of these mAbs was demonstrated elsewhere (33Carter W.G. Wayner E.A. Bouchard T.S. Kaur P. J.

Anti-MCSP core protein antibody (9.2.27) was kindly given by Dr. Ralph Reisfeld (The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA) (38Bumol T.F. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1245-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Anti-CD44 mAb (clone P1G12) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Human plasma FN was purified as a by-product of factor VIII production by sequential ion-exchange and gelatin affinity chromatography as described previously (6McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P. Palm S.L. Furcht L.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The tryptic/catheptic 33-kDa heparin binding fragment of FN A-chains was purified according to methods previously reported (6McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P. Palm S.L. Furcht L.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purity of FN or a tryptic, RGD-containing 75-kDa fragment was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. All of the peptides used in this study were synthesized at the Microchemical Facility of the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN) using a Beckman System 990 peptide synthesizer. The procedures used were based on the Merrifield solid phase system as described previously (30Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilized crude peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C-18 column using an elution gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The purity and composition of the peptides were verified by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of hydrolysates prepared by treating the peptides under nitrogen in 6 n HCl overnight at 110 °C (30Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) usingl-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Sigma) as a coupling reagent. The conjugate was mixed with Freund's adjuvant and then used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. IgG was purified from pooled immune sera by precipitation with ammonium sulfate followed by DEAE anion exchange chromatography as described previously (39Skubitz A.P.N. McCarthy J.B. Charonis A.S. Furcht L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4861-4868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purity of the IgG was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gels. Specificity of the purified IgG was then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (31Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fab fragments of the anti-SG1 IgG or normal rabbit IgG were obtained by incubating the purified IgG with immobilized papain (Pierce) for 5 h at 37 °C following the manufacturer's instructions. The digestion products were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were found to be free of intact IgG heavy chain. Peptide was chemically conjugated to OVA using EDC because previous studies have shown that the coupling of synthetic peptides to larger carrier proteins resulted in enhanced cell adhesion activities (30Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar, 31Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts (by weight) of peptide CS1 and OVA were solubilized in water and mixed with a 10-fold excess (by weight) of EDC dissolved in water. The sample was then mixed overnight at 4 °C on a circular rotator. The coupled peptide was then dialyzed extensively against PBS to remove the excess EDC and uncoupled peptide (Spectrapore 6, 10-kDa exclusion, Spectrum Medical Industries, Los Angeles, CA). The conjugates were stored at −20 °C until use. The specificity of cell adhesion to CS 1/OVA was verified by using mAbs against α4 and β1 as well as soluble peptide CS1 as described under “Results.” Aggrecan was prepared as described previously (40Oegema Jr., T.R. Hascall V.C. Dziewiatkowski D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6151-6159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified aggrecan (dry weight, 50 mg) was digested with both 1 mg of trypsin (Sigma) and 1 mg of proteinase K (Qiagen) in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 100 mmsodium acetate (pH 7.5) overnight at 37 °C and then mixed with an equal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 8 mguanidine. CsCl was added to the solution at a ratio of 6:10 (w/w) to give a density of 1.56 and then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 48 h. The bottom of the solution, in which CSGAG was enriched, was collected and extensively dialyzed against 0.25 m sodium acetate following by PBS. The purified CSGAG was then coupled to CNBr-activated sepharose (Sigma) as described in manufacture's protocol. Under these experimental conditions, 1 mg (as uronic acid) of CSGAG was immobilized on the matrix. Ramos cells were biotinylated and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) containing 50 mm β-octylglucoside, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Mn2+, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (lysis buffer) and then centrifuged at 36,500 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were precleared on a mock column and then applied to the CSGAG column. The column was extensively washed with the lysis buffer, and then the bound materials were eluted by the lysis buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl (41Diamond M.S. Alon R. Parkos C.A. Quinn M.T. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 130: 1473-1482Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel consisting of 7.5% running with 5% stacking gels and then transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane. Nonspecific binding sites on the membranes were blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence systems (Boeringer Mannheim). Elutions from the affinity column were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-α4(P4C2) or isotype-matched control antibody (FLOPC21). The proteins were separated, transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane, and detected as described above. Cell adhesion assays were performed as described, with minor modifications (30Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ligands were diluted in PBS, and 50-μl aliquots were dispersed in triplicate into Immulon-1 polystyrene microtiter wells. The wells were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and nonspecific binding sites on plastic were then blocked by treating the wells with 200 μl of PBS containing 2% BSA. Subconfluent A375SM human melanoma cells that had been radiolabeled overnight with [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 6.7 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) were harvested by rinsing with 1 mm EDTA, washed two times with Eagle's minimum essential medium/BSA (Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 2 mg/ml BSA and 0.15 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) and adjusted to a concentration of 105 cells/ml in the same medium. Aliquots of 100 μl of the cell suspension were dispensed into the wells, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The assays were terminated by aspirating loosely bound and unbound cells from the wells, washing the wells three times, and solubilizing the bound cells in 0.5n NaOH containing 1% SDS. Bound radioactivity, determined in a Beckman model 3801 liquid scintillation counter, was used to calculate the percentage of cells that remained adherent to each substratum. Unless otherwise indicated, the data represent the means of triplicate determinations. A375SM and SKMEL-2 cells were lysed in 80 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 3% SDS, 15% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. The same amounts of proteins were separated by 7.5% running with 5% stacking gels and then transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane. Nonspecific binding sites on the membranes were blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated with primary IgGs (1 μg/ml) for 4 h at room temperature followed by an incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Boeringer Mannheim). Peptide-affinity chromatography was performed according to the methods described previously (31Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Peptide SG1 was immobilized on activated CH-sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and blocked according to the methods described in manufacturer's instructions. Human melanoma cells were surface-radiolabeled with125I using lactoperoxidase and extracted as described previously (30Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were extracted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) containing 50 mm β-octylglucoside, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Mn2+, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm NEM (extraction buffer) and then centrifuged at 36,500 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell lysates were first precleared by incubating with a mock column, on which no peptide was immobilized, and then applied to an SG1 column. The column was extensively washed with the extraction buffer, and then bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of sodium chloride (15 mm to 1 m). Radioactivity in each fraction was quantified using a γ counter, and positive fractions were pooled and immunoprecipitated as described below. The samples were first precleared with normal mouse IgG/rabbit anti-mouse IgG/protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. 1 μg of 9.2.27 or anti-CD44 mAb was incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG/protein A-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. Equal amounts (based on cpm) of the precleared cell lysates were incubated with the 9.2.27/rabbit anti-mouse IgG/protein A-agarose or the CD44/rabbit anti-mouse IgG/protein A-agarose for 4–6 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were extensively washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) containing 50 mm β-octylglucoside, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Mn2+, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm NEM. For enzyme treatment, the beads were washed two times with the digestion buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NEM, 5 mm PMSF, and 0.36 mm pepstatin) and then incubated with 0.01 unit/ml of protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America, Inc., Rockville, MD) in the digestion buffer for 4 h at 37 °C. For heparitinase treatment, digestion buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm sodium acetate, 0.01 m EDTA, 0.01 m NEM, 1 mm PMSF, 0.36 mm pepstatin) was used with 10 milliunits of heparitinase (Seikagaku America). The immune complexes were released from the beads with boiling in SDS-sample buffer and then analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and exposed on x-ray films at −80 °C. To evaluate potential interactions between α4β1 integrin with CSGAGs, we first prepared a CSGAG-affinity column as described under “Materials and Methods.” Aggrecan was used as a source of CSGAG chain because the proteoglycan contains CSGAG as the major GAG. Biotinylated cell lysates were applied to the CSGAG column and washed, and the bound proteins were eluted with 0.4 m NaCl as described by Diamondet al. (41Diamond M.S. Alon R. Parkos C.A. Quinn M.T. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 130: 1473-1482Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane. Although several proteins eluted from CSGAG column under these conditions, two prominent proteins migrated at 140 and 120 kDa (Fig. 1, CSGAG). These proteins were not eluted from mock column (Fig. 1, Mock), indicating that they specifically interact with the GAG chain. Anti-α4 integrin mAb (P4C2) specifically immunoprecipitated α4β1 integrin from the CSGAG column eluants, whereas no detectable immunoprecipitated proteins were detected from the mock column eluant, indicating that α4β1 specifically bound the CSGAG column. In previous reports, we demonstrated that removal of cell surface CSGAGs inhibits α4β1 integrin-mediated but not α5β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion (31Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cell surface CSGAGs can enhance the adhesive function of α4β1 integrin, possibly as a result of directly interacting with the α4 integrin subunit. To further explore this possibility, we selected several positively charged, relatively hydrophilic synthetic peptides from the α4 integrin subunit sequence (Fig. 2 A). One of these peptides, termed SG1, is uniquely contained within the α4 integrin subunit as described by Takada et al. (42Takada Y. Elices M.J. Crous C. Hemler M.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), when comparing integrin sequences that are aligned for maximum homology using CLUSTAL W algorithm (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). In the first set of experiments, each of the peptides was tested for the ability to inhibit cell adhesion to substrata coated with CS1. Cells were preincubated with each peptide for 15 min at 37 °C and then incubated on substrata coated with CS1 for 30 min. Cell adhesion to CS1 was inhibited by soluble CS1, as expected (Fig. 3 A). Although the synthetic peptides were similarly positively charged and possess similar hydropathy indices, only peptide SG1 inhibited cell adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). The inhibitory effects of CS1 and SG1 are not due to their toxic activity on the cells, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion (not shown). The inhibitory effect of SG1 was also not due to the blocking of CS1 binding sites by the soluble SG1 because preincubation of CS1-coated plates with soluble SG1 prior to cell adhesion assays had no effect on cell adhesion (not shown). An all-d form of peptide SG1 (d-SG1) was also tested for the ability to inhibit cell adhesion to evaluate the specificity of inhibitory effect of soluble SG1. This all d-SG1 has a sequence and charge distribution exactly the same as that of an all l-SG1, except that the conformations of the residues within each peptide are mirror images of each other. Although both CS1 and all l-SG1 significantly inhibited cell adhesion to CS1, all d-SG1 did not affect cell adhesion, indicating that the inhibitory effect of SG1 is dependent upon the chirality of the peptide and is not due to a simple charge effect of the peptide (Fig. 3 B). To further evaluate the biological activities of the SG1 site in the context of α4β1 integrin, w"
https://openalex.org/W2048535876,"We have measured the <i>in vivo</i> protein turnover for the major calcium regulatory proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum from the skeletal muscle of young adult (7 months) and aged (28 months) Fischer 344 rats. From the time course of the incorporation and decay of protein-associated radioactivity after a pulse injection of [<sup>14</sup>C]leucine and correcting for leucine reutilization, in young rats, the apparent half-lives for calsequestrin, the 53-kDa glycoprotein, and ryanodine receptor are 5.4 ± 0.4, 6.3 ± 1.3, and 8.3 ± 1.3 days, respectively. A half-life of 14.5 ± 2.5 days was estimated for the Ca-ATPase isolated from young muscle. Differences in protein turnover associated with aging were determined using sequential injection of two different isotopic labels ([<sup>14</sup>C]leucine and [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine) to provide an estimate of protein synthesis and degradation within the same animal. The Ca-ATPase and ryanodine receptor isolated from aged muscle exhibits 27 ± 5% and 25 ± 3% slower protein turnover, respectively, relative to that from young muscle. In contrast, the 53-kDa glycoprotein exhibits a 25 ± 5% more rapid turnover in aged SR, while calsequestrin exhibits no age-dependent alteration in turnover. Statistical analysis comparing the sensitivity of various methods for discriminating different rates of protein turnover validates the approach used in this study and demonstrates that the use of two isotopic labels provides at least a 6-fold more sensitive means to detect age-related differences in protein turnover relative to other methods."
https://openalex.org/W2025060260,"We examined the possibility that the α6A and α6B cytoplasmic domain variants of the α6β1 integrin differentially activate p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. P388D1 macrophages that express equivalent surface levels of either the α6Aβ1 or α6Bβ1 integrin were used to examine this issue. Adhesion to laminin-1 mediated by the α6Aβ1 integrin triggered activation of a substantial fraction of total p42 and p44 MAP kinases as assessed using a mobility shift assay, immunoblot analysis with a phosphospecific MAP kinase antibody, and an immune complex kinase assay. In contrast, ligation of the α6Bβ1 integrin did not trigger significant MAP kinase activation. These data were confirmed by antibody clustering of the α6β1 integrins. Both the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 integrins were capable of activating the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase and this activation, unlike MAP kinase activation, is dependent on phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase. Activation of MAP kinase by α6β1 requires both Ras and protein kinase C activity. A functional correlate for differential activation of MAP kinase was provided by the findings that the α6Aβ1 transfectants migrated significantly better on laminin than the α6Bβ1transfectants and this migration was dependent on MAP kinase activity based on the use of the MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059. Our findings demonstrate that the α6β1 integrin can activate MAP kinase, that this activation is regulated by the cytoplasmic domain of the α6 subunit, and that it relates to α6β1-mediated migration.

Gallagher P.J. Delanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Initial studies demonstrated that MAP kinase could be activated by integrin-mediated attachment to the extracellular matrix (6Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. J. Biol.

More recently, the possible involvement of other signaling molecules including Ras and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in MAP kinase activation by integrins has been explored, an area that remains controversial (9Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 10Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14814-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These studies, however, did not address the possibility that specificity exists among integrins for their ability to modulate MAP kinase activity. Recently, however, this possibility was substantiated by the finding that only a subset of integrins (α1β1, α5β1, and αvβ3) can activate MAP kinase (14Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The ability of these integrins to activate MAP kinase was found to be mediated by the recruitment and phosphorylation of Shc and to be specified by the membrane-proximal portion of the extracellular domain of the integrin α subunit, its transmembrane segment, or both. Other integrins (α2β1, α3β1, and α6β1) were unable to induce MAP kinase activation in these assays (14Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). An issue that has not been resolved with respect to integrin-mediated activation of MAP kinase is the possible role of the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α subunit in regulating this activation. This possibility is supported by studies that have established a specific role for this cytoplasmic domain in regulating integrin-mediated functions (see, e.g., Ref. 15Chan B.M. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers H.R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this direction, we are interested in understanding how the α6A and α6B isoforms of the α6 integrin subunit regulate the signaling properties of the α6β1 integrin. Previously, we reported that ligation of the α6Aβ1 integrin in P388D1 macrophages induces a much more marked induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation than does ligation of the α6Bβ1 integrin in the same cells (16Shaw L.M. Turner C.E. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23648-23652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An important issue that arises from these data is whether the cytoplasmic domain sequence of the α6 subunit can influence MAP kinase activation. This issue is also timely because of the report discussed above concluding that the α6β1integrin cannot activate MAP kinase (14Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G.

In this study, we demonstrate that the α6 cytoplasmic domain sequence regulates MAP kinase activation and that the differential activation of MAP kinase by the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 integrins is linked to the ability of these cells to migrate on laminin-1. Details on the generation and characterization of the P388D1/α6 transfectants have been described previously (17Shaw L.M. Lotz M.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11401-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI containing 25 mm HEPES, 15% certified fetal bovine serum, and 300 μg/ml G418. The subclones used in this study had equivalent surface expression of either the α6Aβ1 or α6Bβ1 integrins as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the α6 specific monoclonal antibody, 2B7 (17Shaw L.M. Lotz M.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11401-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue culture dishes (60 mm, Costar) were coated at 4 °C overnight with 30 μg/ml laminin purified from the Englebreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma as described (18Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Liotta L.A. Robey P.G. Tryggvason K. Martin G.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6188-6193Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The dishes were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with Puck's Saline A prior to use. Confluent P388D1 cells were removed from tissue culture dishes by scraping and maintained in suspension for 30 min at room temperature in Puck's Saline A solution containing 0.5 mm MnCl2. Subsequently, the cells were either kept in suspension or plated on matrix-coated dishes and incubated at 37 °C for the time periods noted in the Fig. legends. Following this incubation, the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted in 0.2 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmphenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). Total cell extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with one of the the following antibodies as indicated in the figure legends: ERK1 mAbs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and Transduction Laboratories, Inc.), a polyclonal ERK antibody (from John Blenis, Harvard Medical School), or a phosphospecific ERK polyclonal antibody (New England BioLabs, Inc.). MAP kinase activity was examined in the P388D1 extracts using an immune complex kinase assay following the manufacturer's protocol (New England BioLabs). In some experiments, MAP kinase activation was assessed after mAb clustering of the α6β1integrins on the surface of the P388D1 transfectants following the method of Kornberg et al. (19Kornberg L.J. Earp H.S. Turner C.E. Prockop C. Juliano R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), except that 20 μg/ml mouse Fc fragment was incubated with the cells prior to the addition of the integrin antibody. To examine the effects of calphostin C (Sigma), wortmannin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and PD98059 (Calbiochem) on MAP kinase activation, the cells were treated with these pharmacological reagents for 30 min in suspension prior to plating on laminin-1. Samples containing calphostin C were activated by fluorescent light. The same extracts of the P388D1 transfectants described above for the MAP kinase assays were also used to assay the activation of S6K by a mobility shift assay. Briefly, 20 μg of total cell protein obtained from cells either maintained in suspension or adherent to laminin were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of S6K were detected by immunoblotting using an S6K-specific polyclonal antibody (provided by John Blenis). Transient transfection experiments were performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each 100-mm dish was co-transfected with 2 μg of pCDNA3-HA-ERK1 (John Blenis) and 6 μg of either pMT3-RasN17 (Larry Feig, Tufts School of Medicine) or empty vector. After 40 h, the cells were removed from the dishes and either maintained in suspension or plated on laminin-1 for 30 min as described above. Cell extracts (200 μg of protein) were immunprecipitated with an HA antibody (12CA5; Boehringer Mannheim). After washing three times with lysis buffer, the immune complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing 50 μm ATP, 4 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and the reactions were terminated by the addition of sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Subsequently, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the phosphorylated MBP was detected by autoradiography. Cell migration assays were performed using 6.5-mm Transwell chambers (8-mm pore size) (CoStar, Cambridge, MA) as described previously (20Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, RPMI-H containing 15 μg/ml laminin was added to the bottom well, and the filters were coated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended at 106cells/ml in RPMI-H, and 105 cells were added to the top well of the Transwell chambers. After a 24-h incubation in the presence of PD98059 (25 μm) in Me2SO or Me2SO alone, the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filters were fixed, stained, and counted as described (20Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether the α6β1 integrin can induce MAP kinase activation and whether the cytoplasmic domain of the α subunit plays a role in this event, we used stable subclones of P388D1 macrophages that expressed either the α6Aβ1 or α6Bβ1 integrins at equivalent levels of surface expression (16Shaw L.M. Turner C.E. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23648-23652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). P388D1 cells do not express the α6 integrin subunit, and expression of either the α6Aβ1 or α6Bβ1integrin enables them to adhere to laminin-1 (20Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was assessed initially by a mobility shift assay using cells that were maintained in suspension or plated on laminin-1-coated dishes for 40 min. In α6Aβ1-expressing cells plated on laminin-1, the phosphorylated forms of both ERK1 and ERK2 increased markedly in comparison to cells maintained in suspension (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). Under identical conditions, significantly less ERK1 and ERK2 were shifted to the slower mobility species in α6Bβ1-expressing cells. Densitometric analysis of data obtained from three separate experiments revealed that the ratio of the increase in ERK2 phosphorylation induced by laminin-1 in the α6Aβ1-expressing cells compared with the increase in the α6Bβ1-expressing cells was 6.0 ± 1.5. The mobility shift data were confirmed using an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the MAP kinases (Fig. 1 A, middle panel). A significant amount of phosphorylated ERK2 was detected in the α6Aβ1-expressing cells adherent to laminin-1 but not in the α6Bβ1-expressing cells. Adhesion to fibronectin, however, induced ERK1 and ERK2 activation in both the α6Aβ1- and α6Bβ1-expressing cells (data not shown). The activity of MAP kinase was assayed using an immune complex kinase assay with Elk1 as the substrate. Densitometric analysis of the blot shown in Fig. 1 A (lower panel) revealed that MAP kinase activity in the α6Aβ1-expressing cells adherent to laminin was approximately 4-fold higher than the activity in the same cells maintained in suspension. In contrast, an increase in Elk1 phosphorylation induced by adhesion of the α6Bβ1-expressing cells adherent to laminin was barely detectable (0.5-fold increase). Although the α6β1 integrin is the only laminin-1 receptor used by P388D1 macrophages (20Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we wished to confirm that the activation of MAP kinase observed in response to laminin adhesion was actually the result of α6β1 ligation. For this purpose, the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1integrins were clustered on the surface of the P388D1 transfectants using the 2B7 mAb and a secondary Ab that recognizes 2B7. It is important to note that 2B7 recognizes the extracellular domain of the α6 subunit that is identical in the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1integrins (21Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ligation of the α6Aβ1integrin induced a more marked increase in the appearance of the phosphorylated form of ERK2 in comparison to ligation of α6Bβ1 (Fig. 1 B). Thus, these data substantiate the laminin adhesion data presented above. To determine the kinetics of MAP kinase activation induced by the α6Aβ1 integrin, we examined the mobility shift of ERK1 and ERK2 at different times after plating the cells on laminin-1 (Fig. 1 C). Significant activation of both ERK1 and ERK2 was detected at 10 min. Activation peaked at 40 min and was sustained for an additional 30 min. These results are consistent with a sustained activation of MAP kinase that occurs in response to fibronectin adhesion, and they are in contrast to the more rapid and transient activation induced by growth factors (8Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The above data obtained using P388D1 macrophages demonstrate that the interaction of the α6β1 integrin with laminin can trigger the activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 family MAP kinases. More importantly, these data implicate a key role for the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α subunit in regulating MAP kinase activation because a substantial fraction of total ERK1 and ERK2 was activated by ligation of the α6Aβ1integrin. Significant activation of MAP kinase by ligation of α6Bβ1 was not observed in any of our assays. Clearly, the results we obtained differ from the recent report that neither ligation of the α6β1 integrin nor cell adhesion to laminin can induce MAP kinase activation (14Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). A likely explanation for this discrepancy is that integrin-mediated regulation of MAP kinase activity is cell-type specific and that it is not activated by α6β1 ligation in the NIH 3T3 cells used by Wary et al. (14Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that MAP kinase activation in response to NIH 3T3 cell adhesion to laminin has been reported previously (6Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The issue of whether the α6Bβ1 integrin is capable of activating other kinases in P388D1 cells was addressed by examining the phosphorylation of the p70 S6K, a Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates the 40 S ribosomal subunit protein S6 (22Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 23Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). We chose S6K because its activation has been shown to be independent of the MAP kinase pathway (24Ming X.F. Burgering B.M. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and because it can be activated by integrin signaling (25Malik R.K. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29785-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of the α6Aβ1- and α6Bβ1-expressing cells to activate S6K in response to laminin adhesion was examined by a mobility shift assay. Extracts from cells that were maintained in suspension or adherent to laminin-1 were immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of S6K. Adhesion to laminin-1 induced a dramatic shift to the more slowly migrating, phosphorylated forms of S6K in both the α6Aβ1- and α6Bβ1-expressing cells (Fig. 2 A), indicating that both the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1integrins can activate S6K in these cells. Interestingly, S6K activation was completely inhibited by 100 nm wortmannin (Fig. 2 A), but MAP kinase activation was affected minimally by this inhibitor (Fig. 2 B). These findings demonstrate that the α6Bβ1 integrin is capable of signaling. To investigate the role of the small G protein Ras in the α6β1-mediated MAP kinase activation, α6Aβ1-expressing P388D1 cells were co-transfected with cDNAs that encode a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ERK1 (HA-ERK1) and a dominant negative form of Ras (RasN17) that blocks guanine nucleotide exchange factors involved in the activation of endogenous Ras (26Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Cells that expressed these constructs were either maintained in suspension or plated on laminin-1 for 30 min and HA-immune complexes obtained from extracts of these cells were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate MBP. As shown in Fig. 3 A, MBP phosphorylation in response to laminin-1 attachment was significantly inhibited in cells that expressed RasN17. A RasN17-dependent reduction in the basal level of MBP phosphorylation of cells in suspension was also observed (Fig. 3 A). Although these findings suggest that α6β1-stimulated MAP kinase activation is through the canonical Ras pathway in these cells, it should be noted that the involvement of Ras, as well as FAK, in integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation remains controversial in other cells (9Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 10Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14814-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). At the very least, we can conclude that FAK is not important for α6β1-mediated activation of MAP kinase in P388D1 cells because these cells, similar to other macrophages, do not express this kinase. 2J. Wei and L. M. Shaw, unpublished results. We also examined the possible role of PKC in the α6β1-mediated MAP kinase activation because of its involvement in MAP kinase activation by growth factor receptors (28Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The involvement of PKC in MAP kinase activation has been implicated largely from the activating effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on these kinases (28Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that overexpression of certain PKC isoforms can activate MEK1 as well as ERK directly, suggesting that these PKC isoforms could be authentic upstream activators of the MEK-ERK pathway (29Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of PKC, cells were pretreated with the PKC inhibitor calphostin C and either maintained in suspension or plated on laminin-1 in the presence of 0.5 mm MnCl2. This divalent cation was included to maintain cell attachment to laminin-1 (20Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mobility shift assay revealed that the α6Aβ1-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was specifically inhibited by calphostin C with half-maximal inhibition observed at approximately 25 nm (Fig. 4). Thus, PKC is a likely intermediate in the α6β1-mediated activation of MAP kinase in P388D1 cells. We reported previously that α6Aβ1-expressing P388D1 cells migrate markedly better on laminin-1 than the α6Bβ1cells (20Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Indeed, this finding has been substantiated by other studies that have linked the α6Aβ1 integrin to cell migration (30Fornaro M. Languino L.R. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Domanico S.Z. Pelletier A.J. Havran W.L. V. Quaranta Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 11: 2253-2265Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For this reason, we examined the possibility that the differential activation of MAP kinase by the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1integrins is linked to the ability of these integrins to mediate cell migration on laminin-1. For this purpose, migration assays were performed in the presence of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. This inhibitor blocked the α6Aβ1-induced phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 4 A) but had no effect on S6K activation (data not shown). The α6Aβ1-expressing cells were approximately 2.5-fold more migratory on laminin-1 than the α6Bβ1 cells (Fig. 4 B) consistent with our previous results (20Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PD98059 inhibited the migration of α6Aβ1 cells by 60% at a concentration range of 12.5–25 μm. The slower migration of the α6Bβ1-expressing cells was also inhibited slightly by PD98059, suggesting that the haptotactic migration of these cells is dependent on MAP kinase and that the differential activation of MAP kinase by the α6Aβ1 and α6Bβ1 integrins regulates this migration. The enhanced ability of the α6Aβ1-expressing cells to migrate on laminin-1 was not observed on other matrix proteins (20Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) indicating that a specific, ligand-dependent activation of MAP kinase is required. These results are interesting in view of the recent report that MAP kinase can regulate cell migration by its ability to phosphorylate myosin light chain kinase (5Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. Delanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). For this reason, it will be informative to determine if the α6Aβ1and α6Bβ1 integrins differ in their ability to induce the phosphorylation of this kinase. In summary, our data demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain sequence of the α6 integrin subunit regulates the ability of the α6β1 integrin to activate MAP kinase. This finding highlights the importance of integrin α subunits in regulating downstream signaling events. Moreover, our finding that differential MAP kinase activation by the α6β1 integrin isoforms is linked to the ability of P388D1 cells to migrate on laminin-1 could have widespread functional implications because the preferential expression of the α6Aβ1 over the α6Bβ1 integrin has been associated with cell migration in several systems (20Shaw L.M.

In this report, we describe the effect of a PGHS2 Y355F mutation on the dynamics of PGHS2 catalysis and inhibition. Tyr355 is part of a hydrogen-bonding network located at the entrance to the cyclooxygenase active site. The Y355F mutant exhibited allosteric activation kinetics in the presence of arachidonic acid that was defined by a curved Eadie-Scatchard plot and a Hill coefficient of 1.36 ± 0.05. Arachidonic acid-induced allosteric activation has not been directly observed with wild type PGHS2. The mutation also decreased the observed time-dependent inhibition by indomethacin, flurbiprofen, RS-57067, and SC-57666. Detailed kinetic analysis showed that the Y355F mutation decreased the transition state energy associated with slow-binding inhibition (EI‡) relative to the energy associated with catalysis (ES‡) by 1.33, 0.67, and 1.06 kcal/mol, respectively, for indomethacin, flurbiprofen, and RS-57067. These observations show Tyr355 to be involved in the molecular mechanism of time-dependent inhibition. We interpret these results to indicate that slow binding inhibitors and the Y355F mutant slow the rate and unmask intrinsic, dynamic events associated with product formation. We hypothesize that the dynamic events are the equilibrium between relaxed and tightened organizations of the hydrogen-bonding network at the entrance to the cyclooxygenase active site.

The inhibitors bind in a long channel whose entrance is flanked by three residues capable of creating a hydrogen-bonding network, Arg120, 2PGHS1 numbering is used. 2PGHS1 numbering is used.Glu524, and Tyr355. Arg120 is required for binding the carboxylic acid moiety of fatty acid substrates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (12Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Falgueyret J.-P. Vickers P.J. O'Neill G.P. J.

Tyr355 is proposed to be a determinant of specificity in the 2-phenylproprionic class of inhibitors; inhibition of the PGHS1 phenylalanine mutant by ibuprofen produced a change in the stereochemical specificity but not potency (13Bhattacharyya D.K.

The channel ends at residue Tyr385, a residue required for cyclooxygenase catalytic activity (14Shimokawa T. Kuylmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

The channel is bordered by Ser530, the site of aspirin acetylation and a side pocket that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can occupy in PGHS2 but not PGHS1. This pocket is the result of a change in PGHS1I523 to PGHS2V523 and PGHS1H513 to PGHS2R513 and is important for the specificity of some PGHS2-selective inhibitors (15Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13139-19134Google Scholar). Dynamics have been shown to play critical roles in the mechanism and inhibition of PGHSs. Many inhibitors of both PGHS isoforms are time-dependent (18Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19Kulmacz R.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Selective PGHS2 inhibition in many cases is correlated with the time-dependent inhibition of PGHS2 and a lack of time-dependent PGHS1 inhibition (20Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Dewitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar,21Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A loss of PGHS1 binding affinity coinciding with conformational changes induced by the allosteric activation of PGHS1 also results in an increase in PGHS2 selectivity (22Swinney D.C. Mak A.Y. Barnett J. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Additionally, the allosteric regulation is proposed to contribute to regulation and selectivity of prostaglandin formation (22Swinney D.C. Mak A.Y. Barnett J. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The factors that relate these dynamic changes to protein structure are unknown. The kinetic mechanism of many time-dependent PGHS inhibitors is reversible slow binding inhibition. The inhibitors bind to form an initial enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI) that is in slow equilibrium with another enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI*) (Scheme 1) (23Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar, 24Callan O.H. So O.-Y. Swinney D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3548-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Intrinsic to this kinetic mechanism are two competing equilibria: an intermolecular equilibrium between the inhibitor and substrate for enzyme and an intramolecular equilibrium between the two enzyme-inhibitor binding complexes. It is the rates of these equilibria relative to the rate of product formation that will determine if these equilibria can be kinetically observed. EP←ES↔E↔KiEI↔k2k−2EI*Scheme 1 We have previously described a method to determine the kinetic constants associated with the reversible slow binding inhibition of PGHS (24Callan O.H. So O.-Y. Swinney D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3548-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The method enabled us to determine the transition state energy between the two enzyme inhibitor complexes, EI and EI*. The transition state energies for indomethacin and flurbiprofen were both approximately 1.4 kcal/mol lower for PGHS1 than PGHS2. We have used this methodology to evaluate the influence of structure on the functional dynamics of PGHS2 inhibition. The dynamics associated with inhibition by flurbiprofen, indomethacin, RS-57067, and SC-57666 and the kinetics associated with allosteric activation by arachidonic acid were evaluated with the PGHS2 Y355F mutant. The time-dependent inhibition and allosteric activation are shown to involve the phenolic group of Tyr355. These dynamics are postulated to be kinetically detectable due to the unmasking of an equilibrium between a relaxed and tightened organization of the hydrogen-bonding network located at the entrance to the cyclooxygenase binding pocket. [3H]Arachidonic acid, [3H]anadamide, and [3H]prostaglandin E2 were purchased from NEN Life Science Products; unlabeled arachidonic acid was from Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN); and unlabeled anadamide, indomethacin, and flurbiprofen were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). RS-57067 and SC-57666 were synthesized at Roche Bioscience. Hemin and tyloxapol were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest grade available. Prostaglandin formation was determined in reactions that contained [3H]arachidonic acid (50 nm to 20 μm; 0.5 μCi) or [3H]anadamide, tyloxapol (0.05%), phenol (1.2 mm), hemin (0.6 μm), and potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 8.0) in a total volume of 0.1 ml unless otherwise stated. All reactions were incubated at 30 °C. The reactions containing arachidonic acid were incubated for 30 s (3 min for anadamide) and stopped with 0.4 ml of ice-cold ethanol and placed on ice. After approximately 30 min on ice, the reactions were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 0.2 ml of 50:50:1 water/methanol/acetic acid, and 0.1 ml was injected onto the HPLC for analysis. The substrate solution was prepared by combining unlabeled arachidonic acid in ethanol, [3H]arachidonic acid in ethanol, and 10 μl of a 0.5% solution of tyloxapol in acetone and evaporating to dryness. This was reconstituted in 0.05 ml of water. The reactions were initiated by adding the detergent-solubilized substrate solution to the enzyme mix containing buffer, phenol, and hemin, which had been preincubated at room temperature for 1–5 min. Oxygen consumption was measured with a YSI model 5300 Biological Oxygen Monitor equipped with a Clark-type micro oxygen electrode. Data was collected and transformed using an external connection to a SLM-Aminco DW2000 data system. Enzyme (20–50 nm) was mixed with hemin (0.8 μm) and phenol (2 mm) to establish a base line. The reaction was initiated with arachidonic acid (200 μm) after preincubation with either inhibitor or vehicle. Arachidonic acid was added in tyloxapol; the final concentration of tyloxapol was not greater than 0.08%. The maximum velocity was determined from a first derivative transformation of the reaction profile. The system was calibrated using the catalase-dependent oxidation of hydrogen peroxide. The products of arachidonic acid and anadamide oxidation were separated by reverse phase HPLC using a 25-cm, 5 μ, Jones Chromatography apex octadecyl column and detected using a Packard Flo-one A-500 radioflow detector with a scintillant mixture:HPLC eluant ratio of 3:1. The strong component of the mobile phase was 0.1% acetic acid/ammonium hydroxide buffer (pH 6.1), and the eluting solvent was methanol. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The following elution profile was used: 0–5 min 20% methanol; 6–15 min −7 convex gradient to 60% methanol; 16–20 min 60% methanol; 21–30 min −7 convex gradient to 80% methanol; 31–35 min 80% methanol; 36–45 min 100% methanol. The prostaglandins eluted around 25 min, arachidonic acid at 44 min, anadamide-derived prostaglandins at 22 min, and anadamide at 38 min (25Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A mathematical model was developed, resulting in a final three-parameter equation describing the initial maximum velocity of the enzyme-substrate reaction as a function of the enzyme-inhibitor preincubation time (24Callan O.H. So O.-Y. Swinney D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3548-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Time-velocity curves were obtained for various inhibitor concentrations, and the three parameters and their asymptotic standard errors were estimated by simultaneously fitting the time-velocity curves for all inhibitor concentrations to the final equation. The Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm in an adaptation of the software package PCNONLIN was used to estimate the parameters, ƒ(T)=100Q1+kappkapp+k−2(e−(kapp+k−2)T−1)Equation 1 where Q=(Km/S)+1(Km/S)(1+(I/Ki))+1Equation 2 and kapp=k21+(Ki/I)Equation 3 where T is the preincubation time,Ki the binding constant associated withEI formation, k2 the forward isomerization rate, and k−2 the reverse isomerization rate. The baculovirus plasmid vector pSyn XIV VI+ X3 containing the human PGHS2 gene, named pPGHS-2 (26Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B. Tsing S. Bach C. Freire J. Chan H. Sigal E. Ramesha C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) was mutagenized following the USE protocol (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The selecting primer 3909 (5′-TTTCACACCGGATATCGTGCACTCTCAG-3′) mutates a unique NdeI site into EcoRV. The mutagenic primer, 5′-GTGCAACACTTAAGTGGCT(T/C)TCACTTCA-3′ (changed nucleotides in boldface type), was synthesized containing restriction endonuclease sites useful for selecting the desired mutants. pPGHS-2 (25 fmol) was heat-denatured in the presence of 25 pmol of primer 3909 and the phosphorylated mutagenic primers. Following an annealing step, the mutant DNA strand was synthesized by incubating for 1 h at 37 °C with a reaction mix containing dNTPs, ATP, T4 ligase, T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 gene 32 protein. The final mutagenesis reactions were digested in a 50-μl reaction with 5–10 units of NdeI to linearize wild type homoduplex DNA. Ten μl of digest were used to transform 40 μl of competent BMH71–18mutS Escherichia coli cells (a repair-defective strain; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Transformants were incubated in 3 ml of growth medium with 100 μg of ampicillin/ml at 37 °C, overnight. Plasmid DNAs were miniprepped and digested again with NdeI, prior to transformation of competent DH5α E. coli cells (from Life Technologies, Inc.). These transformations were plated on LB agar with ampicillin to obtain single colonies. Plasmid DNAs from a handful of colonies were miniprepped and screened for the selecting restriction site. Sequencing of the mutagenized target region (using a Sequenase DNA sequencing kit from U.S. Biochemical Corp.) confirmed the presence of the desired codon change. Transfection of Sf9 insect cells with the mutated, transplacement vector was carried out as described previously (27Sloane D.L. So O.-Y. Leung R. Scarafia L.E. Saldou N. Jarnagin K. Swinney D.C. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Individual baculovirus isolates, selected by assaying cyclooxygenase or peroxidase activity, underwent three rounds of amplification for scale-up production of human PGHS2 Y355F. Mutated PGHS2 was purified from Sf9 insect cells by a modification of the procedure of Barnett and co-workers (26Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B. Tsing S. Bach C. Freire J. Chan H. Sigal E. Ramesha C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1 mm diethylthiocarbamate (from Sigma) and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was added to a lectin column in which the mobile phase contained 0.1% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside instead of octyl glucoside. Fractions containing PGHS2 from the anion exchange HPLC columns and the lentil lectin-Sepharose 4B columns were identified by the N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine coupled peroxidase assay (28Kulmacz R.J. Prostaglandins. 1987; 34: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Final protein samples were essentially single bands as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Enzyme concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 411 nm using an extinction coefficient of 123 mm−1 cm−1 (29Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6358-6363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Gibbs free energies used to create the reaction coordinates were determined as follows: the free energy of the unbound enzyme was normalized to zero; the energy of EI was determined from the equation, ΔGEI=−RTlnKIEquation 4 where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature; and the activation energy for the transition state between EI and EI* was calculated from the Eyring equation, ΔG=RT(ln kT/h−lnk2)Equation 5 where h is Plank's constant and k is the Boltzman constant. The activation energy forES‡ was determined from kcat/Km, which represents the change in free energy between the transition state complex (ES‡) and the free enzyme and substrate (E + S). ΔGES‡=−RTln(kcat/Km)Equation 6 The free energy of ES was calculated by subtracting the free energy associated with kcat, determined by the Eyring equation, from the free energy associated withES‡. The activation energies between free enzyme and EI and ES were assumed to be small relative to those associated with ES‡ and EI‡. The apparentKm and kcat values associated with prostaglandin formation from arachidonic acid and its ethanolamide analog, anadamide (25Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), catalyzed by purified recombinant human PGHS2 and the site-directed mutant PGHS2 Y355F are shown in Table I. The fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menton equation showed the Y355F mutation to decrease the kcat associated with arachidonic acid oxidation by 2-fold, without a large effect on the apparentKm. Anadamide oxidation by the wild type enzyme showed a 6-fold increase in apparent Km and a 3-fold decrease in kcat as compare with arachidonic acid. The Y355F mutation decreased the apparent Km associated with anadamide 2-fold relative to wild type.Table IThe kinetic constants associated with the oxidation of arachidonic acid and anadamide by PGHS2 and PGHS2 Y355FSubstrateEnzymeKmkcatkcat/KmmutΔΔG ‡TRΔΔG ‡Tμms−1AAPGHS210.0 ± 1.113.0 ± 0.681.3e 6Y355F7.76 ± 0.586.06 ± 0.160.79e 6−0.30AnadamidePGHS261.6 ± 11.34.0 ± 0.386.5e 4−1.80Y355F36.1 ± 3.52.49 ± 0.156.9e 40.04−1.47 Open table in a new tab A more complete evaluation of the data showed a curved Eadie-Scatchard plot for oxidation of arachidonic acid by the Y355F mutant (Fig. 2). The data was replotted to the Hill equation (Fig. 2). The Hill plot appeared to be biphasic, with cooperativity observed below 0.5 μm arachidonic acid (n = 1.36 ± 0.05, r 2 = 0.994). No cooperativity was observed above 0.5 μmarachidonic acid (n = 1.01 ± 0.03,r 2 = 0.994). Fitting the Hill equation to the entire data set (n = 1.10 ± 0.03,r 2 = 0.996) resulted in a nonrandom distribution of the residuals as compared with the biphasic fit (Fig. 2, upper left panel). These results are consistent with positive cooperative activation of PGHS2 Y355F by arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid has been directly observed to induce allosteric activation of PGHS1, not PGHS2. However, fluorescent quenching experiments indirectly indicated that PGHS2 was activated at very low arachidonic acid concentrations (22Swinney D.C. Mak A.Y. Barnett J. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the Y355F mutant is less responsive to the arachidonic acid-induced activation than the wild type enzyme. No direct evidence for allosteric activation was observed with the Y355F mutant using anadamide as substrate or with any of the other PGHS2 site-directed mutants that we have investigated (R120Q, R513H, E524Q, V523I, and the double mutant R513H/V523I) (data not shown). Changes in transition state energy (ΔΔG ‡T) due to changes in an R group or a mutation can be calculated from Equation 7 (30Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). ΔΔG ‡T represents the change in free energy required to reach the transition state complex (ES‡) from free enzyme and substrate (E + S). ΔΔGT‡=−RT ln[(kcat/Km)mut/(kcat/Km)wt]Equation 7 The Y355F mutation decreased the transition state energy for prostaglandin formation from arachidonic acid by 0.3 kcal/mol; no change was observed with anadamide. This suggests that the phenolic group of the Tyr355 does not contribute to the rate-limiting step in catalysis. The change of the carboxylic acid (arachidonic acid) to the ethanolamide (anadamide) results in a 1.80 and 1.47 kcal/mol decrease in the respective transition state energies for wild type and mutant. The carboxylic acid to ethanolamide modification slows the rate-limiting step in catalysis independent of Tyr355. We investigated the impact of the PGHS2 Y355F mutation on time-dependent inhibition with four time-dependent cyclooxygenase inhibitors (Fig. 3); the inhibitors were incubated for various times prior to the addition of 200 μm arachidonic acid. The maximum initial velocities were determined from the first derivative of the oxygen consumption profile. It is important to realize that the extent of inhibition observed under these experimental conditions represents only the amount of enzyme sequestered in the EI* complex. All enzyme complexes that are in rapid equilibrium with free enzyme should react with the supersaturating concentrations of substrate (24Callan O.H. So O.-Y. Swinney D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3548-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 3The maximum inhibition will saturate as the inhibitor concentration is increased (24Callan O.H. So O.-Y. Swinney D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3548-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). At saturation, the relative equilibrium between EI and EI* can be determined graphically by comparing the fraction of enzyme that is inhibited (EI*) and to the fraction that is uninhibited (EI). The graphical results are essentially identical to the values obtained mathematically. The observation of saturable inhibition using this experimental protocol is the strongest evidence for the proposed kinetic mechanism and emphasizes the importance of an equilibrium between EI and EI* that is independent of inhibitor concentration. Visual inspection of the inhibition profiles shows that the inhibitors achieve maximal inhibition much more rapidly with the PGHS2 Y355F mutant (only the indomethacin data is shown; Fig. 4).Figure 4The PGHS2 Y355F mutation decreases the time to steady state for time-dependent inhibition of PGHS2 by indomethacin. PGHS2 (▪) and PGHS2Y355F (•) were incubated with 2.5 μm indomethacin, and rates were determined using the oxygen consumption assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The impact of the Y355F mutation on the kinetic parameters associated with slow binding inhibition by flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and RS-57067 is shown in Table II. The carboxylic acids, flurbiprofen and indomethacin, form the EI complex with a similar affinity for both enzymes (similarKi) but rearranged more rapidly to the EI* complex with PGHS2 Y355F (increase in k2) (Table II). The mutation increases the rate of equilibration between EI and EI* without increasing the apparent binding affinity. RS-57067, a non-carboxylic acid inhibitor, bound tighter to EI with PGHS2 Y355F. The reverse isomerization rate from EI* increased 3-fold with PGHS2 Y355F, while the forward rate did not change.Table IIKinetic constants associated with inhibition of PGHS2 and PGHS2 Y355F by indomethacin, flurbiprofen, and RS-57067PGHS2PGHS2Y355FIndomethacin k20.034 ± 0.0040.23 ± 0.039 k−20.0031 ± 0.000330.0041 ± 0.001 Ki11.2 ± 2.05.1 ± 1.2 %EI*91.6%98.2%Flurbiprofen k20.105 ± 0.0080.603 ± 0.186 k−20.0082 ± 0.00080.027 ± 0.009 Ki0.61 ± 0.0750.70 ± 0.25 %EI*92.7%86.4%RS-57067 k20.21 ± 0.090.24 ± 0.06 k−20.083 ± 0.0330.20 ± 0.054 Ki16.9 ± 14.72.0 ± 0.35 %EI*70%55% Open table in a new tab In order for the Y355F mutation to influence the isomerization betweenEI and EI*, it must lower the transition state between the two forms of the inhibitor-bound enzyme (EI‡). The extent of the mutation's effect on the transition state is not directly evident from the magnitude of the individual rate constants; therefore, we constructed free energy profiles to evaluate the effect of the mutation on the transition state energies. (The reaction coordinate for indomethacin is shown in Fig. 5.) Calculation of the influence of the Y355F mutation on binding free energies (ΔG) is shown in Tables III andIV. Indomethacin and flurbiprofen binding to PGHS2 Y355F had minimal effect on the free energy associated with the initial enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI); however, the change lowered the energy associated with the EI toEI* transition state by 1.63 and 0.97 kcal/mol, respectively (Table III, Fig. 5). The ground state energy associated withEI* was stabilized by 0.25 kcal/mol for flurbiprofen and 1.46 kcal/mol for indomethacin. RS-57067 binding to PGHS2 Tyr355 was stabilized by 1.29 and 0.83 kcal/mol in EI and EI*, respectively, and the transition state energy was lowered by 1.36 kcal/mol. The mutation decreased the entire RS-57067 reaction coordinate by the approximately 1 kcal/mol.Table IIIGibbs free energy (ΔG) associated with the EI to EI* transition of indomethacin, flurbiprofen, and RS-57067 for PGHS2 and PGHS2 Y355FEnzymeΔGEIΔGEI‡ΔGEI*ΔGEI− ΔGEI*kcal/molIndomethacin PGHS2−6.8712.92−8.311.44 Y355F−7.3411.29−9.772.43ΔΔG−0.47−1.63−1.460.99Flurbiprofen PGHS2−8.6210.49−10.161.54 Y355F−8.549.52−10.411.87ΔΔG−0.08−0.97−0.250.33RS-57067 PGHS2−6.6212.07−7.180.56 Y355F−7.9010.71−8.010.11ΔΔG−1.29−1.36−0.83−0.45 Open table in a new tab Table IVDifferences in the activation free energy between product formation (ES‡) and slow binding inhibition (EI‡) for wild type PGHS2 and PGHS2 Y355FInhibitorEnzymeΔGkcat(ES‡)ΔGk2(EI‡)ΔΔGk2−kcatΔGYFKcal/molIndomethacinPGHS28.4812.924.44Y355F8.1811.293.111.33FlurbiprofenPGHS28.4810.492.01Y355F8.189.521.340.67RS-57067PGHS28.4812.073.59Y355F8.1810.712.531.06 Open table in a new tab The mutation increased the rate at which the inhibitors approached the EI/EI* equilibrium by increasing the forward rate for indomethacin, both the forward and reverse rates for flurbiprofen, and the reverse rates for RS-57067. Slow binding kinetic behavior is proposed to occur whenk2 is slower than kcat(31Rich D.H. Northrop D.B. Perun T.J. Propst C.L. Computer-aided Drug Design. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 185-250Google Scholar). The k2 values determined for inhibition of PGHS2 by flurbiprofen (0.105 s−1), indomethacin (0.034 s−1), and RS-57067 (0.21 s−1) compared with the kcat reported for PGHS2 (13 s−1) are consistent with this proposal. The data in Table IV show quantitatively the reason for the observed decrease in the time-dependent inhibition associated with the Y355F mutant and also provide a thermodynamic explanation for the kinetics of slow binding inhibition. The Y355F mutation decreases the relative difference between the EI‡/ES‡ transition state energies by 1.33, 0.67, and 1.06 kcal/mol for indomethacin, flurbiprofen, and RS-57067, respectively (Table IV). It is important to distinguish between the equilibrium rate of EI and EI* and the observation of slow binding inhibition. The observation of slow binding inhibition occurs when the equilibrium rate is similar or slower than the rate of catalysis. The equilibrium can occur in the absence of observable slow binding inhibition if it is more rapid than the rate of catalysis. SC-57666 is a selective, time-dependent reversible PGHS2 inhibitor (32Reitz D.B. Li J.J. Norton M.B. Reinhard E.J. Collins J.T. Anderson G.D. Gregory S.A. Kodolt C.M. Perkins W.E. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 3878-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Compounds of this class have been proposed to induce inactivation of PGHS2 (21Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Preincubation of wild type PGHS2 with SC-57666 resulted in incomplete consumption of oxygen as compared with control (Fig. 6, top). We have interpreted incomplete oxygen consumption to correlate with the inactivation of PGHS2 or extremely slow dissociation from PGHS2. Incubation of SC-57666 with PGHS2 Y355F only slightly delays the total oxygen consumption (Fig. 6, bottom). These results suggest that SC-57666 binding to PGHS2 Y355F is rapidly reversible. This is a dramatic contrast to the extremely slow dissociation observed with wild type PGHS2. This work describes the effect of the Y355F mutation on the relative equilibria that comprise the slow binding inhibition of prostaglandin formation by PGHS2. The slow binding inhibition is the result of an intramolecular equilibrium between two kinetic states,EI and EI*, that competes with the rate of prostaglandin formation. The results show that increasing the rate of equilibration between EI and EI* relative to the rate of product formation decreases the likelihood of observing the slow binding inhibition. The overall impact of the Y355F mutation on the competition between prostaglandin formation and slow binding inhibition is to decrease the time it takes to establish the EI/EI* equilibrium. These results suggest a role for Tyr355 in the molecular mechanism of time-dependent inhibition of PGHSs. This work also describes the effect of the Y355F mutation on the equilibrium between the allosterically activated and unactivated enzyme forms. We directly observed arachidonic acid to induce the allosteric kinetics associated with the PGHS2 Y355F mutant (Fig. 2). As we noted earlier, allosteric activation by arachidonic acid has been directly observed with PGHS1, not PGHS2. However, fluorescent quenching experiments indirectly indicate that PGHS2 is activated at very low arachidonic acid concentrations (22Swinney D.C. Mak A.Y. Barnett J. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One explanation for these results is that the Y355F mutation slows the rate of activation by arachidonic acid, thereby allowing it to be kinetically detectable. These results suggest a role for Tyr355 in the molecular mechanism of allosteric activation. To observe a kinetic event, it must be partially rate-limiting. A practice used to delineate mechanisms of catalysis is to employ substrate analogs and isotopes to decrease the rates of reaction. In some instances, this will expose or unmask previously undetectable kinetic steps. We propose that the observations of slow binding inhibition and allosteric activation associated with the PGHS2 Y355F mutant are kinetically detectable because they unmask kinetic steps intrinsic to the activation and binding of arachidonic acid to PGHSs. Tyr355 can potentially participate in the time-dependent inhibition and allosteric activation through its interactions with the substrate, the inhibitor, and/or the hydrogen bonding network. The structures of PGHS2 show at least two possible hydrogen bonding conformations near the entrance to the cyclooxygenase binding pocket: one consisting of Arg120, Glu524, and Tyr355 and another consisting of Arg513, Glu524, and Tyr355. We propose that it is the equilibrium between these two hydrogen bonding arrangements that is responsible for the allosteric activation and that the disruption of this equilibrium contributes to the slow binding inhibition. We envision a mechanism whereby the hydrogen bonding network at the entrance to the cyclooxygenase site is relaxed in the activated enzyme and tightened in the unactivated and inhibitor bound forms (Fig. 7). The Arg513/Glu524/Tyr355 hydrogen bonding network may predominate in the relaxed form, leaving Arg120 to freely interact with substrate, whereas in the tightened conformation the Arg120/Glu524/Tyr355 hydrogen bonding network locks the substrate into a catalytically competent conformation (Fig. 7). For PGHS2, the rates of these transitions are normally too rapid relative to catalysis to be observed; however, inhibitors or mutations that interact with the reorganization of the hydrogen bonding network will slow the reorganization rates relative to catalysis and make the reorganization of the hydrogen bonding network partially rate-limiting. This hypothesis is consistent with the proposal by Browner and co-workers (10Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). They suggested from analysis of the structural data that it is the ability of the channel to move between open and closed conformations that allows both substrates and inhibitors to reach the internal binding site. Anadamide is the ethanolamide derivative of arachidonic acid. Anadamide was recently shown to be selectively metabolized by PGHS2 to a novel class of prostaglandins (25Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We did not observe allosteric activation using anadamide as substrate with either wild type PGHS2 or the Y355F mutant. The free energy required for catalysis is increased by greater than 1.4 kcal/mol for anadamide relative to arachidonic acid for both the wild type and PGHS2 Y355F. The slower rate of catalysis for anadamide relative to arachidonic acid may mask the allosteric activation. Consistent with this proposal is the observed decrease in the time-dependent inhibition of PGHS2 when anadamide is used as substrate. 4Dr. C. Ramesha, personal communication. We conclude that the slower rate of anadamide oxidation relative to arachidonic acid masks the intrinsic equilibria associated with the allosteric activation and time-dependent inhibition. In summary, we have used the tools of site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis to pinpoint an involvement of the phenolic group of Tyr355 in time-dependent inhibition and allosteric activation of PGHS2. We propose that these dynamic events unmask intrinsic changes associated with an equilibrium between relaxed and tightened forms of the hydrogen bonding network at the entrance to the cyclooxygenase binding site. The position of the equilibrium between the relaxed and tightened forms will control substrate binding and ultimately the rate of prostaglandin formation.

https://openalex.org/W2084408475,"Previous studies have shown that Src is required for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent cell cycle progression in fibroblasts. Since fibroblasts usually express both PDGF receptors (PDGFRs), these findings suggested that Src was mandatory for signal relay by both the α and βPDGFRs. In this study, we have focused on the role of Src in signal relay by the αPDGFR. In response to stimulation with PDGF-AA, which selectively engages the αPDGFR, Src family members (Src) associated with the αPDGFR and Src kinase were activated. A mutant receptor, in which tyrosines 572 and 574 were replaced with phenylalanine (F72/74), failed to efficiently associate with Src or activate Src. The wild type (WT) and F72/74 receptors induced the expression of c-myc and c-fos to comparable levels. Furthermore, an equivalent extent of PDGF-dependent soft agar growth was observed in cells expressing the WT or the F72/74 αPDGFR. Comparing the ability of these two receptors to initiate tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules indicated that both receptors mediated phosphorylation of the receptor itself, phospholipase Cγ 1, and SHP-2 to similar levels. In contrast, the F72/74 receptor triggered phosphorylation of Shc to 1 and 20% of the WT levels for the 55- and 46-kDa Shc isoforms, respectively. These findings indicate that after exposure of cells to PDGF-AA, Src stably associates with the αPDGFR, and Src activity is increased. Furthermore, Src is required for the PDGF-dependent phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as Shc. Finally, activation of Src during the G0/G1 transition does not appear to be required for latter cell cycle events such as induction of c-myc or cell proliferation.

All possible isoforms exist and are biologically active. Like the ligand, the receptor is also a dimer that can exist as a homo or hetero combination of the α and β subunits of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Exposure of cells to PDGF assembles the monomeric receptor subunits into dimers, in which each of the subunits binds one of the chains of the dimeric ligand. The PDGFR subunits differ in their ability to bind to the two PDGF chains. The β subunit binds only the B chain with high affinity, whereas the α subunit binds both PDGF chains. Consequently, the PDGF isoform will determine the subunit composition of the PDGFR. PDGF-AA assembles only αα homodimers, PDGF-AB induces αα and αβ dimers, and PDGF-BB, the universal ligand, leads to formation of all possible PDGFR subunit dimers (1Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we will focus on the αPDGFR, which is activated by all forms of PDGF and can be selectively activated with PDGF-AA. Once the PDGFR has been activated, it triggers a number of signaling cascades. Comparison of the signal relay pathways engaged by the α and βPDGFRs demonstrates that although there are many similarities, there are also a number of differences. For instance, the SH2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, binds to the kinase insert of the αPDGFR (2Bazenet C.E. Gelderloos J.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6926-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but to the tail of the βPDGFR (3Kazlauskas A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although both of the receptors recruit and associate with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), and SHP-2, only the βPDGFR stably associates with GTPase-activating protein of Ras (RasGap) (4Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 517-525PubMed Google Scholar, 5Heidaran M.A. Beeler J.F. Yu J.-C. Ishibashi T. LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9287-9295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In regard to which of these signaling molecules are required for sending a biological signal, reports to date have shown that the βPDGFR initiates multiple signal relay cascades and that at least some of the receptor-associated proteins are required for PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis (6Roche S. McGlade J. Jones M. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4940-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In contrast, preventing the αPDGFR from individually associating with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PLCγ, or SHP-2 does not severely impair the mitogenic signal of the receptor (2Bazenet C.E. Gelderloos J.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6926-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Eriksson A. Nanberg E. Ronnstrand L. Engstrom U. Hellman U. Rupp E. Carpenter G. Heldin C.H.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, which if any of these recruited signaling molecules is required for mitogenic signal relay from the αPDGFR remains an open question. A number of groups have investigated the role of Src in PDGF-dependent signal relay. The initial observations were that Src activity increased in a PDGF-stimulated cell (11Gould K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Ralston R. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7845-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that all three Src family members that are expressed in a fibroblast are activated in response to PDGF and associate with the βPDGFR (13Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Binding of Src family members to the βPDGFR requires the presence of two tyrosine phosphorylation sites (579 and 581) in the βPDGFR juxtamembrane domain (14Mori S. Rönnstrand L. Yokote K. Engström A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The binding of Src to the receptor is dependent on the Src SH2 domains, and these events are thought to contribute to activation of Src in a PDGF-stimulated cell (14Mori S. Rönnstrand L. Yokote K. Engström A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 15Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol.

Recent studies have defined two Src-dependent stages in the cell cycle, mid/late G1, as well as G2/M. PDGF-BB-dependent entry into the S phase of the cell cycle was largely eliminated by microinjection of NIH 3T3 cells with either dominant negative forms of Src and Fyn or a neutralizing antibody that inhibits the activity of Src, Fyn, and Yes (17Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Progression to the S phase of the cell cycle could be blocked by microinjecting the reagents at the time of PDGF stimulation or even up to 6 h after stimulating with PDGF (17Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of c-myc, but not fos or jun, rescued the block induced by dominant negative Src (18Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), leading to the idea that Src contributes to PDGF mitogenic signaling by increasing c-myc expression. The observations that Src is activated during mitosis (19Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 20Morgan D.O. Kaplan J.M.

Cell. 1989; 57: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) suggested that Src is performing an important function during this stage of the cell cycle as well. Indeed, Rocheet al. (22Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the activity of Src family kinases is essential for the G2 to M transition. Thus Src kinase activity is required at mid G1 and at the G2/M transition in order for PDGF-stimulated cells to traverse the cell cycle. PDGF-dependent signaling is not unique in its requirement for the activity of Src kinases. A number of other signaling pathways, including those initiated by B and T cell receptors, cytokine receptors, integrins, as well as the receptors for epidermal growth factor and colony stimulating factor-1 also involve Src family members (reviewed in Ref. 23Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Thus, Src appears to be a key member of signal relay pathways in a variety of signaling systems, and it is important to precisely define what events Src is regulating. Although Src is activated at both the G0/G1transition and at the G2/M transition, the relative importance of Src activation at the early point in the cell cycle has not been thoroughly investigated. In addition, the role of Src in signaling by the αPDGFR has not been addressed directly. In this study, our goal was to assess the importance of the initial increase in Src activity for signal relay by the αPDGFR. Our approach was to generate a receptor mutant that was unable to activate Src and then to compare the ability of the WT and mutant receptors to mediate signal transduction events and drive cell proliferation. In our system, the Src family members were not manipulated and were presumably available to execute necessary functions at latter stages in the cell cycle. We found that the wild type αPDGFR activated Src and that a mutant receptor that did not initiate this event also failed to mediate efficient phosphorylation of a small subset of signaling molecules that included Shc. In contrast, activation of Src at the G0/G1 transition did not appear to be required for induction of c-myc or for cell proliferation. The mouse embryo 3T3 Patch B (PhB) cell line was derived from Ph/Ph mouse embryos and was kindly provided by Dr. Dan Bowen-Pope (24Seifert R.A. van Koppen A. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4473-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PhB cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum. The human WT and F72/74 αPDGFR constructs were subcloned into the pLNCX2 retroviral vector, which is a modification of the pLNCX vector (25Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) in that the polylinker of pLNCX2 contains the following unique restriction sites: HindIII,NotI, HpaI, SalI, BglII,ClaI. The αPDGFR constructs in the retroviral vector were transfected into GP+E cells, and the viral supernatant from these cells was used to infect GP+E/Am12 cells (generous gift of Dr. Arthur Banks). Virus from mass populations of G418-resistant GP+E/AM12 cells was used to infect PhB cells, and the infected Ph cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. Mass populations of drug-resistant PhB cells were sorted by FACS to obtain populations of WT and F72/74 PhB cells expressing equal levels of receptor. The sorted populations were used for all of the experiments. The 1.7-kilobase pairPstI-BamHI fragment of the human αPDGFR was subcloned into the pBS+ plasmid, and the resulting construct was called 19E. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using the Amersham oligonucleotide-directed in vitromutagenesis kit. To introduce the phenylalanine changes at Tyr-572 and Tyr-574, the following oligonucleotide, which introduced anEcoRI site without changing the amino acid sequence, was used: 5′-GTCCACAAAAATGAATTCATGTCC3-′. Mutants were initially identified by restriction enzyme digestion using EcoRI and then verified by sequencing. The PstI-BamHI fragment of 19E was then subcloned into 18F, which is a 3.5-kilobase pairNotI-BamHI insert subcloned into pBluescript SKII+ and includes the entire αPDGFR cDNA (2Bazenet C.E. Gelderloos J.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6926-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the NotI-BamHI fragment from 18F was subcloned into the NotI-BamHI-digested pLNCX2 retroviral vector. The αPDGFR antibodies were crude rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein including either the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 951–1089; 27P) or a portion of the first immunoglobulin domain (amino acids 52–94; 80.8) of the human αPDGFR. The αPDGFR antisera recognize the mouse and human αPDGFR and do not cross-react with the βPDGFR of either species. 2J. A. Gelderloos, S. Rosenkranz, C. Bazenet, and A. Kazlauskas, unpublished observations. The Src-2 antibody used for immunoprecipitation of Src family members was purchased from Santa Cruz and is an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 509–533 of c-Src. This antibody recognizes all three of the Src family members that are expressed in fibroblasts, Src, Yes, and Fyn. The Src antibody used for Western blotting, 327, is a mouse monoclonal that is thought to recognize the SH3 domain of c-Src and v-Src (26Lipsich J.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Oncogene Science Inc.) and was used at a 1:1,000 dilution. The immunoprecipitating anti-phosphotyrosine antibody used in these studies was PY20, a monoclonal antibody purchased from Transduction Labs. For anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis, a combination of PY20 (Transduction Labs) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc,), each at a 1:1,000 dilution, was used. To immunoprecipitate PLCγ, we used a polyclonal antibody, 36.3, which was raised against a glutathioneS-transferase-PLCγ1 fusion protein that included amino acids 550–850 of rat PLCγ1. PLCγ Western blot analysis was performed using a mixture of monoclonal anti-PLCγ1 antibodies (Upstate) at a concentration of 0.25 μg/ml. SHP-2 was immunoprecipitated subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (27Klinghoffer R.A. Duckworth B. Valius M. Cantley L. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Shc was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted (using a dilution of 1:100) with an anti-Shc polyclonal antibody purchased from Upstate. PhB cells expressing the WT or F72/74 αPDGFR were grown to confluence, incubated overnight in DME containing 0.1% CS, and were left resting or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA for 5 min. The cells were washed and lysed in EB (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin), and Src was immunoprecipitated using the Src-2 antibody. Immune complexes were bound to formalin-fixedStaphylococcus aureus membranes, spun through EB + 10% sucrose, washed twice with 1.0 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet-P40, 0.1% SDS, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol), twice with 1.0 ml of PAN (10 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 100 mmNaCl, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) + 0.5% Nonidet P-40, twice with 1.0 ml of PAN, and finally resuspended in PAN and stored at −70 °C. Immunoprecipitates from 3 × 106 cells were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Blotto (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.005% NaN3). The membranes were further incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibody diluted in Blotto (the anti-αPDGFR antibodies were a combination of 80.8 + 27P each at 1:1,000; the anti-Src antibody was the 327 monoclonal diluted 1:1,000). The membranes were then incubated with secondary antibody: a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit diluted 1/2,000 in Blotto. Finally, ECL (Amersham Corp.) was used to develop the Western blot. The αPDGFR, PLCγ, SHP-2, and Shc were immunoprecipitated from resting or PDGF-stimulated cells, as described above, using the appropriate antibodies, except the first set of washes were with EB instead of radioimmune precipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitates representing 1.5 × 106 cells were then subjected to an anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot. Src immunoprecipitates from approximately 1–2 × 104 cells were incubated with 1.6 μg of acid-denatured rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma), 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MnCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 2× sample buffer (10 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, 5.6 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% bromphenol blue). Kinase assays with the PDGFR were performed under identical conditions, except that 0.5 μgs of glutathione S-transferase-PLC was used as the exogenous substrate instead of enolase. After the kinase assay, the samples were incubated for 4 min at 98 °C and spun at 8,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. Six-well tissue culture plates were coated with a layer of DME, 5% CS containing 0.6% Sea-Plaque-agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME). Subconfluent Ph cells expressing the WT or F72/74 αPDGFR were trypsinized, washed in PBS twice, and resuspended in DME 5% CS at 1 × 105 cells/ml. One ml of cells was then added to 1 ml of DME 5% CS containing 0.9% Low melting point agarose and 200 ng/ml PDGF-AA or buffer (10 mm acetic acid, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The cells were plated onto the coated tissue culture plates, allowed to solidify, and then placed in a 37 °C incubator. After 10 days, colonies were visualized with an inverted microscope. Colonies were scored as having 10 or more cells. Each of the conditions were assayed in triplicate. RNA was isolated from the PhB cells after lysis in guanidine isothiocyanate and centrifugation through a CsCl gradient (28Chirgwin J.J. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar). RNA (10 μg) was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and electro-transferred to Nytran (Schleicher and Schuell). RNA was cross-linked to the filter with UV light using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Hybridizations were performed at 45 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC is 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 100 mm sodium phosphate, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% Ficoll, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% SDS, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization, blots were washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS and three times at 45 °C with 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS. 32P-labeled probes were prepared with random primers using the Prime-It II kit (Stratagene) and [α-32P]dCTP. The following cDNAs were used as probes: a 548-base pair HindIII-XbaI fragment of pKS321 containing the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (29Montmayeur J.P. Valius M. Vandenheede J. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32670-32678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a 1.5-kilobase pairEcoRI-PstI fragment of murine c-fos/pGEM3 (30Miller A.D. Curran T. Verma I.M. Cell. 1984; 36: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), a 400-base pair PstI fragment of murine c-myc that includes exon 2. To determine whether Src family members (hereafter collectively referred to as Src) are involved in αPDGFR signaling relay, we tested if Src is activated after engagement of the αPDGFR. Our preliminary experiments (data not shown; see Figs. 2 and 3 below) indicated that αPDGFR is indeed able to activate Src; we next wanted to generate an αPDGFR mutant that failed to stimulate the kinase activity of Src. For the βPDGFR, phosphorylation of tyrosines 579 and 581 in the juxtamembrane domain enables Src to associate with the receptor and also appears to activate the kinase activity of Src (14Mori S. Rönnstrand L. Yokote K. Engström A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Since these two tyrosines, as well as the flanking sequences are identical in the α and βPDGFRs, we reasoned that mutating them in the αPDGFR would generate a mutant αPDGFR that would be unable to activate or bind Src. To test this hypothesis, we mutated tyrosine 572 and 574 to phenylalanine residues, and the resulting receptor was expressed in Ph cells, a fibroblast cell line that expresses the βPDGFR, but not the αPDGFR.Figure 3Mutating tyrosines 572 and 574 reduces PDGF-dependent activation of Src. A, PhB cells expressing either the WT or F72/74 αPDGFR were arrested and then stimulated with PDGF-AA for 5–120 min. Src was immunoprecipitated and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using rabbit muscle enolase as the substrate. Equal amounts of enolase were present in eachlane when the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (not shown). Phosphorylation of enolase was visualized by autoradiography. The numbers represent the cpm of each band as determined by scintillation counting of the Coomassie-stained enolase gel band. Stimulation of the WT receptor-expressing Ph cells with PDGF-AA resulted in a 1.8-, 1.9-, 2.2-, 1.6-, and 1.2-fold activation in Src activity at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively. In contrast, fold activation in the F72/74-expressing Ph cells was 0.97, 1.2, 0.84, 0.85, and 0.66, respectively. B, a portion of the immunoprecipitates used in A were immunoblotted with the 327 anti-Src monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze the expression level of the introduced αPDGFR, lysates were prepared from resting or PDGF-stimulated cells, and the samples were subjected to an anti-αPDGFR Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the WT and F72/74 cells expressed comparable levels of the introduced receptor, which we have previously estimated to be similar to the level of the endogenous βPDGFR (4Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 517-525PubMed Google Scholar). Next we compared the kinase activity of the WT and F72/74 receptors. Ph cells expressing the WT αPDGFR or the F72/74 mutant were arrested by serum deprivation then left resting or exposed to PDGF-AA; finally, the cells were lysed, and αPDGFR was immunoprecipitated. The kinase activity of the resulting immunoprecipitates was compared by testing their ability to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate. When the WT αPDGFR was isolated from PDGF-stimulated cells, it phosphorylated the exogenous substrate 5.9 times more than the WT receptor isolated from resting cells (Fig. 1 B). The kinase activity of the F72/74 αPDGFR was also activated by PDGF, and the extent of activation was comparable to the WT receptor. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates demonstrated that there was a similar amount of receptor present in all of the samples (Fig. 1 C). No differences were observed in the kinase activity of the WT and F72/74 receptors when they were compared using additional exogenous substrates (data not shown). These data indicate that mutation of tyrosines 572 and 574 did not impair the kinase activity of the αPDGFR. We next tested if Src associates with the αPDGFR and whether mutating tyrosines 572 and 574 had any effect on this association. Cells were exposed to buffer or PDGF-AA for 5 min, Src was immunoprecipitated, and the samples were subjected to anti-αPDGFR or anti-Src Western blot analysis. Blotting of the Src immunoprecipitates with an αPDGFR antibody demonstrated that the WT αPDGFR coimmunoprecipitated with Src, provided that the cells had been stimulated with PDGF (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, only trace amounts (approximately 1% of that seen with the WT receptor) of the F72/74 receptor was observed coprecipitating with Src from activated cells. An anti-Src Western blot of these Src immunoprecipitates indicated that equal amounts of Src were present in all of the samples (Fig. 2 B). These data indicated that the αPDGFR does indeed associate with Src, and furthermore, that tyrosine 572 and/or 574 is required for this event. Stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts with PDGF-BB has been shown to increase the kinase activity of Src, Fyn, and Yes by 2–5-fold (13Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Since PDGF-BB activates both α and βPDGFRs, which are expressed in most fibroblasts, these studies did not distinguish the contribution of the two receptors to the Src activation event. Mori et al. (14Mori S. Rönnstrand L. Yokote K. Engström A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that the βPDGFR can activate Src; thus we were interested in learning whether the αPDGFR also activates Src and if so, whether association of Src with the receptor was required for this event. Src was immunoprecipitated from WT and F72/74 αPDGFR expressing PhB cells that were either left resting or stimulated with 35 ng/ml PDGF-AA for 5, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min. The kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated Src was measured in an in vitro kinase assay, using enolase as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 3 A). PDGF-AA stimulation of WT cells for 5 min resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in the in vitro phosphorylation of enolase, which was 1.9-fold after 15 min and peaked at 30 min with a 2.2-fold increase. After 60 min, enolase phosphorylation began to decrease with only a 1.6-fold and 1.2-fold increase observed at 60 and 120 min, respectively. In Src immunoprecipitates from F72/74 cells, enolase phosphorylation did not increase after 5 min and was only slightly increased (1.2-fold) after 15 min of stimulation. After 30 min, enolase phosphorylation decreased below the level seen before PDGF stimulation. Western blotting the Src immunoprecipitates with an anti-Src antibody indicated that comparable amounts of Src were present in all of the samples (Fig. 3 B). These experiments demonstrate that engagement of the αPDGFR leads to activation of Src. Furthermore, the F72/74 receptor, which associates with Src poorly, is unable to efficiently activate Src, suggesting that binding of Src to the αPDGFR is required for maximal PDGF-dependent activation of Src kinase activity. Previous studies have linked PDGF-BB-dependent Src activation in NIH 3T3 cells with induction of c-myc but not fos orjun, (18Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2090904413,"Periaxin was first described as a 147-kDa protein that was suggested to have a potential role in the initiation of myelin deposition in peripheral nerves based upon its abundance, cell type specificity, pattern of developmental expression, and localization (Gillespie, C. S., Sherman, D. L., Blair, G. E., and Brophy. P. J. (1994) Neuron 12, 497–508). Here we show that the murine periaxin gene spans 20.6 kilobases and encodes two mRNAs of 4.6 and 5.2 kilobases that encode two periaxin isoforms, L-periaxin and S-periaxin of 147 and 16 kDa respectively. The larger mRNA is produced by a retained intron mechanism that introduces a stop codon and results in a truncated protein with an intron-encoded C terminus of 21 amino acids. Both proteins possess a PDZ domain at the N terminus; nevertheless, they are targeted differently in Schwann cells. Like other proteins that contain PDZ domains, L-periaxin is localized to the plasma membrane of myelinating Schwann cells: in contrast, S-periaxin is expressed diffusely in the cytoplasm. This suggests that proteins that contain this protein-binding module may also participate in protein-protein interactions at sites other than the cell cortex. Periaxin was first described as a 147-kDa protein that was suggested to have a potential role in the initiation of myelin deposition in peripheral nerves based upon its abundance, cell type specificity, pattern of developmental expression, and localization (Gillespie, C. S., Sherman, D. L., Blair, G. E., and Brophy. P. J. (1994) Neuron 12, 497–508).

This suggests that proteins that contain this protein-binding module may also participate in protein-protein interactions at sites other than the cell cortex. Periaxin was first identified as a relatively abundant 146-kDa protein of myelinating Schwann cells in a screen for novel cytoskeleton-associated proteins with a role in peripheral nerve myelination (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Like P0, the major integral membrane protein of peripheral nervous system myelin, periaxin is detectable at an early stage of peripheral nervous system development (2Scherer S.S. Xu Y.T. Bannerman P.G.C. Sherman D.L. Brophy P.J. Development. 1995; 121: 4265-4273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to P0, periaxin is not incorporated into compact myelin (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but is initially concentrated in the plasma membrane, the abaxonal membrane (apposing the basal lamina), and the adaxonal membrane (apposing the axon). As myelin sheaths mature periaxin becomes concentrated in the abaxonal membrane and plasma membrane (2Scherer S.S. Xu Y.T. Bannerman P.G.C. Sherman D.L. Brophy P.J. Development. 1995; 121: 4265-4273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This shift in the localization of the protein in the Schwann cell after completion of the spiralization phase of axon ensheathment suggests that periaxin may participate in the membrane-protein interactions that are required to stabilize the mature sheath. To shed light on the protein's function, we were particularly interested to determine if modular protein-binding domains might be represented in the periaxin amino acid sequence. Although no such domains were identified from initial data base comparisons (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), here we report that the periaxin gene does encode one of the most interesting of these protein-binding motifs to emerge over recent years, namely the PDZ domain. The PDZ domain was named after the three proteins in which it was first identified, namely post-synaptic density protein P SD-95, Drosophila d iscs large (dlg) tumor suppressor gene, and the tight junction-associated protein Z O-1 (3Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). It consists of an approximately 90-amino acid protein-binding motif found in proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of plasma membrane proteins and with the cortical cytoskeleton (4Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Although the binding site for some PDZ domains is the simple peptide sequence (S/T)XV found at the C terminus of certain plasma membrane proteins (5Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), PDZ-containing proteins can recognize somewhat different sequences and can even form homophilic clusters with the PDZ domains of other proteins (6Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) . So far, two major functions have been ascribed to PDZ domains on the basis of their interactions with plasma membrane proteins and their presence in known signaling molecules such as dlg (6Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). First, they may organize and recruit proteins to the plasma membrane as has been proposed for PSD-95 (3Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). Secondly, they may link transmembrane proteins with the actin cytoskeleton via actin-binding proteins such as protein 4.1 (8Lue R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 9Marfatia S.M. Cabral J.H.M. Lin L.H. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 715-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here we report the structure of the murine periaxin gene, which reveals that there are two periaxin isoforms, L-periaxin and S-periaxin. The smaller protein, S-periaxin, is generated by a relatively rare retained intron mechanism (11Altieri D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13848-13855Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is probably favored by the presence of suboptimal 5′- and 3′-splice sites in the final intron together with a downstream putative exonic splicing enhancer (12Dirksen W.P. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both are PDZ proteins, L- and S-periaxin are targeted differently in the Schwann cell, indicating that the PDZ domain is not the sole determinant of their subcellular localization. To our knowledge this is the first example of the differential localization of two protein isoforms with the same PDZ domain. A 129SV murine genomic library (gift from Dr W. Skarnes, Center for Genome Research, Edinburgh University) in the bacteriophage Lambda Dash II (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) was screened by plaque hybridization (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with a 32P-labeled probe comprising nucleotides 1–3000 of rat periaxin cDNA (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hybridization was at 60 °C in QuikHyb (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK), and the filters were washed in 2 × SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7), 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature and finally at 60 °C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. From 1 × 106 clones, twelve positive plaques were identified after three rounds of screening, and EcoRI fragments of each insert were subcloned into the pIBI30 plasmid (IBI, Cambridge, UK) for analysis. The ends of each clone were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) using a T7 DNA polymerase kit (Pharmacia LKB Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), which showed that the twelve clones comprised three groups of sequences that overlapped (H1, F2, and I1). Oligonucleotide primers designed from these sequences were used to determine the order of the EcoRI fragments within the gene by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. using purified bacteriophage DNA (1 μl of 1:500 dilution) as template (first cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and then 72 °C for 1 min; 36 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and then 72 °C for 1 min, 7 min during the last cycle). The reactions (50 μl) included primers (5 μm) and Dynazyme DNA polymerase (5 units) (Flowgen Ltd., Sittingbourne, UK). Periaxin sequence was mapped to the EcoRI fragments by Southern blot with regional periaxin probes. Briefly, EcoRI-digested plasmid DNA from each EcoRI subclone was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and vacuum blotted to Magma nylon membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA). The membrane was hybridized with32P-labeled rat periaxin cDNA fragments covering the entire rat cDNA, and the order of the genomic clones was determined. The cDNA and genomic sequences were compared using the University of Wisconsin GCG software package. Analysis of the three clone types from the first screening revealed the absence of sequence corresponding to the first 297 bases of the rat cDNA, which includes the initiation codon and the 5′-untranslated region. Therefore a further 6 × 105 plaques were screened with a probe corresponding to nucleotides 50–297 of the rat sequence (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which was generated by reverse transcription-PCR of the 5′-end of mouse periaxin mRNA (see below). Two clones were isolated and characterized as described above and were shown to be identical. This sequence (HH1) did not overlap with the 5′-end of H1. However HH1 and H1 were shown to be contiguous by PCR performed on 129SV genomic DNA as template (first cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and then 72 °C for 1 min; 36 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and then 72 °C for 1 min, 7 min during the last cycle). The reactions (50 μl) contained genomic DNA (200 ng) primers (5 μm) and Dynazyme DNA polymerase (5 units) (Flowgen Ltd.). The PCR product was isolated from an agarose gel with the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, UK) cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega Ltd., Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced using a T7 sequencing kit, with T7 and M13(R) primers (Pharmacia). To obtain a probe for the 5′-end of the mouse periaxin mRNA, total RNA was isolated from the sciatic nerves of 15-day-old mice with RNAzol B (Biogenesis, Bournemouth, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcriptions (20 μl) contained RNA (2 μg), random hexamers (150 ng), dithiothreitol (10 mm), dNTPs (0.5 mm), and SuperScript reverse transcriptase (400 units) (Life Technologies Inc., Paisley, Scotland) in first strand synthesis buffer and were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. The reactions were terminated by heating at 80 °C, and 1 μl of this reaction was used as a template for PCR using primers corresponding to nucleotides 50–71 and 631–650 of the published rat periaxin cDNA sequence (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PCR conditions were: five cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 26 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (4 min during last cycle). Reactions (50 μl) contained primers (5 μm) and Dynazyme DNA polymerase (1 unit) (Flowgen Ltd.). The product was subcloned into the pGEM-T (Promega Ltd., Southampton, UK) vector according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced with a T7 DNA polymerase kit (Pharmacia). An oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 50–71 of the rat periaxin cDNA (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Total RNA (10 μg) from the trigeminal nerves of 13-day-old mice was hybridized to labeled oligonucleotide (5 pmol) and reverse transcribed for 10 min at 80 °C followed by 18 h at 42 °C. Reverse transcription employed SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.) in a buffer supplied by the manufacturer and included 50 μg/ml actinomycin D. Extended products were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel adjacent to a dideoxy sequencing ladder comprising the 5′-end of periaxin primed using an oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 103–122 of mouse periaxin cDNA. Two periaxin mRNAs of 5.2 and 4.6 kb were detected in mouse and rat sciatic nerve. We had previously cloned the cDNA for the smaller mRNA (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J.

To identify how the larger mRNA differed from the 4.6-kb mRNA, 3 × 105 clones of a 15-day-old rat sciatic nerve cDNA library constructed in EcoRI-digested λgt11 (Promega Ltd., Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions were screened with a probe comprising nucleotides 1–597 of the rat periaxin cDNA previously described (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Screening was carried out essentially as for the genomic library, and 24 positive plaques were purified. DNA from each of these phage clones was digested with NotI, and the inserts were subcloned into the pGEM11zf plasmid (Promega Ltd., Southampton, UK) and sequenced. Of 11 clones that included a sequence homologous to exon 6 of the mouse gene, five included a sequence corresponding to the intron between exons 6 and 7. Total RNA from both rat and mouse sciatic nerves was subsequently Northern blotted with a PCR-generated probe for this intronic sequence with identical results. Total RNA from 15-day-old mouse sciatic nerves was electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred to Magna nylon membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA) by vacuum blotting in 20 × SSC. Filters were probed for 1.5 h in Rapid Hyb buffer (Amersham) at 65 °C with an exon 7-specific probe, a 1.3-kb restriction fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1–1324 of the rat periaxin cDNA sequence, or a PCR product homologous to the intron 6 of the mouse gene labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (Life Technologies Inc.) and were washed to a final stringency of 0.2 × SSC at 65 °C. The intron probe was prepared using one of the five rat cDNA clones isolated as described above as template with primers that flanked 400 bp of intron sequence. The PCR conditions used for the preparation of this intronic probe were: first cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and then 72 °C for 1 min; 28 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and then 72 °C for 1 min, 4 min during the last cycle. Reactions (50 μl) contained primers (5 μm) and Dynazyme DNA polymerase (0.5 unit) (Flowgen Ltd.). The anti-SPeri and anti-NTerm antibodies were raised in rabbits against the synthetic peptides AKLVRVLSPVPVQDSPSDRVAAAC and EARSRSAEELRRAEC, respectively, which were generous gifts from Prof. N. Groome, Department of Biology, Oxford Brookes University. The former peptide corresponded to the C-terminal 23 amino acids of mouse S-periaxin, and the latter comprised the N-terminal 14 amino acids of mouse periaxin ,which is identical in L-periaxin and S-periaxin. The C-terminal cysteine residue of each peptide was coupled to Keyhole Limpet hemocyanin by standard techniques and used to immunize rabbits. Anti-SPeri antibody was affinity purified by immunoabsorption to a column of peptide coupled to Sepharose (Sigma Chemical Company, Poole, UK). 20-day-old mice were perfused intracardially with a 4% solution of paraformaldehyde in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Sciatic nerves were then removed and fixed for a further 2 h at room temperature. After washing, nerves were cryoprotected by immersion for 15 min in 5% (w/v) and then 10% (w/v) sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.4, followed by overnight incubation in a 20% (w/v) solution at 4 °C. Cryoprotected nerves were subsequently frozen in OCT embedding compound (Tissue TEK) using isopentane. Transverse sections (7 μm) were collected on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-subbed glass slides. Following removal of OCT by washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma), sections were blocked for 3 h at room temperature in a solution of 10% (v/v) goat serum (Scottish Antibody Production Unit, Law Hospital, Carluke, Scotland), 0.2% (w/v) gelatin, and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. Blocked sections were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-170pep1 (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (diluted 1:3000) or affinity-purified anti-SPeri (diluted 1:200) with mouse anti-myelin basic protein (diluted 1:200) (from Prof. N. Groome, Department of Biology, Oxford Brookes University) in 4% (v/v) goat serum, 0.2% (w/v) gelatin and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 (in PBS) under humid conditions at room temperature. Slides were washed in blocking buffer minus goat serum and then incubated with the secondary antibodies fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit (Cappel, Durham, NC) (diluted 1:200) and biotinylated goat anti-mouse (Kirkegaard and Perry) (diluted 1:500). Both antibodies were in 4% (v/v) goat serum, 0.2% (w/v) gelatin, and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 (in PBS) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Further washes in blocking buffer minus serum were followed by a 1-h incubation with streptavidin-Texas red (Vector laboratories) (diluted 1:1500) and several washes in PBS. Sections were subsequently examined with a Leica TCS4D confocal microscope. Sciatic nerve homogenates (10 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-170pep1 (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:2000, affinity-purified rabbit anti-SPeri was diluted 1:200, and rabbit anti-NTerm was diluted 1:1000. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Scottish antibody production unit) was used at a dilution of 1:500. The peroxidase reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS to 2% (v/v). Three different clones were isolated from a murine 129SV genomic library using a rat periaxin cDNA as a hybridization probe. A fourth, which included the 5′-end of the gene, was isolated using a murine cDNA probe that had been generated by reverse transcription-PCR. The clones were digested with EcoRI and subcloned into pIBI30. These clones were analyzed by PCR and Southern blot and were sequenced, which demonstrated that they encompassed the entire periaxin gene. The gene is divided into seven exons, and the coding region spans were approximately 20.6 kb (Fig. 1). Exons 1–6 range in size from 32 (exon 1) to 197 bp (exon 6). Exon 7 is the largest by far at 4002 bp. The sizes of the introns were estimated by restriction mapping and PCR and range from 88 (intron 2) to 7500 bp (intron 5). The exon-intron boundaries were sequenced and the splice donor (GT) and acceptor (AG) sites were identified.

Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the murine gene also encodes two mRNAs of 4.6 and 5.2 kb of approximately equal abundance (Fig. 2 A). Of eleven cDNA clones isolated from a rat cDNA library, five included intron 6 (Fig. 1). Confirmation that the murine 5.2-kb mRNA differed from the 4.6-kb mRNA by the inclusion of this 592-bp intron was obtained by Northern blotting (Fig. 2). The transcriptional initiation site was determined by primer extension and was found to be 75 bp upstream of a primer complementary to a region comprising the final nucleotide of exon 2 and the 5′-end of exon 3 in the murine gene (Fig. 3). This site lay in the sequence YYA+1AGGA, which has some similarity to the sequence YYA+1N(A/T)YY believed to be the consensus transcriptional initiator for RNA polymerase II transcripts (16Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). An identical transcriptional initiation site was found for the rat mRNA (data not shown). Approximately 500 bp of the putative core promoter was sequenced (Fig. 4). Although it lacks a TATA box, the promoter does possess a CAAT box, and between this motif and the initiator the sequence is relatively GC-rich (68%), which is commonly the case in TATA-less promoters (17Beck T.W. Brennscheidt U. Sithanandam G. Cleveland J. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A sequence motif corresponding to the SCIP/Oct-6 binding site (position −241) is of particular interest owing to the role that Oct-6 is believed to play in Schwann cell maturation (18Blanchard A.D.

An element (GCRE) at position −360 has previously been identified as mediating the induction of several myelin protein genes by forskolin (21Li X. Wrabetz L. Cheng Y. Kamholz J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The presence of this sequence would help to explain the ability of cAMP to mimic some of the axonal signals that regulate the expression of differentiation-specific genes in Schwann cells (22Lemke G.

This isoform, termed L-periaxin, is 93% identical to rat periaxin and has a size of 147.500 kDa, slightly larger than the rat protein (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The presence of a retained intron in the larger 5.2-kb mRNA introduces a stop codon preceded by a sequence that encodes a unique 21-amino acid C terminus. This truncated isoform, termed S-periaxin, has a size of 16.2 kDa (Fig. 5 B). Eccept for two differences at the extreme C terminus, the rat and murine S-periaxins are identical. Anti-peptide antibodies recognizing the N terminus of L- and S-periaxin (anti-NTerm), the repeat region unique to L-periaxin (anti-170pep1 (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J.

The sizes of L- and S-periaxin are indicated in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The similarity between mouse and rat periaxin is particularly striking in the N-terminal 127 amino acids up to the point where the sequences of L- and S-periaxin diverge. Within this region the rat and mouse polypeptides are identical. This prompted us to examine this sequence very carefully for conserved motifs that might illuminate the function of these proteins, despite the fact that previous searches of the complete L-periaxin polypeptide had not been informative (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A degree of sequence similarity with a portion of the PDZ domain of the junction-associated protein ZO-1 provided the necessary clue. Comparison of the N terminus sequence from amino acids 13 to 97 with several well characterized PDZ domains in other proteins confirmed that this region comprises a PDZ domain common to both L- and S-periaxin (Fig. 7). Because proteins that contain PDZ domains are believed to associate with the plasma membrane (3Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 6Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), it was of considerable interest to compare the subcellular locations of L- and S-periaxin in the Schwann cell. In transverse sections of sciatic nerves from 20-day-old mice L-periaxin was detected in a typical annular pattern that reflected its concentration in the periaxonal and abaxonal myelin lamellae (Fig. 8, A and C). In contrast to myelin basic protein, L-periaxin was also present at the plasma membrane of the Schwann cell, consistent with the possession of a PDZ domain. As found before, L-periaxin is not present in compact myelin where myelin basic protein is abundant (Fig. 8, B and C) (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Scherer S.S. Xu Y.T. Bannerman P.G.C. Sherman D.L. Brophy P.J. Development. 1995; 121: 4265-4273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, S-periaxin was not concentrated at the interface between the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of the Schwann cell or the myelin sheath (Fig. 8, D–F). Instead, this protein seemed to be distributed fairly evenly throughout the cytoplasm. There also appeared to be some S-periaxin in the nucleus of the Schwann cell. Apparently, the presence of a PDZ domain may not be sufficient to direct the association of S-periaxin with either the Schwann cell plasma membrane or its product, the myelin sheath. One of the most interesting aspects of the expression of the periaxin gene is the fact that alternative splicing involves the retention of an intron. There are approximately equal proportions of two mRNAs that either lack or include the last intron. The factors that determine the retention of introns have been studied in detail by Rottman and colleagues, and a key feature is the “weakness” of the splice sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the intron, i.e. the extent to which they differ from the consensus sequences that are known to promote splicing (12Dirksen W.P. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). These weak splice sites would not normally support splicing without an additional sequence in the downstream exon called the exonic splicing enhancer (13Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main distinguishing feature of exonic splicing enhancers is their high content of purines (13Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this model, the splice sites in the last intron of the periaxin gene are divergent from the consensus sequences, and there is a domain downstream in exon 7 that is highly purine-rich. The sequences of these 5′- and 3′-splice sites are CTGgtacgc and tcagA, respectively (intron sequences in lowercase), which are significantly different from the corresponding consensus donor and acceptor sequences of CAGgtragt and ncagG (24Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Downstream of the acceptor site and 24 bases into exon 7 there is a 14-base sequence GAAGAAGAAGAAGA, which is an excellent candidate for an exonic splicing enhancer (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of those genes that are typically expressed by myelin-forming Schwann cells, the periaxin gene is one of the first to become transcriptionally active (2Scherer S.S. Xu Y.T. Bannerman P.G.C. Sherman D.L. Brophy P.J. Development. 1995; 121: 4265-4273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The means by which the gene is regulated is therefore of considerable interest in evaluating how the expression of those genes required for axon ensheathment and myelination is coordinated. The SCIP/Oct-6 transcription factor is known to play a part in Schwann cell maturation, and the presence of a binding site for this protein in the periaxin promoter is intriguing (18Blanchard A.D. Sinanan A. Parmantier E. Zwart R. Broos L. Meijer D. Meier C. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Jaegle M. Mandemakers W. Broos L. Zwart R. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Meijer D. Science. 1996; 273: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20Bermingham J.R. Scherer S.S. O' Connell S. Arroyo E. Kalla K.A. Powell F.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, the timing of expression of periaxin expression in SCIP/Oct-6 null mutants appears to be relatively normal, despite the fact that peripheral myelination is disrupted (20Bermingham J.R. Scherer S.S. O' Connell S. Arroyo E. Kalla K.A. Powell F.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The presence of a site that bears considerable similarity to the consensus GCRE binding site found in other genes that are characteristically expressed in myelin-forming glia indicates that the the periaxin gene may respond to common signaling mechanisms, in which cAMP can mimic to some extent the inductive interactions of the axon (21Li X. Wrabetz L. Cheng Y. Kamholz J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Certainly axonal contact has been shown to be vital to maintain periaxin expression in Schwann cells in vivo (2Scherer S.S. Xu Y.T. Bannerman P.G.C. Sherman D.L. Brophy P.J. Development. 1995; 121: 4265-4273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far, two major functions have been ascribed to PDZ domains on the basis of their interactions with plasma membrane proteins and their presence in known signaling molecules such as dlg (6Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). First, they may act as organizers of cortical transduction complexes. In this model the PDZ protein acts as a scaffold on which the macromolecular signaling complex is assembled. These complexes have been termed transducisomes, within which PDZ proteins are key elements (25Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Secondly, they may link transmembrane proteins with the actin cytoskeleton via actin-binding proteins such as protein 4.1 (8Lue R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 9Marfatia S.M. Cabral J.H.M. Lin L.H. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, the insolubilty of periaxin (actually L-periaxin) in Triton X-100 was a key feature in the initial identification of this protein as a potential cytoskeleton-associated protein (1Gillespie C.S. Sherman D.L. Blair G.E. Brophy P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 497-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). The discovery of a PDZ domain in the periaxin proteins is certain to provide exciting new ways of interpreting the function not only of periaxin but also of PDZ domain-containing proteins in general. The PDZ motif in periaxin may either participate in the membrane-protein interactions that are required to promote spiralization or act to recruit proteins to a cortical scaffold important in transmembrane signaling, at least for L-periaxin. The fact that S-periaxin is not concentrated at the membrane-cytoplasm interface but is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the Schwann cell suggests that this protein has a quite distinct function and that the PDZ domain may not be sufficient to ensure cortical targeting. It is also possible that the unique C terminus of S-periaxin might target the protein away from the plasma membrane. Although most PDZ proteins are localized to the cell cortex, there is an increasing recognition that they do not always function at the plasma membrane (26Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu W. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 91: 5109-5113Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The possibility that they play a part in nuclear signaling has been suggested by the fact that the tight junction-associated protein Z0–1 localizes to the nucleus before it is recruited to sites of cell-cell contact (27Gottardi C.J. Arpin M. Fanning A.S. Louvard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10779-10784Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a nuclear binding partner for the transcriptional factor SRY is a PDZ protein that is thought to participate in a macromolecular transcription complex (28Poulat F. de Santa Barbara P. Desclozeaux M. Soullier S. Moniot B. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Berta P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7167-7172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that two periaxin isoforms, both of which contain the same PDZ domain, are generated in approximately equal amounts by an alternative retained intron mechanism. Furthermore, these PDZ proteins are uniquely targeted to different localizations in myelinating Schwann cells, which suggests that the presence of a PDZ motif may not be the dominant determinant in the selection of binding partners for L- and S-periaxin in myelinating Schwann cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993032659,"Transcriptional coactivators are involved in gene activation by nuclear hormone receptors. The receptor-associated coactivator 3 (RAC3) was recently identified to be highly related to the steroid receptor coactivator-1 and transcriptional intermediate factor 2, thereby establishing a novel family of nuclear receptor coactivators. In this study, we identified a RAC3 fragment containing three LXXLL motifs conserved among this family, which is sufficient to mediate nuclear receptor interaction in vivo and in vitro. Point mutations that disrupt ligand-dependent activation function of the receptor inhibited the interaction. We found that a 162-amino acid fragment of RAC3 conferred transcriptional activation and recruited the CREB-binding protein and that three distinct LXXLL motifs mediated the transcriptional activation. A trimeric far Western analysis demonstrated the formation of a ternary complex containing CREB-binding protein, RAC3, and the receptor. In addition, we showed that RAC3, transcriptional intermediate factor 2, and steroid receptor coactivator-1 are expressed in specific tissues and cancer cells and that RAC3transcript is directly up-regulated by retinoid treatment. These results suggest that RAC3 may contribute to amplified transcriptional responses through both recruitment of additional coactivators and autoregulation by the receptor-coactivator complex. Transcriptional coactivators are involved in gene activation by nuclear hormone receptors. The receptor-associated coactivator 3 (RAC3) was recently identified to be highly related to the steroid receptor coactivator-1 and transcriptional intermediate factor 2, thereby establishing a novel family of nuclear receptor coactivators. In this study, we identified a RAC3 fragment containing three LXXLL motifs conserved among this family, which is sufficient to mediate nuclear receptor interaction in vivo and in vitro. Point mutations that disrupt ligand-dependent activation function of the receptor inhibited the interaction. We found that a 162-amino acid fragment of RAC3 conferred transcriptional activation and recruited the CREB-binding protein and that three distinct LXXLL motifs mediated the transcriptional activation. A trimeric far Western analysis demonstrated the formation of a ternary complex containing CREB-binding protein, RAC3, and the receptor. In addition, we showed that RAC3, transcriptional intermediate factor 2, and steroid receptor coactivator-1 are expressed in specific tissues and cancer cells and that RAC3transcript is directly up-regulated by retinoid treatment. These results suggest that RAC3 may contribute to amplified transcriptional responses through both recruitment of additional coactivators and autoregulation by the receptor-coactivator complex.

The nuclear receptors are characterized by a common domain structure, including an N-terminal A/B region that contains the first activation function (AF-1), a DNA binding domain (DBD) responsible for recognition of specific DNA response elements, and a C-terminal ligand binding domain. The ligand binding domains of TR and RAR also mediate heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR) (for review, see Ref. 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar), and such complexes are capable of repressing basal transcription in the absence of ligand, while activating net transcription upon ligand treatment (6Baniahmad A. Kohne A.C. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of such repression and activation functions are not fully understood, a growing list of cofactors that interact with and modulate the transcriptional activation and repression properties of nuclear receptors have been identified (for reviews, see Refs.7Horwitz K.B.

The involvement of cofactors in nuclear receptor signaling was first postulated when members of the nuclear receptor superfamily were found to cross-react with each other functionally (10Meyer M. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel M. Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and with other transcription factors (11Schüle R.

Currently, several such cofactors have been identified biochemically (12Halachmi S. Marden E. Martin G. MacKay H. Abbondanza C. Brown M.

In particular, two related proteins known as the silencing mediator for RAR and TR (SMRT) and the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-COR) were identified as TR- and RAR-interacting proteins that can assist transcriptional repression by the unliganded receptors (17Seol W.

Recently, SMRT and N-COR were found to form complexes with the transcriptional corepressor mSin3 and the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and mRPD3 (22Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M.

Hormone binding is thought to dissociate the corepressor complex from nuclear receptors, allowing the receptors to recruit coactivators, such as the CREB/E1A-binding proteins (CBP/p300) (for review, see Ref. 27Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholarand references therein), the p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF; Ref.28Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H.

Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the nuclear receptor corepressor complexes, all of these putative coactivators contain intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (29Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Therefore, transcriptional activation and repression by nuclear receptors might be determined by the relative acetylation level of targets common to nuclear receptor coactivators and corepressors. Recent findings also suggest that, in addition to histones, these coactivators may also acetylate and modulate the DNA binding property of activator proteins or general transcription factors (32Gu W.

Sequence comparison of these proteins reveals that they share an overall identity of about 40%, but with striking similarity at the N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and period-aryl hydrocarbon receptor-single minded (PAS) “A” and “B” domains. The bHLH-PAS domain function in protein-protein interactions, heterodimerization, and target gene selection in many members of this family (45Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2065-2079Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but the role of this domain in the SRC family remains unclear. In addition to the bHLH-PAS domain, seven highly conserved motifs containing a LXXLL (L indicates hydrophobic residue) core consensus sequence flanked by charged and conserved residues are found in a central region that mediates both nuclear receptor interaction and transcriptional activation functions of all three SRC proteins (42Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 43Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

These motifs are also known as the leucine-charged domains (LCDs). Three of these motifs in SRC-1 have been shown to mediate direct protein-protein interaction with liganded receptors (43Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 48Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar), suggesting that these conserved motifs might play an important role in the functions of these coactivators. In this study, we further characterized the nuclear receptor interaction and transcriptional activation domains of RAC3 and found that different LXXLL motifs are differentially involved in either nuclear receptor interaction or transcriptional activation, suggesting the importance of the flanking sequences in determining the function of these LXXLL motifs. We showed that RAC3 interacts directly with CBP through its activation domain and that RAC3 can form a bridge for the interaction between CBP and nuclear receptors, suggesting that one mechanism of transcriptional activation by these coactivators is recruitment of additional cofactors. In addition, we found that the RAC3 transcript is directly up-regulated by retinoic acid, demonstrating a new and perhaps independent mechanism of transcriptional coactivation by the nuclear receptor coactivators. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that RAC3 plays an important role in nuclear receptor activation through utilization of multiple mechanisms. The individual RAC3 fragments were obtained by either restriction enzyme digestion of the full-length RAC3 clone or by PCR amplification with synthetic primers harboring suitable cloning sites. The LXXLL motif constructs were generated by subcloning annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the specified amino acids into the yeast expression vector pAS1 (49Durfee T. Becherer K.

The fusion proteins were separated on denaturing protein gels (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters in a transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 0.01% SDS). After denaturation in 6m guanidine hydrochloride, the proteins were renatured by stepwise dilution of guanidine hydrochloride to 0.187 m in HB buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The filters were then saturated with blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk and then 1% milk in HB buffer plus 0.05% Nonidet P-40). In vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins were generated in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and were diluted into a hybridization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The filters were allowed to hybridize overnight at 4 °C followed by three washes with hybridization buffer. The bound35S-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. The yeast two-hybrid assay was carried out in the yeast Y190 strain (49Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The GAL4 DBD fusion constructs were generated in the pGBT9 vector, and the GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion constructs were made in the pGAD424 or pACTII vector (CLONTECH). The β-galactosidase activities were determined with the ONPG liquid assay as described previously (52Chen J.D. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% resin-charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated in 24-well culture dishes at a density of 50,000 cells/well. Transfection was performed by standard calcium phosphate precipitation. All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate and were replicated at least once. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and refed fresh medium containing the indicated amounts of ligand. After 30 h, cells were harvested and β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were assayed as described previously (52Chen J.D. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Transfected cells in each well were lysed as described (52Chen J.D. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and processed for the luciferase and the β-galactosidase assays. The lysates were transferred into 96-well microlite plates for luciferase assay and 96-well microtiter plates for β-galactosidase assay as described (52Chen J.D. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The luciferase activities were determined with a MLX microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex) using 100 μl of assay solution (0.1 mKPO4, 5 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2) and 100 μl of luciferin solution (0.01md-luciferin in 0.1 mKPO4, pH 7.8). The luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity expressed from the cotransfected pCMX-βGal plasmid. Cells were treated with different concentrations of atRA (0, 10, 100, or 1000 nm) for a period of 12 h. In the control group, cells were treated with an equal volume of solvent (80% EtOH plus 20% DMSO). Total RNAs were isolated using an RNA isolation kit (RNAzol) and separated on a 1% agarose gel with 2.2 m formaldehyde and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were hybridized with random-primed32P-labeled DNA probes specific for RAC3,TIF2, and SRC-1 in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSPE (1× SSPE is 0.18 m NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, and 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.7), 2× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg of sheared herring sperm DNA/ml) at 42 °C overnight. The final wash was in 1× SSC (0.15m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate)-0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Filters were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C for about 24 h. The human tissue and cancer cell blots were purchased fromCLONTECH and hybridized according to manufacturer's protocols. The nuclear receptor-interacting domain of RAC3 has been previously located within a central fragment between amino acids 401 and 1204 (42Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Here, we show that deletion of amino acids 507–1017 eliminates the receptor interaction and that the rest of the N-terminal and C-terminal sequences cannot interact with liganded RAR (Fig. 1 A) or other class II receptors (data not shown) in the yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting that amino acids 507–1017 contain the interacting domain. The interaction was then confirmed by the mammalian two-hybrid system, in which amino acid fragments 401–800 and 613–752 both interact with RAR, whereas fragments 401–695 and 401–624 do not interact with the receptor (Fig. 1 B). We found that the 613–752 fragment can also interact significantly with the unliganded receptor, and such interaction was only slightly enhanced by ligand, whereas the interaction with fragment 401–800 is ligand-dependent. Coincident with previous studies (43Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 48Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar), this receptor-interacting domain (RID) of RAC3 contains three LXXLL motifs, which have been implicated in mediating direct interaction between SRC-1 and nuclear receptors (43Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 48Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). To further confirm the interactions between RAC3-RID and nuclear receptors, we generated a GST-RID fusion and analyzed its interaction with three nuclear receptors in vitro by far Western blot analyses. Significant interactions were observed with liganded RAR, TR, and estrogen receptor (Fig. 1 C), demonstrating that this RID domain indeed mediates a ligand-dependent interaction between RAC3 and nuclear receptors. We have demonstrated previously that the interaction between RAC3 and nuclear receptor depends on the presence of an intact AF2-AD (42Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Here, we further tested whether the AF-2 functionper se is required for such interaction. Several point mutations within the AF2-AD helix of the human RXRα (51Schulman I.G. Chakravarti D. Juguilon H. Romo A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8288-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were analyzed for their effects on interaction with RAC3. We found that disruption of the AF-2 function by three independent AF2-AD point mutations (F450A, F450P, and ML454A) abolishes the interaction between RAC3 and RXR (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, a neutral AF2-AD mutation (M452A) permits a strong ligand-dependent interaction. These results suggest that the activation function of the AF2-AD helix correlates with its ability to interact with RAC3, further supporting the hypothesis that RAC3 is an AF-2-dependent nuclear receptor coactivator. The transcriptional AD of RAC3 was previously located within amino acids 401–1204 (42Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Further deletional analyses in yeast cells reveal that the AD of RAC3 is located at the C terminus of this central fragment (Fig. 2 A), in contrast to the receptor-interacting domain found at the N terminus. In particular, amino acids 401–800 and further deletion mutants cannot activate transcription from a Gal4-dependent β-galactosidase reporter, whereas the C-terminal fragments 982–1204, 982–1056, and 1017–1179 strongly stimulate the reporter gene expression (Fig. 2 A). These results demonstrate a minimal RAC3-AD between amino acids 1017 and 1179. Within the RAC3-AD, we found several conserved LXXLL motifs. Because these motifs are not required for nuclear receptor interaction, we speculate that they might be directly involved in transcriptional activation. We analyzed the activation function of each of these motifs and found that when fused with the GAL4 DBD, the three C-terminal motifs (iv, v, and vi), but not the N-terminal ones, can activate transcription from a Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter in yeast cells (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that these C-terminal LXXLL motifs may directly mediate transcriptional activation by RAC3. Because SRC-1 can interact with the general transcriptional coactivator CBP and p300 (37Yao T.P. Ku G. Zhou N. Scully R. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), we tested whether RAC3 can also interact with CBP. Serial GST-CBP fusions covering the SRC-1-interacting domain were analyzed for interactions with35S-labeled full-length RAC3, SRC-1, and RAC3-AD (amino acids 1017–1179) (Fig. 3,A–C). We find that RAC3 interacts strongly with the CBP fragments C and D but not with other fragments. Similarly, SRC-1 interacts with CBP fragments C and D, consistent with previous observations (36Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K.

A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We also find that the RAC3-AD alone is sufficient for CBP interaction, suggesting that one function of AD is to recruit CBP or its related proteins. The ability of RAC3 to interact with both CBP and nuclear receptors prompted us to test whether each pair of interactions is enough to mediate the formation of a ternary complex. We developed a trimeric far Western protocol to test this possibility (Fig. 3 D). Briefly, the CBP fragments C and D were probed first with unlabeled full-length RAC3 and then with 35S-labeled nuclear receptor. The results demonstrate that RAC3 can bridge the interaction between CBP and RAR in the presence of ligand (Fig. 3 E) but not in the absence of ligand (not shown). As controls, CBP fragments C and D were probed parallel with 35S-RAC3 and35S-RAR, individually. These results suggest that the strength of interactions between CBP-RAC3 and RAC3-RAR are sufficient to link together a ternary complex. These results also confirm that RAC3 utilizes distinct domains for interaction with CBP and RAR. The expression patterns of RAC3 in different human tissues and cancer cells were examined and compared with those of SRC-1 and TIF2. RAC3 is expressed at high levels in the heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas but at very low levels in the brain, lung, liver, and kidney (Fig. 4 A, left). The SRC-1 message is expressed at high levels in the heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas and, again, at extremely low levels in the lung, liver, and kidney. Two distinctSRC-1 messages are clearly detectable, and the larger message appears to be expressed at a higher level than the smaller form. The expression pattern of TIF2 is very similar to that of RAC3, but with the highest expression in the heart instead of placenta. In the human cancer cells, we found the highest expression of the RAC3 message in the Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells and substantial expression in the epitheloid carcinoma HeLa cells, the chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562 cells, the colorectal adenocarcinoma SW480 cells, and the melanoma G361 cells. Low levels of RAC3were found in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, the lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells, and the lung carcinoma A5"

The neurotrophins mediate their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain of the Trk receptors adjacent to the membrane has previously been shown to be the dominant element for specific neurotrophin binding. Using computer graphics models of the human TrkA and TrkC immunoglobulin-like domains as a guide, the residues involved in binding to their respective neurotrophins were mapped by mutational analysis. TrkC primarily utilizes loop EF, between β-strands E and F, for binding. In contrast, TrkA utilizes the EF loop as well as additional residues, the latter being prime candidates for determining the specificity of TrkAversus TrkC. When selected TrkC and TrkA mutants with reduced binding were expressed on NIH3T3 cells, neurotrophin-induced autophosphorylation was strongly reduced or absent.

Binding induces autophosphorylation of the Trk receptors, which triggers the subsequent steps in the signal transduction cascade (reviewed in Ref. 11Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin.

Schweiger M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1807-1811PubMed Google Scholar). According to this proposal, the extracellular portion of the Trk receptors is composed of a cysteine-cluster, a leucine-rich motif, and a second cysteine-cluster, followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Analysis of a series of Trk receptor domain deletions and chimeras between the different members of the Trk family has shown that the second immunoglobulin-like domain of TrkC and TrkB confers specificity and affinity to their respective neurotrophins (14Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and that both the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains are important for TrkA binding and specificity (14Urfer R.

Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The leucine-rich motif has been implicated to bind neurotrophins (16Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Lang M.E. Auer B. Schneider R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11256-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Schneider R. J. Biol.

Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast, exchanging the second immunoglobulin-like domain from TrkB into TrkC resulted in high affinity BDNF binding (14Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, a fragment of TrkA comprising the two immunoglobulin-like domains has been shown to bind NGF and inhibit neurite outgrowth (18Tannahill L. Klein R. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,19Holden P.H. Asopa V. Robertson A.G.S. Clarke A.R. Tyler S. Bennett G.S. Brain S.D. Wilcock G.K. Allen S.J. Smith S.K.F.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In this study, the neurotrophin binding sites on TrkA and TrkC have been determined using molecular modeling and mutagenesis of the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Most of the NT-3 binding site on the TrkC receptor is contributed by residues in a loop connecting β-strands E and F at the membrane proximal portion of the binding domain. In contrast, while this same loop is important for TrkA binding of NGF, numerous residues outside of this loop also make major contributions to binding, suggesting a mechanism of specificity discrimination.DISCUSSIONNeurotrophins mediate their signal into the cell through specific interactions with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family (reviewed in Refs. 11Kaplan D.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have defined the binding sites on these neurotrophins for TrkC and TrkA, respectively. In addition, the regions controlling specificity of the neurotrophins have been localized to the central β-strand bundle (46Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Presta L.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4775-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and at least one loop connecting the β-strands (47Ilag L.L. Lönnerberg P. Persson H. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19941-19946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the residues that are involved in binding are not identical to those controlling specificity (46Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Presta L.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4775-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).While the binding sites on NGF and NT-3 for their cognate Trk receptors have been determined by mutational analysis, the details of the binding site on the Trk receptors have remained unexplored. It has been shown previously that the second immunoglobulin-like domain of the extracellular portion of TrkC is the main determinant for interaction with NT-3 (14Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and that both the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains are important for TrkA binding of NGF (14Urfer R. Tsoulfas P.

The present study involved a more detailed analysis of the second immunoglobulin-like domain of TrkA and TrkC using molecular modeling and surface scanning mutagenesis.Loop EF Plays a Major Role in Binding NeurotrophinsTrkC is the most stringent member of the Trk family in terms of specificity; it binds NT-3 with high affinity but not the other neurotrophins (7Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). TrkA preferably binds NGF, and TrkB preferably binds BDNF and NT-4/5, but at least in vitro, they can bind NT-3 with lower affinity (36Soppet D. Escandón E. Maragos J. Middlemas D.S. Reid S.W.

This study has shown that both TrkA and TrkC utilize loop EF as a dominant component of their binding site (Table I). All three Trk receptors possess a conserved sequence in loop EF: abPTHcNNGd, where a is N or D; b is Q, N, or K; c is V, M, or Y; and d is N or D (Fig. 1). While the threonine and second conserved asparagine residues are important for both TrkA and TrkC (Table I), the two receptors differ in their utilization of the other residues in loop EF. In TrkA, Gln317, His320, and Val321 are involved in binding, whereas in TrkC the analogous Lys336, His339, and Tyr340 are uninvolved; in TrkA, Asn316 is unimportant, while the analogous TrkC residue Asn335 is important (Table I). This difference in utilization of residues in this loop suggests that loop EF may play a role in determining the specificity, as well as binding, of the neurotrophins.Inspection of the three-dimensional structures of immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin-like domains determined by x-ray crystallography reveals that loop EF may have one of two basic conformations: α-helical as in immunoglobulin CH2 and CH3 domains (21Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar) or with a side chain:main chain hydrogen bond as in VCAM domain 1 (20Jones E.Y. Harlos K. Bottomley M.J. Robinson R.C. Driscoll P.C. Edwards R.M. Clements J.M. Dudgeon T.J. Stuart D.I. Nature. 1995; 373: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), CD4 domain 2 (54Ryu S.E. Kwong P.D. Truneh A. Porter T.G. Arthos J. Rosenberg M. Dai X.P. Xuong N.H. Axel R. Sweet R.W. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 55Wang J.H. Yan Y.W. Garrett T.P. Liu J.H. Rodgers D.W. Garlick R.L. Tarr G.E. Husain Y. Reinherz E.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1990; 348: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), and telokin (54Ryu S.E. Kwong P.D. Truneh A. Porter T.G. Arthos J. Rosenberg M. Dai X.P. Xuong N.H. Axel R. Sweet R.W. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of loop EF in the Trks could accommodate either conformation. In all three Trk receptors, loop EF has a hydrophobic residue (Val321 in TrkA; Tyr340 in TrkC), which could anchor a putative α-helix to the domain, similar to the function of the loop EF tryptophan residues in immunoglobulin CH2 and CH3 domains (21Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). In the alternative conformation, the first conserved asparagine residue (Asn322 in TrkA; Asn341 in TrkC) could provide the side chain:main chain hydrogen bond as found in VCAM domain 1, for example (20Jones E.Y. Harlos K. Bottomley M.J. Robinson R.C. Driscoll P.C. Edwards R.M. Clements J.M. Dudgeon T.J. Stuart D.I. Nature. 1995; 373: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, changing this asparagine residue to alanine in both TrkA and TrkC had little or no effect on binding (Table I); this would argue against this conformation, since alteration of the analogous EF loop asparagine in VCAM domain 1 affected both binding to receptor and anti-VCAM mAbs (56Renz M.E. Chiu H.H. Jones S. Fox J. Kim K.J. Presta L.G. Fong S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If loop EF adopts this alternative conformation, then the loop EF hydrophobic residue would be solvent-exposed and therefore could be important for determination of specificity of the Trk receptors by direct interaction with neurotrophins. The results presented here do not allow a definitive choice between the two possibilities.Mutations to amino acids other than alanine at positions within loop EF in TrkC point to rather stringent requirements for binding. TrkC residue Asn342 was the most sensitive to mutation, since all replacements at this position resulted in a reduction of TrkC receptor function (Table I). Mutations at Asn335 and Thr338 were tolerated if they involved amino acids that were isosteric or similar in chemical character, but exchanges to larger side chains reduced binding significantly, indicating that the spatial requirements at this part of the binding site may be very restricted.Loop EF and loop AB, which play a role in the interaction of TrkA and TrkC with their ligands, have previously been shown to be important for molecular recognition in immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin-like domains with their receptors. Mutational analysis of the interaction of IgE with its high affinity receptor demonstrated that, among others, loop EF residues in the IgE Cε3 domain are major contributors to affinity (57Presta L. Shields R. O'Connell L. Lahr S. Porter J. Gorman C. Jardieu P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26368-26373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the complex betweenS. aureus protein A and IgG Fc (domains CH2 and CH3) revealed that major contacts are formed by residues in loop EF (Gln311 and Leu314) and loop AB (Met252, Ile253, and Ser254) of the CH2 domain (21Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar); these same two loops are likewise utilized when IgG binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (58Burmeister W.P. Huber A.H. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In VCAM, residue Asn65 in loop EF is important for binding to the human receptor but not the murine receptor (56Renz M.E. Chiu H.H. Jones S. Fox J. Kim K.J. Presta L.G. Fong S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although other immunoglobulin-like domains may utilize loops other than AB and EF,e.g. mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule (59Viney J.L. Jones S. Chiu H.H. Lagrimas B. Renz M.E. Presta L.G. Jackson D. Hillan K.J. Lew S. Fong S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2488-2497PubMed Google Scholar) and intercellular adhesion molecule (60Fisher K.L. Lu J. Riddle L. Kim K.J. Presta L.G. Bodary S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the common usage of loops EF and AB by functionally quite different members of the immunoglobulin superfamily suggests that this arrangement of functional side chains provides an example of a structural motif optimal for protein-protein interaction.The three-dimensional relationship of the five domains in the Trk receptors is unknown. The complexity of the epitopes for the anti-TrkA and anti-TrkC antibodies in conjunction with blocking versusnonblocking character (Tables II and IV) suggests that two or more of the domains may interact with one another. For example, it has been shown previously that TrkC domain 5 alone can bind NT-3 and undergo autophosphorylation (14Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, the anti-TrkC mAb C1435, which binds to domains 1–3, blocks NT-3 binding to full-length TrkC (Table IV). Similarly, some TrkA mutants in domain 5 affect binding to mAb A1488, which does not map to TrkA domain 5 (Tables II and III), Since both domain 4 and domain 5 are important for NGF binding in TrkA (14Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Pérez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) the TrkA domain 5 mutants P269E and T327A/L329A (Tables I and III) could affect binding by disrupting the domain 4-domain 5 interface (rather than by direct interaction with NGF). The short link between domains 4 and 5 also suggests that domain 5 loops BC, DE, and/or FG could form interdomain contacts with domain 4 (similar to the loop interdomain contacts in VCAM (20Jones E.Y. Harlos K. Bottomley M.J. Robinson R.C. Driscoll P.C. Edwards R.M. Clements J.M. Dudgeon T.J. Stuart D.I.

TrkC is the most stringent among the Trk receptors in its binding of neurotrophins, yet only a few residues outside of loop EF seem to be involved in binding: Glu287, Cys331, and His363 (Table I, Fig. 2 A). In contrast, in TrkA numerous residues outside of loop EF were major (Pro269, His310, Ser340/Met342) or minor (e.g.Val261, His264, Thr292, Thr307, Thr327/Leu329, Asn332, Glu355/Asp356) contributors to binding (Table I, Fig. 2 B). Two modes of neurotrophin/Trk interaction, which are not mutually exclusive, are possible. First, it has been shown previously that both NGF and NT-3 use residues in their central β-strand bundle for binding (30Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. Soppet D. Escand-n E. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5896-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 44Ibáñez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, NGF also utilizes residues at its N terminus (44Ibáñez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 45Shih A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22707-22710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas NT-3 does not (30Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. Soppet D. Escand-n E. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5896-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This suggests that the central β-strand residues in the neurotrophins might interact with loop EF in the Trk receptors, while the NGF N-terminal residues interact with other portions of the TrkA second immunoglobulin-like domain (interactions not present in the NT-3/TrkC interaction). One candidate for control of binding and specificity is β-strand B/loop AB. In TrkC, one residue in the N-terminal portion of β-strand B (Glu287) is important for binding NT-3, while in TrkA, several residues in loop AB (Val261, Met263, and His264) are important. Second, while portions of the TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain outside of loop EF may not play a role in binding, they may play an important role in specificity by providing negative interaction with the noncognate neurotrophin ligands. Hence, NGF may be prevented from binding to TrkC not by residues in loop EF (most of which are conserved) but by residues external to loop EF; similarly, NT-3 may be prevented from binding to TrkA by negative interaction with residues outside of loop EF. This possibility is supported by the difference in binding affinity exhibited by the TrkC R295A and R295D mutants. The TrkC R295A mutant showed no reduction in binding, but a charge reversal, TrkC R295D (TrkA has an aspartic acid at this position), effected a 12-fold reduction in binding (Table I). Further support comes from previous findings that residues in the neurotrophins involved in binding may be segregated from those involved in specificity (46Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Presta L.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4775-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and that changing specific residues in NT-3 altered binding to TrkA and TrkB but not TrkC (62Rydén M. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5623-5627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).TrkA and TrkC also differ in the nature of residues in the segment connecting the second immunoglobulin-like domain to the transmembrane sequence (Fig. 1). Several residues in the TrkA segment affected NGF binding when mutated (Table I), and these may provide additional binding/specificity determinants not present in TrkC. A naturally occurring TrkA receptor isoform carries an insert of six amino acids between the second immunoglobulin-like domain and the transmembrane sequence (63Barker P.A. Lomen-Hoerth C. Gensch E.M. Meakin S.O. Glass D.J. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15150-15157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a similar isoform has also been detected in human TrkC (28Shelton D.L. Sutherland J. Gripp J. Camerato T. Armanini M.P. Phillips H.S. Carroll K. Spencer S.D. Levinson A.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 477-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When tested in fibroblasts, the presence or absence of the insert did not affect the ligand specificity of the receptor (63Barker P.A. Lomen-Hoerth C. Gensch E.M. Meakin S.O. Glass D.J. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15150-15157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when the TrkA isoform containing the six-amino acid insert was expressed in PC12nnr5 cells and analyzed for NT-3-induced biological responses, significantly more neurite outgrowth was observed than in the cell line expressing a variant lacking the insert (64Clary D.O. Reichardt L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11133-11137Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This suggests that the presence of this insert might modulate the specificity of TrkA in a PC12 cell environment. Although the mechanism of this effect is unknown, it is conceivable that the insert may influence the orientation of the nearby binding domain, or, alternatively, amino acids in the insert may interact directly with neurotrophins.While this study has provided a high resolution map of the residues in the second immunoglobulin-like domain of TrkA and TrkC involved in neurotrophin binding, it has only provided a glimpse of possible modes of specificity determination for these receptors. The data presented here show that TrkC may have fewer positive interactions with its cognate ligand NT-3 than does TrkA with its cognate ligand NGF and suggest that negative interactions may dominate the specificity. To more fully understand the mechanism of specificity, mutants of the Trks that can recruit binding of the noncognate neurotrophin ligands need to be evaluated, similar to studies on the specificity of neurotrophins (30Urfer R.

Tum does not compete with CI for binding sites on DNA, and unlike RecA mediated induction of lambda prophage, the action of Tum on CI is reversible. Mechanisms by which Tum may act against CI are discussed. Following infection of a host bacterium by a temperate bacteriophage, the phage can develop in one of two ways: lytically, whereby progeny phage are produced and released by lysis of the host cell, or lysogenically whereby the phage genome is integrated into the host cell (the prophage state) and replicated along with the host DNA. Although these two life cycles are independent, some temperate phage retain the ability to switch between them. For example, in certain classes of temperate bacteriophage, exposure to UV light or other DNA-damaging agents stimulates the phage to switch from the passive prophage state to the productive lytic cycle, the process of prophage induction. In the lambdoid family of bacteriophage, commitment to prophage induction after UV irradiation is achieved by inactivation of the prophage maintenance function, CI, through linkage to the complex global stress response system known as the SOS response (1Walker G.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Scaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987Google Scholar). Upon exposure of a cell to DNA-damaging agents, host RecA protein is converted to an activated form that catalyzes by autoproteolysis the inactivation of host cell-encoded LexA protein, a transcriptional repressor of a series of unlinked genes, the SOS genes (2Little J.W. Mount D.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 11-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Activated RecA also catalyzes the self-cleavage of lambda CI repressor protein, relieving repression of lytic genes to bring about prophage induction (3Little J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 4Kim B. Little J.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Coliphage 186 is a close relative of the non-inducible P2 family of phage (5Egan J.B. Dodd I.B. Webster R.G. Granoff A. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, London1994: 1003-1009Google Scholar). The finding that 186, like lambda, is UV-inducible (6Woods W.H. Egan J.B. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was therefore unexpected. Induction of a 186 prophage differs from that in lambda. RecA is not directly involved in induction of a 186 prophage, but rather 186 relies upon a phage encoded function tum,whose expression is under host LexA control (7Lamont I. Brumby A.M. Egan J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5492-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, prophage induction in 186 can be considered an SOS function. The SOS operon of 186 (Fig. 1) contains two genes under control of the p95 promoter, tum and orf97 (8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The tum gene contains several alternative translational start points, and the product of one of these (Tum) is essential for prophage induction. Expression of the orf97 gene product from a plasmid blocks infection of the cell by 186; however, its absence has little effect on prophage induction (8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The prophage state of coliphage 186 is, like lambda, maintained by the product of a single gene, CI (13Lamont I. Richardson H. Carter D.R. Egan J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5286-5288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 186 CI represses transcription from two promoters, pR and pB(Fig. 1). The lytic promoter pR directs the synthesis of genes required for excision and replication (10Dodd I.B. Kalionis B. Egan J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Dodd I.B. Reed M.R. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas pB is responsible for expression of the B protein, a transcriptional activator required for expression of the late genes (14Dibbens J.A. Gregory S.L. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2643-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, there are two more CI binding sites, FL and FR, whose functions are unknown (12Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11532-11540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but which may be involved in DNA looping. Exposure of a 186 lysogen to a DNA-damaging agent leads to production of the activated form of RecA, which in turn catalyzes the irreversible inactivation of host LexA, resulting in a general SOS response, including relief of the LexA-mediated repression of p95. The resulting Tum protein then acts in an unknown fashion to activate lytic development (7Lamont I. Brumby A.M. Egan J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5492-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present work, we investigate the mechanism of Tum action and demonstrate that Tum acts against the CI repressor, the sole phage function required for maintenance of lysogeny. By using Tum and CI purified to near homogeneity, we show that Tum specifically prevents effective CI binding to its operator sites and that this Tum-CI interaction is reversible. Radiolabeled nucleotides and oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Bresagen (Adelaide, Australia). Media and general techniques for 186 are as described (15Hocking S.M. Egan J.B. J.

The orientation of the insert was such thatp95-directed transcription was in the opposite direction to pAmp. pEC308 is same as pEC307, except the 186 DNA source was 186cI+ tum16. pEC309 is same as pEC307, except the 186 DNA source was 186Δ95. pEC324 is a derivative of the λpL expression plasmid pPLc28 containing the 3.1-kb EcoRI restriction fragment from an M13 Ecol clone (M13Ecol 95.4−/5−) in which Orf95.4 and Orf95.5 expression had been abolished by mutation (8Brumby A.M.

The orientation is such that pLtranscription was in the same direction asp95. pEC330 is a plac expression plasmid carrying p15A replicon and confers kanamycin resistance. It was constructed as described (8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 1.2-kb SspI (8655) to AccI (1372) fragment (end-filled) from pEC303 was inserted into the ScaI site of pEC330. The insert was oriented for expression of Tum from plac. The 1.3-kb HaeIII (1721) toHaeIII (2998) restriction fragment from 186cItsp was ligated into the HindIII site of a single copy pKO2-derived plasmid. pEC363 is a pET3a-Tum expression vector. It was created by ligating the 300-bp NdeI (8765) toBamHI (9104) restriction enzyme fragment from the mutated M13 clone, M13EcorNdeTum+ ligated into the NdeI to BamHI backbone of pET3a. The carboxyl-terminal portion of the tum gene was reconstructed by ligating the XhoI (9104) to XhoII (9730) restriction fragment from M13EcorNdeTum+ into the recreated BamHI site of the pET3a construct. pEC364 is a pET3a Tum16 expression vector. It is the same as pEC363, except the 186 DNA source was the M13 clone, M13EcorNde tum16. pEC452 is a CI expression plasmid. It contains the 1.3-kb HaeIII-HaeIII (71.2–75.5%) fragment of 186+ inserted into the EcoRV site of pACYC184 such that CI expression was under the control of its own promoter,pL (14Dibbens J.A.

The tum gene from pEC324 (Orf95.4−,.5− (8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B.

The PCR product was digested with NdeI and SacII and ligated into the NdeI, SacII backbone of pET3a which had been modified (H. Healy, University of Adelaide) to fuse the coding sequence for LVPRGSHHHHHH at the carboxyl terminus of any inserted sequence. pET Tum16His6 was the same as pET TumHis6 except the template for the PCR reaction was pEC364. All regions amplified by PCR were sequenced to ensure no errors had been introduced. RNA isolation was based on the procedure of Reddy and Gilman (18Reddy K.J. Gilman M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 4.4.1-4.4.7Google Scholar). The concentration and purity of RNA preparations were determined spectroscopically, anA260 /A280 ratio of greater than 1.7 being regarded as acceptable for primer extension analysis. Primer extension reactions were performed essentially as described (19Neufing P.J. Shearwin K.E. Camerotto J. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All reactions were extended from oligonucleotides that had been labeled at the 5′ end using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP. Electrophoresis was carried out on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. A lysogenic culture, C600(186cItsp) or (186cItspΔSA), was grown overnight at 30 °C in LB, and then diluted 10−2 in LB. Incubation was continued at 30 °C until A600 = 0.8, and the culture was transferred to 39.5 °C for 20 min. Nitrosoguanidine was added (8 μg ml−1 or 16 μg ml−1), and incubation was continued for a further 20 min. Following cell lysis, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and aliquots of lysate were diluted 10−3 into LB and stored over chloroform at 4 °C. Cells (BL21 [λDE3] pLysS pET TumHis6) were grown with vigorous shaking at 37 °C in LB (500 ml) containing ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (30 μg ml−1) until anA600 nm of 0.6–0.8 had been reached. IPTG (0.4 mm) was added to induce Tum expression and growth continued for a further 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (TEG150 buffer), and stored at −20 °C until use. Prior to purification, cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 8 m urea (PTU buffer). The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 15 min and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was applied to a 1 × 5-cm column of Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen), equilibrated with PTU buffer, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1. The column was washed extensively with the PTU buffer, pH 6.3, followed by washing with PTU buffer, pH 6.3, containing 50 mm imidazole. The eluate was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Tum was eluted with PTU buffer, pH 6.3, containing 200 mm imidazole. Fractions containing Tum (as judged by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, and the protein was refolded by dialysis against TEG150 buffer containing progressively lower concentrations of urea. The final product was centrifuged to remove any aggregated material and stored at −70 °C. The protein was judged to be >95% pure on the basis of SDS-PAGE. Approximately 10 mg of TumHis6 was obtained from 500 ml of culture. Tum16 His6 was purified in the same manner. Amino-terminal sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems 475A Protein Sequencer) of TumHis6 revealed that the initiator methionine is retained, to give a calculated molecular weight (including the 12-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension) of 17,958 for TumHis6. Concentrations of Tum were measured spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 11,000m−1 cm−1, calculated from the average extinction coefficients of tryptophan (5500m−1 cm−1) and tyrosine (1200m−1 cm−1), assuming additivity of absorbances (20Wetlaufer D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar). 186 CI protein was purified as described (21Shearwin K.E. Egan J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11525-11531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and a cell-free extract containing CII was prepared as described (19Neufing P.J. Shearwin K.E. Camerotto J. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled DNA fragments for gel retardation assays were generated via the polymerase chain reaction, by inclusion of [α-32P]dATP in the PCR reaction mix. Fragments were purified on a 6% polyacrylamide gel before use. Samples (10 μl), containing 150–300 cpm of labeled fragment, were prepared in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.01 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ng μl−1 salmon sperm DNA) and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to loading. A separate lane of tracking dye was used. Gels (6% polyacrylamide containing 20% glycerol) were run at 4 °C. Electrophoresis was carried out at 20 mA for approximately 2 h, and the gels were dried under vacuum and the distribution of labeled DNA recorded on a phosphor screen. The screen was analyzed with the Imagequant program on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Western blots were performed essentially as described (22Gallagher S. Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Hurrell J.G.R. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 10.8.1-10.8.17Google Scholar), using the Supersignal chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An60Ti rotor and absorption optics. Samples were centrifuged for 24 h at 5 °C and scans taken every 4 h thereafter until equilibrium had been reached. Data sets were collected at 280 nm with a spacing of 0.001 cm as the average of three scans. Proteins were prepared for centrifugation by exhaustive dialysis against TEG150 buffer. The partial specific volume of TumHis6 was calculated using the amino acid partial specific volumes of Zamyatnin (23Zamyatnin A.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1984; 13: 145-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This value was 0.721 ml g−1. Buffer density at 5 °C was measured in an Anton-Paar precision density meter to be 1.0378 g ml−1. No function other than CI is required for maintenance of the prophage state (13Lamont I. Richardson H. Carter D.R. Egan J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5286-5288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CI is known to repress transcription of the excision and replication genes from pR (10Dodd I.B. Kalionis B. Egan J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and transcription of the late activator gene from pB (14Dibbens J.A. Gregory S.L. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2643-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The action of Tum in prophage induction could be to activate transcription that bypasses the repressedpR and pB, or more likely, it could be that Tum interferes with CI function or production. We first sought to confirm that, upon UV-induced prophage induction,pR was derepressed rather than an alternative promoter activated. Primer extension analyses were performed on RNA accumulated at various time points after UV irradiation of a 186 lysogen, with an oligonucleotide primer (primer A) complementary to the l strand at the start of the apl reading frame. Thus, transcription of the apl gene from pR, essential for optimal prophage induction (11Dodd I.B. Reed M.R. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Reed M.R. Shearwin K.E. Pell L. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), would generate a 125-bp product in the primer extension assay. As shown in Fig. 2, a 125-base extension product was first visible 60 min after irradiation, indicating that UV irradiation of a prophage results in activation of transcription from pR. However, a second minor product 180 bases in length also appeared in parallel with the 125-base product. The possibility remained therefore that Tum activated an alternative promoter giving the 180-bp product, with the further possibility of processing to yield the 125-base product. To confirm that Tum's action is to inactivate CI rather than activate an alternative promoter, we next compared the transcription response following expression of Tum specifically (from a plasmid rather than via UV induction) with that seen after temperature inactivation of a temperature-sensitive CI mutant. A two-plasmid system was established with pEC331, a pACYC177-derived plasmid with the tum gene placed in front of the plac promoter (8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) so making Tum expression IPTG-inducible, and pEC342, an R1-derived (single copy) plasmid carrying the 1.3-kb HaeIII restriction fragment (9Kalionis B. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) from 186cItsp encoding the cI gene (tsp allele). Once again primer extension analysis was used to assaypR transcriptional activity. At 30 °C, production of CI from pEC342 completely repressedpR activity (Fig. 3). This was unchanged in the presence of the Tum plasmid pEC331. However, 30 min after addition of IPTG,pR activity was evident but not if the tum gene was mutant. This result indicated that Tum is both necessary and sufficient to derepress CI-repressedpR. pEC342, bearing a temperature-sensitive allele of cI, allowed the removal of repression independently of Tum. Raising the temperature of the culture to 41 °C and thus inactivating CI gave a rightward transcription pattern indistinguishable from that obtained through the agency of Tum. The appearance of the 125-base product supported the earlier conclusion that Tum acts by derepressing pR, whereas the presence of the 180-base product dismisses the possibility that its appearance was Tum-dependent. The possibility that there exists a CI-repressed constitutive promoter initiating transcription 55 bases upstream of pR is not evident by sequence analysis nor by reporter gene studies in whichpR is inactivated by mutation, 2R. Schubert and I. Dodd, personal communication. suggesting that the 180-base product was an artifact of the primer extension assay. A second 186 promoter repressed by CI is pB. To confirm that Tum acts to derepress rather than activate, the start point of the B transcript after exposure of the repressedpB to Tum was determined by primer extension analysis, using a three-plasmid system (Fig. 4). pB B was carried as an insert on a single copy RI-derived plasmid pEC458 (14Dibbens J.A. Gregory S.L. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2643-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transcription from pB was detected as an 82-base extension product and was repressed by CI supplied in transfrom pEC452, which is a pACYC184 derivative (14Dibbens J.A. Gregory S.L. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2643-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The third plasmid pEC307 is pBR322-derived and bears the 2.0-kb PstI fragment spanning p95 and tum (25Brumby, A. M., The Control of Prophage Induction in Coliphage 186.Ph.D. thesis, 1994, University of Adelaide.Google Scholar). When the host carrying the three plasmids was UV-irradiated, exactly this 82-base product was detectable at 20 min after irradiation. If the tum plasmid (pEC307) was replaced by either pEC308 carrying the inactive tum16 mutant allelle or pEC309 bearing atum deletion mutant (25Brumby, A. M., The Control of Prophage Induction in Coliphage 186.Ph.D. thesis, 1994, University of Adelaide.Google Scholar), then UV-mediated activation of pB was no longer evident. The correspondence in size of the UV-induced extension product with that of the pB transcript was further evidence for an antirepressor role for Tum and evidence against the proposal that Tum acts to bypass repressor by activation of a new transcript. As in previous assays, a larger minor extension product was evident, but in this instance its appearance was not under repressor control. Although it is uncertain whether the larger extension product in these assays was an artifact or not, the pattern of its appearance rendered it irrelevant to our conclusion that Tum acts as an antirepressor rather than as an activator. To probe further the nature of Tum-mediated prophage induction, an attempt was made to isolate mutants of CI resistant to the action of Tum. Initial attempts involved screening for the presence of turbid plaques on media containing mitomycin C, a DNA-damaging agent that causes prophage induction, and indicator bacteria hosting a single copyp95 tum + plasmid (pEC306). Thus, in theory, 186 tum − mutants would be complemented in trans by the tum + plasmid in the host strain, leaving only mutants of 186 resistant to Tum as turbid plaque formers. From a sample of 650,000 plaques, generated by plating a nitrosoguanidine-mutagenized 186cItsp stock (see “Experimental Procedures”) on C600(pEC306), four potential Tum-resistant mutants were isolated. However, the mutations were mapped to the tumgene itself, identifying them as dominant tum −mutants. This gave the first indication that Tum may act as an oligomer, and indeed we show Tum in solution to be a dimer (see below). An improved screen for Tum resistance was then employed, using a 186tum deletion mutant, 186cItspΔSA, that removes all of tum, as well asp95. Use of this phage was designed to preclude the possibility of mutation to tum − dominance, as the only source of Tum is that of pEC306. Nitrosoguanidine-mutated stocks of this phage were plated for single plaques on C600(pEC306) in the presence of mitomycin C. From a screen of 550,000 plaques, three further potential Tum-resistant mutants were isolated. One of these mutants (TumR ε) mapped to the left of the cI gene, in a region concerned with integration and excision of the prophage. Indeed this mutant displayed a deficiency in prophage induction common to both heat- and Tum-mediated induction and was not pursued. The remaining two mutants (TumR G and TumR 3) mapped to the cI gene, each mutant bearing a double mutation resulting in two amino acid substitutions within cI (V58A,L98F for TumR G; L115F,P158S for TumR 3). The mutants formed unstable prophage that displayed a defect in prophage induction by Tum (data not shown), suggesting a simultaneous loss of sensitivity to Tum and of repressibility. However, the defect was not specific for Tum induction as the mutants were also defective in heat induction (the cItsp allele was used in the mutational screen). We therefore concluded that CI activity and resistance to Tum were not genetically independent, and development of improved genetic screens was discontinued in favor of biochemical studies to study CI-Tum interactions. The expression of tum-derived proteins in maxicells (8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) indicated that up to four proteins (Orf95.1, .2, .4, and .5) are expressed from the tumreading frame. Plasmid-driven expression of these various proteins also demonstrated that the tum function responsible for prophage induction corresponded to the 146 amino acid Orf95.1 protein product (8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was used to create an NdeI site at the GTG initiation codon of Tum (Orf95.1), in a construct (pEC324 (8Brumby A.M. Lamont I. Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)) in which Orf95.4 and Orf95.5 expression had been abolished. This modifiedtum gene was initially cloned into the pET3a expression vector to give pEC363. That this clone produced functional protein was shown by the plaque phenotype of 186 on the bacterial strain HMS174[λDE3] hosting pEC363. Even without IPTG induction there was sufficient basal expression of Tum to give a clear plaque (no lysogens) phenotype in the presence of pEC363 but not the tum16 control pEC364. However, SDS-PAGE analysis of cell extracts prepared from induced cultures of HMS174[λDE3] pEC363 showed that very little of the Tum protein produced was in a soluble form. To facilitate purification of an active, soluble form of Tum, the gene was cloned into a modified expression vector such that the expressed protein contained a carboxyl-terminal six histidine tag (pET TumHis6). Again, analysis of the plaque phenotype of 186 when plated on HMS174[λDE3] pET TumHis6 showed that this vector, but not the corresponding tum16 construct, produced functional Tum protein. The presence of the histidine tag enabled the use of a one-step affinity purification procedure under denaturing conditions, followed by a simple refolding procedure, to yield milligram quantities of soluble protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). Purified TumHis6 and CI (isolated as described (21Shearwin K.E. Egan J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11525-11531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)) were used in a series of gel retardation assays to determine whether Tum-specific retardation of CI binding activity could be demonstrated in vitro. Several conclusions could be drawn from this series of experiments as follows. (i) As shown by Dodd and Egan (12Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11532-11540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), purified CI caused retardation of DNA fragments containing the pR (Fig. 5 a) and pB (Fig. 5 b) CI operator sequences. The presence of Tum resulted in a loss of the ability of CI to cause retardation of these fragments, confirming the in vivo result that Tum acts to prevent effective CI binding. (ii) Tum by itself did not give rise to retardation of the pR (Fig. 5 a) or pB (Fig. 5 b) containing fragments, indicating that Tum did not compete with CI for binding sites on the DNA. (iii) The inhibitory action of Tum was specific for CI binding. This was demonstrated using a DNA fragment that contained both the FR CI operator and the CII binding site. CII, a transcriptional activator required to establish lysogeny in 186, is like 186 CI, a helix turn helix protein, and binds to a 7-base pair inverted repeat sequence located at the beginning of the CII gene (19Neufing P.J.

Science. 1989; 244: 1351-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the mutation compromises the ability of CFTR to traffic out of the endoplasmic reticulum to its appropriate location on the apical plasma membrane (10Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. O'Riordan G.A. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Repair of the mutation can be effected by transferring wild-type CFTR into the mutant cell (11Drumm M. Pope H.A. Cliff W.H. Rommens J.M. Marvin S.A. Tsui L-C. Collins F.S. Wilson J.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1227-1233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and the long term strategy for treatment of cystic fibrosis has thus become focused on gene therapy at the level of the whole organism. However, it has also been observed that the ΔF508 CFTR does have intrinsic channel activity (12Drumm M.L. Wilkinson D.J. Smit L.S. Worrell R.T. Strong T.V. Frizzell R.A. Dawson D.C. Collins F.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12347-12350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, incubation of some mutant cells at low temperature (14Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), or in chemical chaperones such as 1 mglycerol (15Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), do permit the mutant CFTR to traffic out of the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Once at the membrane, the mutant CFTR exhibits cAMP-activated chloride channel activity, thereby permitting functional repair. These data have thus been interpreted to indicate that the ΔF508-CFTR is intrinsically active, and more recent data have shown that in some cells a small but measurable portion of the mutant CFTR actually spontaneously traffics to the vicinity of the plasma membrane (16Dalemanns W. Barby P. Champigny G. Jallet S. Dott K. Dreyer S.D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J-P. Lazdunski M.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 17Haws C.M. Nepomuceno I. Krouse M.E. Wakelee H. Law T. Xia Y. Nguyen H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 1544-1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data therefore suggest that an alternative way to overcome the reduced chloride transport in CF cells might be to find compounds which further activate the small portion of mutant CFTR chloride channels which have trafficked to the cell membrane. The adenosine A1-receptor antagonist CPX (8-cyclopentyl-1,3- dipropylxanthine) has been shown to stimulate36[Cl−] efflux from pancreatic CFPAC-1 cells (18Eidelman O. Guay-Broder C. van Galen P.J.M. Jacobson K.A. Fox C. Turner R.J. Cabantchik Z.I. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in the concentration range of 20–100 nm. These cells are homozygous for the ΔF508 genotype common to most cases of cystic fibrosis. Similar results were obtained with the CF tracheal epithelial cell line IB3–1 expressing the ΔF508 allele, and with recombinant mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells (19Guay-Broder C. Jacobson K.A. BarNoy S. Cabantchik Z.I. Guggino W.B. Zeitlin P.L. Turner R.J. Vergara L. Eidelman O. Pollard H.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9079-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Schweibert et al. (20Schweibert E. Gruenert D. Stanton B. Pediatric Pulm. 1992; S8: 257Google Scholar) have also shown that CPX (50 nm) activates outward chloride currents in whole cell patch studies of primary explants of nasal epithelial cells from homozygous ΔF508 CF patients as well as wild-type CFTR control cells. More recently, Haws et al.(17Haws C.M. Nepomuceno I. Krouse M.E. Wakelee H. Law T. Xia Y. Nguyen H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 1544-1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that CPX could activate iodide efflux from recombinant cells expressing ΔF508 CFTR. Thus wherever the CFTR mutant has been expressed, or in some favorable cases the wild-type CFTR, an effect of CPX on chloride efflux can be demonstrated. In considering how CPX activates wild-type CFTR or repairs mutant CFTR, it is possible that CPX action might either be directly on the CFTR molecule, or be secondary to binding of CPX to another protein (21Casavola V. Turner R.J. Guay-Broder C. Jacobson K.A. Eidelman O. Pollard H.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C226-C233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated above, CPX is best known as an adenosine A1-receptor antagonist (22Jacobson K.A. van Galen P.J.M. Williams M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). However, Northern blot analysis and structure-activity relationship (“SAR”) studies with 26 different compounds indicate that the A1-receptor is not responsible for CPX action in CFPAC cells (23Jacobson K.A. Guay-Broder C. van Galen P.J.M. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Melman N.K.A. Jacobson M.A. Eidelman O. Pollard H.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9088-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As one useful example, 1,3-diallyl-8-cyclohexylxanthine (DAX), a poor A1antagonist, is also highly potent and efficacious in stimulating chloride efflux from CFPAC-1 cells (23Jacobson K.A. Guay-Broder C. van Galen P.J.M. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Melman N.K.A. Jacobson M.A. Eidelman O. Pollard H.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9088-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus the site of action of these xanthines in stimulating chloride efflux appears to represent a novel site of action, possibly involving direct interaction with the CFTR molecule. Additional information consistent with this latter possibility are data indicating that radiolabeled CPX binds with high affinity to the recombinant first nucleotide-binding fold (NBF-1) of CFTR (24Cohen B.E. Lee G. Jacobson K.A. Kim Y-C. Huang Z. Sorscher E.J. Pollard H.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and to a subdomain within NBF-1 (25Lee G. Cohen B.E. BarNoy S. Eidelman O. Jaobson K.A. Pollard H.B. Pediatr. Pulm. 1995; S12: 185Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis directly at the single channel level, we have incorporated recombinant wild-type CFTR channels from HEK293 cell microsomal membranes into planar lipid bilayers, and tested whether CPX could activate chloride currents through CFTR channels. In addition, we tested whether DAX, another active CPX analogue, could also activate chloride currents through CFTR channels. We report here that both CPX and DAX potently activate cAMP-dependent CFTR chloride channels. Furthermore, both compounds affect CFTR channel kinetics differently, and in a manner predictable from their respective actions on chloride efflux from different cell types. Furthermore both CPX and DAX also bind with high affinity to the recombinant first nucleotide-binding fold domain (NBF-1) of CFTR (24Cohen B.E. Lee G. Jacobson K.A. Kim Y-C. Huang Z. Sorscher E.J. Pollard H.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data together indicate that the mechanism of CFTR channel activation very likely involves direct interaction of the drugs with the CFTR protein. We anticipate that this new information will contribute fundamentally to the rational development of these and related compounds for cystic fibrosis therapy.

Geneticin (G418, 250 μg/ml) was added to the cell culture media to maintain selection of the cells containing pCMV-EBNA vector until after CFTR gene transfer. pCEP4(CFTR) was then introduced to the cell using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies), and 2 days after transfection, the cells were passaged and selected for hygromycin resistance (hygromycin B, 260 μg/ml). Three weeks after transfection, microsomal vesicles were isolated from transfected cells. The expression of CFTR protein was conformed by Western blot using an antibody against the R domain of CFTR (mAb 13-1, Genzyme; Ref. 28Ma J. Tasch J.E. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J.

Microsomal vesicles were isolated from HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type CFTR protein using a modified protocol of Gunderson and Kopito (29Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19349-19353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (26Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 70: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 12 × 75-cm2 flasks of HEK 293 cells transfected with pCEP4(CFTR) vectors were harvested. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml benzamidine) before lysis by 10 strokes in a tight-fitting Dounce glass homogenizer, followed by 15 strokes after the addition of an equal volume of sucrose buffer (500 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2). Microsomes were collected by centrifugation of a postnuclear supernatant (600 × g for 15 min) at 100,000 ×g for 45 min, and resuspended in 1 ml of prephosphorylation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm Mg-ATP, and 100 units/ml PKA catalytic subunit). The membrane vesicles were stored at a protein concentration of 2–6 mg/ml at −75 °C until use. CPX was synthesized according to GMP (“Good Manufacturing Practice”) as part of our program for preparing CPX for clinical trials on cystic fibrosis patients. The CPX was solubilized at a concentration of 10 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide, and further diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide prior to dilution into the chamber solution. Prior to recording the effects of the drug, the contents of the chamber were mixed for 30 s using an internal mixing apparatus. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide never exceeded 1%, and this amount of dimethyl sulfoxide alone was found to be entirely inactive, either on the naked bilayer or on incorporated CFTR channels. DAX was synthesized as described previously (23Jacobson K.A. Guay-Broder C. van Galen P.J.M. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Melman N.K.A. Jacobson M.A. Eidelman O. Pollard H.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9088-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Planar bilayers were formed by applying a suspension of palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine and palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylserine, 1:1, 50 mg/ml, each in n-decane, to a hole of about 100–120 μm in diameter in a thin TeflonTM film separating two compartments that contained defined salt solutions (31Arispe N. Rojas E. Hartman J. Sorscher E.J. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Channels were incorporated from a suspension of microsomes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing wild-type CFTR. The microsomes were added to the cis chamber in small aliquots, and incorporation occurred directly from the experimental solutions. Currents associated with CFTR channels were observed shortly after the bilayer system was exposed to protein kinase A (100 units/ml). The specific conditions include a KCl gradient (cis = 200 mm; trans = 50 mm), (1 mm) MgCl2, and ATP (2 mm) in cis, and 10 mm Tris/HEPES in cis and trans, adjusted to a final pH of 7.0. Single channel currents were recorded using a patch-clamp amplifier (AXOPATCH-1D equipped with a CV-4B 0.1–100 Bilayer headstage, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and data were stored on magnetic tape using a pulse-code modulation/video cassette recorder digital system (Toshiba) with a frequency response in the range from direct current to 25,000 Hz. Off-line analysis of the recorded CFTR channel activity was carried out using the software package pClamp 5.51 and 6. (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data base files were obtained from playbacks of the experimental records digitized using a 12-bit analog to digital converter (TL-1 DMA interface, Axon Instruments) using the fetchex subroutine. The channel current signal from the PCM-VCR was fed through a low pass filter (eight-pole Bessel 902 LPF; Frequency Devices Inc., Haverhill, MA) in series with the ADC module. The filtering level was set between 50 and 100 Hz. As a rule the data base used for open time and close time distribution corresponded to filtered recordings with a signal to noise ratio of ≥4:1. HEK293 cells expressing a permanently transfected CFTR gene were grown and microsomes were prepared by differential centrifugation (30Tao T. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Zhao J. Davis P.B. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Microsomal membrane vesicles carrying the expressed protein were then incorporated into a planar lipid bilayer, and ionic currents measured in the presence of a chemical and potential gradient. Currents associated with CFTR channels were observed shortly after the bilayer system was exposed to protein kinase A (100 units/ml). The specific ionic conditions, as described under “Materials and Methods,” were maintained throughout all the experiments described in this work. As previously reported, these channels are insensitive to DIDS (50 μm), blocked by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (300 μm), and are selective for chloride (26Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Xie J. Drumm M.L. Zhao J. Ma J. Davis P.B.

Fig. 1 A, illustrates typical current events observed upon application of electrical potentials (−30, −50, or −80 mV) to the cis compartment. These events correspond to conductances of 7–10 pS, and additional current levels, double that of the first, are occasionally observed. These data indicate that more than one channel of the same type has been incorporated in the bilayer. In addition, we observe subconductances of about 2.5 pS, as described previously for CFTR channels (30Tao T. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Zhao J. Davis P.B. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows the expression of several combinations of these large and small CFTR conductances. To better visualize the relationships a more expanded amplitude scale is employed for records taken at −80 mV. In Fig. 1 B, part a) multiple larger current events are shown. In Fig. 1 B, part b, isolated smaller current events (smaller conductance) are shown, and in Fig. 1 B, part c, mixtures of the larger and smaller current events are observed. The relationship between amplitude and voltage for this family of current events is shown in the appended I-V curve (Fig. 1 C). The values of current in the I-V curves are calculated as the arithmetic mean ± S.E. The larger slope conductance (solid circles) is 6.7 pS, with an equilibrium potential of −21.5 mV. The smaller slope conductance (solid squares) is 2.6 pS, with an equilibrium potential of −22 mV. Thus on the basis of blocker sensitivity, chloride selectivity, and conductance states these channels correspond to CFTR activity. CFTR was incorporated into the planar lipid bilayer, and the channel modestly activated by addition of PKA and ATP (see “Materials and Methods”), Fig. 2 A. These data represent the control condition, in which the dominant motif is relatively low CFTR channel activity at the conductance level of 8.3 pS, and generated by a −50 mV driving force potential. Fig. 2 B shows continuous recordings of CFTR channel activity, generated by the same driving force 5 min after 500 nm CPX was added to the cis side of the planar lipid bilayer system. The figure represents 2 min of continuous recording. The overall general activity is considerably increased, and the system exhibits multilevels of current that were not observed under control conditions. Upon elevation of the CPX concentration to 2 μm (see Fig. 2 C), the general pattern of activity is reduced relative to the maximum at 500 nm CPX. However, it remains higher than control. This type of “bell-shaped response” is precisely what would have been predicted from our previously published results with the effect of CPX on chloride efflux from CF cells (19Guay-Broder C. Jacobson K.A. BarNoy S. Cabantchik Z.I. Guggino W.B. Zeitlin P.L. Turner R.J. Vergara L. Eidelman O. Pollard H.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9079-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Jacobson K.A. Guay-Broder C. van Galen P.J.M. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Melman N.K.A. Jacobson M.A. Eidelman O. Pollard H.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9088-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A kinetic analysis of these data, shown below, indicates that the effect of CPX is to increase the number and duration of open events of CFTR channels without modifying their conductance and selectivity. The I-V relationship for CFTR channels under control and 500 nm CPX conditions are shown in Fig. 3 A. To prepare these data we plotted the arithmetic mean current amplitude of unitary events recorded at different electrical potentials (≥59 events in control conditions and ≥257 events in the presence of CPX, for each potential). Regression lines fit for the two conditions are statistically identical, indicating that the slope conductances (8.2 pS) and equilibrium potentials (12 mV) for ion fluxes are the same for both conditions. This indicates that the ionic selectivity and the unitary conductance of CFTR channels are not affected by the interaction with the drug. Rather, the increased current activity of the system must be due to a direct effect of CPX on the kinetics of the CFTR channel behavior. The action of CPX on the CFTR conductance can be most clearly visualized by construction of amplitude histograms from current records. Fig. 3 B, left panel, shows such an amplitude histogram from a control record summarizing the distribution of amplitudes at −50 mV. The Gaussian distribution of the mean amplitudes of these events gives an average amplitude of 0.48 pA (59 unitary events). In the presence of 500 nm CPX (Fig. 3 B, right panel) the amplitude histogram of all events occurring during 2 min recording reveals that the events are distributed in three levels. The principal Gaussian peak (number 1)(749 events) is very similar to that of the control in the absence of CPX. The additional peaks (number 2 (257 events) and number 3 (9 events)) are exact multiples of the principal peak. These data indicate that the CPX-induced increase in CFTR activity are likely to be additional CFTR channels. A second approach to the analysis of CPX action on the CFTR channel is to create a scatter plot of amplitudes as a function of duration of the events. The large solid dot symbols in Fig. 3 Care the values of current amplitudes at −50 mV under control conditions. The cross symbols are the values of current amplitude after the application of 500 nm CPX. These data indicate that whatever the duration of the event the mean amplitudes are the same, regardless of the presence or absence of CPX. Furthermore, the control condition and the lower level measured in the presence of CPX appear to be quite coincident. However, in the presence of CPX, a very well defined second level occurs at an amplitude which is twice the control. Furthermore, this level is constant regardless of the duration of the event. The conclusions from both analytic approaches similarly indicate that CPX increases the number of active CFTR channels. Data shown later (see Fig. 7) indicate that CPX also increases the open time probability. As mentioned above, the smaller 2.5 pS conductance associated with CFTR expression can, on occasion, be incorporated as a single channel in isolation from the larger 7–10 pS CFTR conductance. We therefore took advantage of several such instances to study the influence of CPX on the smaller conductance. Addition of CPX also increased the overall activity of the 2.5 pS conductance. For a better signal to noise ratio, we analyzed this increased activity at a large potential. As shown in Fig. 4 A, control conditions at a membrane potential of −100 mV (upper panel) are characterized predominantly by brief spikes, which under the 50 Hz filtering conditions give an apparent average open time of 8 ms and an apparent arithmetic mean amplitude of 0.08 pA. After the addition of 500 nm CPX the activity of the channel increases profoundly, with the apparent arithmetic mean amplitude increasing to 0.14 pA (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). The effect of CPX is to increase the duration of single events. Quantitatively, the open time probability increases from about 8% in control conditions to 35–38% in the presence of CPX. Since the control amplitude of 0.08 pA is the average spike amplitude observed under high filtering conditions (50 Hz), the apparent increase in current amplitude mediated by CPX may not be the real effect of the drug. This is because the amplitudes of longer events are less attenuated by the filtering condition. Thus, alternatively, the apparent increase in current amplitude could also be a consequence of the ability of CPX to prolong the open time of individual events. To test the latter hypothesis we plotted open time histograms of the 2.5 pS CFTR conductance for both control and 500 nm CPX conditions. Channel activity of the 2.5 pS conductance under control conditions is characterized by predominantly brief spikes with an average duration of 8 ms (see upper panel of Fig. 4 B). A minor peak is observed at approximately 24 ms. In the presence of CPX (see lower panel, Fig. 4 B) the increase in open time duration is not monotonic but is distributed into three main Gaussian populations, with peak durations of 9, 27, and 44 ms, respectively. However, we observe that the 27 ms population in the CPX treated condition is actually present to a very minor extent in the drug-free condition (viz. the 24 ms population in the control histogram in the upper panel of Fig. 4 B). These data therefore suggest that the CPX may activate or modify existing 2.5 pS CFTR channels, rather than merely recruit cryptic or new CFTR channels. We conclude that these data support the concept that addition of CPX not only increases the number of events, but also their duration. DAX is also a potent activator of chloride conductance in CF cells, much like CPX, which we hypothesized might also activate CFTR channels. To study this possibility we followed the same protocol used to study CPX. Therefore, prior to the addition of DAX we established an active CFTR channel using PKA/ATP (see “Materials and Methods”). We then added DAX at various concentrations and studied the channel activity at various membrane potentials. In all conditions, addition of DAX produced a profound increase in basal channel activity. Fig. 5 A summarizes one of those results for a driving force potential of −50 mV. The data representing the control condition show a dominant motif of relatively low activity at the level of 7–10 pS. The 2.5 pS conductance is absent from this example. DAX (500 nm) is then added to the cisside of the planar lipid bilayer system. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the number of channel events is considerably increased. By inspection, at least four different levels c"

Differential scanning calorimetry of the native enzyme showed the presence of two well defined peaks identified as the metal free and holoprotein. Unlike dimeric Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases, the unfolding of the monomeric enzyme was found to be highly reversible, a behavior that may be explained by the absence of free cysteines and the highly polar nature of its molecular surface. The melting temperature of the E. coli enzyme was found to be pH-dependent with the holoenzyme transition centered at 66 °C at pH 7.8 and at 79.3 °C at pH 6.0. The active-site metals, which were easily displaced from the active site by EDTA, were found to enhance the thermal stability of the monomeric apoprotein but to a lower extent than in the dimeric enzymes from eukaryotic sources. Apo-superoxide dismutase from E. coli was shown to be nearly as stable as the bovine apoenzyme, whose holo form is much more stable and less sensitive to pH variations. The remarkable pH susceptibility of the E. coli enzyme structure was paralleled by the slow decrease in activity of the enzyme incubated at alkaline pH and by modification of the EPR spectrum at lower pH values than in the case of dimeric enzymes. Unlike eukaryotic Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases, the active-site structure of the E. coli enzyme was shown to be reversibly perturbed by urea. These observations suggest that the conformational stability of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases is largely due to the intrinsic stability of the β-barrel fold rather than to the dimeric structure and that pH sensitivity and weak metal binding of the E. coli enzyme are due to higher flexibility and accessibility to the solvent of its active-site region.

They have been found in the cytoplasm of all the eukaryotic cells and in the periplasm of several bacterial species (1Bannister J.V. Bannister W.H. Rotilio G. CRC Crit. Rev.

Eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs are homodimers that contain one atom of zinc and one atom of copper per subunit and catalyze the dismutation of the superoxide anion at a diffusion-limited rate enhanced by electrostatic guidance of the substrate to the active site (3Desideri A. Falconi M. Polticelli F. Bolognesi M. Djinovic K. Rotilio G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cu,Zn-SODs possess a very compact structure that is highly resistant to denaturing agents such as urea and SDS and to attack by proteolytic enzymes. Several factors are thought to contribute to the enzyme stability, including the prosthetic metal ions (4Forman H.S. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the intrasubunit disulfide bond (5Abernethy J.L. Steinman H.M. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Structural and functional properties of bacterial Cu,Zn-SODs have not yet been studied in detail, but amino acid comparisons (7Bordo D. Djinovic-Carugo K. Bolognesi M. J. Mol.

Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have shown that prokaryotic and eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs share a conserved ligand stereochemistry and a very similar monomer fold, based on a flattened Greek-key eight-stranded β-barrel. However, despite these similarities, in P.leiognathi Cu,Zn-SOD the dimer interface is formed from β-strands that are different with respect to the eukaryotic enzymes (10Bourne Y. Redford S.M. Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that, starting from a putative monomeric SOD precursor, prokaryotic and eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs have convergently evolved toward a dimeric structure, which may be important for the enzyme biological function.Since the discovery of Cu,Zn-SOD, there has been interest in understanding if the dimeric structure contributes to the high catalytic efficiency and to the remarkable stability of this class of enzymes. All attempts to obtain monomeric Cu,Zn-SODs by treatments with detergents (11Rigo A. Marmocchi F. Cocco D. Viglino P. Rotilio G. Biochemistry. 1978; 175: 534-537Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or site-directed substitutions of hydrophobic residues at the dimer interface (12Bertini I. Piccioli M. Viezzoli M.S. Chiu C.Y. Mullenbach G.T. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have provided enzymes that display very low catalytic activity and gross alterations of the spectroscopic properties. These dramatic changes probably reflect changes in the tertiary structure consequent to rearrangements of the solvent-exposed hydrophobic dimer interface.A valuable tool to investigate the role of the dimeric structure in Cu,Zn-SODs is represented by the recently discovered enzyme from Escherichia coli (13Benov L.T. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25310-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which we have shown to be monomeric (9Battistoni A. Folcarelli S. Gabbianelli R. Capo C. Rotilio G.

Folcarelli S. Rotilio G. Capasso C. Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Desideri A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2125-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and which possesses a catalytic activity very close to that of the human and bovine enzymes (9Battistoni A. Folcarelli S.

Med. 1996; 21: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This finding does not exclude the possibility of a more subtle regulation of activity in the dimeric enzymes but demonstrates that the dimeric structure is not necessary to ensure efficient catalytic activity. Moreover, the different organization of the dimer interface of P. leiognathi and eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs strongly argues against the existence of a common mechanism of communication between the subunits.An alternative explanation that could account for a selective advantage of subunit association is that the dimeric structure provides a substantial contribution to the stability of the enzyme. The stability of the tertiary structure of the enzyme has been the focal point of several investigations. It was shown that eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs are characterized by a high conformational melting temperature and undergo irreversible denaturation at temperature values higher than 70 °C (17Lepock J.R.

Frontiers of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biology and Medicine. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1994: 129-130Google Scholar). To understand if the dimeric structure substantially contributes to the stability of Cu,Zn-SODs, we have undertaken an investigation of the thermal unfolding of the monomeric E. coli enzyme by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). We have found that denaturation of this enzyme is reversible and that the temperature of unfolding is largely affected by small variations of pH. This pH-dependent thermal stability is consistent with a similar dependence of activity upon incubation of the enzyme at alkaline pH and by sensitivity of metal binding and EPR spectrum to pH variations. These findings, together with the observation that urea is able to induce modifications of the copper site, at variance with the insensitivity of the eukaryotic enzymes, suggest that the monomeric structure allows the solvent to alter the microenvironment of the active site more readily than in the dimeric enzymes.DISCUSSIONThe DSC thermograms of the E. coli Cu,Zn-SOD purified from cells overexpressing the enzyme consist of two well resolved components whose transition temperatures are both highly influenced by pH. According to the denaturation profiles of the apo and of the copper-free zinc-containing derivatives and to the different ΔCp values of the two forms (negative for the first component and positive for the second one), we assign the first peak to the presence of a metal-free form and the second one to holo-Cu,Zn-SOD. The presence of a consistent amount of apoprotein is not usual in Cu,Zn-SOD preparations as the eukaryotic enzymes are generally purified with a nearly complete zinc and copper complement comprised of between 1.5 and 2.0 atoms of metal/protein dimer. However, the results reported in Fig. 4 indicate that, at variance with eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs, the E. colienzyme has a lower affinity for the active-site metals, both of which can be removed by EDTA at pH > 6 (Fig. 4 B). This finding is in agreement with a recent report showing that the metals are easily lost by the enzyme also at room temperature and that the addition of zinc or copper to the enzyme solution increases the recovery of activity of the heat-inactivated enzyme (29Benov L.

Frontiers of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biology and Medicine. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1994: 129-130Google Scholar), but the results obtained by different authors are not always directly comparable to each other, as the unfolding of the enzyme is significantly influenced by solvent composition and scan rate (18Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D. Valentine J.S. Markey L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the contribution of the quaternary structure to the stability of the enzyme, we have performed DSC experiments under a condition that has been used previously to study the thermal stability of a number of Cu,Zn-SODs. In Table III, the Tm values of some Cu,Zn-SODs variants are reported, showing that the E. coli enzyme is significantly less stable than all the other variants so far studied. The difference is particularly evident with respect to the bovine, ovine, and human enzymes, which possess a Tm about 20 °C higher, whereas the Tm of the monomeric enzyme is less than 8 degrees lower than that found for the Cu,Zn-SOD from yeast, X. laevis, and the prokaryote P. leiognathi. This finding suggests that subunit interactions may provide a contribution to the thermostability of this class of enzymes, but also that the compactness of the β-barrel fold is sufficient to confer a remarkable conformational stability to the monomeric Cu,Zn-SOD. This statement is reinforced by DSC experiments carried out at lower pH, which showed that the stability of the Cu,Zn-SOD from E. coli is heavily influenced by pH in the relatively narrow interval roughly corresponding to the physiological pH range of an enteric bacterium. In fact, we have found that the Tm of the holoprotein at pH 6.0 is 79.3 °C, about 14 °C higher than the Tm observed at pH 7.8, whereas the difference for the apoenzyme is 6 °C between this two pH values. Such a pH-dependent stability is a peculiar feature of the E. coli enzyme, as the Tm of the bovine enzyme is stable in the 6.0–8.0 pH range (18Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D. Valentine J.S. Markey L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and it is well established that the spectroscopic and catalytic properties of all the eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs are stable in this pH range (26Rotilio G. Finazzi Agrò A. Calabrese L. Bossa F. Guerrieri P. Mondovı̀ B. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30O'Neill P. Davies S. Fielden E.M. Calabrese L. Capo C.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the Tm at pH 7.8 of the apoenzyme from E. coli is very similar to that of the bovine enzyme, and that metals increase the Tm of the protein only 13 °C compared with the 35 °C increase reported for the bovine enzyme under the same conditions (21Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Giartosio A. Musci G. Carlini P. Calabrese L. Asada K. Yoshikawa T. Frontiers of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biology and Medicine. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1994: 129-130Google Scholar). Moreover, it was previously shown that metal-induced reorganization of the active site is critical for the pH stability of eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs, as the stability of the bovine apoenzyme is pH-dependent, reaching its maximumTm value near pH 6.0 (18Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D. Valentine J.S. Markey L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that differences in the active-site structure of eukaryotic and prokaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs are major determinants of their different thermal stability.Table IIITm of different Cu,Zn-SODsSODTm°COx88.0Sheep87.1Human83.6Shark84.1Yeast73.1X. laevis A71.1X. laevis B76.8P. leiognathi71.0E. coli65.9 Open table in a new tab The high pH sensitivity of the monomeric enzyme is confirmed by a titration of the EPR spectrum as a function of pH, showing that the protein-bound copper assumes a biuret type of conformation at much lower pH values (10.5 versus 12.5) than the Cu,Zn-SODs from ox (26Rotilio G. Finazzi Agrò A. Calabrese L. Bossa F. Guerrieri P. Mondovı̀ B. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and P. leiognathi (27Foti D. LoCurto B. Cuzzocrea G. Stroppolo M.E. Polizio F. Venanzi M. Desideri A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7109-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These findings, together with the previously reported inactivation in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.8 (13Benov L.T. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25310-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Battistoni A. Rotilio G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), clearly demonstrate that the enzyme from E. coli is more sensitive to alkaline denaturation than the highly homologous dimeric protein from the bacterium P. leiognathi. Moreover, we have also observed that the enzyme loses its catalytic activity upon incubation at 37 °C, and that the extent of this inactivation is pH- and buffer-dependent. The enzyme activity is stable at pH 6.0, but at higher pH values, the activity significantly drops to reach 38% of its initial value in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8. Also the eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs are inhibited at alkaline pH, but this inhibition, due to protonic equilibria of basic residues near the active site of the enzyme (31Polticelli F. Battistoni A. O'Neill P. Rotilio G. Desideri A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), occurs at higher pH values. Therefore, the time-dependent loss of activity of E. coli Cu,Zn-SOD at much lower pH values is rather indicative of a conformational change involving the active-site structure. Inspection of E. coli Cu,Zn-SOD amino acid sequence (8Imlay K.R.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Battistoni A. Folcarelli S. Gabbianelli R. Capo C. Rotilio G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and of the recently solved three-dimensional structure of the dimeric enzyme from P. leiognathi (10Bourne Y. Redford S.M. Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) may provide some clues in this regard. Bacterial enzymes share with the monomer of eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs a conserved β-barrel topology (7Bordo D. Djinovic-Carugo K. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 8Imlay K.R.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Battistoni A. Folcarelli S.

Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but display differences in the organization of the major loops. In particular, the architecture of the active site is largely modified by a 4-amino acid deletion in loop 7,8 and a 7-amino acid insertion in the “S-S” subloop that creates a very long and solvent-exposed loop, containing a cluster of charged residues that are strictly conserved in all the bacterial Cu,Zn-SODs. These charged residues have been proposed to be involved in substrate steering to the active site (10Bourne Y. Redford S.M. Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but could also play an important structural role. The lack of dimeric structure in the E. coli enzyme, which is characterized by a highly polar molecular surface (9Battistoni A. Folcarelli S. Gabbianelli R. Capo C. Rotilio G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), could increase flexibility of this loop and explain its unusual active-site accessibility. Alterations in the active-site structure of the monomeric enzyme may be inferred by the EPR and optical spectra that are clearly different with respect to that of the eukaryotic and P. leiognathi enzymes (26Rotilio G. Finazzi Agrò A. Calabrese L. Bossa F. Guerrieri P. Mondovı̀ B. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Foti D. LoCurto B. Cuzzocrea G. Stroppolo M.E. Polizio F. Venanzi M. Desideri A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7109-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All these observations suggest that the copper environment of E. coli Cu,Zn-SOD may be more susceptible to solvent modifications than that of the dimeric enzymes. This is confirmed by the urea-induced alteration of the copper site of the E. coli enzyme, as deduced by the changes of its optical spectrum as a function of urea concentration. It is interesting to note that the monomeric derivatives of human and wheat germ Cu,Zn-SODs display a more axial coordination of the copper chromophore (11Rigo A. Marmocchi F. Cocco D. Viglino P. Rotilio G. Biochemistry. 1978; 175: 534-537Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Bertini I. Piccioli M. Viezzoli M.S. Chiu C.Y. Mullenbach G.T. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and an increased distance of the water-coordinated molecule (12Bertini I. Piccioli M. Viezzoli M.S. Chiu C.Y. Mullenbach G.T. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the dimeric structure may be important to reduce flexibility of the active site also in Cu,Zn-SODs lacking the 7-residue insertion found in the bacterial enzymes.One of the most intriguing features of the E. coli enzyme evidenced by DSC experiments, pH titration of the EPR spectrum, and recovery of activity of the enzyme incubated at alkaline pH is its efficient reversibility of unfolding. All dimeric Cu,Zn-SODs have been shown to undergo irreversible aggregation after exposure to temperatures higher than Tm, with the only exception being the yeast enzyme, which partially refolds to a new conformation of lower stability than the native one (10Bourne Y. Redford S.M. Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Lepock J.R. Arnold L.D. Torrie B.H.

Frontiers of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biology and Medicine. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1994: 129-130Google Scholar). At least two factors are known to be involved in this phenomenon: metal ions and free cysteines. It is well established that incorrect disulfide bond formation, concomitant with cysteine oxidation probably enhanced by metals, is a cause of aggregation of heat-denatured proteins (32Perry L.J. Wetzel R. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the case of Cu,Zn-SODs it has been observed that the denaturation of the bovine apoenzyme is partially reversible (18Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D. Valentine J.S. Markey L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and that the substitution by site-directed mutagenesis of Cys residues not involved in disulfide bonds, although producing moderate effects on conformational stability (19McRee D.E.

Mullenbach G.T. Cousens L.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), greatly increases the reversibility of thermal denaturation of human and bovine Cu,Zn-SODs thermal denaturation. Moreover, the only dimeric Cu,Zn-SOD, which shows a partial reversibility after a DSC scan is the yeast enzyme, which does not contain free cysteines (17Lepock J.R. Arnold L.D. Torrie B.H. Andrews B. Kruuv J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Cu,Zn-SOD from E. coli does not contains cysteines that could cause formation of incorrect disulfide bonds, and this undoubtedly contributes to its efficient refolding. However, the dimeric enzyme from P. leiognathi also denatures irreversibly (10Bourne Y. Redford S.M. Steinman H.M. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12774-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) despite lack of free cysteines. Probably, solvent-induced distortion of the hydrophobic subunit interface plays a role in the aggregation of heat-denatured dimeric Cu,Zn-SODs, whereas the polar nature of the E. coliCu,Zn-SOD surface favors its efficient refolding to the native structure. Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases (Cu,Zn-SODs) 1The abbreviations used are: Cu,Zn-SOD, Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; Cp, heat capacity. 1The abbreviations used are: Cu,Zn-SOD, Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; Cp, heat capacity. are metalloenzymes involved in the mechanisms of cellular defense against oxidative damage. They have been found in the cytoplasm of all the eukaryotic cells and in the periplasm of several bacterial species (1Bannister J.V. Bannister W.H. Rotilio G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 111-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 2Kroll J.S. Langford P.R. Wilks K. Keil A.D. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2271-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic Cu,Zn-SODs are homodimers that contain one atom of zinc and one atom of copper per subunit and catalyze the dismutation of the superoxide anion at a diffusion-limited rate enhanced by electrostatic guidance of the substrate to the active site (3Desideri A. Falconi M. Polticelli F. Bolognesi M. Djinovic K. Rotilio G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cu,Zn-SODs possess a very compact structure that is highly resistant to denaturing agents such as urea and SDS and to attack by proteolytic enzymes. Several factors are thought to contribute to the enzyme stability, including the prosthetic metal ions (4Forman H.S. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the intrasubunit disulfide bond (5Abernethy J.L. Steinman H.M. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Kv channels in mammalian cells are encoded by an extended family of at least nineteen genes (2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-72Google Scholar). The largest subfamily, Kv1, is related to the fly Shaker gene and contains six members,Kv1.1–Kv1.6 (2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-72Google Scholar). The Shaker gene has 21 exons, which can be alternatively spliced to generate at least five functionally distinct transcripts (8Pongs O. Kecskemethy N. Muller R. Krah-Jentgens I. Baumann A. Kiltz H.H.

In contrast, the protein-coding regions of each of the six known mammalianKv1 genes and the three known Xenopus homologues are contained in a single exon (2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A.

The evolutionary significance of this pattern of organization remains a puzzle. Here we report the identification of a novel mammalian gene,Kv1.7 (Kcna7/KCNA7), that has a genomic organization distinct from the other members of the vertebrateKv1 subfamily. We have defined the chromosomal location of this gene in the mouse and human genome, determined its tissue distribution, and characterized the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the cloned channel. Three overlapping genomic clones (KC225, KC254, and KC256) were isolated from an AKR/J mouse genomic library screened with a mixture of mKv1.1 and rKv1.5 cDNA probes, as described previously (10Chandy K.G.

Interspecific backcross progeny were generated by mating (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)F1 females and (C57BL/6J) males, and a total of 205 N2 mice were used to map the two mouse genes, mKv1.7/Kcna7 and mKv3.3/Kcnc3, as described previously (11Ghanshani S.

The probe for mKv1.7 was the entire 6.4-kb EcoRI fragment shown in Fig. 1, and that for mouse Kv3.3 was a 4-kb genomic HindIII fragment containing the entire 3′-exon (11Ghanshani S. Pak M.

Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombination events required to account for the allele distribution patterns. Fluorescentin situ hybridization of cosmids to metaphase human chromosomes was carried out as described previously (21Brandriff B.F. Gordon L.A. Tynan K.T. Olsen A.S. Mohrenweiser H.W. Fertitta A.

A Northern blot of poly(A)+ RNA from mouse heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis (CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was probed with the mouse Kv1.7-specific 3′-noncoding region sequence. The PstI/SacIKv1.7 3′-noncoding region was labeled by the random primer method (Boehringer Mannheim Random Primed DNA labeling kit). The RNA blot was hybridized at 60 °C for 18 h, washed at a final stringency of 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 1 h, and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen for 3 days. cRNA probes labeled with α-35S-labeled UTP (1300 Ci/mmol) were alkaline-denatured to an average size of 100 nucleotides and used for in situhybridization on pancreatic frozen sections (6–10 μm thick) from db/db mice. Briefly, sections were hybridized overnight at 42 °C, RNase treated, washed five times in 0.5 × SSC at 65 °C, coated with Ilford K5 photographic emulsion, and exposed at 4 °C for varying times. After development, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin Y and examined with a Leitz Aristoplan microscope equipped with reflected polarized light to visualize silver grains in dark field. The probes used for hybridization were as follows: insulin, 1.6-kb human insulin gene including the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (ATCC no. 57399);hKv3.4, 1.9-kb cDNA fragment spanning S1 through the 3′ end of the coding region (0.6 kb), and 1.3 kb of the 3′-noncoding region; mKv1.7, 540-bp PstI/SacI fragment containing 29 bp of C-terminal coding sequence and 511 bp of 3′-noncoding sequence. To make a mKv1.7expression construct we amplified a 588-bp fragment from mouse brain cDNA spanning the region encoded by the two Kv1.7 exons using reverse transcriptase PCR (5′-primer, 5′-TCTCCGTACTCGTCATCCTGG-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-AAATGGGTGTCCACCCGGTC-3′). Exon 1 (850-bpBspHI/BinI fragment), a 283-bpBinI/BglII fragment of our 588-bp PCR product, and exon 2 (747-bp BglII/HindIII), were ligated together at BinI and BglII sites to generate “fragment I” (1880 bp). Fragment I was blunt-ended at the 5′ end and cloned into the pBluescript vector atSmaI/HindIII sites. To remove the 5′-NCR from fragment I, and for the purpose of cloning this fragment into the pBSTA expression vector, we introduced a unique BamHI site just upstream of the initiator methionine using PCR: 5′-primer, 5′-ACAAAAGCTTCATATGACTACAAGGAAAGCT-3′; and 3′-primer: 5′-AAGCGCAACCCGGCCACG-3′. The resulting PCR product (corresponding to the first 233 nucleotides of the coding region) was spliced to fragment I at the NcoI site, and the 1870-nucleotide fragment was ligated to the pBSTA vector. mKv1.7 cRNA was transcribed in vitro (Ambion Kit, Austin, TX) and diluted in a 0.1–0.5% fluorescein-dextran (Mr 10,000, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 100 mm KCl. Rat basophilic leukemic (RBL) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and glutamine, and were plated onto glass coverslips one day prior to use for electrophysiological experiments. RBL cells were injected with cRNA using pre-pulled injection capillaries (Femtotip) in combination with an Eppendorf microinjection system (micromanipulator 5171 and transjector 5242; Madison, WI) as described previously (23Ikeda S.R. Soler F. Zuhlke R.D. Lewis D.L. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 422: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Four to six hours later, fluorescent cRNA-injected cells were evaluated electrophysiologically. All membrane currents were recorded at room temperature (22–26 °C) with a LIST EPC-7 amplifier (Heka Elektronik, Germany). Series resistance compensation was employed if the current exceeded 2 nA, and the command input was controlled by a PDP 11/73 computer via a digital-to-analog converter. Capacitative and leak currents were subtracted using a P/8 procedure and the holding potential in all experiments was −80 mV. When membrane currents exceeded 2 nA 80% series resistance compensation was used. A restriction map of a 6.4-kb EcoRI DNA fragment containing the entire mouse Kv1.7 coding region is shown in Fig. 1. The coding region is contained in two exons separated by a 1.9-kb intron. The upstream exon encodes the entire N terminus, S1, and part of the S1-S2 loop. The downstream exon contains the region extending from the S1-S2 loop to the C-terminal end of the protein. The intron-exon splice sites were determined by comparing the genomic sequence with cDNA sequences obtained from the hamster insulinoma cell line, HIT-T1S, and from mouse brain (Fig. 1). The complete coding sequence of the mKv1.7 is shown in Fig. 2. The mKv1.7 sequence is identical in the N terminus from bp 52 to 996 with the mouse EST sequence AA021711. Betsholtz et al. (24Betsholtz C. Baumann A. Kenna S. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J. Berggren P.O. Grupe A. Pongs O. Rorsman P. Sandblom J. Welsh M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) amplified a short segment of Kv1.7 cDNA spanning the S5/S6 region from mouse (MK-6), rat (RK-6), and hamster (HaK-6) insulin-producing cells using PCR. Our sequence is identical to their MK-6 sequence, except for four nucleotide changes. The deduced mKv1.7 protein consists of 532 amino acids and contains six putative membrane-spanning domains, S1–S6 (Fig. 2). The hydrophobic core of this protein shares considerable sequence similarity with otherShaker family channels, while the intracellular N and C termini and the external loops between S1/S2 and S3/S4 show little conservation. The protein contains conserved sites for post-translational modifications as indicated in Fig. 2. As do all other Shaker-related channels, mKv1.7 has a potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (RPSFDAVLY) in its N-terminal region (2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-72Google Scholar); the proline-rich stretch within the N terminus (see residues 29–42) may be a binding site for SH3 domains of tyrosine kinases. Two protein kinase C consensus sites (Ser/Thr-X-Arg/Lys) are present in the cytoplasmic loop between S4 and S5 of mKv1.7; at least one of these sites is present in all members of the Kv1 family (2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-72Google Scholar). mKv1.7, like Kv1.6, lacks anN-glycosylation site in the extracellular loop linking the S1 and S2 transmembrane segments; this consensus sequence is conserved in all other Kv1 family genes. Fig. 3 shows a phylogenetic tree of the entire Shaker family of genes based on parsimony analysis of a nucleotide sequence alignment (generated from the amino acid sequence alignment) using the program PAUP (25Swofford D.L. PAUP: Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony. Computer program distributed by the Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1993Google Scholar). Our analysis placesmKv1.7 within the Shaker family of genes. The mKv1.7 gene does not cluster with any of the known genes, and its position within the tree is not firmly established. The mKv1.7/Kcna7 gene resides on mouse chromosome 7 (Fig. 4 A), ∼0.5 centimorgan telomeric to the Shaw-related K+ channel gene,mKv3.3/Kcnc3, and ∼2.4 centimorgans centromeric of MyoD1 (myoblast differentiation factor). The most centromeric marker in this study was Gpi1 (glucose phosphate isomerase 1), which mapped ∼6.1 centimorgans centromeric tomKv3.3/Kcnc3. The interval on mouse chromosome 7 containing mKv1.7/Kcna7 and mKv3.3/Kcnc3 shares a region of homology with human chromosomes 19q13 and 11p15, and the human homologues of these K+ channel genes may therefore be expected to reside on one of these chromosomes. Confirming this prediction, we mapped both genes to human 19q13.3–13.4 using fluorescent in situhybridization. The idiogram of human chromosome 19 shown in Fig. 4 B, and a more detailed map shown in Fig. 4 C, indicate that hKv1.7/KCNA7 is located ∼1.3 mb centromeric of hKv3.3/KCNC3. The genes for both muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1) and the histidine-rich calcium protein (HRC) also map to this region; Kv1.7/KCNA7 lies ∼25 kb telomeric to GYS1 and ∼200 kb centromeric to HRC (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, a putative diabetes susceptibility gene has been suggested to be present at 19q13.3 (26Groop L.C. Kankuri M. Schalin-Jantti C. Ekstrand A. Nikula-Ijas P. Widen E. Kuismanen E.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), especially in Finnish families with associated hypertension and difficulties in insulin-stimulated glucose storage. This region has also been suggested to contain a modifier locus for cystic fibrosis (28Estivill X. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We carried out a detailed characterization of mKv1.7 channels expressed in RBL cells which express no native Kv currents (29McCloskey M. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 208-222Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Nguyen QA Kath J. Hanson D.C. Biggers M.S. Canniff P.C. Donovan C.B. Mather R.J. Bruns M.J. Rauer H. Aiyar J. Lepple-Wienhues A. Gutman G.A. Grissmer S. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1672-1679PubMed Google Scholar). The mKv1.7 gene expressed in Xenopus oocytes produced currents (data not shown) similar to those obtained in RBL cells (Fig. 5). Patch clamp studies were performed in the whole-cell mode. Fig. 5 A shows a family of outward currents elicited by a 200 ms depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of −80 mV in RBL cells injected with mKv1.7 cRNA; no outward currents were detected in control cells (data not shown). The currents activate rapidly, and from the conductance-voltage curve shown in Fig. 5 B we determined that the 1/2 activation potential (V1/2) is −20 mV. Inactivation of mKv1.7 channels was rapid following a 200 ms depolarizing pulse from −80 to 40 mV (Fig. 5 A). The rate of inactivation, measured by fitting the data to a single exponential function, yielded a time constant (τh) of 14 ± 2.1 ms (S.E., n = 7). As shown in Fig. 5 C, the current became progressively smaller following repeated depolarizing pulses at 1-s intervals. This phenomenon, termed “cumulative inactivation,” is due to the accumulation of channels in the inactivated state which are then unavailable for opening. The related channels, Kv1.3 (7Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and Kv1.4 (31Wymore R. Korenberg J.R. Coyne C. Chen X-N Hustad C. Copeland N.G. Gutman G.A. Jenkins N.A. Chandy K.G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), also display this behavior. The kinetics of channel closing (deactivation) was determined by first opening the channels with a 15 ms conditioning depolarizing pulse, and then forcing the channels to close by repolarizing to different potentials (Fig. 5 D). The time constant, τtail, of the resulting “tail” current was 5.1 and 5.3 ms at −60 mV in two cells. We measured single-channel currents in an outside-out patch by applying 450-ms voltage ramps from −90 to 80 mV every second (Fig. 5 E). Single channel events were seen at potentials more positive than ∼−15 mV. The single-channel conductance of 21 pS was estimated from the slope of the current recorded during an opening (Fig. 5 E). We determined the pharmacological sensitivity of the mKv1.7 channel using methods described previously (30Nguyen QA Kath J. Hanson D.C. Biggers M.S. Canniff P.C. Donovan C.B. Mather R.J. Bruns M.J.

Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar), IC50 values in each case being determined when block reached steady-state. The channel was blocked by several non-peptide small molecule antagonists, 4-aminopyridine (IC50 = 245 μm), capsaicin (25 μm), cromakalim (450 μm), tedisamil (18 μm), nifedipine (13 μm), diltiazem (65 μm), and resiniferatoxin (20 μm). Surprisingly, the dihydroquinoline compound, CP-339,818, that blocks rapidly inactivating Kv1 channels in the nanomolar range (30Nguyen QA Kath J. Hanson D.C. Biggers M.S. Canniff P.C. Donovan C.B. Mather R.J. Bruns M.J. Rauer H. Aiyar J. Lepple-Wienhues A. Gutman G.A. Grissmer S. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1672-1679PubMed Google Scholar), had little effect on mKv1.7 (IC50 = 10 μm). The channel was insensitive to externally applied tetraethylammonium (C50 = 86 mm), probably because the residue at the tetraethylammonium-binding site, Ala-441 (Fig. 2), is hydrophobic. The mKv1.7 channel is also potently blocked by a peptide (ShK toxin) obtained from sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus(IC50 = 13 nm), and by the scorpion toxins, noxiustoxin (IC50 = 18 nm) and margatoxin (IC50 = 116 nm). The channel was resistant to charybdotoxin (IC50 >1000 nm) and kaliotoxin (IC50 >1000 nm). Northern blot assays using a mKv1.7-specific probe revealed strongly hybridizing 3-kb bands in heart and skeletal muscle; faint bands of similar size were visible in liver and lung (together with larger 7–8-kb bands), but none were seen in spleen, kidney, testis, or brain (Fig. 6) We were able to isolatemKv1.7 transcripts from mouse brain by PCR (see Fig. 1). mKv1.7 is also expressed in placenta, since the mouse EST AA021711 was derived from this tissue. PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of haKv1.7 mRNAs in hamster insulinoma cells (Fig. 1). We verified the presence of mKv1.7 mRNA in pancreatic islet cells obtained from 9–16-week-old diabetic db/db mice by in situhybridization (Fig. 7 C) using a mKv1.7-specific antisense probe (12deJong P.J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 491-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar); mKv1.7 mRNA was also present in islets from normal db/+ mice (data not shown). Scattered acinar cells outside the islets also showed mKv1.7 hybridization (Fig. 7 C). In contrast, mKv3.4mRNA was found in acinar cells surrounding islets, but not in islets, of both db/db (Fig. 7B) and db/+ mice (data not shown). As a control, insulin mRNA was detected in both normal and diabetic islets, but not in acinar cells (Fig. 7 A). A Kv1.5-specific probe did not show appreciable hybridization to islets (data not shown), despite a report of Kv1.5 cDNA having been cloned from human insulinoma cells (33Philipson L.H. Hice R.E. Schaefer K. LaMendola J. Bell G.I. Nelson D.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Unlike all other known mammalian Shaker-related genes (Kv1.1–Kv1.6) that have intronless coding regions (2Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-72Google Scholar, 9Schwarz T.L. Papazian D.M. Caretto R.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1988; 331: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), the protein-coding region of mKv1.7 is interrupted by a single 1.9-kb intron. The fly Shaker gene also contains an intron in the S1-S2 loop, raising the possibility that the intron in Kv1.7 may be ancient, predating the divergence of flies and mammals. Both the mouse Kv.1.7 and the fly Shaker intron are placed between codons, i.e. they are “phase 0” introns. While this is consistent with their having a common origin it may also be fortuitous, since there are only three possible “phases.” Although we favor the idea that Kv introns were lost in the vertebrate lineage before their expansion by gene duplication (in which case the Kv1.7 intron would represent a more recent insertion), the evolutionary history of this complex gene family remains to be elucidated. Since Kv1.7 mRNA is expressed in the mouse heart, we searched the literature for native cardiac A-type Kv currents with properties resembling those of Kv1.7. The Kv1.7 homotetramer shares many properties with the rapidly inactivating transient outward (Ito) current in cardiac Purkinje fibers, but not the Ito current in atrial and ventricular myocytes. Kv1.7 and the Purkinje Ito currents activate at negative potentials (∼−30 to −20 mV), inactivate rapidly (τh < 25 ms), exhibit cumulative inactivation, are blocked by micromolar concentrations of 4-aminopyridine, and are resistant to >20 mm tetraethylammonium (34Reder R.F.

Res. 1996; 79: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) (this study). In contrast, the Ito current in atrial and ventricular muscle, a product of the Kv4.3 gene, does not exhibit cumulative inactivation (36Dixon J.E. Shi W. Wang H.S. McDonald C. Yu H. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that at least part of the Purkinje fiber Ito might be encoded by the Kv1.7 gene, although more extensive biophysical and pharmacological studies are required to confirm the link, and the presence of Kv1.7 mRNA and/or protein has yet to be demonstrated in these fibers. The abundant expression of Kv1.7 mRNA in mouse heart suggests that this channel is also likely to be present in ventricular and/or atrial muscle where it may co-assemble with other Kv1 family channels to form heterotetramers. Recent studies suggest an important role for Kv channels in regulating islet cell function, specifically in repolarizing the membrane potential following each action potential during the glucose-induced bursting phase associated with insulin secretion (3Smith P.A.

Despite these interesting findings, the genes encoding Kv genes in β-cells have not been identified. Although the Kv1.5 gene was isolated from human insulinoma cells (33Philipson L.H. Hice R.E. Schaefer K. LaMendola J. Bell G.I. Nelson D.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we did not detectKv1.5 mRNA in normal or diseased islets. We have, however, demonstrated the presence of Kv1.7 mRNA in these cells. Unlike the noninactivating Kv channels in pancreatic β-cells (3Smith P.A. Bokvist K. Arkhammar P. Berggren P.O. Rorsman P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1041-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the Kv1.7 homotetramer exhibits rapid C-type inactivation. Since Kv1.7 mRNA is expressed in pancreatic islets, it is possible that heteromultimers composed of Kv1.7 and other Kv1 subunits constitute the native Kv channels in β-cells. Enhanced levels of such Kv channels would excessively hyperpolarize the membrane of β-cells and impair insulin secretion (5Philipson L.H. Rosenberg M. Kuznetsov A. Lancaster M.E. Worley III, J.F.

The mapping of the Kv1.7 gene to human chromosome 19q13.3, a region thought to contain a diabetic susceptibility gene (26Groop L.C. Kankuri M. Schalin-Jantti C. Ekstrand A. Nikula-Ijas P. Widen E.

Leppert M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), also suggests that Kv1.7 might contribute to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes mellitus in some humans. In conclusion, we have described a novel Kv1 family gene with a genomic organization distinct from all the other members of the family. The Kv1.7 channel produces a typical A-type current, and transcripts are expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, placenta, and pancreatic β-cells. This channel is biophysically and pharmacologically similar to the Purkinje fiber Itocurrent, and the gene may contribute at least one subunit to heteromultimeric Kv channels in pancreatic β-cells.

We have constructed conditional alleles of the CKA1 gene. In contrast to cka1 cka2 ts strains, which exhibit a defect in both G1 and G2/M cell cycle progression,cka1 ts cka2 strains continue to divide for three cell cycles after a shift to restrictive temperature and then arrest as a mixture of budded and unbudded cells with a spherical morphology. Arrested cells exhibit continued growth, a nonpolarized actin cytoskeleton, delocalized chitin deposition, and a significant fraction of multinucleate cell bodies, confirming the presence of a cell polarity defect in cka1 tsstrains. The presence of budded as well as unbudded cells in the arrested population suggests that CKII is required for maintenance rather than establishment of cell polarity, although a role in both processes is also possible. The terminal phenotype of cka1 ts strains bears a strong resemblance to that of orb5 strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which carry a temperature-sensitive CKII catalytic subunit mutation, but the underlying mechanism appears to be different in the two cases. These results establish a requirement for CKII in cell polarity in S. cerevisiae and provide the first evidence for functional specialization of CKA1 and -2.

Casein kinase II (CKII) 1The abbreviations used are: CKII, casein kinase II; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. is an essential, highly conserved, acidic-directed protein kinase that is ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms (1Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 2Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of catalytic (α) and regulatory (β) subunits that associate to form an α2β2 holoenzyme. Distinct isoforms of one or both subunits occur in various species, and the three subunits of the mammalian enzyme (α, α′, and β) associate to form distinct α2β2, α′2β2, and αα′β2 tetramers in vivo (5Chester N. Yu I.J. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7501-7514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whether these distinct forms have unique functions is unknown. In vitro, CKII activity is inhibited by polyanions and activated by polycations, but the mechanism of regulation of the enzyme in vivo remains to be defined. CKII phosphorylates a broad spectrum of nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates (6Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the regulation of fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, translation, morphogenesis, and cell cycle regulation. Consistent with a role in the latter process, misregulated expression of CKII activity in lymphocytes of transgenic mice results in the stochastic production of lymphoma and, when combined with c-myc, leukemia (7Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Molecular/genetic techniques have been used to dissect the physiological role of CKII and its subunits in both budding and fission yeast. Purified CKII of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of four subunits, α, α′, β, and β′, which are encoded by the CKA1, CKA2, CKB1, and CKB2genes, respectively (8Glover C.V.C. Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 481-488PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is exclusively tetrameric, but which of the nine possible isoforms occur has not been definitively established. Disruption of either catalytic subunit gene yields no obvious phenotype on normal media, but disruption of both is lethal (9Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Padmanabha R. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4981-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,10Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Cells depleted of CKII activity arrest as a mixed population of budded and unbudded cells, with a significant proportion of the budded fraction displaying an elongated morphology (10Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The continued growth of the arrested cells suggests a cell cycle defect, and analysis of temperature-sensitive alleles of the cka2 gene confirms that CKII function is required for cell cycle progression at two points in the cell cycle, one in G1 and one in G2/M (11Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Depletion of CKII activity also results in flocculation, a lectin-mediated, Ca2+-dependent cell-cell aggregation. The significance of this is unknown, but mutations in the global transcriptional repressor, Ssn6/Tup1, display a similar phenotype (12Lipke P.N. Hull-Pillsbury C. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 797-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schultz J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3637-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Rather surprisingly, disruption of CKB1 and/or CKB2 results in no overt phenotype on normal media; however, cells lacking either gene display specific sensitivity to Na+ and Li+ (14Reed J.C. Bidwai A.P. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18192-18200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast to S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe appears to have a single gene encoding each subunit of CKII (16Roussou I. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 576-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutations of the cka1 + gene encoding the catalytic subunit have been isolated in a screen for morphological mutants (17Snell V. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These mutations (orb5) are recessive lethal and confer a spherical morphology at the restrictive temperature. Although arrested cells display aberrant actin and tubulin cytoskeletons, analysis of double mutants between orb5 and various cell division cycle mutants indicates that CKII is required not for cell polarity per sebut for the re-establishment of polarized growth following cytokinesis. No defects in cell cycle progression were defined for these mutants, and orb5 cells in fact undergo two to three cell divisions prior to arrest. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, null mutations of the ckb1 + gene encoding the regulatory subunit confer a slow growth phenotype, cell-cell aggregation, and cold sensitivity (16Roussou I. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 576-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such mutants also display an abnormal rounded morphology, reminiscent of the orb5phenotype. The rather disparate results obtained in the two systems make it difficult to construct a unified model of the physiological role of CKII. In S. cerevisiae, CKII is implicated in cell-cell aggregation, ion homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and perhaps morphogenesis. In S. pombe, CKII is implicated in cell-cell aggregation and polarized cell growth. Although cell-cell aggregation and morphological abnormalities are common to both systems, CKII appears to be dispensable for cell growth in S. cerevisiae and for cell cycle progression in S. pombe. Furthermore, the morphological abnormalities observed in the two systems are opposite in sign, since the elongated phenotype observed in S. cerevisiae is indicative of hyperpolarization (18Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), whereas the spherical morphology of orb5 alleles reflects a loss of polarity (or the ability to grow in a polarized fashion). Although it is formally possible that the orb5 alleles are gain-of-function mutations, the recessive nature of these alleles makes this unlikely (17Snell V. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the course of analyzing conserved elements in the N-terminal region of the CKII α subunit, we have constructed two temperature-sensitive alleles of the S. cerevisiae CKA1 gene. We report here thatcka1 ts mutants display an apolar phenotype, in marked contrast to the cell cycle phenotype displayed bycka2 ts strains. Although this phenotype is similar in several respects to that observed in S. pombe orb5 mutants, we find that in S. cerevisiae CKII function is required not for polarized growth but for cell polarity itself. Our results also provide genetic evidence for functional specialization of the two catalytic subunit isoforms in budding yeast. Principal S. cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. For routine work, yeast strains were grown at 29 °C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% d-glucose) or in synthetic complete medium (SC) lacking specific components as necessary (19Rose M.D. Winston F.

Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Synthesis of oligonucleotide primers and DNA sequencing were carried out on Applied Biosystems instruments at the University of Georgia Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility. To construct the cka1-Δ2 and cka1-Δ3 alleles, the wild-type CKA1gene contained on the 2.3-kilobase pair EcoRI insert of pJCW11 (10Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pSelect-1 (Promega), and deletion derivatives of this construct (pMB2011) were then generated using the “Altered Sites” in vitro mutagenesis kit (Promega). Sense-strand primer, 5′-GAAATGCAGGGTATGGACGAATATCAATAAAC-3′, was used to construct cka1-Δ2 (pMB2029); and sense-strand primer 5′-GAAATGCAGGGTATGGAATACTGTAATTGATTG-3′ was used to construct cka1-Δ3 (pMB2031). In each case, the desired construction was verified by restriction mapping and resequencing of the entire insert. To construct plasmids pAR1, pAR2, and pAR3, the inserts of pMB2011, pMB2029, and pMB2031, respectively, were released by digestion with EcoRI and BglII (the latter cuts within the 3′-untranslated region of the CKA1 gene), gel-purified, and subcloned into pRS315 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a second EcoRI site in pRS315 necessitated a partial digestion with EcoRI; following complete digestion with BglII, the relevant vector band was gel-purified prior to ligation. The cka1-13 allele (D253N) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of double-stranded pAR1 DNA using the Chameleon kit (CLONTECH) with mutagenic primer 5′-GAATGTATGATTATTCTTTAAACTTGTGGTCGTTTGGGAC-3′ and selection primer 5′-CCGCGGTGGACGTCCAATTCGCC-3′ (the altered residue in the former primer and the AatII site that replaces the unique SacI site of the vector are underlined). The fidelity of the construction, designated pAR4, was verified by restriction mapping and resequencing of the insert. Plasmid pAR5, employed in chromosomal integration of the cka1-Δ2 allele, was constructed by digesting pAR2 with HindIII and XbaI and subcloning the resulting fragment into HindIII/XbaI-digested pRS306 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains were constructed according to standard molecular/genetic procedures (19Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Strains YAR105, YAR106, YAR107, and YAR12 were constructed by lithium acetate-mediated transformation of strain RPG41-1a (Table I) with plasmids pAR1, pAR2, pAR3, and pAR4, respectively. Cells prototrophic for both leucine and uracil were selected on the appropriate medium and colony-purified. Strains YAR108, YAR109, and YAR13 were generated from YAR105, YAR106, and YAR12, respectively, by eviction of the resident URA3plasmid derived from RPG41-1a. Briefly, cells were grown nonselectively in YPD for 3 days at 29 °C and then plated on SC plates containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), which selects against the presence of the URA3 gene (22Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). 5-FOA-resistant cells were colony-purified by restreaking on the same medium. Chromosomal integration of the cka1-Δ2 allele at the CKA1 locus was accomplished by generating a tandem duplication at the locus and then resolving the duplication to leave the mutant allele in the chromosome. Plasmid pAR5 was linearized withAflII, which cleaves in the 5′-untranslated region of the CKA1 gene, and used to transform YDH6 (Table I) to uracil prototrophy. Five colony-purified transformants were selected and grown nonselectively in YPD for 3 days and then plated on YPD at 29 °C. Cells that had lost the CKA2 LEU2 plasmid derived from YDH6 were identified by the slow growth rate conferred by the cka1-Δ2 allele. Replica-plating confirmed that such colonies were Leu−, Ura+, His+, and temperature-sensitive, consistent with construction of the desired tandem duplication. The duplication was resolved by plating on SC containing 5-FOA. All 5-FOA-resistant colonies were His− as well as Ura− and remained temperature-sensitive. Proper integration of the mutant allele was confirmed by genomic Southern hybridization. To assay temperature-sensitive growth, cells were cultured overnight in YPD at 25–29 °C, diluted as necessary, and then spotted in triplicate (2000 cells/10-μl spot) on a series of YPD plates. Plates were incubated at the desired temperatures for 4 days. For generation of growth curves, cells were grown overnight in YPD at 25–29 °C and then inoculated into fresh YPD at a starting concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Cultures were grown at permissive temperature (either 25 or 29 °C) with vigorous shaking (450 rpm). For temperature shift studies, parallel cultures were shifted to restrictive temperature (either 37 or 38.5 °C) when the culture reached a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. To determine cell number, aliquots were removed at the indicated times, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and counted in a hemacytometer. Viable cells were determined by plating an appropriate dilution of an unfixed aliquot on YPD at 25 °C. Percent viability was calculated as 100 × (number of colonies)/(cell number). To study cell morphology and budding pattern, formaldehyde-fixed cells from the growth curves were examined by phase contrast and Nomarski optics. Nuclear morphology was visualized by staining with DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole) as described by Hanna et al. (11Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and chitin distribution was visualized by staining with 0.1 mg/ml calcofluor as described by Pringle (23Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Photographs were taken in a Zeiss IM 35 epifluorescence microscope fitted with Nomarski optics. F-actin was visualized by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin as described (24Adams A.E.M. Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Stained cells were examined by epifluorescence microscopy using the DeltaVision System (Applied Precision, Inc.). Digitized images were processed on a Macintosh computer running Adobe Photoshop. Our studies were initiated in an effort to analyze the function of the N-terminal region of the CKII catalytic subunit in vivo. This region is well conserved among different species (Fig. 1), with the highest conservation concentrated in two six-residue motifs (corresponding to the sequences SEARVY and EYWDYE of Cka1). We generated two deletion mutants of the S. cerevisiae CKA1 gene, one of which (cka1-Δ2) removed the first element, and the other of which (cka1-Δ3) removed both, together with the intervening sequence (Fig. 1). The ability of these mutants to complement a cka1 cka2 null background was then tested by transforming each construct into RPG41-1a (Table I) and plating the resultant strains on 5-FOA to eliminate the original rescuing plasmid present in this strain. As shown in Fig. 2, the smaller deletion mutant (cka1-Δ2) supported viability in this assay (strain YAR106), whereas the larger deletion (cka1-Δ3) did not (strain YAR107). YAR106 generated viable colonies at a frequency comparable with that of strains rescued by either wild-type CKA1 (strain YAR105) orCKA2 (strains YDH31 and YDH6) but exhibited a small colony size, indicative of a reduced growth rate. This small colony phenotype was reproducible, and subsequent analysis of this strain (designated YAR109 after eviction of the URA3 plasmid) revealed a doubling time of 120 min in liquid YPD at 29 °C, compared with 90 min for the isogenic wild-type control (YAR108). YAR109 also exhibited constitutive flocculation (data not shown). Both of these phenotypes are characteristic of reduced CKII activity (10Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol.

This and the recessive nature of the mutation (data not shown) suggest thatcka1-Δ2 is a hypomorphic loss-of-function allele.Figure 2Functional analysis of cka1deletion alleles in vivo. Plasmid shuffling was used to test the ability of cka1-Δ2 and cka1-Δ3 to complement a cka1 cka2null background. Yeast strains were grown nonselectively in YPD for 3 days. Cells were adjusted to an identical concentration and then serially diluted in YPD and plated on YPD + 5-FOA, which selects against the URA3 gene. Plates were incubated at 29 °C for 4 days. All six strains shown contain chromosomal disruptions of bothCKA1 and CKA2. Plasmid-borne CKA1 or2 alleles present in each strain are as follows, with those remaining after eviction of any URA3-marked plasmid shownunderlined: YAR105 (CKA1 CKA2); YAR106 (cka1-Δ2 CKA2); YAR107 (cka1-Δ3 CKA2); YDH31 (CKA2 CKA2), RPG41-1a (CKA2); and YDH6 (CKA2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) YAR109 was viable on a variety of fermentable as well as nonfermentable carbon sources and exhibited normal resistance to nitrogen starvation or heat shock in stationary phase, similar to previously characterizedcka mutants (9Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Padmanabha R. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4981-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The strain also displayed normal glycogen accumulation and was not cold-sensitive. However, YAR109 was found to be temperature-sensitive, with a breakpoint between 35 and 36 °C (data not shown). This fortuitous temperature sensitivity afforded us the opportunity to explore the physiological role of the CKA1 gene in greater detail. Because previous studies of null alleles had indicated thatCKA1 and CKA2 are functionally redundant (9Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Padmanabha R. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4981-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.-P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we anticipated that cka1-Δ2 would exhibit the same cell cycle defects exhibited by previously characterizedcka2 ts alleles (11Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This did not prove to be the case, however. Growth curves for the cka1-Δ2 strain YAR109.1 (Table I) and YAR108 following a temperature shift to 37 °C are shown in Fig. 3, panel A. In contrast to five previously analyzed cka2 ts alleles, all of which arrest within approximately one cell doubling (11Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), YAR109.1 completed at least three cell divisions prior to arrest. An identical outcome was obtained at 38.5 °C (data not shown). The terminal phenotype of cka1-Δ2 cells was also distinct from that of previously characterized cka2 tsstrains (Fig. 4). As expected based on previous studies (11Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), strain YDH13, which carries the temperature-sensitive allele cka2-13 (Table I), arrested as a mixed population of unbudded and large-budded cells (reflecting cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2/M, respectively), and a significant fraction of the budded population was hyperpolarized (panel E). With few exceptions, all of these forms retained the asymmetric, oval shape typical of wild-type S. cerevisiae. In contrast, YAR109.1 arrested with a spherical morphology (panel D). A significant fraction of the population was again budded, but, in contrast to YDH13, buds of all sizes were evident. In the case of budded cells, mother as well as daughter exhibited a spherical morphology, and hyperpolarized forms were completely absent. Both mutants increased significantly in size at the restrictive temperature (compare panels D and E with panels A–C and F), indicating that metabolism and cell growth continue after proper cell cycle progression is halted.Figure 4Terminal phenotype of cka1 ts and cka2 ts strains. Yeast strains were inoculated into YPD at a starting concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml, grown at 29 °C to a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml, and then shifted to 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times after the shift, fixed with formaldehyde, and examined by differential interference contrast microscopy (in this and subsequent figures, the time points shown for cka1 ts strains are generally later than those for cka2 ts strains because of the comparably longer time required to achieve arrest). Strains and times shown are YAR109.1 (cka1-Δ2), 0 h (A); YDH13 (cka2-13), 0 h (B); YPH499 (wild-type), 0 h (C); YAR109.1, 15 h (D); YDH13, 10 h (E); YPH499, 15 h (F). Scale bar in E applies to all panels and indicates 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the novel behavior of YAR109.1 was specific to the cka1-Δ2 allele, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to construct a second temperature-sensitive cka1allele (cka1-13), identical in form to one of our previously characterized cka2 ts alleles (see “Experimental Procedures”). The amino acid affected in this mutation (which corresponds to Asp-220 of cAMP-dependent protein kinase) is invariant in all protein kinases and serves an essential structural role in stabilizing the catalytic loop (25Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten-Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The resulting strain (YAR13) was indeed temperature-sensitive, although with a breakpoint approximately 2 °C higher than that of the corresponding cka2-13 strain, YDH13. Remarkably, the phenotype of YAR13 was virtually indistinguishable from that of YAR109.1 in all respects (data not shown), indicating that the novel behavior of the latter is not specific to the cka1-Δ2 allele. An additional indication of the unique behavior of both cka1 ts alleles was provided by an analysis of cell viability following a shift to restrictive temperature (Fig. 3, panel B). In contrast tocka2 ts alleles, which lose viability within the first few hours (11Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, panel B), bothcka1 ts strains remain viable up to 10 h after the shift, a time approximately coincident with their growth arrest. Collectively, these results imply that the unique phenotype of the two cka1 ts alleles is specific to the CKA1 gene rather than to the nature of the alleles themselves. A priori, the distinct phenotypes of cka1 ts versus cka2 ts strains could be due either to a quantitative difference in the level of the mutant activity (reflecting for example a difference in gene expression) or to a qualitative difference between the two catalytic subunits. In an effort to distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined each temperature-sensitive strain across a spectrum of permissive, semi-permissive, and restrictive temperatures. As noted above, the phenotype of YAR109.1 was identical at 37 an"

The molecular mass of the enzyme on a gel filtration column was 440 kDa, whereas on SDS gels a single protein band of 110 kDa was observed.

Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 1-52Google Scholar). Thus, oligosaccharides that have α-1,2-linked l-fucose are precursors for blood group A and B antigens (2Watkins W.M. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1980; 10: 1-136PubMed Google Scholar). In the Lewis blood group antigens, Galβ1,3 (Fucα1,4), GlcNAc-R, and Fucα1,2Galβ1,3(Fucα1,4)GlcNAc-R are determinants for Lewisa and Lewisb blood group antigens. In addition, fucosylated and sialylated oligosaccharides have been found to be the recognition molecules for the E- and P-selectins, two members of the selectin family of cell adhesion molecules (3Lowe J.B. Stoolman L.M. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Berhend T.L. Marks R.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 475-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). These selectins and their fucosylated (and sialylated) ligands are important in inflammation and in the recognition of leukocytes for endothelial cells (4Lasky L.A. Science. 1992; 258: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The primary pathway for the formation of l-fucose in procaryotic and eucaryotic cells is from d-mannose via an internal oxidation reduction and then epimerization of GDP-d-mannose to produce GDP-l-fucose (5Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2196-2205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Foster D.W. Ginsburg V. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1958; 230: 511-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies in rats showed that radiolabeled l-fucose could be incorporated into glycoproteins (9Coffey J.W. Miller O.N. Sellinger O.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bekesi J.G. Winzler R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3873-3879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an alternate route for activation of l-fucose. Anl-fucokinase that synthesizes β-l-fucose-1-phosphate (11Ishihara H. Massaro D.J. Heath E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a GDP-l-fucose pyrophosphorylase (12Ishihara H. Heath E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1110-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were partially purified from pig liver. However, the fucokinase preparation had rather broad substrate specificity with regard to sugar and nucleoside triphosphate, probably because of contaminating enzymes such as hexokinase in the partially purified fraction. In the present report, we describe the purification to apparent homogeneity of the pig kidney fucokinase. This enzyme preparation was very specific for l-fucose, and the only other sugar that could be phosphorylated, at about 10% of the rate with l-fucose, was d-arabinose. The fucokinase is also quite specific for ATP as the phosphate donor. This enzyme should be valuable for the synthesis of large amounts ofl-fucose-1-P, as well as for the formation of radiolabeled fucose-1-P. l-[3H]Fucose (52 Ci/mmol) and other radioactive sugars were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., or New England Nuclear Co. l-fucose-1-P, non-radioactive sugars, and nucleoside diphosphate sugars were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Various adsorbents were obtained from the following sources: DE-52 from Whatman Chemical Ltd., hydroxylapatite from Bio-Rad, omega-aminohexyl-Agarose and Sephacryl S-300-HR from Sigma Chemical Co. The following materials were obtained from Bio-Rad: Sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), Acrylamide, Bisacrylamide, Comassie blue, Protein assay reagent. All other chemicals were from reliable chemical sources, and were of the best grade available. Fucokinase activity was assayed by measuring the production ofl-fucose-1-P from l-[3H]fucose and ATP. The incubation mixtures contained the following components (final concentrations) in a total volume of 150 μl: 0.1 mml-fucose, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgSO4, 65 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and various amounts of enzyme at the different stages of purification. Incubations were at 37 °C for 10 min, and reactions were terminated by heating the reaction mixtures in a boiling water bath for 1 min. The incubation mixtures were then applied to columns of DE-52 contained in Pasteur pipettes, and the columns were washed with at least 5 column volumes of 10 mm(NH4)HCO3 to remove the unbound material. The [3H]fucose-1-P was then eluted with 500 mm(NH4)HCO3. Aliquots of the eluates were assayed for their radioactive content by subjecting a portion to scintillation counting. Pig kidneys were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and were transported to the laboratory on ice. The fresh kidneys were defatted and cut into pieces that were washed with cold distilled water. Each kidney piece was homogenized in a Waring blender in 2 volumes of Buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman J-21 centrifuge. The supernatant liquid was removed and filtered through six layers of cheesecloth. The filtered supernatant liquid was then further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The clarified supernatant liquid was used as the starting crude extract. All operations were done at 0–4 °C, unless otherwise specified. In all cases, fresh kidneys were used as the starting material for purification since the fucokinase activity was much lower after freezing the tissue. A 5 × 16 cm column of DE-52 was prepared, and the column was equilibrated with Buffer A. The supernatant liquid from the ultracentrifugation of 400 g of kidney (i.e. about 500 ml of supernatant liquid) was applied to the column, and the column was washed well with Buffer A and then with 800 ml of 0.1 m KCl. The fucokinase was eluted with 1000 ml of a 0.1–0.5 m gradient of KCl. Nine-ml fractions were collected, and every other fraction was assayed for activity and for protein. Active fractions were pooled and brought to 60% saturation by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate. After standing on ice for 15 min, the precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and dissolved in Buffer A containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. The dissolved ammonium sulfate fraction was applied to a 2.5 × 20 cm column of Macro-Prep Methyl HIC Support (Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated with Buffer A containing ammonium sulfate. The column was then washed with the equilibration buffer. The kinase was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 1–0 mammonium sulfate in Buffer A. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to about 30 ml on an Amicon filtration apparatus using a PM 30 membrane. The concentrated enzyme was then dialyzed against Buffer B (30 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol). The dialyzed enzyme was loaded onto a 2.5 × 10 cm column of hydroxylapatite that had been equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted with a 0–50 mm linear gradient of KH2PO4 in Buffer B. Under these conditions, the kinase bound to the column but not as tightly as other proteins in the preparation. Thus, about 60–70% of the enzyme emerged from the column at 15–25 mm KH2PO4. Some of the enzyme did remain on the column and could be eluted with the bulk of the protein at about 50 mm K2HPO4, in Buffer B. Active fractions, eluted from the hydroxylapatite column, were pooled and concentrated to about 2 ml on the Amicon apparatus. The concentrated enzyme preparation was applied to a 1.5 × 95 cm column of Sephacryl S-300 that had been equilibrated with Buffer C (25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.1, containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol). Four-ml fractions were collected and assayed for fucokinase activity. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to a small volume. The concentrated enzyme fraction from Sephacryl was applied to a 1.5 × 10 cm column of aminohexyl agarose, which had been equilibrated with Buffer C. The column was washed with 300 mm NaCl in Buffer C, and the kinase was eluted with 160 ml of a linear gradient of 300–700 mm NaCl in Buffer C. Fractions containing the active enzyme were pooled and the NaCl was removed by filtration on an Amicon apparatus and stored at −80 °C until used for various experiments. The most purified enzyme preparation gave a single protein band of 110 kDa on SDS gels but was found to still be contaminated with α-mannosidase activity (see “Results”), which also had a molecular mass of 110 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Thus, fractions from the aminohexyl-agarose column were assayed for fucokinase and α-mannosidase, and fractions containing fucokinase activity were incubated with the N3-[32P]ATP probe and examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to identify the fucokinase. Preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done at 4 °C in tubes containing 7% acrylamide and 10% glycerol as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and using Tris buffer. The pH of the stacking gel was 6.7 and that of the resolving gel was 8.9. The samples of fucokinase were made up to 10% with respect to sucrose and contained bromphenol blue. During electrophoresis, the current was maintained at 3 mA/gel, and the temperature was kept at 4° C. Two samples were run in parallel. One gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to detect proteins while the other gel was cut into 0.25 cm pieces, and the enzyme was eluted by overnight diffusion at 4° C into Buffer A. The various elutions were then assayed for enzymatic activity. On native gels, the fucokinase (molecular mass of 440 kDa, seelower band of Fig. 4 A) was separated from the α-mannosidase (see upper band of Fig. 4 A). To show that both of these bands were composed of 110-kDa subunits, the native gel was removed from the tube and laid on its side on top of an SDS slab gel and polymerized to that gel. Standard proteins were also combined in a native gel and added to the top of the slab gel. The proteins in the native gels were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (as seen in Fig. 4 B). Enzyme, at various stages of purity, was mixed with 8-azido- ATP[32P] in buffer and allowed to incubate for 20 s in an ice bath. 8-Azido-[32P]ATP was prepared as described previously (14Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After incubation, the reaction mixture was exposed to short wave UV light for about 90 s to activate the azido group, and the protein was subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis to separate the proteins. The gels were dried and exposed to film to locate the radioactive bands and were also stained with Coomassie Blue to locate the various proteins. The specificity of the labeling was determined by examining the effect of various concentrations of unlabeled ATP or other nucleotides on the labeling of the protein by N3-[32P]ATP. Various controls were also run, such as one in which exposure to UV was omitted. The radioactive sugar phosphate produced in the reaction was isolated by ion exchange chromatography from large scale incubations of [3H]fucose and ATP with purified enzyme. The radiolabeled peak that eluted from DE-52 with a gradient of 0–250 mm (NH4)HCO3 was lyophilized several times to remove the bicarbonate and was then subjected to hydrolysis in various concentrations of HCl to determine the location of the phosphate group. Sugar-1-phosphates are quite sensitive to mild acid hydrolysis (0.05 N), and the phosphate group is lost fairly rapidly, whereas phosphate residues on other hydroxyl groups are quite stable to these conditions. In addition, the product was analyzed by proton NMR to determine the location and anomeric configuration of the phosphate group. Three hundred mHz proton NMR and31P-decoupled (GARP) NMR on the sample ofl-fucose-1-P were performed on a Bruker ARX300 NMR. Data were acquired in D2O at pH 6.0. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 22: 248-254Crossref Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The molecular weight of the native fucokinase was determined by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 and that of the subunit by SDS-gel electrophoresis. A number of molecular weight standards were run including: thyroglobulin (Mr669,000), apoferritin (Mr 443,000), β-amylase (Mr 200,000), alcohol dehydrogenase (Mr 150,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr 66,000), and cytochrome c(Mr 12,000). The pig kidney fucokinase was purified about 5000-fold with a recovery of activity of about 21% using the methods described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 shows two of the key steps in the purification procedure, i.e. chromatography on hydroxylapatite (panel A) and chromatography on an aminohexyl agarose column (panel B). The hydroxylapatite step gave about a 10-fold purification, whereas chromatography on aminohexyl-agarose gave better than a 6-fold purification. Table I presents a summary of the purification procedure showing the changes in specific activity at each step and the recovery of activity. Based on gel filtration, the native enzyme emerged from the column in the same area as apoferritin and had an estimated molecular mass of about 440 kDa.Table IPurification of pig kidney fucokinasePurification stepProteinTotal activity1-aUnits are nmol of fucose-1-P produced in 1 minute.Specific activity-FoldYieldmgunitsunits/mg of protein%Crude Extract22000.056200.255100DE-cellulose1000.055605.5621.898.9Macro-Prep Methyl HIC232.5405017.4268.372.1Hydroxyl-apatite13.22446185.30726.743.5Sephacryl S-30011.252497221.96870.444.4Aminohexyl-agarose0.9512101273.684994.821.51-a Units are nmol of fucose-1-P produced in 1 minute. Open table in a new tab The purified enzyme was subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 2. The initial crude extract showed a number of protein bands (lane 2) while the most purified preparation (lane 7) gave one major protein band with a molecular mass of about 110 kDa. That this band was indeed thel-fucokinase was demonstrated by the fact that it was specifically labeled by the photoprobe, azido-[32P]ATP. Thus, as seen in Fig. 3, incubation of enzyme with N3-[32P]ATP gave a single labeled band at the 110-kDa region (lane 2), but no labeled protein band was seen in the absence of exposure to UV light (lane 1). The labeling was shown to be specific since it was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled ATP (i.e. 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mm) to the incubation mixtures (lanes 3–6). On the other hand, GTP at 0.6 and 1.2 mm (lanes 7 and 8) or ITP at 0.6 or 1.2 mm (lanes 9 and 10) were considerably less effective in inhibiting the reaction. Lanes 11–13 of Fig. 3 show the results of another experiment designed to determine whether 8-N3-[32P]GTP could label the fucokinase.Lane 12 shows that incubation with this probe did not give rise to labeled protein, whereas incubation with N3-[32P]ATP did result in labeling of the 110-kDa protein (lane 13). These experiments indicate that the fucokinase is quite specific for ATP.Figure 3Photoaffinity labeling of the fucokinase with azido-[32P]ATP. The purified enzyme was incubated for 20 s with azido-[32P]ATP, and the mixture was exposed to UV light for 90 s. The reaction was stopped by adding loading buffer and the mixture being subjected to SDS-PAGE. Radioactive bands were detected by exposure to film. Lanes are as follows:lane 1, probe + enzyme but no UV; lane 2, probe + enzyme + UV; lanes 3–6, probe + enzyme + 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mm ATP + exposure to UV light; lanes 7 and 8, 0.6 and 1.2 mm GTP + probe + exposure to UV light; and lanes 9 and 10, 0.6 and 1.2 mm ITP + probe + exposure to UV light. In lanes 11 and 12, the enzyme was incubated with N3-[32P]GTP and then exposed to UV light (lane 12) or not exposed to UV light (lane 11).Lane 13 is a control of enzyme + N3-[32P]ATP + exposure to UV light.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition, when various fractions from the aminohexyl agarose column (Fig. 1 B, fractions 48–56) were incubated with the N3-[32P]ATP probe, maximum labeling of the 110-kDa band was coincident with maximum fucokinase activity,i.e. fractions 48, 50, and 52 (data not shown). These data provide convincing evidence that the 110-kDa band is the fucokinase. The 110-kDa protein was cut from the gel and sent to Harvard Microsystems for amino acid sequencing. One peptide, obtained byendo-Lys-C digestion, was sequenced, and a BLAST search indicated significant homology to α-mannosidase. The purified enzyme preparation was found to have strong fucokinase activity but also had readily detectable α-mannosidase activity. Although much of the α-mannosidase activity was removed on the aminohexyl agarose column, some activity still emerged with the fucokinase in fractions 46–56 (Fig. 1 B). This enzyme preparation gave a single sharp band at 110 kDa on SDS gels as shown in Fig. 2, lane 7. The fucokinase could be separated from the α-mannosidase by native gel electrophoresis. Thus as seen in Fig. 4 A, gel electrophoresis of the enzyme preparation from the aminohexyl-agarose column on native gels gave two protein bands, one with an estimated molecular mass of 440 kDa and a slower migrating band (Fig. 4 A). The gel was sliced into 2.5-mm sections, and the proteins were eluted into buffer and assayed for activity. The fucokinase activity was only associated with the lower band while α-mannosidase was found in the upper, slower moving band. When this native gel with the two bands was then subjected to SDS-PAGE in a second dimension (Fig. 4 B), both the 440-kDa protein and the slower moving protein gave a single protein band of 110 kDa. These data indicate that both the fucokinase and the α-mannosidase are composed of 110-kDa subunits, but the native enzymes are quite different in size or charge. The 110-kDa subunit isolated from the 440-kDa protein (Fig. 4 B) was subjected to endo-Lys-C digestion, peptide isolation, and amino acid sequencing of several of the well-separated peptides. The amino acid sequences of three peptides were as follows: peptide 1, VDFSGGWSDTPPLAYE; peptide 2, (T)(G)IRDWDLWDPDTP(P)(T)ER; and peptide 3, LSWEQLQPCLDR. These sequences do not show significant homology to any known sequences in the BLAST search. The purified enzyme was studied to determine its substrate specificity, as well as various other properties of the enzymatic reaction. The enzyme showed a typical pH profile from 5.5 to 8.0 using MES and HEPES buffers, with a sharp pH optimum at about 8.0 in HEPES buffer. However, the pH curve on the alkaline side, between 8.0 and 9.0 in Tris buffer, did not show a sharp optimum. The activity in Tris buffer, pH 8.0, was about 80% of that in HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 (data not shown). The enzyme had an absolute requirement for a divalent cation for activity. As shown in Fig. 5, Mg2+ gave the best stimulation, with optimum activity being seen at 3 mm concentration. Fe2+ also stimulated the enzyme to nearly the same degree as Mg2+, but in this case, optimum activity occurred at about 10 mm. Co2+ and Mn2+ were also stimulatory, with maximum activity occurring at about 3–5 mm, but the maximum activity was only about one-fourth to one-third of that observed with Mg2+. A variety of other metal ions were tested and found to be inactive, including Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, Mo2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. However, when Cu2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+ were added at 1 mmconcentrations to incubations containing Mg2+, they completely inhibited activity. The specificity of the kinase for various sugar substrates was examined in two different ways. In the first set of experiments, various radiolabeled sugars were tested as phosphate acceptors for the purified enzyme using the ion-exchange chromatography method for assay of activity. Table II shows the results of this experiment. It can be seen that, of all the sugars tested, l-fucose was by far the best substrate and was readily phosphorylated.d-Arabinose, which has the same configuration at carbons 1 through 4 as l-fucose, was also a reasonable substrate for phosphorylation and was about 10% as effective asl-fucose. On the other hand, all of the other sugars were ineffective as phosphate acceptors.Table IISugar specificity of purified fucokinaseRadiolabeled sugar addedSpecific activitynmol/mg proteinl-Fucose11.8d-Arabinose1.1d-Glucose0.3d-Ribose0d-Mannose0d-Galactose0d-Xylose0 Open table in a new tab Although it was possible to get a reasonable assessment of the sugar specificity of the kinase from the above experiment, it was not possible to test sugars such as d-fucose since these sugars are not available in radioactive form. Thus, these unlabeled sugars were tested for their ability to inhibit the phosphorylation ofl-[3H]fucose. The rationale for this experiment is that a sugar that inhibits the phosphorylation ofl-fucose would probably compete with l-fucose for the phosphorylation (i.e. active) site. Table III shows the results. As expected, unlabeled l-fucose was a reasonable inhibitor of the activity, and unlabeled d-arabinose also inhibited although considerably less so than the l-fucose. Interestingly,d-fucose and l-rhamnose were ineffective as inhibitors, as was 2-deoxyglucose or other sugars. These data indicate that the configuration of the sugar at carbons 1 through 4 must be in the l-galactose configuration to be a substrate or inhibitor.Table IIIInhibition of fucose phosphorylation by various monosaccharidesMonosaccharides addedRelative activity%None100l-Fucose23d-Fucose102d-Arabinose80d-Mannose100d-Glucose100d-Galactose100d-Rhamnose102d-Xylose103d-Ribose962-Deoxy-d-glucose92 Open table in a new tab The specificity of the nucleoside triphosphate was also examined by testing the ability of a variety of nucleotides to serve as phosphate donors in the phosphorylation ofl-[3H]fucose. Table IV demonstrates that the kinase is very specific for ATP as the phosphate donor and shows less than 2% activity with any other nucleoside triphosphate. In addition, no activity is observed with any nucleoside diphosphates or monophosphates.Table IVSpecificity of fucokinase for phosphorate donorNucleotide addedSpecific activitynmol/mg proteinATP4.05ITP0.10UTP0.04CTP0.05GTP0.09 Open table in a new tab The effect of concentration of the substrates, l-fucose and ATP, on the velocity of the reaction was determined. The Km for l-fucose was determined at saturating concentrations of the other substrates, i.e. 5 mm ATP and 5 mm Mg2+. The data were plotted by the method of Lineweaver and Burke, and the Km for l-fucose was determined to be 27 μm (data not shown). A similar experiment was performed with ATP. In this case, the reactions were done in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ and 100 μml-fucose. The Km for ATP was estimated to be 600 μm (data not shown). The kinase was found to be inhibited by the final product of this alternate pathway, GDP-l-fucose. The data in Fig. 6 shows the effect of adding increasing amounts of GDP-l-fucose to reaction mixtures containingl-fucokinase, l-fucose, and ATP. It can be seen that the amount of inhibition of fucokinase increased with increasing amounts of GDP-l-fucose, and the Ki for GDP-l-fucose was estimated to be about 10 μm. Other GDP-linked sugars, such as GDP-d-mannose and GDP-d-glucose, did not inhibit the fucokinase, nor didl-fucose-1-P. However, when increasing amounts of GDP-d-mannose were added to incubation mixtures of fucokinase with l-fucose, ATP, Mg2+, and 20 μm GDP-l-fucose, the presence of GDP-d-mannose effectively blocked the inhibition by GDP-l-fucose, with complete reactivation occurring at about 1–1.5 mm GDP-d-mannose (data not shown). To determine whether the fucokinase was present in other tissues besides kidney, crude cytosolic extracts were prepared from various porcine tissues, and each of these extracts was incubated with [3H]fucose, Mg2+, and ATP for various times. The amount of label that bound to DE-52 and the specific activity of each extract are presented in Table V. It can be seen thatl-fucokinase activity was present in many different tissues, and in fact, lung and kidney were the tissues with the highest specific activity for this enzyme. Aorta and brain also had reasonably high activity, whereas pancreas, heart, and spleen were the lowest. Crude extracts prepared from cultured MDCK cells and HT-29 cells were also assayed, but no detectable fucokinase activity was found in those extracts.Table VTissue distribution of fucokinaseTissueCPMSpecific activitymg/proteinnmol/mg proteinAorta13910.97Pancreas6530.45Kidney19221.34Heart4850.33Lung15961.10Spleen5830.40Brain12610.87Liver9790.68 Open table in a new tab The product of the reaction was isolated from large scale incubations of l-fucose with ATP and active enzyme and was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and by paper chromatography. The radioactive fucose product eluted from the DE-52 column in the same position as authentic sugar-1-phosphates, such as glucose-1-P or GlcNAc-1-P. The product was subjected to mild acid hydrolysis in 0.05 N HCl at 100 °C. Aliquots of the hydrolysis mixture were withdrawn at various times after the initiation of heating, and each aliquot was passed through a column of DE-52. The wash and salt elution of the column were subjected to scintillation counting to determine the rate of hydrolysis. The phosphorylated sugar completely lost its charge (and no longer bound to DE-52) within the first 3 min of hydrolysis (data not shown). These data provide convincing evidence that the phosphate group is attached to the anomeric carbon of the sugar. The sugar-1-P produced in the reaction was subjected to 300 mHz NMR as an aid in the structural characterization as well as to determine the anomeric configuration of the phosphate group. Panel A of Fig. 7 shows 300 mHz NMR proton detection for the anomeric proton region of l-fucose-1-phosphate, and panel B shows the 31P-decoupled spectrum. The J1,2 spin-coupling is 4 Hz for the anomeric proton, consistent with a β-l-fucose-1-phosphate configuration. l-Fucose is an important component of many animal glycolipids and glycoproteins, and turnover of these polymers in the lysosomes must lead to the formation of free l-fucose (9Coffey J.W. Miller O.N. Sellinger O.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising to find that certain tissues, especially liver and kidney, contain a specific kinase that can phosphorylatel-fucose to form l-fucose-1-phosphate. In fact, early labeling studies in rats indicated that various tissues are capable of utilizing free l-fucose as a precursor of thel-fucose in glycoproteins (9Coffey J.W. Miller O.N. Sellinger O.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bekesi J.G. Winzler R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3873-3879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a pathway to reutilize l-fucose. The presence of the enzyme l-fucokinase was first demonstrated by Ishihara et al. (11Ishihara H. Massaro D.J. Heath E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who partially purified this enzyme from pig liver. However, the initial purification of this enzyme was only about 70-fold, and the enzyme preparation still had considerable activity for phosphorylating d-glucose,d-ribose, and l-rhamnose. Thus, that enzyme fraction still probably contained hexokinase, ribokinase, and other enzymatic activities. Interestingly enough, the kinase was also purified about 3500-fold from pig liver by Yurchenko and Atkinson (16Yurchenco P.D. Atkinson P.H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3107-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Their enzyme preparation also phosphorylatedd-glucose, d-galactose, andd-mannose at about the same rate or better then it phosphorylated l-fucose. These data suggest either that their kinase had a very broad specificity for sugar or that the preparation was still contaminated with hexokinase and galactokinase. Unfortunately, those authors did not examine the nature of the products formed from glucose and mannose to determine whether the phosphate group was in the 1 or 6 position since that would readily have shown whether the reaction was catalyzed by hexokinase. Otherwise, it is difficult to envision how a sugar kinase could catalyze a reaction with four different sugars, all having a different stereochemistry at carbons 2 through 4. On the other hand, the l-fucokinase described in the present report shows very strong specificity for sugars having thel-galactose configuration at carbons 2 through 4. Thus, only l-fucose and d-arabinose were active as phosphate acceptors although d-arabinose was only about 10% as effective as l-fucose. In addition, the enzyme only utilized ATP as the phosphate donor in contrast to the enzyme reported by Ishihara et al. (11Ishihara H. Massaro D.J. Heath E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which could also use CTP, UTP, and GTP as phosphate donors. Thus, it is not clear whether the enzyme reported here is a new enzyme or whether it is the same protein as described earlier but has been purified much more extensively to apparent homogeneity. We sent the purified enzyme to Harvard Microsystems for amino acid sequencing and obtained the sequences of three peptides. These sequences do not show any more then 40% homology to known sequences by the BLAST search. Thus, our protein is clearly not very closely related to other reported kinases. We are grateful to the Louisiana State University NMR facility for the analysis of the phosphorylated sugar and especially to Dr. Roger Laine for the interpretation of the data and for helpful and stimulating discussions pertaining to these studies."

The current study was initiated to determine the identity of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 70–80 kDa protein that becomes Lck-associated after stimulation with anti-CD45 or anti-CD3. We demonstrate that the cytoskeletal protein paxillin becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated when cells are plated on immobilized antibodies specific for CD45 or CD3. Only tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin is associated with Lck, suggesting that the association is through the SH2 domain of Lck. Consistent with this we demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Lck binds tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin. In contrast, the association of paxillin with the FAK-related kinase Pyk2 was found to be constitutive and not altered by the phosphorylation of either protein. Finally, we establish that the phosphorylation of paxillin is dependent on the expression of Lck. Taken together, these results demonstrate that paxillin is physically associated with kinases from two different families in T cells and suggest that paxillin may function as an adaptor protein linking cellular signals with cytoskeletal changes during T cell activation.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that paxillin is physically associated with kinases from two different families in T cells and suggest that paxillin may function as an adaptor protein linking cellular signals with cytoskeletal changes during T cell activation. T cells have been shown to undergo dramatic changes in cell morphology, coincident with cytoskeletal rearrangements, upon activation (1O'Rourke A.M. Apgar J.R. Kane K.P. Martz E. Mescher M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Parsey M.V. Lewis G.K. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1881-1893PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies over the past few years have indicated that protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the formation of focal adhesions, the sites of contact between integrins on the cell surface and extracellular matrix, are tightly linked (3Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 4Schaller M.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is plausible that some of the phosphorylation events that are observed upon T cell activation regulate cytoskeletal reorganization, leading to the observed changes in cell morphology. CD45 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed on all cells of hematopoietic origin (5Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that antibodies to CD45 induce rapid and dramatic changes in T cell morphology (6Arendt C.W. Hsi G. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5095-5103PubMed Google Scholar). Coincident with these changes in morphology is an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at approximately 70 kDa and 120 kDa and an association of these proteins with the Src-related protein-tyrosine kinase Lck (6Arendt C.W. Hsi G. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5095-5103PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these proteins also occurs upon stimulation through the T cell receptor (6Arendt C.W. Hsi G. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5095-5103PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of these proteins is enhanced when both anti-CD45 and anti-CD3 are coimmobilized, suggesting that engagement of CD45 or CD3 stimulates the phosphorylation of an overlapping set of proteins (6Arendt C.W. Hsi G. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5095-5103PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of these proteins might therefore provide insight into the regulation of T cell activation. Phosphorylation of a Src-related kinase at its negative regulatory site results in the intramolecular interaction of the phosphorylated residue with the SH2 domain of the same molecule, rendering it inactive (7Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kepeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 8Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C.

An implication of this model is that dephosphorylation of Tyr-505 would not only allow the kinase to become activated but would also allow for the interaction of other phosphorylated proteins with the newly available SH2 domain of Lck, which may have important biological consequences. Consistent with this notion, recent studies have suggested that the SH2 domain of Lck is required for T cell activation (10Straus D.B. Chan A.C. Patai B. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Lewis L.A. Chung C.D. Chen J. Parnes J.R. Moran M. Patel V.P. Miceli M.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2292-2300PubMed Google Scholar). Paxillin is a cytoskeletal protein that localizes to sites of adhesion to extracellular matrix (12Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon integrin engagement and associates with focal adhesions (12Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), possibly as a consequence of its direct association with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SH2, Src homology 2; BSA, bovine serum albumin. (13Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 14Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As a cytoskeletal protein that targets to focal adhesions, paxillin is thought to be intimately involved in cell spreading. Very little is known about the role, if any, of paxillin in T cell activation. Because T cells undergo dramatic changes in cellular morphology upon T cell activation we sought to examine the possible link of Lck with the cytoskeleton. In the current study we establish that paxillin becomes phosphorylated upon T cell action and associates with Lck and may therefore function as an adaptor protein linking tyrosine phosphorylation events with the cytoskeleton by way of its association with Lck. The murine H-2b-specific CTL clones 11 and AB.1 have been described previously (15Kane K.P. Sherman L.A. Mescher M.F. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4153-4160PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated weekly with irradiated C57BL/6J spleen cells in media supplemented with interleukin-2, and experiments were performed 4–6 days after stimulation. All of the experiments that are shown were done with AB.1 and confirmed with clone 11. Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 were obtained from the ATCC. The monoclonal antibodies 145-2C11 (2C11, anti-mouse CD3) and OKT3 (anti-human CD3) were obtained through the ATCC. I3/2 (anti-CD45) was obtained from Dr. I. Trowbridge, and PY-72 (anti-phosphotyrosine) was obtained from Dr. B. Sefton, both of whom are at The Salk Institute (La Jolla, CA). Hybridomas were grown in Protein-Free Hybridoma Medium-II (Life Technologies, Inc.). The monoclonal antibodies were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and, if necessary, by protein A or protein G chromatography. The monoclonal antibody specific for paxillin was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Antiserum to the carboxyl terminus of Lck was generated in our laboratory using a bovine serum albumin-coupled peptide based on amino acids 476–509 of human Lck (6Arendt C.W. Hsi G. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5095-5103PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the experiments have also been done with anti-Lck (carboxyl terminus) antiserum obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Pyk2 antiserum was generated in our laboratory as described previously (16Ma E.A. Lou O. Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Anti-GST was obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody and goat anti-hamster IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunologicals (Mississauga, ON) and protein A from Pierce. The GST fusion proteins used in this study have also been described previously (17Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1753-1757PubMed Google Scholar). 60 mm Petri dishes were incubated with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 15 μg/ml of the indicated antibody (2C11 or I3/2) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 30 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then used immediately for assay. Cells (7.5 × 106 per plate) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and were lysed directly on the plates by adding 1.5× lysis buffer to give a final concentration of 1% Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate. Postnuclear lysates were incubated with the indicated antibody for 30 min on ice after which protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC) was added prior to a 90-min incubation with rotation. If a monoclonal antibody was used, rabbit anti-mouse antiserum was added to facilitate immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) before SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels. Immunoblotting was performed by either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-paxillin followed by rabbit anti-mouse coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Blots were developed by chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products) as described in the product bulletin. When T cell clones are plated on immobilized anti-CD45 or anti-CD3, but not on anti-Class I MHC, the cells undergo dramatic changes in cellular morphology typified by extensive spreading (6Arendt C.W. Hsi G. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5095-5103PubMed Google Scholar). Coincident with cell spreading induced by these antibodies there is an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the ranges of 70 to 80 kDa and 115 to 120 kDa (Fig. 1). The extent of phosphorylation induced with anti-CD3 is significantly greater than that seen with anti-CD45 (Fig. 1). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are found in Lck immunoprecipitates following anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 1) as we have previously shown for the CD45-induced phosphoproteins (6Arendt C.W. Hsi G. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5095-5103PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are not detected in control ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1) or in preimmune serum (6Arendt C.W. Hsi G. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5095-5103PubMed Google Scholar, 17Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1753-1757PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified two of the approximately 120-kDa Lck-associated proteins as the related tyrosine kinases FAK and Pyk2 (17Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1753-1757PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we turn our attention to the identification of the 70–80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Paxillin is an approximately 75-kDa cytoskeletal protein that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during actin reorganization coincident with cell spreading (12Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because paxillin appears to fit the characteristics of the Lck-associated protein detected in Fig. 1, we determined whether the 70–80-kDa protein is indeed paxillin. Paxillin immunoprecipitates from AB.1 cells that had been plated on immobilized anti-CD3 or anti-CD45 or on BSA as a control were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine. Paxillin clearly undergoes a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation after stimulation with either antibody (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with the data presented in Fig. 1, the phosphorylation is much more extensive in anti-CD3-stimulated cells. This phosphorylation is coincident with a significant shift in the migration of paxillin as can be seen in the anti-paxillin blot in Fig. 2 B, which has been confirmed with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (data not shown). A large proportion of the paxillin, about 60–70% in most experiments, becomes phosphorylated upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 2 B). To directly determine if paxillin is present in Lck immunoprecipitates they were probed with anti-paxillin antibodies. Paxillin can be easily detected in Lck immunoprecipitates from stimulated, but not unstimulated, cells, and there is significantly more paxillin in the Lck immunoprecipitates from the anti-CD3-stimulated than the anti-CD45-stimulated cells (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the associated paxillin is only of the more slowly migrating species suggesting that the association with Lck requires tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. That the association between Lck and paxillin requires the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin implies that the interaction may be mediated through the SH2 domain of Lck. We are able to compete for binding of essentially all of the Lck-associated proteins with phenyl phosphate (data not shown), which is consistent with what has been shown previously with Lck immunoprecipitates prepared from activated T cells (18Peri K.G. Gervais F.G. Weil R. Davidson D. Gish G.D. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2765-2772PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of paxillin immunoprecipitates prepared from phenyl phosphate eluates of Lck immunoprecipitates reveal that tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin is bound to Lck; however no tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin is observed in the control rabbit anti-mouse Ig immunoprecipitate from 2C11-stimulated cells, and very little is detected in paxillin immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells (Fig. 4). These results further confirm that paxillin associates with Lck in CTL clones and suggest that these proteins associate in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner and possibly a SH2-dependent manner. To directly address the question of whether paxillin associates with the SH2 domain of Lck, we generated GST fusion proteins containing either the SH2 or the SH3 domain of Lck. The GST fusion proteins were mixed with lysates from AB.1 stimulated with either anti-CD45 or anti-CD3, and the complexes were captured with glutathione beads. An 80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein can associate with the Lck-SH2 domain GST fusion protein after stimulation of cells with 2C11 and to a low level after plating of cells on immobilized anti-CD45 (Fig. 5). This phosphoprotein does not associate with our SH3 domain preparations or with GST alone (Fig. 5). When this same blot is probed with anti-paxillin (Fig. 5), it is clear that paxillin specifically associates with the SH2 domain of Lck. Although not apparent on this blot, only the more slowly migrating phosphorylated form of paxillin is associating with the fusion protein (data not shown). The argument could still be made that paxillin does not interact with the SH2 domain of Lck directly but rather forms a complex with a phosphoprotein that itself interacts with Lck. To assess whether paxillin binds directly to the SH2 domain of Lck, a Far Western blot of paxillin immunoprecipitates using GST-SH2-Lck as a probe was completed. The data presented in Fig. 6 show that the SH2 domain of Lck binds to paxillin immunoprecipitated from 2C11-stimulated cells. Interestingly, the GST-SH2-Lck probe fails to interact with immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells, which contain only nonphosphorylated paxillin (Fig. 6). Since anti-CD45 does not induce extensive phosphorylation of paxillin, we did not include it in these studies. These experiments confirm that there can be a direct interaction between the SH2 domain of Lck and tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin. It has been demonstrated that paxillin can directly associate with FAK through an interaction that is phosphotyrosine independent (13Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 14Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Recently paxillin has also been shown to constitutively associate with the FAK-related kinase Pyk2, also known as related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), in T cells with only a modest increase in the level of association after T cell activation (19Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since both FAK and Pyk2 are expressed in our CTL clones (16Ma E.A. Lou O. Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) we determined if either FAK or Pyk2 preferentially associates with paxillin in these clones. We prepared immunoprecipitates of FAK, Pyk2, and paxillin and probed these with anti-paxillin. Interestingly, we did not see a significant interaction between paxillin and FAK; however we saw a strong association with Pyk2 (Fig. 7). Even when the blot was considerably overexposed, paxillin could not be detected in the FAK immunoprecipitates (data not shown). We know that the FAK antiserum is functional as it immunoprecipitates tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK in parallel experiments (data not shown and Ref. 17Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1753-1757PubMed Google Scholar). The level of association between Pyk2 and paxillin did not significantly change upon T cell receptor complex stimulation; however the Pyk2-associated paxillin did become phosphorylated after stimulation (Fig. 7). These results indicate that paxillin is constitutively associated with Pyk2 but not with FAK in these T cell clones. Since paxillin is physically associated with at least two different tyrosine kinases in T cells, it is of interest to determine if either of these kinases might be responsible for its phosphorylation. To address this question we made use of the Src-related tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1 (20Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). When cells are treated with this drug prior to anti-CD3 stimulation, as previously observed (20Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), no increased tyrosine phosphorylation is detected (Fig. 8 A). In this experiment cells were stimulated with cross-linked anti-CD3 in solution since we have observed that PP1 prevents cell spreading thereby limiting the ability of cells to contact immobilized antibody (data not shown). When the phosphorylation status of paxillin was examined, we found that PP1 completely inhibited its tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 8 B), suggesting that a Src-related kinase is required upstream of paxillin phosphorylation. However, this inhibition could be either direct or indirect because PP1 also inhibits the induction of Pyk2 phosphorylation, although PP1 does not directly inhibit Pyk2 kinase activity as measured by autophosphorylation (data not shown). To more directly assess the role of Lck in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin we examined paxillin phosphorylation in the Lck-deficient variant of Jurkat called J.CaM1.6. We have previously demonstrated that Lck is not required for the induction of FAK or Pyk2 phosphorylation (17Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1753-1757PubMed Google Scholar). However, examination of paxillin phosphorylation reveals that it does not become tyrosine-phosphorylated in the J.CaM1.6 cells (Fig. 9). Taken together these results demonstrate that Lck is required, either directly or indirectly, for paxillin phosphorylation. We have provided the first demonstration that antibodies to CD45 or CD3 stimulate the phosphorylation of paxillin leading to its association with the SH2 domain of Lck. Paxillin contains a number of potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, five of which conform to SH2-binding motifs (21Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it binds to the SH2 domain of Src upon tyrosine phosphorylation (22Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Since Lck is the predominant Src-related kinase found in T cells it could be predicted that it might bind to paxillin via its SH2 domain. Paxillin also contains a proline-rich domain that may be important for linking it to other signaling molecules or cytoskeletal components (21Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because paxillin is a major component of the cytoskeleton and can bind to multiple signaling molecules it may function as an adaptor molecule linking intracellular signals with morphologic changes known to accompany T cell activation. The phosphorylation of paxillin may therefore be important for regulating its adaptor function during T cell activation. In addition to the association with Lck, we have also found that paxillin constitutively associates with Pyk2 in T cells, as previously shown (19Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We could detect little or no association between FAK and paxillin. These results show that paxillin is able to bind to at least two kinases from different tyrosine kinase families in T cells; however it is not clear which kinase, if either, is directly responsible for phosphorylating paxillin. Both FAK and Pyk2 have been shown to phosphorylate paxillin in vitro (22Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 23Salgia R. Avraham S. Pisick E. Li J.-L. Raja S. Greenfield E.A. Sattler M. Avraham H. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31222-31226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that one or both of these kinases is responsible for paxillin phosphorylation in CTL clones. It is also possible that Lck might phosphorylate paxillin since paxillin has also been shown to be a substrate for Src (22Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Consistent with this we have demonstrated that the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 is able to inhibit paxillin phosphorylation. Although we cannot formally exclude a role for FAK or Pyk2 in phosphorylating paxillin, we reason that paxillin is unlikely to be a direct substrate of these kinases since both FAK and Pyk2 become phosphorylated (17Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1753-1757PubMed Google Scholar) in the Lck-deficient cells while paxillin does not become phosphorylated (Fig. 9). It is also conceivable that both Pyk2 and Lck phosphorylate paxillin at different sites. Studies are currently underway to distinguish these possibilities. Adhesion through a number of different integrin receptors is known to play an important role in T cell activation. The signals that are required to induce the cytoskeletal changes required for increased adhesion remain largely unknown. Our previous results show that cell spreading, which is coincident with increased adhesion, correlates with increased tyrosine phosphorylation (6Arendt C.W. Hsi G. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5095-5103PubMed Google Scholar). Which is cause and which is effect remains to be determined. Interestingly, only those antibodies or ligands that induce cell spreading induce tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. So far this is limited, in our hands, to purified class I MHC molecules (data not shown) and antibodies to the T cell receptor complex or CD45. We have shown that antibodies to β3integrins, which are expressed on these T cells, stimulate phosphorylation of FAK and Pyk2 (16Ma E.A. Lou O. Berg N.N. Ostergaard H.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however no significant cell spreading or paxillin phosphorylation is stimulated by these antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies to LFA-1 or class I MHC induce limited phosphorylation of FAK and Pyk2; however little or no cell spreading and paxillin phosphorylation is observed with these antibodies (data not shown). Taken together these results suggest that cell spreading correlates with paxillin phosphorylation. Paxillin phosphorylation does not appear to require adhesion since phosphorylation of paxillin occurs, albeit very transiently, upon stimulation of CTL with soluble cross-linked antibody to CD3 (Fig. 8and data not shown). We believe, therefore, that paxillin phosphorylation leads to cell spreading and not vice versa. That CD45 plays a role in regulating the phosphorylation of paxillin suggests that it might be involved in the regulation of adhesion. It has been clearly established that antibodies to CD45 can induce homotypic adhesion in various cell types (24Lorenz H.-M. Harrer T. Lagoo A.S. Baur A. Eger G. Kalden J.R. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 147: 110-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Bernard G. Zoccola D. Ticchioni M. Breittmayer J.-P. Aussel C. Bernard A. J.

We have observed that CD45-deficient cell lines do not appear to be as adhesive as their CD45-expressing counterparts. 2H. L. Ostergaard and C. W. Arendt, unpublished observations. Recently Roachet al. (27Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. Cahir McFarland E. Okumura M. Thomas M. Brown E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 408-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have shown that macrophages from CD45-deficient mice are unable to maintain integrin-mediated adhesion. They further demonstrated that this disregulation of adhesion correlates with the hyperphosphorylation of Src-related kinases (27Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. Cahir McFarland E. Okumura M. Thomas M. Brown E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 408-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is possible that CD45 might regulate adhesion in a global manner by dephosphorylating Src-related kinases which in turn function to regulate the phosphorylation of paxillin. Interestingly, a CD45-related transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, LAR, has been found to localize to focal adhesions, where FAK and paxillin are located, and may induce their disassembly (28Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Taken together these studies support the provocative idea that CD45 regulates adhesion by regulating FAK, Pyk2, and paxillin phosphorylation, perhaps via Lck or other Src-related kinases. In summary, the phosphorylation of paxillin, and likely its function, are regulated through the T cell receptor and can be modulated through CD45 engagement. It appears that paxillin might act as a type of adaptor protein that is able to bind to tyrosine kinases and cytoskeletal proteins and may therefore be important for integrating growth signals and cellular adhesion, both of which are essential for mitogenic signals in T cells.

We are investigating thiol chemistry and biology in Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria and are interested in how the thiol metabolisms of these organisms compare with that of their human hosts. The human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus does not utilize the thiol/disulfide redox system based on glutathione and glutathione reductase (GSR) 1The abbreviations used are: GSR, glutathione reductase; CoADR, coenzyme A disulfide reductase; NOX, NADH oxidase; NPX, NADH peroxidase; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s). found in eukaryotes and Gram-negative bacteria (1Fahey R.C.

Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, S. aureus appears to use a redox system based on CoA and coenzyme A disulfide reductase (CoADR) (22delCardayré S.B. Stock K.P. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5744-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CoADR is a dimeric flavoprotein that specifically catalyzes the NADPH dependent reduction of oxidized CoA (Equation 1), CoASSCoA+NADPH+H+⇌2CoASH+NADP+Equation 1 thereby contributing to the high ratio of CoA/oxidized CoA (>450) and the intracellular reducing environment. An initial physical and chemical characterization of CoADR indicated that this enzyme was related to the family of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases, which includes glutathione reductase (GSR), mercuric reductase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. In addition, the disparate disulfide specificities of CoADR and its presumed human counterpart, GSR, identified this enzyme as a possible target for the design of selective inhibitors that would interrupt the thiol metabolism of S. aureus and function as anti-staphylococcal agents. To better compare CoADR to human GSR and to facilitate the recovery of large amounts of recombinant enzyme for structural and functional studies, we have cloned and expressed the cdr gene in Escherichia coli. Our analysis of the CoADR primary structure reveals striking features that distinguish this enzyme not only from GSR but from other members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family. This analysis also highlights regions of the enzyme that likely mediate disulfide specificity and provokes questions as to the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme and to the function of homologous enzymes. S. aureus 8325-4 was the source of CoADR and genomic DNA (from John Iandolo, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS). E. coli DH5α was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, ON, Canada), strain BL21 (DE3) and plasmid pET22B(+) were from Novagen (Madison, WI). S. aureuswas grown in tryptic soy broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) at 37 °C. Isolation of S. aureus genomic DNA was carried out as described (3Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). E. coli was grown at 37 °C in LB and TB medium (4Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and when required in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Tetramethyl ammonium chloride, and CNBr were from Sigma (Mississauga, ON). Restriction enzymes and Taq DNA polymerase were from Life Technologies, Inc., and T4 DNA ligase and Calf Intestine Alkaline Phosphatase were from New England Biolabs. DNA fragments and PCR products were purified using Qiaquick spin columns (Qiagen, San Diego, CA). DNA fragments were labeled with digoxigenin by random primed PCR using the digoxygenin DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, PQ, Canada). PCR products were cloned using the TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Plasmids were purified on Qiawell cartridges (Qiagen) and sequenced using the Dye Termination Cycle Sequencing Kit and AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS (Perkin-Elmer) and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) 373 automated DNA sequence analyzer. Sequences were further analyzed and assembled using the program SEQED (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Oligonucleotides were prepared on a Beckman (Fullerton, CA) oligonucleotide synthesizer using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. SDS-PAGE and blotting of proteins were carried out using a Mini Protean Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA), using a Tris-glycine buffer system as described (5Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore (Mississauga, ON, Canada). Protein sequence determinations were carried out by the University of British Columbia Nucleic Acid and Protein Sequencing Laboratory on an ABI 476A Protein Sequencer. CoADR was purified from S. aureus as described previously (22delCardayré S.B. Stock K.P. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5744-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The gene encoding CoADR was identified and cloned using a reverse genetic approach. Purified CoADR (5 μg) was cleaved with cyanogen bromide as described (6Matsudaira P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the resulting fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands corresponding to native CoADR and a 35-kDa CNBr cleavage product were excised and sequenced. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers (SD111 and 113; see Table I), designed from the N-terminal and internal sequences (see Table I), were used to amplify the N-terminal of the CoADR gene using the PCR. The PCR was performed in PCR buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing S. aureus genomic DNA (10 ng), primers SD111 and SD113 (100 pmol each), MgCl2 (2.4 mm), tetramethylammonium chloride (60 mm), and dNTPs (0.25 mm each). The reaction was incubated at 95 (30 s), 47 (30 s), and 72 °C (30 s) for 30 cycles. The 600-bp product was ligated directly with the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen) and electroporated into E. coli DH5-α. The fragment was entirely sequenced from the resulting plasmid, pCR:CDR.Table ISequences of peptides (N-terminal to C-terminal) and oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′) used for the cloning and expression of the cdr gene encoding CoADRNameSequenceDescriptionPeptides Peptide 1PKIVVVGAVAGGATN-terminal of CoADR Peptide 2QPILDELDKRE?PYYLN-terminal of 35-kDa CNBr cleavage fragmentOligonucleotides SD111GG(A/T)GC(A/T)GT(A/G/T)GC(A/T)GG(A/T)GG(A/T)GCCoding primer for peptide 1 SD113TTC(A/T)C(T/G)TTTATC(T/C)AATTCATC(T/C)AA(A/T)AT(A/T)GGTTGNoncoding primer for peptide 2 SD301GGGAATTCCATATGCCCAAAATAGTCGTAGTCGGN-terminal PCR primer for cloning into pET22B(+) SD302CCCAAGCTTTATTTAGCTTTGTAACCAATCATC-terminal PCR primer for cloning into pET22B(+) Open table in a new tab The cloned PCR fragment encoding the N-terminal of CoADR was excised from pCR:CDR by digestion with EcoRI and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The excised fragment was labeled with digoxigenin and used to probe Southern blots of S. aureus genomic DNA digested with various restriction enzymes (4Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A single 3.8-kilobase pair HindIII fragment that hybridized to the probe under stringent conditions (68 °C, 0.1 × SSC buffer containing 0.1% SDS) was subcloned from a size selected library (3–5 kilobase pairs) into plasmid pUC18. The resulting plasmid, pUCDR4, was identified by colony hybridization to the PCR fragment and purified. Both strands of the gene encoding CoADR were then sequenced by primer walking. The open reading frame encoding CoADR was compared with a nonredundant protein data base using BLASTP 2http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. and was aligned to individual members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family using the GAP algorithm of the Genetics Computer Group software package (Madison, WI). CoADR was then compared by multiple sequence alignment to representative members of this superfamily using the CLUSTAL algorithm of the Genetic Data Environment software package, version 2.2, using a PAM 100 weighting matrix, a k topple of 2, and a fixed and floating gap penalty of 10. TERMINATOR (Genetics Computer Group) was used to identify possible stem loop structures functioning as transcriptional stop signals. The structural gene for CoADR was overexpressed in E. coli using the pET expression system (7Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar, 8Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encoding CoADR was amplified by the PCR using primers SD301 and SD302 (see Table I), which were designed to create NdeI and HindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the CoADR gene. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and HindIII, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated with pET22B(+) (Novagen, Madison WI) digested with the same two enzymes and purified. The resulting plasmid, pXCDR (expression ofCoADR; see Fig. 3 A), was sequenced to confirm the presence of cdr and transformed into the expression strain BL21 (DE3). For overexpression, TB (10 ml) containing ampicillin (400 μg/ml) was inoculated with a fresh colony of BL21 (DE3)/pXCDR and shaken overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in TB (10 ml), used as an inoculum for TB (1 liter) containing ampicillin (400 μg/ml), and incubated with shaking at 37 °C until it reached an A600 of 1.2. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (to 1 mm) was added, and incubation was continued for 3 h. The cells were harvested, and the recombinant enzyme was purified as described for native CoADR (22delCardayré S.B. Stock K.P. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5744-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) except that lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) was used in place of lysostaphin in cell disruption. The purity of the enzyme was assessed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. The specific activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the oxidation of NADPH (22delCardayré S.B. Stock K.P. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5744-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GSR activity of the final sample was measured to confirm that noE. coli GSR had been copurified. Thecdr gene encoding CoADR was identified and cloned using protein sequencing and a reverse genetic strategy. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of CoADR and a 35-kDa CNBr fragment of CoADR are shown in Table I. Degenerate oligonucleotides (Table I) were designed to encode these peptides and used in the PCR to amplify the N-terminal portion of the CoADR gene. This fragment was used as a probe in Southern blots to identify a singleHindIII fragment carrying the entire CoADR gene. The structure of the 3.8-kilobase pair HindIII fragment containing cdr and carried in the plasmid pUCDR4 is depicted in Fig. 1 A. The complete nucleotide sequence of cdr, the deduced amino acid sequence of CoADR, and the 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences are shown in Fig. 1 B. The 1317-bp gene encodes a 438-amino acid polypeptide having a calculated molecular weight of 49,200. The gene contains 35% guanosine and cytosine (G+C) nucleotides consistent with that of S. aureus (3Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The N-terminal and internal peptides (the residues with asterisks in Fig. 1 B) sequenced from the native and CNBr digested protein are both encoded within this polypeptide, and the sequence of the PCR fragment used as probe (theunderlined region in Fig. 1 B) is present within the nucleotide sequence. A putative ribosome-binding site (3Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) was tentatively identified 9 bp upstream from the start codon (ATG). A putative transcriptional start site recently mapped by primer extension 3M. K. Pope, personal communication. is located 23 bases upstream from the ATG start codon. The structural gene for CoADR is preceded by another open reading frame (ORF1 in Fig. 1 A) that terminates 50 bp upstream from the CoADR start codon. There was no evidence for stem loop structures that might serve as factor independent transcriptional terminators. The sequence of CoADR shared greatest similarity to members of the pyridine nucleotidedisulfide oxidoreductase superfamily (P(N) = 10−6–10−30). Members of this superfamily are characterized by a conserved arrangement of functional domains: an N-terminal ADP-binding motif, GXGXXG, for binding the nucleotide moiety of FAD, followed by a catalytic region having a pair of redox active cysteines, CXXXXC, another ADP-binding motif for the binding of the pyridine nucleotide, and a flavin-binding region. A pairwise comparison revealed that CoADR was 20–30% identical and 40–50% similar to representative members of this superfamily (Table II) and that sites of similarity were concentrated in areas corresponding to the FAD and pyridine nucleotide-binding motifs. However, an active site disulfide motif was missing from the sequence. Instead, CoADR has a stretch of amino acids containing a single cysteine residue that is similar to that of the conserved active site signature sequence SFXXC of NADH oxidase (NOX) and NADH peroxidase (NPX) from Enterococcus faecalis (Fig. 2 A), enzymes considered to be members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductase superfamily. Furthermore, a multiple sequence alignment of CoADR to members of the superfamily places CoADR in a new subfamily of disulfide reductase that is separate from GSR, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, thioredoxin reductase, and mercuric reductase and that more closely resembles NPX and NOX (Fig. 3). Sequence alignments of CoADR with NOX and NPX are shown in Fig. 2 A and with GSR from E. coli and human erythrocyte in Fig. 2 B. It is clear from these comparisons that the CoADR sequence is divergent from both classes of enzyme but shares the catalytic region of the NPX and NOX subfamily and sequences typical of NADPH as opposed to NADH specific enzymes with the GSR subfamily. The upstream open reading frame, ORF1, which was also compared with the protein data base using BLASTP, encodes a homolog to a family of “hypothetical proteins” identified in the DNA sequences of a variety of microorganisms. The closest member of that family was the protein from Bacillus subtilis, P(N) = 10−30 (GenBank™ accession number for the Bacillus homolog is Z79580).Table IISequence identity (similarity) of CoADR to members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductase familyEnzymeIdentity (similarity)%E. faecalisNPX24 (50)E. faecalis NOX26 (53)Streptococcus mutans NOX29 (53)M. jannaschii NOX28 (53)Mycoplasma genetaliumNOX28 (53)Mycoplasma pneumonia NOX22 (50)Hemophilus influenzae GSR23 (51)Pseudomonas aeruginosa GSR22 (47)E. coli GSR21 (45)Human erythrocyte GSR22 (47)Trypanosoma cruzi TSR23 (48)S. aureus MER19 (50)S. aureus DLD21 (44)E. coli DLD24 (53)B. subtilisDLD24 (47)E. coli TRXB26 (50)Streptomyces coelicolor TRXB18 (43) Open table in a new tab To overcome the difficulty of isolating CoADR from S. aureus, the cdr gene was cloned into the vector pET22B(+) and overexpressed in E. coli. Extracts of BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pXCDR (Fig. 4 A) and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside contained significant CoADR activity. CoADR was purified from the soluble fraction at 5–10 mg/liter of culture to greater than 99% purity according to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4 B). The specific activity (4,600 units/mg) and kinetic parameters (Km (NADPH) = 1.9 ± 0.5 μm, Km (CoA disulfide) = 14 ± 3 μm, and kcat = 1100 ± 200 s−1) of the recombinant enzyme were indistinguishable from that of CoADR isolated from S. aureus (Ref. 22delCardayré S.B.

The purified CoADR sample had no detectable GSR activity, and the N-terminal sequence of the recombinant enzyme was identical to that of native CoADR purified from S. aureus (Table I). The cdr gene of S. aureus encodes a polypeptide having a calculated molecular weight of 49,200 that is consistent with a subunit Mr of 49,000 and native Mr of 90,000 ± 10,000 estimated previously (22delCardayré S.B. Stock K.P. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5744-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The gene contains a putative ribosome-binding site (Fig. 1 B) and putative transcriptional start site.3 The deduced primary structure of CoADR is similar to that of the pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase superfamily and contains a catalytic region, two FAD-binding regions, and a single NADPH-binding region in appropriate arrangement. The most striking feature of the CoADR primary structure is its lack of a conserved pair of catalytic cysteine residues. CoADR instead has a region containing a single cysteine residue (Cys43) that is similar to the active site cysteine (Cys42) of the NPX and NOX from E. faecalis. These enzymes are members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductase superfamily, but their unique active sites have thus far distinguished them from enzymes that actually reduce disulfide bonds (9Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 658-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Claiborne and co-workers have extensively characterized NPX and demonstrated that Cys42 forms a stabilized sulfenic acid intermediate during the catalytic reduction of H2O2 by this enzyme (10Claiborne A. Ross R.P. Parsonage D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Claiborne A. Miller H. Parsonage D. Ross R.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Their analysis of the x-ray crystal structure of NPX further showed that Cys42 is structurally and functionally similar to Cys63, the charge transfer cysteine, of human erythrocyte GSR (12Stehle T. Claiborne A. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Yeh J.I. Claiborne A. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cys43 of CoADR likely participates in substrate reduction as well but in a manner that more closely resembles the reduction of O2 and H2O2 by NOX and NPX than the reduction of disulfides by GSR. Indeed, we find that during catalysis CoADR forms a stable mixed disulfide intermediate with CoA. These findings are discussed in detail in the accompanying paper (22delCardayré S.B. Stock K.P. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5744-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree produced from a multiple sequence alignment of representative members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductase superfamily suggests that CoADR represents a unique subfamily that lies between the GSR and NPX branches (Fig. 3). A comparison of the pyridine nucleotide and FAD-binding regions of CoADR, NPX, NOX, and GSR provides further support for this divergence (Fig. 2). The N-terminal of CoADR (residues 3–32) contains a putative βαβ ADP-binding fold ((14) and references therein) that aligns well with the N-terminal (residues 2–31) FAD-binding region of NPX and NOX (Fig. 2 A). Like NPX and NOX, the central glycine of this GXGXXG pyrophosphate-binding fingerprint is not conserved (valine in CoADR). However, unlike NPX and NOX, the residue following the central glycine in CoADR is alanine, a residue that could not functionally replace the conserved histidine (His10) that is believed to stabilize the sulfenic acid that forms at Cys42 during catalysis by these enzymes (11Claiborne A. Miller H. Parsonage D. Ross R.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 13Yeh J.I. Claiborne A. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Crane III, E.J. Parsonage D. Claiborne A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CoADR has two cysteine residues, one in the proposed active site region (Cys43) and the other in the center of the N-terminal βαβ motif (Cys16). Thiol titrations of CoADR suggest that one of these cysteines remains in the reduced form in both the reduced and the oxidized enzyme (22delCardayré S.B. Stock K.P. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5744-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Residue 16 of NPX is buried in the core of the FAD-binding region. Cys16 of CoADR would be buried in the analogous region of CoADR and is thus likely the cysteine that is recalcitrant to oxidation. In catalysis by GSR a C-terminal histidine residue, His467 of the human erythrocyte enzyme, acts as general base in the activation of the interchange cysteine; however, no analogous residue in CoADR is obvious. Another βαβ ADP-binding fold starts at Lys150 in CoADR and presumably binds the ADP moiety of NADPH. The replacement of the terminal glycine in the GXGXXG motif with serine is common among enzymes that bind NADPH rather than NADH (14Bellamacina C.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The bulkier serine residue is proposed to expand the fold to sterically permit the 2′ phosphate into the binding cleft. An arginine residue (Arg179) just following the terminal β sheet likely binds the 2′ phosphate of NADPH. Both NPX and NOX, which use NADH as cofactor, maintain the terminal glycine residue and have a conserved aspartate following the terminal β sheet that is believed to form a hydrogen bond with the 2′-hydroxyl of the ribityl moiety (9Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 658-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Bellamacina C.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 857-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CoADR has an additional fingerprint region (residues 267–277) that likely participates in the binding of the flavin moiety of FAD. The terminal aspartate of this region (Asp277) is well conserved and in other enzymes is known to interact with the 3′ hydroxyl of the FAD ribityl moiety (17Schreuder H.A. van der Laan J.M. Hol W.G.J. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Schierbeek A.J. Swarte M.B.A. Dijkstra B.W. Vriend G. Read R.J. Hol W.G.J. Drenth J. Betzel C. J.

The structural differences between CoADR and human GSR that result in the distinct disulfide specificities of these enzymes are of particular interest. In the absence of tertiary structural information for CoADR, a comparison of the x-ray structures for NPX and human GSR was made instead. Although the overall fold of these two enzymes are quite similar, the region following the cysteine redox centers are of dramatically different structure. In human GSR this region (residues 63–122) comprises two long α-helices connected by a loop region (19Karplus P.A. Shulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), whereas in NPX this region (residues 43–68) comprises several short stretches of helix and coil (12Stehle T. Claiborne A. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Yeh J.I. Claiborne A. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Mande S.S. Parsonage D. Claiborne A. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6985-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because these regions in both enzymes span the substrate-binding pocket, it is possible that the analogous region in CoADR (residues 44–70) may participate in the specificity for CoA disulfide. Future structure-function studies of the recombinant enzyme will be necessary to address these speculations. CoADR is the first disulfide reductase reported to have a SFXXC active site motif and represents a new subfamily of disulfide reductase (Fig. 3). This finding implies that proteins that are identified as similar to NPX and NOX due to the presence of the SFXXC motif may not reduce H2O2 or O2 but instead reduce disulfide bonds. For example, in the sequence of Methanococcus jannaschii (21Bult C.J. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) a gene was identified as encoding an NADH oxidase. This gene has the SFXXC motif but shares greater sequence similarity to CoADR than to NOX (Fig. 3) and lacks a residue similar to the conserved His10 of NOX. What is the true function of the protein encoded by this gene? The similarity of CoADR to NPX and NOX also provokes the question whether NPX, NOX, and CoADR share catalytic activities. We have shown that CoADR has only minimal O2 or H2O2 reductase activity, <0.1% that of its CoA disulfide reductase activity (see Table II of Ref. 22delCardayré S.B. Stock K.P. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5744-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but can NPX or NOX reduce CoA disulfide? E. faecalis NPX was shown to have no disulfide reductase activity using the substrates lipoamide, glutathione disulfide, and DTNB, however, CoADR activity was never measured. NOX was recently shown to have no detectable CoADR activity. 4A. Claiborne, personal communication. Previous purifications of CoADR yielded approximately 200 μg of enzyme from 10L of S. aureus cells. This level was sufficient for an initial characterization of the enzyme but has hampered more detailed structure/function investigations. The ability to rapidly purify milligram quantities of enzyme will now permit a structural analysis of CoADR. Protein engineering studies aimed at the identification of those residues within CoADR that mediate substrate recognition and turnover are now underway. Low molecular weight thiols play diverse and important roles in aerobic organisms. CoADR was originally identified as an enzyme central to the thiol metabolism of the human pathogen S. aureus and as a potential point of intervention in the treatment of staphylococcal infections (22delCardayré S.B. Stock K.P. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5744-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The cdr sequence has further confirmed that CoADR is structurally divergent from other disulfide reductases, and recent investigations show that these enzymes reduce disulfide bonds by different chemical mechanisms. A key question now is whether CoADR is essential for S. aureus pathogenicity. The molecular genetics of S. aureus are well established and provide a means of testing this possibility directly. The pathogenicity of a mutant strain of S. aureus in which cdr has been disrupted can be compared with that of an otherwise isogenic organism. Such a study would provide insight as to the role thiols play during infection and would provide the first direct test of whether interrupting the thiol metabolism of a pathogen could curtail virulence.

https://openalex.org/W2016450815,"The Sp1 family of transcription factors are often involved in the regulated expression of TATA-less genes, frequently enhancing gene transcription. In this paper, we demonstrate that an Sp1-binding element inhibits the expression of the megakaryocyte-specific αIIb gene in all cell lines tested and that this inhibition is actively overcome only in megakaryocyte-like cell lines. We had noted previously in primary megakaryocytes that a 50-base pair (bp) deletion from −150 to −101 bp in the rat αIIb promoter region resulted in increased expression. We now show that deletion of this region markedly increased expression in both megakaryocytic and non-megakaryocytic cell lines, eliminating the tissue specificity of the αIIb promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) defined a single complex, which bound to a −145 to −125 bp subregion. Point mutations within this region, localized the critical point of binding around bases −136/−135, and expression studies showed that introduction of the −136/−135 mutation into the rat αIIb promoter had a comparable result to that seen with the 50-bp deletion. EMSA studies with the homologous human αIIb promoter region gave an identical migrating band. Southwestern blots of HeLa nuclear proteins with both the rat −145 to −125 DNA and its human homologue bound to a single ∼110-kDa protein, the known molecular weight of Sp1. Confirmation that this region of the αIIb gene promoter bound Sp1 was accomplished using EMSA studies with an Sp1 consensus probe, anti-Sp1 and -Sp3 antibodies, and recombinant Sp1 protein. Further support for the role of Sp1 in the silencing of the αIIb promoter was obtained using a Gal4 binding site substitution for the silencer region of αIIb and co-expression of near full-length Sp1/Gal4 fusion protein expression vectors. Ectopic reinsertion of the −150 to −101 bp region, back into the −150 to −101 bp deleted promoter, enhanced rather than decreased expression, suggesting that Sp1's inhibitory role at −136/−135 depends on its local interactions. In summary, we believe that we have identified a cross-species, non-consensus Sp1-binding site that binds Sp1 and that acts as a silencer of αIIb expression in many cell lines. A model is presented as to how this Sp1-binding silencer element contributes to the megakaryocyte-specific expression of αIIb gene."

SMCs cultured from the aortae of 2-week-old rats (pups) (WKY12–22 cells) secreted almost 200-fold greater levels of PDGF than cells isolated from 3-month-old rats (adults) (WKY3M-22 cells). Subsequent Northern blot analysis determined that PDGF-B gene expression is at least 60-fold greater in cultured pup SMCs than adult cells (4Majesky M.W. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Evidence that differential PDGF-B expression is mediated at the level of transcription was obtained from nuclear run-off analysis (5Malayankar U.M. Ridall A.L. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33 (abstr.): 62Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Several other genes, such as tropoelastin and α1-procollagen (type I), were found to be overexpressed in pup cells relative to adult cells by cDNA library screening strategies. Cloning pup cells by dilution plating revealed that subpopulations expressed high levels of elastin, CYPIA1 and osteopontin mRNA (6Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured pup and adult SMCs also display marked differences in morphology. The epithelioid and cobblestone shape of pup cells contrasts with the spindle-like, elongated bipolar nature of adult SMCs (4Majesky M.W. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Basal and inducible expression of the PDGF-B gene is mediated by nucleotide elements located approximately 40 bp upstream of the TATA box. We and others showed that Sp1 binds to the 5′-CCACCC-3′ motif and drives basal expression in vascular endothelial (7Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol.

This is consistent with in vivo footprinting studies which indicate that this region is occupied by nuclear factors in intact cells (9Dirks R.P.H. Jansen H.J. van Gerven B. Onnekink C.

The related zinc finger transcription factor, Sp3, also interacts with this region of the promoter and activates transcription (8Liang Y. Robinson D.F. Dennig J. Suske G. Fahl W.E. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acid Res. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), plays a positive regulatory role in PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression in cells exposed to phorbol esters or subjected to mechanical injury (12Jin H.-M.

Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Egr-1 binds to a cryptic recognition element in the PDGF-B promoter and can displace Sp1 from overlapping binding sites (13Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This region also mediates inducible PDGF-B promoter-dependent gene expression in endothelial cells exposed to thrombin (14Scarpati E.M. DiCorleto P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3025-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); however, functionaltrans-acting factors mediating this process have not yet been identified. We hypothesized that the restricted expression of PDGF-B in subpopulations of cultured SMCs may be regulated by functional interactions of key zinc finger transcription factors with nucleotide elements in the proximal PDGF-B promoter. Here, we report that Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 are constitutively elevated in pup SMCs compared with adult cells. Promoter deletion and transient transfection analysis in pup cells revealed that the region bound by these factors is critical for basal expression directed by the PDGF-B promoter. Mutation of this region attenuates expression to levels comparable with those in adult cells. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the differential expression of PDGF-B gene in SMCs. Pup and adult SMC lines were cultured in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 30 μg/ml l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cultures were passaged every 3–4 days in 75 cm2 flasks. Cells seeded for preparation of nuclear extracts were grown to 80% confluence and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, then returned to the incubator in 1% growth medium for 24 h prior to extraction. SMCs were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture plates 2 days prior to transfection. When approximately 60% confluent, the cells were transfected with 10 μg of the indicated promoter-reporter plasmid along with 2 μg of pTKGH to correct for transfection efficiency. In overexpression studies, SMCs were cotransfected with 3 μg of either Sp1-pcDNA3 (CMV promoter based), 5 μg of Egr-1-pcDNA3, or pcDNA3 alone. Transfections were performed using Superfect (Qiagen). A precipitate was formed using 5 μl of Superfect reagent/μg of plasmid DNA and the transfection mix made up to 300 μl with serum- and antibiotic-free Waymouth's medium. After incubation at 22 °C for 10 min, 3 ml of complete Waymouth's growth medium was added, and the entire mixture was then added to cells previously washed once in PBS, pH 7.4. Following a 3-h incubation at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, the precipitate was gently aspirated, and the monolayers were washed once with 4 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, prior to the addition of 10 ml of complete Waymouth's growth medium. For overexpression experiments, SMCs were refed with 2% Waymouth's medium. Two days post-transfection, the conditioned medium was collected for determination of soluble growth hormone by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bioclone Australia), and cell lysates were prepared for assessment of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity as described (7Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SMCs were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and removed from the culture dish by scraping. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in cold PBS, pH 7.4, and the suspension was transferred to Eppendorf tubes. Cells were repelleted in a microcentrifuge by spinning at 14,000 rpm for 20 s at 4 °C. The cells were lysed by resuspending the pellet in an ice-cold Buffer A, which consisted of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 200 mm sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin. After incubation on ice for 5 min, the suspension was recentrifuged and the nuclei were lysed in ice-cold Buffer C, which consisted of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing DNA-binding proteins was combined with an equal volume of ice-cold Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were immediately frozen on dry ice and then stored at −80 °C until use. Electrophoresis, transfer, and immunodetection were performed as described previously (13Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized with trityl groups off and purified by gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Bresatec) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified by centrifugation in Chromaspin-10 columns (CLONTECH). Binding reactions for gel shift assays were performed in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), 5% sucrose, 1 mg of poly(dI·dC)-poly(dI·dC) (Sigma), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (150,000 cpm), and 3 μg of nuclear extract (determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay). The reaction was incubated for 35 min at 22 °C. In supershift studies, 2 μl of the appropriate affinity-purified antipeptide polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with the binding mix for 10 min before addition of the probe. These antibodies do not cross-react with the others' protein target. Bound complexes were separated from free probe by loading samples onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresing at 200 V for 2.5 h. The gels were vacuum dried at 80 °C and subjected to autoradiography overnight at −80 °C. Previous investigations by our group (7Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28648-28654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined that PDGF-B gene expression in cell types other than SMCs is under the transcriptional control of the zinc finger nuclear factors, Sp1, Egr-1, and Sp3. Since the PDGF-B gene is expressed at higher levels in cultured pup rat aortic SMCs than SMCs derived from adult rats, we hypothesized that elevated PDGF-B gene expression may be due to elevated levels of Sp1, Egr-1, and Sp3 in the former cell type. Using a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide bearing consensus sites for this superfamily of regulatory proteins together with nuclear extracts from cultured pup or adult aortic SMCs, we observed the formation of several distinct nucleoprotein complexes, designated a-g(Fig. 1). Differences were observed in several of these complexes between the two cell subtypes. By densitometric assessment, complexes a, b,c, and d were approximately 12-, 11-, 4-, and 5-fold more abundant using extracts from pup cells as compared with adult cells, respectively. Antibody inhibition experiments were performed to identify the protein components of these complexes. Inclusion of polyclonal antibodies directed against Sp1 in the binding reaction attenuated formation of complex a (Fig. 2 A), the most intense of these complexes. Antibodies raised against Egr-1 eliminated complexb (Fig. 2 B), while antibodies recognizing Sp3 completely abolished the formation of complex c (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, the Sp1 antibody slightly attenuated the intensity of complex c while the Sp3 antibody weakly inhibited the formation of complex a (Figs. 2, A and C). This raises the possibility that Sp1 and Sp3 occupy the promoter fragment simultaneously in these cells. Indeed, the incomplete supershift obtained using the Sp1 antibody (Fig. 2 A) has been observed previously by several groups (16Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpstra A.J. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol.

Several criteria indicate that differences in Sp1, Egr-1, and Sp3 binding activity observed between pup and adult SMCs was not a consequence of unequal protein content in each preparation of extract. First, identical amounts of pup and adult nuclear extracts were used for each EMSA. Second, the intensity of nucleoprotein complexese, f, and g was similar between pup and adult samples. Third, the nucleoprotein complex obtained when a32P-labeled oligonucleotide bearing a serum response element in the egr-1 promoter was incubated with these extracts was slightly more intense when adult samples were used (Fig. 2 D). We performed Western blot analysis to provide confirmatory evidence that Sp1, Egr-1, and Sp3 are present in greater levels in nuclear extracts from pup cells than adults since DNA binding activity and levels of protein may not necessarily correlate. Findings from immunoblot analysis indicate that Sp1, Egr-1, and Sp3 levels are indeed greater in pup nuclei than adults (Fig. 3), consistent with observations from gel and supershift studies (Fig. 2). The Coomassie Blue-stained gel indicates equal protein loading (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Sp1, Egr-1, and Sp3 are constitutively expressed in pup SMCs and that these levels exceed those in adult cells. To demonstrate a functional consequence of the disproportionate existence of these transcription factors in the nuclei pup and adult SMCs, we mobilized the gel shift oligonucleotide upstream of CAT cDNA in pCATprom and performed transient transfection analysis using the heterologous promoter-reporter construct in each cell type. Normalized CAT activity was severalfold greater in pup SMCs than adult cells (Fig. 4). The higher levels of reporter gene expression in pup cells obtained using this construct are thus consistent with the greater abundance of factors binding the element in this cell type (Fig. 1). Nucleotide regulatory elements mediating basal expression of the PDGF-B gene have not yet been defined in vascular SMCs. Transient transfection analysis was performed in pup cells with a series of PDGF-B promoter fragments cloned upstream of a promoterless CAT cassette (7Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAT activity directed by construct d26, which extends 153 bp upstream of the TATA box, was comparable with expression generated from construct d77, which bears 82 bp of promoter sequence (Fig. 5). However, CAT expression produced by construct d75, which bears 19 bp of promoter sequence, was only 9% that of d77 (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that the region between the 5′ end points of the PDGF-B fragments in d77 and d75 contain nucleotide elements crucial for basal expression in pup cells. We used EMSA and supershift studies to determine whether Sp1, Egr-1, and Sp3 interact with the region in the PDGF-B promoter responsible for high basal expression in pup SMCs. A32P-oligonucleotide spanning the −30/−13 region of the PDGF-B promoter in competition with its unlabeled cognate revealed the formation of several specific nucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 6, complexes a-d, comparelanes 2 and 4). Complexes a-c were barely detectable when adult nuclei were used in the EMSA (lane 3). Complexes a-d were abrogated in the presence of a molar excess of oligo GC (lane 6), whereas an irrelevant oligonucleotide, E74, was without effect (lane 5). The oligo GC result strongly suggested the involvement of zinc finger transcription factors in these complexes. Antibody inhibition experiments provided definitive evidence that Egr-1 (lane 7), Sp3 (lane 8), and Sp1 (lane 9) associate with this region of the PDGF-B promoter preferentially in pup nuclei. Interestingly, the partial supershift obtained using the Sp1 antibody alone was completely abrogated by coincubation with the Sp3 antibody (lane 10). These findings indicate that Sp1, Egr-1, and Sp3 bind to the proximal PDGF-B promoter in pup cells although, of all these factors, Sp1 associates with this region of the promoter most abundantly. Transfection of construct d77 into pup SMCs resulted in high levels of PDGF-B promoter-dependent gene expression (Fig. 7 A, column 1). In comparison, reporter gene expression driven by this construct was low in adult cells (column 3). Mutation of the region bound by these factors in the PDGF-B promoter resulted in an 87% decrement in normalized CAT activity in pup cells (column 2). Interestingly, reporter gene expression directed by the mutant construct in pup cells was comparable with levels obtained using the wild-type construct in adult cells (column 3). Mutation of the zinc finger binding site (−34/−18) only slightly attenuated promoter-dependent expression in adult cells (column 4). When wild type d77 was cotransfected with a cytomegaloviral promoter-driven Sp1 expression construct in adult cells, reporter expression increased to levels comparable with those in pup cells (column 5). Overexpression of Egr-1, either alone or in combination with Sp1, also resulted in inducible PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression (Fig. 7 B). These binding, mutational, and overexpression studies demonstrate that elevated PDGF-B expression in cultured pup SMCs is influenced by zinc finger nuclear factors binding to regulatory elements in the proximal region of the PDGF-B promoter. In this paper, we have investigated the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the high constitutive expression of PDGF-B in SMCs isolated from the aortae of pup rats. Curiously, SMCs cultured from adult rats of the same strain express low levels of PDGF-B. EMSA and Western blot analysis revealed that levels of Sp1 and two other zinc finger transcription factors, Sp3 and Egr-1, are markedly elevated in the nuclei of pup SMCs compared with adult cells. 5′ deletion and transient transfection analysis defined the proximal region of the PDGF-B promoter as that which mediates high basal expression of the gene in pup cells. EMSA using extracts from pup cells revealed that Sp1, Egr-1, and Sp3 bind to this region of the promoter in a specific manner. Mutation of the proximal element abolished basal PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression in these cells. Conversely, overexpression of Sp1 and/or Egr-1 in adult cells increased reporter gene expression. These studies define a critical role for the proximal region of the PDGF-B promoter in the elevated expression of the gene in pup SMCs and identifies several nuclear proteins that bind to these elements in a specific and functional manner. While the basic structure of the rat aorta is already formed at birth, the vessel wall continues to develop within the first three months postpartum. SMCs proliferate and differentiate most actively in the first few weeks and deposit large amounts of connective tissue matrix components into the extracellular space while the artery undergoes remodeling (20Gerrity R.G. Cliff W.J. Lab. Invest. 1975; 32: 585-600PubMed Google Scholar). The migratory and proliferative effects of PDGF-BB on cultured aortic SMCs (2Ferns G.A.A. Sprugel K.H. Seifert R.A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Kelly J.D. Murray M. Raines E.W. Ross R. Growth Factors. 1990; 3: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and the chemotactic effects of PDGF-BB on SMCs in rat (21Jawien A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Lindner V. Schwartz S.M. Clowes A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and porcine (22Pompili V.J. Gordon D. San H. Yang Z. Muller D.W.M. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 2254-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) models suggest that the PDGF B-chain may play a developmental role. A thinner aortic wall, among other abnormalities, in PDGF-B null mice is consistent with a role for PDGF-B in blood vessel development (23Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swolin B. Larsson E. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). High constitutive PDGF-B expression in pup SMCs that decline in older mice lends support to this notionprima facie. However, Northern blot analysis indicates that PDGF-B mRNA is present only in low amounts in aortic SMCs in pup and adult rats (24Majesky M.W. Reidy M.A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Hart C.E. Wilcox J.N. Schwartz S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Placement of pup SMCs in culture results in a dramatic change in PDGF-B phenotype, so much so that abundant levels of PDGF-B mRNA are observed after six passages (4Majesky M.W. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Moreover, SMCs isolated from the neointima of adult rats 2 weeks after balloon catheter injury have an epitheloid morphology strongly resembling that of pup SMCs (25Walker L.N. Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7311-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Steady-state PDGF-B mRNA levels in these pup-like neointimal cells also increase with time in culture (26Majesky M.W. Giachelli C.M. Reidy M.A. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization using rat-specific cDNA probes and anen face technique shed light on this apparent conundrum. It appears that only a subpopulation of SMCs can actually express PDGF-B in the aortic media. SMC cultures expressing high levels of PDGF-B after successive passages may arise from clonal expansion of the PDGF-B-expressing SMC subpopulation (27Lindner V. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cloning pup SMCs by dilute plating have generated isolates that either express or do not express PDGF-B mRNA (6Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar). Aortic SMCs are, therefore, a heterogeneous population with diverse patterns of growth and gene expression (6Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar). Such gross differences in PDGF-B expression between cultured pup and adult SMCs provide a valuable resource to investigate transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to cell-specific gene expression. In addition, the similarity of the PDGF-B phenotype between cultured pup SMCs and SMCs isolated from the balloon-injured rat adult artery wall (26Majesky M.W. Giachelli C.M. Reidy M.A. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) implicates a role for zinc finger transcription factors in the vascular response to injury. Differences in nuclear transcription factor content have previously been suggested as a regulatory mechanism underlying cell-specific gene expression. For example, interleukin-2 expression in murine Th1 cells, but not Th2 cells, may be due to the presence of NFAT in the former cell type (28Barve S.S. Cohen D.A. Debenedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Kaplan A.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1171-1181PubMed Google Scholar). Second, expression of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene in B-cells, but not K562 cells or Jurkat T-cells, may be due to the presence of both Spi-1/PU.1 and Spi-B in B-cells (29Muller S. Sideras P. Smith C.E. Xanthopoulos K.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1955-1964PubMed Google Scholar). Third, murine surfactant protein A (SP-A) promoter-dependent expression in mouse lung epithelial (MLE-15) cells, but weakly, if at all, in HeLa, 3T3, or H441 cells, may be due to the preferential expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) in the former cell type (30Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6531-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Finally, MyoD, the skeletal muscle lineage control gene product that converts adult SMCs to skeletal muscle myoblasts, is unable to alter the phenotype of pup SMCs (31van Neck J.W. Medina J.J. Onnekink C. van der Ven P.F.M. Bloemers H.P.J. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 143: 269-282Google Scholar), suggesting that pup and adult SMCs differ in nuclear factors able to interact with MyoD (6Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar). The present study also extends recent findings demonstrating no major differences between the content of NF-κB and AP-1 in the nuclei of pup and adult cells (32Malayankar U.M. Ridall A.L. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10 (abstr.): A1134Google Scholar). Our findings also demonstrate that overexpression of Sp1 and Egr-1 could augment PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression in rat SMCs and that these effects were not additive under these conditions. Gel shift studies indicate that in addition to Sp1 and Egr-1, Sp3 and other factors, yet to be defined, bind specifically to the proximal PDGF-B promoter (Fig. 6). While overexpression studies are helpful in determining the functional importance of transcription factors, simultaneous overexpression of multiple factors with a reporter may not necessarily approximate the expression pattern of the authentic gene. This process is likely to be influenced by the nature, concentration, stoichiometry, and even the order of assembly of nuclear factors on the promoter. While the present findings indicate that the proximal region of the PDGF-B promoter is required for high basal PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression in pup cells and that this region is bound by a large number of nuclear factors, elevated PDGF-B expression may not be mediated by these trans-acting factors alone. For example, basal and inducible PDGF-A transcription is, like PDGF-B, dependent upon specific interactions of Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 with the proximal promoter (33Silverman E.S. Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: H1415-H1426Google Scholar). Unlike PDGF-B, however, steady-state PDGF-A mRNA levels are reportedly similar in pup and adult SMCs but do increase with time in culture (4Majesky M.W. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar). This may result from differences in the methylation state of the authentic promoter, or combinatorial interactions between transcription factors over promoter elements. Methylation of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter results in loss of DNase I hypersensitivity and inhibition of transcription (34Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Wolffe A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 157-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Prolactin promoter-dependent gene expression in pituitary tumor cells is inversely correlated with CpG methylation of the promoter and the ability of transcription factors to bind (35Ngo V.M. Laverriere J.N. Gourdji D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The G+C-rich nature of the PDGF-A promoter adds support to this possibility (36Bonthron D.T. Morton C.C. Orkin S.H. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1492-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Second, transcription factors undergo ordered cooperative interactions over promoter elements to form stereospecific enhancer complexes that augment rates of transcription (37Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Sp1 bends DNA upon promoter binding (38Ikeda K. Nagano K. Kawakami K. Gene. 1993; 136: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and interacts synergistically with YYI (39Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), Ets-1 (40Gegonne A. Bosselut R. Bailly R.A. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), HIV Tat (41Madore S.J. Cullen B.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 1150-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), GATA-1 (42Fischer K.D. Haese A. Nowock J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19680-19683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Differences in the nature or content of other regulatory factors may, therefore, influence this highly selective process and contribute to the preferential expression of PDGF-B in cultured pup SMCs. We would like to thank Drs. U. M. Malayankar, C. M. Giachelli, and S. M. Schwartz (Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle) for their kind gift of pup and adult rat aortic SMCs.

(1996)J. Immunol. 156, 4582–4593). To identify proteins that interact specifically with ATF2 in lymphocytes, the yeast two-hybrid interaction system was employed using ATF2 cDNA as a “bait.” In two separate screenings, a clone was identified that revealed a novel sequence with homology to several members of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. An identical sequence was recently reported as the human homolog of the yeast UBC9, hUBC9. Northern blot analysis revealed a 1.3-kilobase RNA transcript, which showed differential levels of expression in various human tissues and a moderate induction after a 48-h stimulation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes. An antibody that was generated against the bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-hUBC9 detected a ∼19-kDa protein, which localizes predominantly in the nuclei of T cells. Further quantitative assays using the yeast two-hybrid system confirmed a high and specific level of interaction of hUBC9 with ATF2 and lack of interaction with lamin or control vectors. Two other cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding transcription factors, CREB and ATF1, also showed significant levels of interaction with hUBC9. However, this interaction was severalfold lower as compared with ATF2. Far Western blot analysis confirmed the specific binding of ATF2 and hUBC9 alsoin vitro. Evidence is presented that indicates a physiological significance for the interaction of hUBC9 with ATF2. (a) We show that ATF2 is ubiquitinated in vivo and in vitro, and (b) ATF2 ubiquitinationin vitro is facilitated by addition of purified hUBC9. (c) ATF2 is shown to undergo a proteolytic process, which is rapidly regulated upon T cell activation concomitant with induction of ATF2 phosphorylation. (d) A proteasome inhibitor delays the down-regulation of ATF2 phophorylation after T cell activation. Taken collectively, these results implicate a role for hUBC9 and the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in regulation of ATF2 in T cells. Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) is regulated by phosphorylation via the Jun N-terminal kinase, and its binding activity is markedly induced at late stages of T and B lymphocyte activation (Feuerstein, N., Firestein, R., Aiyer, N., Xiao, H., Murasko, D., and Cristofalo, V.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We have shown that stimulation of T or B lymphocytes via the antigen receptor is associated with a marked induction of ATF2 binding to consensus CRE elements as well as to CRE elements in the promoter of proliferating cell nuclear antigen at late stages of activation or differentiation (3Feuerstein N. Firestein R. Aiyer N. Xiao H. Murasko D. Cristofalo V. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4582-4593PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, induction of CRE binding activity was observed by us and others in cloned T cells stimulated with IL-2 (4Feuerstein N. Huang D. Hinrichs S. Orten D.J. Aiyar N. Prystowsky M.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 68-79PubMed Google Scholar) and in human peripheral blood T cells stimulated by PHA (5Wollberg W. Soderqvist H. Nelson D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19719-19724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of T cell proliferation by rapamycin, a potent macrolide immunosuppressant, was associated with a marked inhibition of ATF2 binding activity (3Feuerstein N. Firestein R. Aiyer N. Xiao H. Murasko D. Cristofalo V. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4582-4593PubMed Google Scholar, 6Feuerstein N. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This indicates that transactivation of ATF2 is tightly regulated and may play an important role during lymphocyte activation. The transcription factor ATF2 has been implicated in the induction of cytokine gene expression after engagement of the antigen receptor in lymphocytes (7Tsai E. Jain J. Pesavento P. Rao A. Goldfeld A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 8Kim S.-J. Wagner S. Liu F. O'Reilly M.A. Robbins P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Specifically, ATF2 was implicated in the transcription of tumor necrosis factor γ (7Tsai E. Jain J. Pesavento P. Rao A. Goldfeld A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), in tumor growth factor β (8Kim S.-J. Wagner S. Liu F. O'Reilly M.A. Robbins P.D. Green M.R.

Cell. 1993; 74: 887-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). An important role for ATF2 has also been demonstrated in the expression of T cell-specific genes (10Gao M.-H. Kavathas P.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4376-4385PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee M.-R. Chung C.-H. Liou M.-L. Li W.-F. Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J.

Loh D.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ATF2 binds to the conserved CRE decamer motif in the CD8α promoter (10Gao M.-H. Kavathas P.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4376-4385PubMed Google Scholar) and in TCR Vβ promoter (11Lee M.-R. Chung C.-H. Liou M.-L. Li W.-F. Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1906-1912PubMed Google Scholar). Isoforms of the CRE-BP1 DNA (ATF2) were found to mediate activity of a T cell-specific enhancer required for expression of the CD3δ gene of the T cell receptor complex (12Georgopoulos K. Morgan B.A. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because this motif is also present in the enhancer and promoter of the TCR α and β genes, it has been suggested that ATF2 may mediate expression of other members of the CD3/TCR complex during T cell activation and differentiation (12Georgopoulos K. Morgan B.A. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ATF2 was also implicated in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 (14Franklin A.A. Kubik M.F. Uttenbogaard M.N. Brauweiler A. Utaisincharoen P. Matthews M.-A. Dynan W.S. Hoeffler J.P. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21225-21231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia, an aggressive malignancy of helper T lymphocytes in humans. Specifically, ATF2 was shown to bind and transcriptionally activate the virus-encoded transactivator protein, Tax, leading to induction of HTLV-1 gene expression (9Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 10Gao M.-H. Kavathas P.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4376-4385PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee M.-R. Chung C.-H. Liou M.-L.

Biol. 1992; 12: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that pathological processes by oncogenic virus expression in human T lymphocytes utilize cellular processes that up-regulate ATF2 transcription factors during T cell activation. Evidence indicated that full-length ATF2 is inactive due to intramolecular inhibition exerted by its DNA binding domain (16Li X.-Y. Green M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that ATF2 interaction with other proteins releases this intramolecular inhibition and transactivates the protein (16Li X.-Y. Green M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Indeed, ATF2 transcriptional activation was shown to involve interaction with several different proteins including: E1A (17Liu F. Green M.R.

Therefore, the function of ATF2 may be determined by its specific interaction with other inducer proteins. Transcriptional activation of ATF2 was shown to also be induced by phosphorylation mediated by stress-activated protein kinases including Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a subgroup of the MAP kinase family (23Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 24Gupta S. Cambell D. Derijard B. Davis J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies have shown that cell stimulation via pro-inflammatory cytokines or ultraviolet radiation is associated with rapid phosphorylation of ATF2 by JNK, implicating a role for ATF2 in rapid signaling processes via JNK transduction pathways (24Gupta S. Cambell D. Derijard B. Davis J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). JNK has been implicated in integration of different signaling pathways leading to T cell activation via the TCR/CD3 (27Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Taken collectively, this evidence leads to the possibility that transcriptional activation of ATF2 may be tightly regulated by early and late signaling processes during T cell activation. To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate ATF2 in T cell activation, we searched for proteins that interact with ATF2 in vivo. The genetic approach of the yeast two-hybrid was employed using the full-length human ATF2 cDNA used as a “bait.” The search was performed using a cDNA library of PHA-activated human peripheral blood leukocytes. We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone that encodes a new member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, which specifically interacts with ATF2 in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro in Far Western analysis. An identical sequence was recently reported as the human homolog of the yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9, hUBC9 (28Kovalenko V.O. Plug A.W. Haaf T. Gonda D.K. Ashley T. Ward D.C. Radding C.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that hUBC9 protein localizes predominantly in the nuclei of control and stimulated T cells. hUBC9 belong to a family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) that participate in the linking of C-terminal glycine residues of ubiquitin to specific lysine residues of target proteins (for review, see Refs. 31Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 32Jentsch S. Annu. Rev.

This ubiquitination leads to target protein degradation by the 26 S proteasome. We demonstrate that ATF2 is ubiquitinated in vivo and in vitro and provide evidence that hUBC9 facilitates the ubiquitination of ATF2 in vitro. We further demonstrate that changes in abundance of degradation products of ATF2 occur rapidly upon T cell activation concomitant with induction phosphorylation of ATF2. These results taken collectively implicate the proteasome pathway and specifically hUBC9 in the regulation of ATF2 during T cell activation. Affinity-purified antibody specific for conjugated ubiquitin was a kind gift of Dr. Arthur L. Haas (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI) and Dr. C. Pickart (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Anti-ATF2 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY, and a gift from Dr. Michael Green, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA), anti-numatrin/B23 polyclonal antibody was generated as described previously (55Feuerstein N. Chan P.K. Mond J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10608-10612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione cross-linked to agarose beads, creatine phosphokinase from rabbit muscle, inorganic phosphate from yeast, concanavalin A, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, N-ethylamide,N-tosyl-l-phenylamine chloromethyl (TPCK),N-tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (LLnL) all were purchased from Sigma. Full-length ATF2 cDNA (a generous gift from Dr. Michael Green), was subcloned in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the yeast expression vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH) at the BamHI site. The plasmid was confirmed to carry the ATF2 cDNA in the correct orientation and was transformed using a standard LiCl transformation procedure into the HF7C strain of yeast. The presence of ATF2-pGBT9 in the yeast was stably maintained by selection for the pGBT9 selection marker TRP1, which allows yeast growth in the absence of tryptophan. Expression of ATF2-pGBT9 only in the yeast cells transfected with ATF2-pGBT9 was confirmed by Western analysis using antibody to ATF2. HF7C yeast cells transformed only with pGBT9-ATF2 were then tested for activation of the reporter genes HIS3 and LacZ. It was seen that pGBT9-ATF2 alone or cotransformed with the activation domain (pGAD10) did not activate either the HIS3 orLacZ reporter genes, indicating that the pGBT9-ATF2 construct alone failed to activate at the GAL4 binding sites of the reporter genes. A PHA-stimulated human peripheral leukocyte Matchmaker™ cDNA library (CLONTECH) was transformed into HF7C yeast already containing the pGBT9-ATF2 construct. Transformants were grown in the absence of tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (selective minimal media) at 30 °C for 8 days. The library was screened twice by this method with a total of 3 × 106 clones analyzed. Colonies that grew in this selective minimal media condition (eight colonies), were scored for β-galactosidase activity by the filter assay method. Colonies were lifted directly from plates onto Whatman no. 50 filters, lysed by freeze-fracture in liquid nitrogen, and allowed to thaw at room temperature for 1 min. Filters were then incubated, colony side up, on Whatman no. 3MM filters that had been presoaked in β-galactosidase assay buffer. Filters were incubated at 30 °C for up to 6 h. His+/β-galactosidase+ colonies were directly recovered from the plate and grown in selective media lacking leucine. DNA inserts from the positive yeast clones were electrotransformed into HB101 leucine auxotrophic bacterial cells. The HB101 transformants were grown on M9 (−Leu, −Amp) minimal medium to select for plasmids that contained the pGAD10 vector (−Leu, −Amp). The cDNA inserts were sequenced using automated sequencing analysis (ABI sequence analyzer, Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson University). A 670-bp probe was prepared from the coding region of the hUBC9 cDNA byEcoRI/SpeI digestion. This32P-labeled probe was used in Southern blot, Northern blot, and screening of λgt10 human peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library. cDNA inserts were excised from purified phage DNA byEcoRI digestion. From 1 × 106plaque-forming units that were screened with the 670-bp probe, two phages were obtained that were carried through primary, secondary, and tertiary screenings. These phages were grown in liquid culture, and a DNA extraction was performed. The cDNA inserts were released byEcoRI digestion of purified phage DNA and subjected to Southern blot analysis utilizing the 670-bp coding region probe. Both phage carried an identical insert of 1.3 kb that hybridized strongly to the probe. The inserts were sequenced using automated sequencing analysis (ABI sequence analyzer, Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson University). Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method as described previously (6Feuerstein N. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was analyzed on glyoxal-agarose gel and transferred onto Nytran filters. Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) contained 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane of different human tissues run on a denaturing formaldehde 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to a charged modified nylon membrane, and fixed by UV irradiation. A 670-bp probe was prepared from the coding region of the hUBC9 cDNA byEcoRI/SpeI digestion and labeled by random priming using [32P]dCTP. Hybridization was performed as described previously (6Feuerstein N. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Southern blot (Zoo Blot,CLONTECH) contained 4 μg of genomic DNA per lane from eukaryotic different species. DNA was digested withEcoRI, run on a 7% agarose gel, transferred to a charged modified nylon membrane, and fixed by UV irradiation. A 670-bp probe was prepared from the coding region of the hUBC9 cDNA byEcoRI/SpeI digestion and labeled by random priming using [32P]dCTP. The hUBC9 cDNA was subcloned into the pGEX2T vector in frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) moiety. The pGEX2T-hUBC9 construct was transformed into BL21 pLysS Escherichia coli and induced to express a GST-hUBC9 fusion protein by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-dgalactopyranoside. The fusion protein was isolated and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose beads. The fusion protein was then eluted from the beads and was sent for production of a polyclonal antibody in rabbit (horseradish peroxidase, Antisera Services, Denver, PA). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which was performed using purified hUBC9 (the GST moiety was cleaved using thrombin cleavage assay), demonstrated a titer of ≥1:204,800. Western blot analysis detected specifically an ∼18–20-kDa protein. This assay was performed using the protocol described previously (34Feuerstein R. Wang X. Song D.C. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). pGEX3X-ATF2 construct was transformed into BL21 E. coli and induced to express GST-ATF2. ATF2 was cleaved from the GST moiety by incubation with factor Xa (ICN) at 40:1 w/w ratio for 16 h at 4 °C in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2. The GST moiety was pelleted using glutathione-agarose beads, and the supernatant was collected as purified ATF2. Purified ATF2 and purified actin (Sigma) were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated in blocking solution (5% bovine serum albumin in UB buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% NaN3) overnight at 4 °C. The blocked membrane was incubated in overlay buffer, containing: 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.25% gelatin, 1% Nonidet-P40, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. GST-hUBC9 was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of heart muscle kinase and exposed to thrombin cleavage as described (34Feuerstein R. Wang X. Song D.C. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The purified radiolabeled hUBC9 (∼20,000 cpm) was added to the overlay buffer and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed extensively in UB buffer supplemented with 0.5% sarcosyl, dried, and autoradiographed. Subcellular fractionation of nuclei and cytosolic fraction were performed as described previously (6Feuerstein N. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. J. Biol.

Jurkat T cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 at 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated in the presence or absence of concanavalin A (5 μg/ml) and PMA (10 ng/ml). At the end of the incubation period, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl/10 × 106 cells of RSB buffer (0.01 mTris-HCl, 0.01 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmleupeptin, for 2 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as the soluble fraction and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Nuclear proteins were extracted in urea lysis buffer containing 4.5m urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Equal amounts of nuclear or soluble proteins (30 μg) were mixed with Laemmli gel sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then was blotted with anti-hUBC9 antiserum (1:1000 dilution) at room temperature for 2 h. Detection of the immunoreactive band was done by ECL system. Another cellular fractionation method was performed to verify no cross-contamination between the soluble and the nuclear fractions. Cells (∼95 × 106) were washed and then resuspended in 3 ml of homogenization buffer containing: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.25 m sucrose and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were homogenized using Dounce homogenizer (20–30 strokes) at 4 °C. The presence of intact nuclei was verified using the microscope. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2200 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The soluble fraction was further purified by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the proteins were acetone-precipitated. Jurkat T cells at logarithmic growth were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were homogenized at 4 °C, the unbroken cells were pelleted rapidly in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was frozen at −20 °C until further use in ubiquitin conjugation assay. Purified GST-ATF2 was exposed to a standard ubiquitin conjugation assay as described previously (36Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9582-9589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (35 μl) contained: 5–15 μg of GST-ATF2, 5–10 μg of ubiquitin, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 units/ml creatine phosphokinase from rabbit muscle (Sigma), 50 μmdithiothreitol, 0.6 units/ml inorganic phosphate from yeast (Sigma), 5 mm creatine phosphate, 10–50 μg of Jurkat T cell protein extract (as indicated in the specific experiments), purified hUBC9 (∼150 ng), and 1 μm lactacystin (purchased from Dr. E. Corey, Harvard University, Cambridge MA). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time as indicated and stopped by adding 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads and incubation at 4 °C. After 7 min of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C, and washed twice more with Tris-buffered saline. The pelleted beads were dissolved in 30 μl of 2× SDS-sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed on 7.5% acrylamide gels. The proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and the ubiquitin-conjugated ATF2 forms were detected by Western blot analysis with anti-ATF2 antibody or with affinity-purified antibody, which detect specifically ubiquitin conjugate. Western blot analysis of anti-Ub was done at 1:4000 dilution, and detection was performed with ECL. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot were done as described previously (6Feuerstein N. Huang D.

At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with RIPA buffer (0.15m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, leupeptine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25 mm TPCK, 0.25 mm TLCK, 5 mm N-ethylamide, 50 μm N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. Equal amounts of proteins (1–2 mg of proteins at 300 μl) were incubated with rotation at 4 °C with 1.5 μg of sheep anti-ATF2 IgG or nonimmune sheep IgG for 2–3 h. The immune complex was precipitated by incubation with 40 μl of protein G-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with RIPA. The beads were suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed on 10–12% acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with anti-ATF2 as described previously.

https://openalex.org/W2019566306,"Nucleoside-diphosphate kinases (NDKs) catalyze the transfer of γ-phosphoryl groups from NTPs via an active site histidine to NDPs using a ping-pong mechanism. We have used the change of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence that occurs upon phosphorylation of NDK to measure the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation with a range of nucleotides and nucleotide analogues. For natural nucleotides, the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were linearly dependent upon nucleotide concentration until they became too fast to measure. The second order rate constants for phosphorylation by natural NTPs varied between 0.7 and 13 × 106m−1s−1. Dephosphorylation by NDPs was 2–3-fold faster than the corresponding phosphorylation reaction, and dephosphorylation by dNDPs was 3–4-fold slower than the equivalent NDPs. In all cases, second order rate constants were highest for guanine followed by adenine and lowest for cytosine nucleotides. NDK also catalyzes the transfer of thiophosphate from adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) and guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) to NDP, but at 11000 of the equivalent phosphoryl transfer rates. In this case, the observed rate constants of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were hyperbolically dependent on nucleotide concentration. Thiophosphorylation by ATPγS and GTPγS occurred withkmax of 2.8 and 1.35 s−1 and Kd of 145 and 36 μm respectively. For dethiophosphorylation by a range of NDPs, kmaxwas in the range of 5–30 s−1, whereasKd varied between 0.16 and 3.3 mm. Guanine had the lowest Kd values, and cytosine had the highest. The data are consistent with fast reversible binding of the nucleotide followed by the rate-limiting phosphoryl transfer. Thiophosphates change only the rate of the phosphoryl transfer step, whereas both events are influenced by the base. Modification at the 2′-hydroxyl of ribose has only a small effect, while the overall rate of phosphoryl transfer is reduced 1000-fold by modification at the 3′-ribose.

NDK exists as either hexamers (most eukaryotic species) or tetramers (most prokaryotic species) and has been reported to display little specificity for different nucleotide bases (2Mourad N.

It is thus considered a housekeeping enzyme (4Parks R.E. Agarwal R.P. Enzymes. 1973; 8: 307-334Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar), a role that has taken on greater significance with the therapeutic use of nucleotide analogues such as azidothymidine (AZT) as replication inhibitors as these compounds must be phosphorylated in the cell before becoming active (5Furmann P.A.

Cancer. 1995; 72: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), emphasizing the importance of the presence of functional NDK in the cell. Beyond their role as nucleotide kinases, a multitude of biological activities have been ascribed to these enzymes, ranging from their potential function as histidine protein kinases to the identification of NDK-B as a nucleic acid-binding protein acting as a transcription factor for the c-myc oncogene (for a review, see Refs. 13Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1170-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and 14De La Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Most recently, another member of the human nm23 tumor suppressor family, DR-nm23, has been identified; this protein seems to be involved in myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation (15Venturelli D. Martinez R. Melotti P. Casella I. Peschle C. Cucco C. Spampinato G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7435-7439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A fourth member, nm23-H4, might represent a mitochondrial isoform of human NDKs (16Milon L. Rousseau-Merck M.-F. Munier A. Erent M. Lascu I. Capeau J. Lacombe M.-L. Human Genet. 1997; 99: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the complete biological role of NDK is not clearly defined, a situation underlined by the poor understanding of the mechanism of substrate recognition and phosphate transfer by the protein. The mechanism of the NDK activity has been extensively studied in the steady state, and a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism of NDK is well established (4Parks R.E. Agarwal R.P. Enzymes. 1973; 8: 307-334Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 17Garces E. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, the overall reaction is the sum of a donor and acceptor half-reaction, following the reaction scheme, E+NTP⇌K1E­NTP⇌K2E∼P­NDP⇌K3E∼P+NDPSCHEME 1 where E represents NDK, E∼P is phosphorylated NDK, and NTP and NDP are substrates and products and where Ki (=k+i/k−i) is the equilibrium constant of the ith step. However, the nature of the ping-pong mechanism with a single substrate binding site means that both of the substrates and both products compete with each other for the binding site. Thus, it is notoriously difficult to establish the true steady state parameters for such a system. This has resulted in different claims for the extent to which NDK discriminates between different substrates (2Mourad N. Parks R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dumas C. Lascu I. Morera S. Glaser P. Fourme R. Wallet V. Lacombe M.-L. Veron M. Janin J.

A transient kinetic approach has the potential to avoid such problems as each half-reaction can be studied in the absence of the second substrate. Under such conditions, the addition of an excess of NTP results in a single turnover of the enzyme to produce stoichiometric amounts of phosphorylated enzyme and NDP. However, few transient kinetic studies of NDK have been reported mainly because of the lack of a simple assay system for the single turnover reaction. An exception was the quenched flow study by Wålinder et al. (21Wålinder O. Zetterqvist Ö. Engström L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1060-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using ATP and dGDP as substrates. The recent report (22Deville-Bonne D. Sellam O. Merola F Lascu I. Desmadril M. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14634-14650Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that the phosphorylation of the active site histidine of NDK from Dictyostelium discoideum results in an enhancement of the intrinsic protein fluorescence suggested that a transient kinetic approach would now be possible. We present here a detailed transient kinetic analysis of the human NDK-A and -B, which have been overexpressed in bacterial cells. Each half-reaction of NDK-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer was examined independently for a wide range of substrates and substrate analogues. The approach allowed the measurement of individual rate and equilibrium constants for the reaction shown above and demonstrated that for most nucleotides the enzyme binds the nucleotide rapidly and reversibly followed by rate-limiting phosphoryl transfer. In addition, the enzyme shows a significant preference for adenine and guanine nucleotides with the highest affinity for guanine nucleotides and fastest phosphoryl transfer for adenine nucleotides. Nucleotides, enzymes, and other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim, unless stated otherwise. AZT-TP and 2′(3′)-O-(N-methyl-anthraniloyl)-ATP were generous gifts from Prof. R. S. Goody. When checked for purity by HPLC analysis (see below), ATP, ADP, GTP, and GDP were found to be more than 95% pure. ATPγS and ADPβS were more than 90% pure with the contaminating nucleotides ADP and AMP, respectively, at less than 10%. The cDNAs encoding NDK-A and -B (which were a generous gift from Dr. M.-L. Lacombe) were cloned into the vector pJC20 (23Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.G. Wilson S. Lambert K. Wu C. Cell. 1990; 63: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) with and without an N-terminal histidine tag. The pJC20 HisN vector contains the multiple cloning site of pET19b. It fuses the amino acid sequence MGH10ID4KHLD to the N terminus of the protein. This sequence includes an enterokinase cleavage site. For overproduction of recombinant proteins, these vectors were transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain. A total of 5–10 1-liter cultures were grown, and expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 5 h at 37 °C at an optical density of 0.5–0.7 at 600 nm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 rpm in a Sorvall RC-3B centrifuge and broken down by freezing and sonication. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 1 h at 11,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor in a Sorvall RC-5B. Unmodified proteins NDK-A and -B were purified and characterized as described previously (24Schaertl S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To prepare His-tagged proteins (NDK-AHis and NDK-BHis), cell extracts were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, containing 20 mm imidazole, and loaded onto a nickel column (Ni2+-nitrolotriacetic acid-agarose; Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). The column was washed with the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, and proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole in this buffer. The protein solutions were equilibrated in buffer A (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), concentrated by dialysis against solid ammonium sulfate, and stored as an ammonium sulfate precipitate at 4 °C. Proteins were recovered by gel filtration (PD10 column, Pharmacia) or by dialysis against buffer A. Purity of proteins was analyzed by standard gel electrophoresis in 15% acrylamide in the presence of SDS (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by measuring the absorption at 280 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 1.3 cm2 mg−1 (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) and molecular masses as given under “Results.” All protein concentrations given are with respect to catalytic sites, i.e. monomers. Phosphorylated protein was prepared by incubating 1 ml of 20–50 μm NDK with an at least 20-fold molar excess of ATP or ATPγS for 1 min at 25 °C and then passing it through a PD10 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) which removed the nucleotides. The phosphoenzyme and thiophosphoenzyme were stable for several hours (27Morera S. Chiadmi M. Le Bras G. Lascu I. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11062-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). NDK activity was measured at 20 °C in a standard pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled enzyme assay (4Parks R.E. Agarwal R.P. Enzymes. 1973; 8: 307-334Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar) using 2 mm ATP and 0.5 mm dTDP as substrates in buffer A. The nucleoside diphosphate substrate for NDK was dTDP because this nucleotide is a poor substrate for pyruvate kinase. An activity of 1 unit is defined as the turnover of 1 μmol of substrate in 1 min per mg of protein. The coupled enzyme assay is not suitable for following the NDK reaction with ATP and GDP as substrates, since the latter is a good substrate for pyruvate kinase. This reaction was studied by HPLC. 1 ml of experimental buffer containing 0.5–5 nm NDK-B was incubated with 5 mm ATP and 1 mm GDP. Aliquots of 40 μl were removed at fixed time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by heating to 80 °C or by injecting directly into the HPLC column. Nucleotides were separated on a C-18 reversed phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, Bischoff Chromatography) filled with Hypersil 5.0 μm on a Beckman System Gold HPLC apparatus. The column was run at room temperature at an isocratic flow of 1.5 ml/min with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, 7.5% acetonitrile (modified after Ref. 28Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Turnover rates were determined from the amount of generated GTP and ADP as a function of time. Steady-state measurements on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer LS 3B fluorimeter at 20 °C. The rates of nucleotide-induced protein fluorescence changes were measured with a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-51 or SF-61 stopped-flow rapid mixing device equipped with a 100-watt xenon/mercury lamp and monochromator. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm and detected at 90° to the incident light after passing through a WG 320 cut-off filter. A total of 512 12-bit data points were collected using a DAS 50 analogue to digital converter in a Hewlett Packard 486 computer running Hi-Tech software. 3–10 traces were collected with the same solution, averaged, and fitted to a single-exponential (Ft =Famplitude e −kobst +F∞) function using a nonlinear least-squares fitting routine. In all measurements, enzyme was mixed with at least 5-fold excess of nucleotides; if nucleotide concentrations over 1 mm were used, MgCl2 was added to ensure that Mg2+ was present in excess. Concentrations always refer to the concentrations of the reactants after mixing in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Experiments were performed at 20 °C in buffer A. Unmodified and N-terminally histidine-tagged NDK-A and -B were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity. The proteins (NDK-A, NDK-AHis, NDK-B, and NDK-BHis) migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) as single bands at 20, 23, 19, and 22 kDa compared with calculated molecular weights (excluding the N-terminal methionine) of 17,017, 20,198, 17,167, and 20,348, respectively. Histidine-tagged proteins showed a faint second band running at the size of the untagged protein. This was probably due to cleavage of the tag at the enterokinase recognition site during the purification process; it contained less than 10% of the total protein. When tested for activity in the coupled enzyme assay (with 2 mm ATP and 0.5 mm dTDP as substrates) at 20 °C, all proteins had specific activities of 450 units, being equivalent to turnover rates of 130 s−1. Activities of NDK-B and -BHis with 5 mm ATP and 1 mm GDP at 20 °C as determined by HPLC analysis were 120 and 136 s−1, respectively. This compares to values of 160 and 210 s−1 measured before (6Gilles A.M. Presecan E. Vonica A. Lascu I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8784-8789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for NDK-A and -B with 1 mm ATP and 0.3 mm 8-bromo-IDP at 25 °C. An active site titration was performed by measuring the amount of newly generated ADP with the HPLC method after incubating 14 μmNDK-BHis with 140 μm ATP. About 80% of the protein sites were phosphorylated as reported previously (17Garces E. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,29Lecroisey A. Lascu I. Bominaar A. Veron M. Delepierre M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12445-12450Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When 50 μm ATP was added to 1 μmNDK-B, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence decreased by about 10%. When phosphorylated NDK-B was prepared, the addition of 50 μm ADP resulted in a 7% increase in fluorescence. The addition of ADP to NDK-B or the addition of ATP to phosphorylated NDK-B had no measurable effect on the fluorescence, apart from a small quench due to absorption of the nucleotide. This demonstrated that the observed fluorescence changes indicated the phosphorylation state of the enzyme and not nucleotide binding (22Deville-Bonne D. Sellam O. Merola F Lascu I. Desmadril M. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14634-14650Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In a titration experiment, the tryptophan fluorescence (excitation, 295 nm; emission, 340 nm) of 11 μm NDK-B or NDK-BHis was recorded at ATP concentrations between 0 and 300 μm (Fig. 1). The change in fluorescence (ΔF) was plotted against the added ATP concentration and used to determine K50%, the concentration of ATP at which half of the maximal fluorescence change occurred, i.e. when half of the total protein is phosphorylated. A correction was made for the linear decrease in fluorescence due to absorption of the nucleotide by repeating the titration with ADP. At [ATP]total =K50%, half of the NDK (initially 11 μm) is phosphorylated, and therefore [NDK] = [NDK∼P] = [ADP] = 112 μm. These values were used to calculate the overall equilibrium constantKeq from the equation, Keq=[NDK∼P][ADP]/[NDK][ATP]Equation 1 where [ATP] = [ATP]total − 5.5 μm. The values of K50% were 14.9 ± 1 μm for NDK-B and 15.7 ± 1 μm for NDK-BHis. Thus, Keq = 0.59 ± 0.05 was obtained for NDK-B, and Keq = 0.54 ± 0.05 was obtained for NDK-BHis. NDK-A showed a similar quenching in fluorescence upon adding ATP; however, the change in fluorescence was smaller (∼7% upon addition of ATP) than for NDK-B. Due to this small signal,Keq was not determined for NDK-A. Since the addition of ATP leads to a 10% decrease in protein fluorescence, this signal can be used to follow the rate of the ATP-induced phosphorylation reaction. Fig. 2 a shows the changes in fluorescence recorded upon mixing 0.5 μmNDK-BHis with 10 μm ATP in the stopped-flow fluorimeter. A 9% decrease in fluorescence was observed, which was well described by a single exponential function with an observed rate constant (kobs) of 88 s−1. When ADP replaced ATP, no significant change in fluorescence occurred. In an analogous experiment, 0.5 μm phosphorylated NDK-BHis (NDK-BHis∼P) was mixed with 5 μm ADP and led to a 6% increase in fluorescence, withkobs = 119 s−1 (Fig. 2 b). The addition of ATP to phosphorylated enzyme produced no change in fluorescence. The measurement was repeated for nucleotide concentrations between 2.5 and 30 μm for ATP and 2 and 10 μm for ADP. At even higher concentrations, the reaction was difficult to measure, since the amplitude of the reaction gradually disappeared, limited by the 2-ms dead time of the stopped-flow system. Over these concentration ranges, kobs was linearly dependent on nucleotide concentration (Fig. 3,a and b). The linear dependence of kobs suggests that the change in fluorescence was limited by the rate of nucleotide binding, and the slope of the best fit line defines the apparent second order rate constant for the nucleotide binding reaction. A provisional assignment of this second order rate constant in terms of the intrinsic rate constants of Scheme 1 can be made with a few assumptions: 1) the fluorescent signal originates from the formation of the phosphorylated protein; and 2) the reverse reaction is negligible because the concentration of ADP is very low throughout the transient reaction (reaching a maximum of 0.5 μm, the concentration of the protein). In this case, there are two situations in which a single exponential is expected for the fluorescence transient and in which kobs is linearly dependent on ATP concentration. 1) When the phosphoryl transfer reaction is much faster than nucleotide binding (i.e. k+2 + k−2≫ [ATP] k+1 +k−1), then the apparent second order rate constant is given by k+1. This predicts that the event observed is a diffusion-controlled reaction, and as suchk+1 should have a value of 107 to 108m−1 s−1, and it should have little dependence on temperature (30Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Science. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1995: 261-275Google Scholar). In fact, the second order rate constant is of the order expected for a diffusion controlled reaction for ADP (and GDP, as shown below), but this is not true of all other nucleotides (see below). 2) When phosphoryl transfer is much slower than nucleotide binding (i.e. k+2 + k-2 ≪ [ATP] k+1 + k−1), thenkobs is predicted to be hyperbolically dependent on [ATP], kobs=K1k+2[ATP]/(1+K1[ATP])Equation 2 and at low ATP concentrations, such that K1× [ATP] ≪ 1, then kobs =K1k+2[ATP], and the apparent second order rate constant definesK1k+2. The model in which k+2 +k−2 ≅ [ATP] k+1 +k−1 can be eliminated, since this would produce significant deviations from a single exponential change in fluorescence. The data for ATP and ADP (Fig. 3) do not clearly distinguish cases 1 and 2. Preliminary data at 10 °C suggest the reaction slows down by a factor of 2, which again does not clearly distinguish the two possible interpretations. However, in general we favor situation 2, because the values of the second order rate constants observed for a wide range of nucleotides, discussed below, are much too slow for a diffusion-controlled reaction. The same measurements were repeated for untagged NDK-B and untagged and His-tagged NDK-A, and the data are summarized in Table I. All proteins have similar rates of phosphorylation; however, dephosphorylation was 2–3-fold faster for NDK-B compared with NDK-BHis and for untagged and His-tagged NDK-A. The amplitudes of the fluorescence changes were not altered by the His-tag, and NDK-A had an approximately 2-fold smaller amplitude than NDK-B. Since the differences between the tagged and untagged proteins are small, the remainder of the measurements presented here have used the more easily produced NDK-BHis.Table IApparent second order rate constants for the observed fluorescence changes upon mixing ATP with NDK and ADP with phosphorylated NDK (NDK ∼ P) for NDK-B, NDK-BHis, NDK-A, and NDK-AHisSecond order rate constant (× 10−6m−1 s−1)NDK-BNDK-BHisNDK-ANDK-AHisATP + NDK6.0 ± 27.9 ± 0.56.8 ± 1.55.2 ± 1ADP + NDK ∼ P30.4 ± 617.9 ± 110.0 ± 313.2 ± 6 Open table in a new tab The results presented in Table I show that for the ATP/ADP substrate pair, the dephosphorylation reaction is 2–5 times faster than the phosphorylation reaction, leading to Keq (equal to kphos/kdephos) = 0.2–0.67 for all constructs, which is in broad agreement with the titration data (Fig. 2). These values are in the same range as determined for D. discoideum NDK of 0.2 (22Deville-Bonne D. Sellam O. Merola F Lascu I. Desmadril M. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14634-14650Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), for yeast NDK of 0.19 (17Garces E. Cleland W.W.

Biochem. 1983; 135: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reactions shown in Fig. 2, a and b, were repeated for a wide range of naturally occurring nucleotides and in each case, the reaction could be described by a single exponential. The plots of kobs against the nucleotide concentration are shown in Fig. 3. The apparent second order rate constants obtained from the slopes of the plots are summarized in Table II.Table IIApparent second order rate constants of nucleotide-induced fluorescence change for NDK-BHis (a) and phosphorylated NDK-BHis(b)Base moietySecond order rate constant (× 10−6m−1 s−1)NTP (a)NDP (b)dNDP (b)Adenine7.9 ± 0.517.9 ± 14.5 ± 0.5Guanine12.2 ± 0.529.1 ± 2.410.3 ± 2.7Uracil2.0 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.1Cytosine0.7 ± 0.031.3 ± 0.040.2 ± 0.004Thymine2.3 ± 0.12-aDeoxythymidine triphosphate.4.3 ± 0.12-a Deoxythymidine triphosphate.

In all cases, the plots were linear over the accessible range. It is important to note that for most of the nucleotides used the values of the intercepts from these plots are not significantly different from 0. Only ATP, GTP, dADP, and dGDP have significant intercepts, and this suggests that the assumption of a negligible reverse reaction is not completely valid in these cases. For the model of Scheme 1, in which both nucleotide binding events are much faster than the phosphoryl transfer step, the complete solu"

In the absence of DNA, the E47 bHLH domain forms a very stable homodimer, whereas MyoD is unfolded and monomeric. Fluorescence quenching experiments show that MyoD does not dimerize with E47 under dilute conditions in the absence of DNA.

An altered MyoD bHLH substituted with the loop segment from E47 folds in the absence of DNA, and it readily dimerizes with E47. In the presence of a specific DNA binding site, MyoD and E47 both form homodimeric complexes with DNA that have similar dissociation constants, despite the very different stabilities of these protein dimers off DNA. A 1:1 mixture of these bHLH domains forms almost exclusively heterodimeric complexes on DNA. Assembly of these bHLH-DNA complexes is apparently governed by the strength of each subunit's interaction with the DNA and not by the strength of protein-protein interactions at the dimer interface.

Many activating transcription factors bind to their DNA targets as heterodimers in which each subunit has a distinctive DNA binding preference and transcriptional activity. The strength of transcriptional activation is modulated by the choice of subunits forming these protein dimers, their cellular concentrations, and their affinities for DNA regulatory sites.

In general, bHLH proteins function as heterodimers of a tissue-specific bHLH protein and one of the widely expressed bHLH proteins known as E-proteins. The well characterized bHLH protein MyoD is a master regulator of skeletal muscle development (2Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R.

MyoD binds to regulatory sequences upstream of muscle-specific genes and activates transcription. MyoD's biological activity is contingent upon E-proteins, such as the alternative splice products of the E2A gene, E47 and E12, which physically associate with MyoD and bind to regulatory DNA sites as heterodimers (12Murre C.

Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Dimerization of MyoD and other bHLH proteins is mediated by the helix-loop-helix motif, a four-helix bundle that positions the N-terminal basic region in the major groove of DNA (15Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The 60-residue bHLH domain of MyoD is necessary and sufficient for the myogenic conversion of cultured fibroblasts (1Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Science. 1992; 256: 1027-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), implying that the delivery of this compact DNA-binding domain to E-box regulatory sites (-CANNTG-) can commit cells to a program of muscle development.E-proteins promote MyoD's transcriptional activity by recruiting it to DNA regulatory sites in heterodimeric DNA complexes that form in preference to either homodimeric complex (13Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 14Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H.

The higher stability of these heterodimeric complexes might result from the strength of bHLH heterodimerization as well as from the strength of interactions with the DNA. Despite the similar crystal structures of the MyoD-DNA complex and the E47-DNA complex (15Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), the protein fold of the MyoD bHLH is markedly less stable than that of E47 (19Anthony-Cahill S.J. Benfield P.A. Fairman R. Wassermann Z.R. Brenner S.L. Stafford W.F.I. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1992; 255: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 20Fairman R. Beran-Steed R.K.

E-proteins could stabilize the folded conformation of the MyoD bHLH by forming stable heterodimers that deliver MyoD to DNA. Alternatively, the number or strength of the DNA contacts made by the MyoD-E47 heterodimer may be increased relative to those made by either homodimer. We have investigated the dimerization strengths and preferences of the MyoD and E47 bHLH domains to address the selective formation of MyoD-E47-DNA complexes.DISCUSSIONTranscriptionally active bHLH complexes consist of two protein subunits bound to a regulatory DNA site. Although many bHLH proteins can bind to DNA as homodimers, they regulate cellular development by the selective formation of DNA-bound bHLH heterodimers. Consistent with this in vivo function, heterodimeric DNA complexes predominate over homodimeric complexes when appropriate bHLH partners are mixed with DNA sites in vitro (Fig. 4; Refs. 1Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Science. 1992; 256: 1027-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H.

A full description of transcriptional regulation by bHLH proteins requires knowledge of the mechanism of bHLH subunit association during DNA binding. The association of particular DNA-bound dimers could result either from more favorable protein-protein interactions or from better protein-DNA contacts in the preferred complex. Because bHLH proteins show a wide range of dimerization strengths in the absence of DNA (19Anthony-Cahill S.J. Benfield P.A. Fairman R. Wassermann Z.R. Brenner S.L. Stafford W.F.I. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1992; 255: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 20Fairman R. Beran-Steed R.K. Anthony-Cahill S.J. Lear J.D. Stafford W.F.I. DeGrado W.F. Benfield P.A. Brenner S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10429-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), protein-protein interactions have been widely considered to be the more likely of these two possibilities. However, the DNA binding constants of most bHLH complexes are in the 1-30 nm range, and it is difficult to monitor these protein-protein interactions at the concentrations that are relevant for DNA binding. We therefore used a fluorescence assay to study the oligomerization of MyoD and E47 at concentrations approximating their dissociation constants to reveal the nature of the regulatory complex formation.Although the structures of the bHLH domains of MyoD and E47 are very similar in the DNA complexes (Fig. 1), in the absence of DNA only E47 is stably folded and dimeric at low concentrations (Fig. 3). The instability of the MyoD bHLH in the absence of DNA is reminiscient of the behavior of basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. The bZIP protein c-Fos does not form homodimers, because of the repulsive interactions of several acidic residues in its leucine zipper. However, c-Fos readily dimerizes with its partner c-Jun, forming intersubunit salt bridges between basic residues in the leucine zipper of c-Jun and the corresponding acidic residues of c-Fos (35O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 699-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We expected that MyoD and its dimerization partner E47 might likewise associate in a very stable heterodimer, and this could explain the selective binding of MyoD-E47 dimers to DNA. However, we find that the MyoD bHLH fails to stably associate with E47 in the absence of DNA (Fig. 5). The high concentrations of MyoD required for its interaction with fE47 (Fig. 5 A) approach the dimerization constant of MyoD homodimers, indicating that in the absence of DNA there is no preference for the formation of MyoD-E47 heterodimers. The addition of DNA allows the formation of MyoD-E47-DNA complexes. MyoD likewise fails to dimerize with the closely related E12 protein in the absence of DNA (36Maleki S.J. Royer C.A. Hurlburt B.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6762-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unlike E47, E12 binds to DNA exclusively in heterodimeric complexes with MyoD or E47, because of an inhibitory domain located N-terminal to the basic region that prevents the formation of E12 homodimers (18Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 36Maleki S.J. Royer C.A. Hurlburt B.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6762-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Shirakata M. Paterson B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1766-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the dimerization preferences in solution do not explain the DNA binding preferences of MyoD and its E-protein partners. Instead, the DNA binding equilibrium favors the MyoD-E47 heterodimer because of more favorable contacts made by one or both subunits to the DNA. This model is confirmed by the DNA binding affinities of the MyoD and E47 bHLH domains in homo- and heterodimeric complexes.The binding isotherms for DNA complex formation are sigmoidal, which suggests two possible mechanisms of binding. Either bHLH domains can bind to DNA only as dimers and the equilibria for dimerization and DNA binding are coupled, or monomers bind initially to DNA and a second monomer binds with high cooperativity to form the stable dimeric complex. The fact that MyoD and E47 homodimers bind to DNA with comparable affinities (Table II), despite their vastly different dimerization constants off DNA (Table I), makes the mechanism of dimers binding to DNA in a coupled equilibrium seem unlikely. For coupled equilibria, the overall equilibrium binding constant of DNA complex formation is the product of the dimer dissociation constant and the dissociation constant for the dimer binding to DNA. Because the dimerization constants of E47 and MyoD differ by a factor of about 100, their very similar overall DNA binding constants can only be reached if the MyoD dimers bind to DNA 100-fold better than E47 dimers. Considering the similar DNA contacts made by these proteins (15Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), this possibility seems unlikely. In addition, the model of coupled equilibria predicts that covalently linked MyoD dimers should form an exceptionally stable protein-DNA complex. This is not the case, as shown by the data of Fig. 5 and Table II.We therefore favor the model in which bHLH monomers bind transiently to DNA and a second subunit is cooperatively recruited into the complex. We have fitted the DNA binding isotherms to an equation describing a cooperative binding mechanism (Equation 1) and obtained values for the microscopic binding constants (Table II). The data are reasonably well described by this relationship. However, a nonrandom deviation of the calculated curve is evident in the transition region of some of the binding isotherms (Figs. 5, B and D). We attribute this deviation to the fact that monomeric bHLH-DNA complexes are not detected by our EMSA assays. The failure to quantitate binding intermediates in highly cooperative processes results in precisely the deflection observed here (38Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this shortcoming of EMSA, the calculated DNA binding affinities of the bHLH dimers (Table I) agree with previously reported values (18Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 39Meierhans D. el-Ariss C. Neuenschwander M. Sieber M. Stackhouse J.F. Allemann R.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11026-11036Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although we do not observe significantly different DNA binding affinities for MyoD and E47, as reported by Sun and Baltimore (18Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the dimerization strengths of MyoD and E47 have little influence on their DNA binding affinities. Although the HLH dimerization motif is required for DNA binding (40Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar) and mutations in this segment can decrease DNA binding affinity, the primary role of the HLH interface might be to position each subunit of the dimer for optimal interactions with its DNA half-site. This positioning effect could be the basis for the observed cooperativity of binding to DNA.Our results using bHLH domains of MyoD and E47 appear to conflict with previous reports that in vitro translated full-length MyoD is co-immunoprecipitated with epitope-tagged E47 protein in the absence of DNA (12Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vässin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan N.Y. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D.

Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). We find that in vitro translated full-length MyoD and epitope-tagged full-length E47 do indeed coprecipitate in roughly equal amounts over a wide range of protein concentrations (0.5–100 pm concentration of each protein; data not shown). However, this protein-protein interaction appears to be nonspecific because it cannot be blocked by a 50-fold excess of the E47 bHLH studied here or the larger E47 fragment encoded by the partial cDNA originally isolated (12Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vässin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan N.Y. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). These latter E47 fragments readily dimerize with full-length E47 or MyoD in complexes with DNA, 3T. Keith Blackwell, personal communication. leading us to conclude that the contents of immune precipitates with epitope-tagged E47 do not reflect the true binding equilibrium in solution.The different dimerization behaviors of E47 and MyoD in the absence of DNA could provide the basis for an additional regulatory function. The enhanced dimerization strength of E47 in comparison with MyoD is due to localized structural differences in the helix-loop-helix segment, as demonstrated with the hybrid protein MyoEL. Helix 1 of the E47 HLH is one turn longer than helix 1 of MyoD or the analogous helix of the bHLH-zipper proteins Max (41Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and USF (42Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Helix 1 of the MyoD HLH segment is capped by a Tyr from helix 2 (Fig. 1), whereas the corresponding Val in E47 is smaller, and it allows for the extension of helix 1 by one additional helical turn. This extension of helix 1 in the E47 HLH increases the buried surface at the dimer interface, and it facilitates an intersubunit salt bridge between His366 at the COOH terminus of helix 1 and Glu390 in helix 2 of the apposing subunit. Residues in the loop of the E47 bHLH domain form a network of hydrogen bonds that bridges between helices 1 and 2 within each subunit. This unique hydrogen bond network stabilizes the HLH fold and, thus, probably contributes indirectly to the stability of E47 dimers. The substitution of E47's loop into the MyoD bHLH domain confirmed this hypothesis. The resulting MyoEL dimer is significantly more stable than the wild-type MyoD dimer (Fig. 3; Table I), and, in contrast to MyoD, it readily dimerizes with E47 in the absence of DNA (Fig. 6 C).MyoD tolerates a variety of insertions and nonconservative substitutions in its loop segment (17Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), suggesting that the loop contributes little to the proper functioning of wild-type MyoD. In contrast, residues in the loop of the inhibitory HLH protein Id1 are important for its dimerization specificity (43Pesce S. Benezra R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7874-7880Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Id1 and related inhibitory HLH proteins lack a functional basic region and thus fail to bind to DNA (44Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshorn D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 45Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 46Wilson R.B. Megerditch K. Shen C. Benezra R. Zwollo P. Dymecki S.M. Desiderio S.V. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6185-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These inhibitory proteins strongly associate with E47 and E12, whereas dimerization with MyoD is less favorable (44Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshorn D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 45Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar,47Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Id proteins probably block myogenic differentiation by sequestering E-proteins as inactive heterodimers, thereby depriving MyoD of a dimerization partner. The weak interaction between Id and MyoD might be explained by the relative instability of MyoD's HLH domain. We find that MyoD must interact with DNA to stably fold and dimerize at low peptide concentrations. Id proteins do not bind to DNA and are therefore disfavored as dimerization partners for MyoD. In contrast, the E47 HLH is a folded dimer at nanomolar peptide concentrations that can readily exchange with other folded bHLH domains (Figs. 3 and 5), including the Id protein. This could be an “Achilles heel” of regulated transcriptional responses, in which stably folded E-proteins promote the folding and DNA binding activities of their unstable partner MyoD. Id exploits the dimerization strength of E47 by sequestering it in inactive E47-Id heterodimers.Despite the substitution of the loop and several flanking residues from E47 into MyoD, the resulting MyoEL dimer is not as stable as E47, implying that additional residues contribute to the exceptional stability of E47 dimers. One likely candidate is Cys363 of E47, which is a serine in MyoD and MyoEL (Fig. 1). Cysteine 363 is buried in the HLH interface of the E47 dimer, and its substitution with the more polar residue serine is probably disfavored in this hydrophobic environment. Although it is located in the protein interior (16Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), Cys363 is prone to oxidation during long term storage of the E47 bHLH peptide. It has been suggested that formation of this intersubunit disulfide bond promotes, and may be required for, the DNA binding activity of E47 dimers (48Benezra R. Cell. 1994; 79: 1057-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, a disulfide link at this position is not compatible with the crystal structure of the E47 dimer. In our experience, oxidation of the E47 bHLH domain decreases its ability to bind DNA, and this deficiency can be overcome by reducing the peptide with 10 mm dithiothreitol (not shown). Under mildly reducing conditions, the E47 and MyoD subunits readily exchange, and they bind to DNA as both homodimers and heterodimers (Figs. 4 and5). These results suggest that disulfide-linked dimers of E47 adopt a nonnative structure that does not bind to DNA. Substitution of Cys363 in E47 with the more polar residue serine alters the dimerization activity and the secondary structure of the bHLH domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with this finding, it has been previously reported that an E47 bHLH peptide with the C363S substitution unfolds at significantly higher concentrations (20Fairman R. Beran-Steed R.K. Anthony-Cahill S.J. Lear J.D. Stafford W.F.I. DeGrado W.F. Benfield P.A. Brenner S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10429-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) than the wild-type E47 domain reported here.Our finding that the stabilities of various bHLH dimers in solution have little influence on the affinities of the corresponding bHLH-DNA complexes presents an apparent paradox. Although dimerization is required for the stabilization of DNA complexes, the DNA binding equilibrium does not reflect the amounts of preformed bHLH dimers in solution. One explanation for this behavior is a model in which the rate of association of bHLH proteins with DNA is limited by the rate of folding of the basic region segment and its interaction with DNA, irrespective of the oligomerization state of bHLH subunits. In this model, the initial binding of DNA effectively involves monomers, and dimerization is subsequently required to stabilize the protein-DNA complex once it is formed. Evidence for the transient association of basic region leucine zipper monomers with DNA, prior to stabilization of dimeric bZIP-DNA complexes, has been presented (49Metallo S.J. Schepartz A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 50Park C. Campbell J.L. Goddard W.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6287-6291Google Scholar). As suggested for the bZIP proteins, electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone may initially recruit bHLH subunits to the DNA, where a new equilibrium of specifically bound dimers is established. Our finding that specific and nonspecific DNAs promote the dimerization of MyoD with E47 supports this model of electrostatic recruitment for bHLH transcription factors. The nonspecific interaction of each bHLH subunit with DNA might shield unfavorable electrostatic interactions of the protein dimer interface, which destabilize MyoD dimers in the absence of DNA. In such a model, the relative stabilities of various bHLH-DNA complexes are determined by their rates of dissociation from DNA, and these rates depend on the particular DNA contacts made by each dimeric combination of subunits. This mechanism for transcriptional regulation does not require a strict control over the cellular levels of various bHLH subunits, because the equilibrium is determined by the DNA rather than the strength of protein-protein interactions. At the heart of transcriptional initiation are numerous cooperative interactions between basal factors, transcriptional activators, and their promoter DNA sites. Many activating transcription factors bind to their DNA targets as heterodimers in which each subunit has a distinctive DNA binding preference and transcriptional activity. The strength of transcriptional activation is modulated by the choice of subunits forming these protein dimers, their cellular concentrations, and their affinities for DNA regulatory sites.

This was then solubilized in guanidinium hydrochloride, immobilized on a cobalt-containing resin, and after dialysis against renaturation buffer, was quantitatively transformed to mature enzyme. However, when a mutation was introduced into the mature sequence to inactivate thermolysin, the proenzyme was not processed either in vivo or in vitro. In addition, mutated prothermolysin was not processed by exogenous thermolysin under a variety of experimental conditions.

However, when a mutation was introduced into the mature sequence to inactivate thermolysin, the proenzyme was not processed either in vivo or in vitro. In addition, mutated prothermolysin was not processed by exogenous thermolysin under a variety of experimental conditions. The results demonstrate that thermolysin maturation can proceed via an autocatalytic intramolecular pathway. Thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27), a 34.6 kDa extracellular neutral protease produced by the Gram-negative Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, is the prototype member of the M4 family of zinc endopeptidases (1Rawlings N. Barrett A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 290: 205-218Google Scholar). This thermostable enzyme was the first zinc endopeptidase to be crystallized, and subsequent crystallographic studies have led to a mechanism of action being proposed for the zinc metallopeptidases in general (reviewed in Ref. 2Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar). An active site model of thermolysin has also been used as a template for the design of inhibitors for several mammalian zinc metallopeptidases, for which structural data is lacking, such as neutral endopeptidase-24.11 (EC3.4.24.11), angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) and endothelin-converting enzyme (reviewed in Refs. 3Roques B.P.

Roques B.P. Beaumont A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As compared with other enzyme classes (reviewed in Refs. 8Shinde U. Inouye M. Trends Biochem.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), there have been comparatively few studies on the roles of prosequences of bacterial zinc peptidases, although they have been shown to be essential for the production of active enzyme in vivo(10Takagi M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26477-26481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The prosequences, as independent polypeptides, can also act as inhibitors of their respective mature enzymes (14O'Donohue M.J. Beaumount A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22726-22731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From site-directed mutagenesis studies of the M4 enzymes, it has been inferred that prosequence processing is autocatalytic, as mutations of active site residues often result in low or negligible yields of mature enzyme (16Toma S. Campagnoli S. Gregoris E.D. Gianna R. Margarit I. Zamai M. Grandi G. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17McIver K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J.

In addition, certain mutations in the active site of thermolysin that change specificity lead to the production of more than one enzyme species differing by their N-terminals. 1C. Marie-Claire and A. Beaumont, unpublished observations. For these reasons there have been few detailed studies involving the mutagenesis of residues responsible for activity and/or specificity of the thermolysin-like enzymes in contrast to the extensive research devoted to determining the factors involved in their varying degrees of thermostability (20Vriend G. Eijsink V. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 367-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Eijsink V. Veltman O.R. Aukema W. Vriend G. Venema G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To investigate further thermolysin maturation and, in particular, to determine if it proceeds via an intermolecular or intramolecular autolytic mechanism, prothermolysin with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag (His6-TLN) 2The abbreviations used are: His6-proTLN, His-tagged prothermolysin; His6-proTLN′, His-tagged prothermolysin with Glu-143 of the mature enzyme mutated to Ala; Gdm-HCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; [3H]Leu-enkephalin, [3H]tyrosyl-glycyl-glycyl-phenylalanyl-leucine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. has been expressed in Escherichia coli. A tagged proenzyme form with the mutation E143A in the mature sequence (His6-TLN′), was also expressed. This mutation was introduced to obtain a folding competent proenzyme, which would be incapable of any possible autolytic maturation. Glu-143 is an active site residue that acts as a general base, polarizing the water molecule that attacks the substrate scissile bond (2Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and various mutations of this residue in other M4 proteases have been found to reduce or eliminate maturation (16Toma S. Campagnoli S. Gregoris E.D. Gianna R. Margarit I. Zamai M. Grandi G. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17McIver K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J.

Moreover, in one study where residual maturation and activity was obtained, crystallographic data showed that the mutation (E143S) provoked only minor localized structural changes in the mature enzyme, which has 70% sequence identity with thermolysin (22Litster S. Wetmore D. Roche R. Codding P. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 543-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an alanine replacement of the equivalent residue to Glu-143 in the mammalian thermolysin-like enzymes discussed above has been shown to abolish their activity (23Devault A. Nault C.

The folding and processing of these prosequences have been studied in vivo and in vitro, in the latter case after their purification from inclusion bodies and immobilization on a Co2+ resin via the histidine tags. The results give direct proof that thermolysin processing is autocatalytic and also show that it is likely to be an intramolecular event. [3H]Leu-enkephalin was purchased from Izinta (Hungary) and [α-33P]dATP, [3H]leucine, the chemiluminescence kit for Western blotting, and the Sequenase enzyme (Version 2.0) were purchased from Amersham France S.A. (France). Culture media components were Difco products obtained from OSI (France). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys (UK). New England Biolabs DNA-modifying enzymes and theCLONTECH Talon Co2+-containing resin were from Ozyme (France), and the Xpress protein expression system was purchased from Invitrogen (Netherlands). GenElute agarose spin columns were from Supelco and the E. Coli T7 S30 extract was from Promega (France). The antipolyhistidine monoclonal antibody was from Sigma (France). E. coli DH5α was used to manipulate recombinant plasmids and E. coli JM109 (DE3), which contains the T7 RNA polymerase under the inducible control of the lacUV 5 promoter, for the induction of genes under T7 promoter control. E. coli strains were transformed with plasmids as described (26Sambrook F. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and cultured in L broth. Ampicillin was used at 100 μg/ml. Plasmid isolation, restriction endonuclease digestions and DNA modifications were carried out as described (26Sambrook F. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restricted or polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments were isolated and purified after agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA sequences were determined by the chain termination technique with Sequenase 2.0 using [α-33P]dATP. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out as described (27Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelford D.H. Sninsrky J.J. White T.S. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Method and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 3-12Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The reaction buffer contained pfu DNA polymerase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 6 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 0.25 mm of each of the dNTPs and 2 units of native pfu polymerase. Amplification protocols were adapted according to the primers used. Polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (28Ho S.M. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pearse L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). A pvuII unique restriction site was introduced at the junction between the pre- and prosequence by site-directed mutagenesis in the previously described pTLN2 vector (7O'Donohue M.J. Roques B.P. Beaumont A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mutated plasmid was then digested withpvuII and EcoRI and the resulting proTLN fragment inserted in the pRSET C expression vector digested by pvuII and EcoRI to add an N-terminal His-tag to the prosequences. JM109 (DE3) containing pRSET derivatives were grown in L broth, supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic at 37 °C to anA595 of 0.6, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Total protein and protein from the soluble and insoluble fractions were obtained as described (26Sambrook F. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Aliquots were run on 12% SDS-PAGE and the proteins either stained with Coomassie Blue or electrotransfered to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies raised against either thermolysin (kindly provided by Dr. C. Bohuon), or polyhistidine. The relative proportions of the proteins in the different bands after Western blotting was estimated by densitometry. E. coli cultures were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min, the pellet resuspended in 50 mm Hepes pH 8.0 containing 5 mmCaCl2, and the cells lysed by sonication on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was washed by sonicating in the same buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. After recentrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in 50 mm Hepes pH 8.0, containing 6 m Gdm-HCl and 5 mm CaCl2, and the preparation was centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatants were incubated with the Co2+ resin, previously equilibrated in the solubilization buffer for 20 min at room temperature, and the resin was extensively washed with the buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. For naturation experiments, aliquots of the resin were dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes pH 7.0 containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 4 μmZnCl2 for 48 h at 4 °C. Translation of [3H]His6-proTLN′ in vitro with the E. coli T7 S30 system was carried out using [3H]leucine and 2 μg of plasmid following the manufacturer's instructions, and the proteins were visualized after 12% SDS-PAGE by fluorography (26Sambrook F. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Thermolysin activity was measured as described previously using the pentapeptide [3H]Leu-enkephalin as substrate (7O'Donohue M.J. Roques B.P. Beaumont A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Benchetrit T. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In extracts of E. coli cells transformed with the wild-type histidine-tagged proenzyme (His6-proTLN), three proteins were detected after SDS-PAGE not present in control cells, which were recognized by the thermolysin antibody (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4) and were primarily located in the insoluble fraction. Only the protein with the highest apparent molecular weight corresponding to that of the intact His-tagged prosequence (62 kDa) was recognized by an anti-poly-His antibody (not shown). The protein with an apparent molecular mass of 58 kDa is likely to be an N-terminally truncated form of His6-proTLN possibly due to a second origin of replication in the construction downstream from the poly-His tag, as a similar species was also obtained when [3H]His6-proTLN′ was synthesized in a cell-free translation system (see below). The protein with the lowest apparent molecular mass (36 kDa) had the same mobility as a thermolysin standard, showing that some processing of the prosequence occurred intracellularly. In the case of E. coli cells transformed with His6-proTLN′, which contains the active site mutation, no protein corresponding to mature thermolysin was detected (Fig. 1,lanes 5 and 6), supporting the proposed autocatalytic nature of thermolysin maturation. The results also show that no endogenous E. coli protease is capable of specifically processing the His-tagged proenzymes. His6-proTLN and His6-proTLN′, which represented around 40% of the total protein present in the inclusion bodies, were solubilized in 6 m Gdm-HCl and independently immobilized on a Co2+-containing resin by their N-terminal tags. Around 200–300 μg of the proenzymes were attached/ml of resin, which was then extensively washed with a high salt buffer to eliminate contaminating protein (Fig. 2). Dialysis of immobilized His6-proTLN against renaturation buffer led to the total disappearance of the proenzyme and the concomitant appearance of a protein corresponding in molecular weight to mature thermolysin. The majority of this protein was found in the supernatant of the dialysate and was fully active against the thermolysin substrate [3H]Leu-enkephalin (Fig. 3,lanes 1–3). No protein was detected on the dialyzed resin by Coomassie Blue staining; most of the prosequence probably had been digested by thermolysin during the course of the dialysis (Fig. 3,lane 4), whereas a Western blot showed the presence of some mature enzyme, which represented ≤5% of the total. The resin-associated enzyme could be eluted with 500 mmimidazole, which removes His-tagged proteins, and was therefore presumably noncovalently attached to the remaining prosequence or C-terminally truncated derivatives. With the active site mutant, His6-proTLN′, no evidence for processing was observed in line with the in vivo results, the proprotein being recovered intact and still attached to the resin after dialysis (Fig. 3, lanes 5–7). The E143A mutation therefore either eliminated maturation or reduced it to undetectable levels under the conditions used.Figure 3Western blot of the immobilized denatured prosequences before and after dialysis.

Some active mature thermolysin was formed in extracts containing His6-proTLN, but the recovery was <1.0% of that obtained with a similar quantity of immobilized proenzyme. The preceding results not only demonstrate the autocatalytic nature of thermolysin maturation but also suggest that it is an intramolecular event. For further confirmation of this, His6-proTLN and His6-proTLN′ were co-immobilized on the resin in a 1:1 protein ratio. Renaturation by dialysis in this case resulted in both the formation of active mature thermolysin and the retention of a proenzyme form on the resin (Fig. 3, lanes 8–10). Similar results were obtained when the dialysis time was increased from 48 to 96 h. As the amount of proenzyme retained on the resin was approximately 50% of that originally bound, it seemed likely that this corresponded to His6-proTLN′. To verify this, [3H]His6-proTLN′ was produced in a cell free system (Fig. 4), which led as in vivo (Fig. 1) to the synthesis of two proteins, one of 62 kDa corresponding to the entire His-tagged prosequence, which was recognized by both the antithermolysin and antipolyhistidine antibodies and the second of 58 kDa, which was only recognized by the antithermolysin antibody (not shown) implying as discussed above a second origin of replication downstream from the poly-His tag. When the wild-type prosequence was synthesized under the same conditions a third protein corresponding to mature thermolysin was also obtained, which was used as a standard for other fluorographic experiments. When [3H]His6-proTLN′ was also co-immobilized as a tracer with His6-proTLN and His6-proTLN′, >99.8% of the radioactivity remained associated with the resin after 48 h dialysis, confirming that the active thermolysin produced from the wild-type proenzyme is unable to process the mutated proenzyme. The resistance of His6-proTLN′ to proteolysis by thermolysin also demonstrates that this protein has assumed a folded conformation. To see whether thermolysin might be able to process the mutated enzyme if the latter were not attached to a support, [3H]His6-proTLN′ and its N-terminally truncated form were incubated in solution with different concentrations of thermolysin for 1 h at 37 °C. Degradation of both proteins was observed only at the highest enzyme, proenzyme ratio used (1:1), and this was nonspecific in nature with no detectable radiolabeled mature thermolysin being formed (Fig. 4). Intermolecular processing however, might only occur if preceded by intermolecular folding. Free mature thermolysin previously denatured in 6 m Gdm-HCl was therefore included in the dialysis in a 1:1 molar ratio with immobilized His6-proTLN′ and tracer [3H]His6-proTLN′. Under these conditions no evidence for the conversion of [3H]His6-proTLN′ to mature enzyme was observed (Fig. 5). In addition only <0.5% of the original thermolysin activity was recovered from the dialysate, similar to that found when the same quantity of denatured mature enzyme was dialyzed in the presence of the Co2+resin alone. To determine whether prothermolysin processing can proceed through either intermolecular or intramolecular autolysis, N-terminally His-tagged wild-type and mutated proenzymes were expressed in E. coli. The presence of the His-tag allowed the proenzymes, extracted from inclusion bodies, to be attached to a solid support, thus avoiding aggregation during renaturation and giving conditions where intramolecular processing could be differentiated from intermolecular processing. The wild-type proenzyme was transformed to mature enzyme both in vivo and in vitro in the latter case after purification and therefore in the absence of other proteolytic enzymes. In addition, no processing was observed for the proenzyme containing the active site mutant, E143A, either in vivo or in vitro. These results demonstrate the autocatalytic nature of thermolysin processing and are also in favor of an intramolecular mechanism, as His6-proTLN was quantitatively transformed to mature enzyme when sequestered using only 4–6% of the theoretical resin capacity to limit the chance of intermolecular reactions. However, as it could be argued that even under these conditions only two favorably positioned molecules are required to start a chain reaction, further studies were undertaken to see whether thermolysin could process the mutated proenzyme, His6-proTLN′. No evidence for specific intermolecular processing was found when His6-proTLN and His6-proTLN′ were co-immobilized on the resin prior to renaturation by dialysis or when free [3H]His6-proTLN′ was incubated with exogenous thermolysin. In addition the prosequence of immobilized His6-proTLN′ was unable to facilitate the refolding of mature denatured thermolysin. It can therefore be concluded that prothermolysin processing can take place via an intramolecular mechanism. However, it should be pointed out that the results obtained from these mainly in vitro studies do not entirely rule out the existence of an intermolecular mechanism in vivo. This is illustrated by the data available for the serine bacterial protease, subtilisin. Whereas the results of several studies are in favor of an intramolecular mechanism for prosubtilisin folding and processing (30Ikemura H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12959-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bryan P. Wang L. Hoskins J. Ruvinov S. Stausberg S. Alexander P. Orna A. Gilliland G. Gallagher T.

Biol. 1996; 262: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), an intermolecular pathway has also been suggested with the prosequence of one molecule acting as the folding template for the mature sequence of the second (33Li Y. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M.

It has been proposed that both mechanisms might function in vivo with the intermolecular route occurring during periods of maximum synthesis (33Li Y. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,36Hu Z. Haghjoo K. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3375-3380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although some of the results obtained in this study argue against a similar bimolecular mechanism for thermolysin, i.e. the prosequence region of immobilized His6-proTLN′ did not appear to act as a template for the refolding of the mature sequence, further studies will be required to determine whether the two pathways may function for thermolysin processing in vivo. In addition, to facilitate folding, the thermolysin prosequence as an independent polypeptide is a specific noncompetitive inhibitor of the mature enzyme with a nanomolar affinity (14O'Donohue M.J. Beaumount A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26477-26481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An inhibitory role has also been found for the prosequences of other enzymes (15Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22726-22731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ohta Y.

Beaumount A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26477-26481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and subtilisin (40Kojima S. Minagawa T. Miura K.-I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) it has also been shown that inhibition is temporary as the prosequence is eventually degraded by their respective mature enzymes. Given that intramolecular folding and processing of prothermolysin have now been shown to be feasible, another role for the inhibitory properties of the prosequence can be envisaged. Thermolysin is a bilobal enzyme with the active site in a cleft between its N- and C-terminal domains, and in addition to the single catalytic zinc atom in this active site, the enzyme also binds four calcium atoms. Thermal denaturation of thermolysin is rapid and irreversible due to the local unfolding of exposed sequences, followed by autolysis (20Vriend G. Eijsink V. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 367-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Eijsink V. Veltman O.R. Aukema W. Vriend G. Venema G. Nat. Struct.

The calcium atoms, by protecting surface-exposed loops against unfolding, stabilize the enzyme, and calcium-3, which binds to the N-terminal domain, has been shown to be particularly important in this respect (20Vriend G.

In addition the N-terminal domain of thermolysin, which is predominantly formed of β-sheets, is less stable than the predominantly α-helical C-terminal domain (41Roche R. Voordouw G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Prothermolysin maturation occurs between a serine and an isoleucine residue (7O'Donohue M.J. Roques B.P. Beaumont A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), in line with the preference of the enzyme for cleaving substrates at the N-terminal side of hydrophobic residues (2Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Therefore for intramolecular processing to occur, the proenzyme must not only have a functional active site but Ile-1 of the mature sequence should also be positioned in the S1′ subsite prior to hydrolysis. However, in the crystallographic structure of the enzyme, Ile-1 is 29 Å away from the active site cleft. It therefore follows that a repositioning of the N-terminal residues of the mature enzyme occurs after processing, and it is likely that the calcium-3 binding site would not be formed until this stage. Again, parallels can be drawn with the serine protease, subtilisin, where intramolecular folding also necessitates an N-terminal rearrangement and the formation of a Ca2+-binding site after processing (31Bryan P. Wang L. Hoskins J. Ruvinov S. Stausberg S. Alexander P. Orna A. Gilliland G. Gallagher T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10310-10318Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Shinde U. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The temporary inhibition of thermolysin by its prosequence after autolytic processing could therefore help to stabilize the enzyme against irreversible autolysis before calcium-3 binding. We thank C. Dupuis for invaluable help in drafting this manuscript."

Previously, we demonstrated that hemoglobin supplemented into a chemically defined medium significantly and specifically induced fibronectin binding toC. albicans. We now report that hemoglobin also induces binding of laminin, fibrinogen, and type IV collagen but not of thrombospondin-1 or type I collagen. The binding of each protein was inhibited by the respective unlabeled ligand in a concentration-dependent manner. Fibrinogen inhibited the binding of radiolabeled fibronectin, laminin, and fibrinogen with similar IC50 values, suggesting that a single promiscuous receptor recognizes these three proteins. Competitive binding studies indicated that a second class of receptor binds specifically to laminin. Growth of C. albicans in the presence of hemoglobin also increased cell adhesion to immobilized fibronectin, laminin, fibrinogen, and type IV collagen but not to thrombospondin-1 or type I collagen. Exposure to hemoglobin induced increased orde novo expression of several surface proteins on C. albicans. One of these proteins with a molecular weight of 55,000 recognized fibronectin, based on ligand protection and affinity chromatography on immobilized fibronectin.

Some of these receptors are probably homologs of mammalian integrins (15Hostetter M.K. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, fibronectin binds to C. albicansboth through the cell binding domain recognized by mammalian integrins (8Klotz S. Smith R. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 163: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and through the collagen binding domain (6Negre E. Vogel T. Levanon A. Guy R. Walsh T.J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22039-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and laminin and fibrinogen bind to distinct classes of receptors on C. albicans that are probably not integrins (9Bouchara J. Tronchin G. Annaix V. Robert R. Senet J. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 48-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Casanova M. Lopez-Ribot J.L. Monteagudo C. Llombart-Bosch A. Sentandreu R. Martinez J.P.

Thus, both integrin and non-integrin receptors may mediate adhesion of C. albicans.Previously, we reported that hemoglobin induces a marked enhancement of fibronectin binding activity in C. albicans (17Yan S. Negre E. Cashel J.A. Guo N. Lyman C.A. Walsh T.J. Roberts D.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2930-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This induction is reversible, requires cell growth in the presence of hemoglobin, and is not due to a bridge effect of hemoglobin between a receptor on the organism and fibronectin. In addition, adhesion of C. albicans to corneal endothelial cells was significantly increased when grown in hemoglobin-containing defined medium compared with those grown in defined medium alone. Although the ability to acquire iron has long been considered one of the most important adaptive responses for microbial pathogenesis (18Esterly N. Brammer S. Crounse R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1967; 49: 437-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Weinberg E. Microbiol. Rev. 1978; 42: 45-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the enhancement of fibronectin binding by hemoglobin was not simply due to iron acquisition from the hemoglobin, because other ferroproteins, ferrous ions, or iron-containing porphyrins were inactive (17Yan S. Negre E. Cashel J.A. Guo N. Lyman C.A. Walsh T.J. Roberts D.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2930-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, hemoglobin itself may act as a potent regulator for the fibronectin receptor in C. albicans, although its precise mechanism remains unclear.We have now examined whether this specific induction by hemoglobin influences binding of C. albicans to other ECM proteins. We demonstrate that binding of C. albicans to laminin, fibrinogen, and type IV collagen, are increased to various degrees, but binding to thrombospondin-1 and type I collagen are not. In addition to inducing specific receptors for some ECM ligands on C. albicans, growth in the presence of hemoglobin induces a promiscuous receptor for several ECM proteins including fibronectin (FN), fibrinogen, and laminin. Adhesion to these proteins is also coordinately increased, and expression of specific cell surface proteins that bind FN is increased. Among these, a 55-kDa protein was identified as a hemoglobin-induced fibronectin receptor. Based on these findings, hemoglobin seems to be a potent regulator of the adhesive phenotype of C. albicans.DISCUSSIONBoth solution phase cell binding assays and adhesion to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins demonstrate that growth of C. albicans in a defined medium containing hemoglobin coordinately up-regulates interactions with laminin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and type IV collagen. This up-regulation is specific in that interactions with at least two other extracellular matrix proteins, type I collagen and thrombospondin-1 are unaffected. Both binding to the proteins in solution and adhesion to the immobilized proteins are increased by growth in the presence of hemoglobin. A larger increase was observed in binding to the soluble proteins than in adhesion to immobilized proteins. This was noted previously using fibronectin (17Yan S. Negre E. Cashel J.A. Guo N. Lyman C.A. Walsh T.J. Roberts D.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2930-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and probably reflects a greater sensibility of soluble ligand binding assays to changes in receptor number compared with the multivalent avidity measured in adhesion assays. Growth in the presence of hemoglobin induced increased expression of several proteins on the surface of C. albicans. FN binding to C. albicansprotected amino groups on a 55-kDa protein from chemical modification, identifying this surface protein as a candidate for the hemoglobin-induced ECM receptor. A 55-kDa protein was also identified as a potential FN receptor by purification using affinity chromatography on immobilized FN.To address whether a single promiscuous receptor or a family of receptors with varying specificities are responsible for the enhancement of ECM protein binding by hemoglobin, we performed quantitative analysis of heterologous displacement experiments. By comparing the Ki values for a single protein to inhibit binding of the three labeled proteins, fibronectin, laminin, and fibrinogen, we demonstrated that fibronectin and fibrinogen bind to a common class of sites that overlap only partially with those sites recognizing laminin. Therefore, growth in the presence of hemoglobin induces expression on C. albicans of a class of promiscuous receptors that bind fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and type IV collagen and specific receptors for some ECM proteins, such as laminin. Binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen to the promiscuous site produces a linear Scatchard plot, indicating that a homogeneous class of receptors accounts for binding of each of these ligands. Because some of these ECM proteins bind to each other, we could not examine heterologous displacement between all pairs of proteins. Using fibrinogen as a tracer for binding to the promiscuous receptor, however, we can show that native type I collagen does not bind to this receptor. Although C. albicans apparently has receptors that mediate adhesion to type I collagen and thrombospondin-1, these receptors are probably distinct from the promiscuous receptor because their binding and ability to promote adhesion are not affected by growth with hemoglobin.Studies in other organisms provide precedent for both specific and shared promiscuous receptors for ECM proteins. Promiscuous integrins have been identified in mammalian cells. The best defined of these are the platelet integrin IIbIIIa (αIIb/β3), which binds to fibrinogen, thrombospondin, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor (25Yamada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the leukocyte β2 integrin CR3 (CD11b/CD18, reviewed in Ref. 26Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells also express several families of scavenger receptors that bind multiple ligands (27Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Among these, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and CD36 have been demonstrated to bind to several ECM proteins (28Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Asch A.S. Barnwell J. Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. J. Clin.

Microbial interactions with multiple ECM proteins are also frequently observed.Staphylococcus aureus interacts with fibronectin, laminin, collagens, thrombospondin-1, and elastin (31Park P. Roberts D. Grosso L. Park W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W. Mecham R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23399-23406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reviewed in (32Roberts D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 3: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Patti J.M. Hook M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Some of these interactions are mediated by distinct receptors, but aS. aureus protein that binds several ECM proteins has also been reported (34McGavin M. Krajewska-Pictrasik D. Ryden C. Hook M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2479-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blood stages of the protozoan pathogen responsible for malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, recognize the host proteins thrombospondin-1, CD36, VCAM1, E-selectin, and ICAM1 via a family of related cell surface receptors (35Borst P. Bitter W. McCulloch R. Van Leeuwen F. Rudenko G. Cell. 1995; 82: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The promiscuous receptor on C. albicans resembles a mammalian cell scavenger receptor (27Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar) in that the proteins bound are apparently unrelated in sequence, but only a subset of proteins are recognized by the receptor.Previous studies of extracellular matrix interactions with C. albicans have identified candidate receptors for fibronectin (5Klotz S.A. Hein R.C. Smith R.L. Rouse J.B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4679-4681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Klotz S. Smith R. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 163: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), laminin (16Lopez-Ribot J. Casanova M. Monteagudo C. Sepulveda P. Martinez J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 742-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fibrinogen (36Lopez-Ribot J. Martinez J. Chaffin W. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and entactin (37Lopez-Ribot J.L. Chaffin W.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4564-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an analog of mammalian integrin β subunits that may mediate adhesion to epithelial cells (reviewed in Ref. 15Hostetter M.K. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Limited evidence has been obtained for partial competition between laminin, fibronectin, and entactin for binding to cell wall extracts of C. albicans (37Lopez-Ribot J.L. Chaffin W.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4564-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no competition was observed between fibrinogen and the complement receptor (36Lopez-Ribot J. Martinez J. Chaffin W. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin inhibited binding of C. albicans to several ECM proteins, including fibronectin, laminin, and types I and IV collagen. This inhibition does not reflect binding of the glycosaminoglycans to a C. albicans binding site shared with these proteins but probably resulted from sequestration of ligands after binding of heparin to the proteins (38Klotz S.A. Smith R.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 78: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Up-regulated expression of potential receptors for selected ECM proteins was observed at the functional level by increased binding activity and adhesion to the immobilized proteins as well as at the protein level as increased expression of several surface proteins onC. albicans, including a 55-kDa protein. Binding of FN to the cells differentially protected the protein from chemical modification (Fig. 7), suggesting that it may directly mediate hemoglobin-induced interactions with fibronectin. The same 55-kDa protein was also identified as a major protein bound to a FN affinity column and eluted with acetic acid. Proteins of 68–72 kDa were identified previously as putative receptors for laminin, fibrinogen, and C3d (9Bouchara J. Tronchin G. Annaix V. Robert R. Senet J. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 48-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are reviewed in (3Calderone R. Braun P. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins with molecular masses of 60 and 105 kDa were identified as potential FN receptors in uninducedC. albicans by affinity chromatography on immobilized FN (5Klotz S.A. Hein R.C. Smith R.L. Rouse J.B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4679-4681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Klotz S.A. Rutten M.J. Smith R.L. Babcock S.R. Cunningham M.D. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 14: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because lyticase was used to release the surface proteins, protease contamination in the lyticase could result in some degradation of the receptor. Thus, the native molecular mass of the receptor identified here may be larger than 55 kDa.The finding that hemoglobin is a potent regulator of the binding of C. albicans to several ECM proteins may contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of systemic candidasis. Hemoglobin is an abundant circulating protein in the body, and it is often present in sites of tissue injury. C. albicans may readily encounter hemoglobin at sites of tissue injury, which may in turn change its binding to ECM proteins in the tissue. Furthermore, virulent strains of C. albicans express a hemolytic activity that could release hemoglobin from erythrocytes exposed to C. albicans (39Manns J. Mosser D. Buckley H. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5154-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, hyphal cells of C. albicans were reported to bind to human hemoglobin, suggesting that this organism expresses hemoglobin receptors (40Watanabe T. Tanaka H. Nakao N. Mikami T. Matsumoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Induction of ECM binding to C. albicans by hemoglobin would facilitate colonization of this organism after it enters the vascular compartment. Therefore, defining of the mechanism by which hemoglobin regulates adherence in this pathogen could identify new targets to prevent or treat C. albicans infections. Candida albicans is an important opportunistic pathogen for humans, causing both superficial and disseminated infections (reviewed in Refs. 1Odds F.C. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1994; 31: S2-S5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar and 2Odds F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22039-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and laminin and fibrinogen bind to distinct classes of receptors on C. albicans that are probably not integrins (9Bouchara J. Tronchin G. Annaix V. Robert R. Senet J. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 48-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Casanova M. Lopez-Ribot J.L. Monteagudo C. Llombart-Bosch A. Sentandreu R. Martinez J.P. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lopez-Ribot J. Casanova M. Monteagudo C. Sepulveda P. Martinez J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 742-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both integrin and non-integrin receptors may mediate adhesion of C. albicans. Previously, we reported that hemoglobin induces a marked enhancement of fibronectin binding activity in C. albicans (17Yan S. Negre E. Cashel J.A. Guo N. Lyman C.A. Walsh T.J. Roberts D.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2930-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This induction is reversible, requires cell growth in the presence of hemoglobin, and is not due to a bridge effect of hemoglobin between a receptor on the organism and fibronectin. In addition, adhesion of C. albicans to corneal endothelial cells was significantly increased when grown in hemoglobin-containing defined medium compared with those grown in defined medium alone. Although the ability to acquire iron has long been considered one of the most important adaptive responses for microbial pathogenesis (18Esterly N. Brammer S. Crounse R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1967; 49: 437-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Weinberg E. Microbiol. Rev. 1978; 42: 45-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the enhancement of fibronectin binding by hemoglobin was not simply due to iron acquisition from the hemoglobin, because other ferroproteins, ferrous ions, or iron-containing porphyrins were inactive (17Yan S. Negre E. Cashel J.A. Guo N. Lyman C.A. Walsh T.J. Roberts D.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2930-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, hemoglobin itself may act as a potent regulator for the fibronectin receptor in C. albicans, although its precise mechanism remains unclear. We have now examined whether this specific induction by hemoglobin influences binding of C. albicans to other ECM proteins. We demonstrate that binding of C. albicans to laminin, fibrinogen, and type IV collagen, are increased to various degrees, but binding to thrombospondin-1 and type I collagen are not. In addition to inducing specific receptors for some ECM ligands on C. albicans, growth in the presence of hemoglobin induces a promiscuous receptor for several ECM proteins including fibronectin (FN), fibrinogen, and laminin. Adhesion to these proteins is also coordinately increased, and expression of specific cell surface proteins that bind FN is increased. Among these, a 55-kDa protein was identified as a hemoglobin-induced fibronectin receptor. Based on these findings, hemoglobin seems to be a potent regulator of the adhesive phenotype of C. albicans. DISCUSSIONBoth solution phase cell binding assays and adhesion to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins demonstrate that growth of C. albicans in a defined medium containing hemoglobin coordinately up-regulates interactions with laminin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and type IV collagen. This up-regulation is specific in that interactions with at least two other extracellular matrix proteins, type I collagen and thrombospondin-1 are unaffected. Both binding to the proteins in solution and adhesion to the immobilized proteins are increased by growth in the presence of hemoglobin. A larger increase was observed in binding to the soluble proteins than in adhesion to immobilized proteins. This was noted previously using fibronectin (17Yan S. Negre E. Cashel J.A. Guo N. Lyman C.A. Walsh T.J. Roberts D.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2930-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and probably reflects a greater sensibility of soluble ligand binding assays to changes in receptor number compared with the multivalent avidity measured in adhesion assays. Growth in the presence of hemoglobin induced increased expression of several proteins on the surface of C. albicans. FN binding to C. albicansprotected amino groups on a 55-kDa protein from chemical modification, identifying this surface protein as a candidate for the hemoglobin-induced ECM receptor. A 55-kDa protein was also identified as a potential FN receptor by purification using affinity chromatography on immobilized FN.To address whether a single promiscuous receptor or a family of receptors with varying specificities are responsible for the enhancement of ECM protein binding by hemoglobin, we performed quantitative analysis of heterologous displacement experiments. By comparing the Ki values for a single protein to inhibit binding of the three labeled proteins, fibronectin, laminin, and fibrinogen, we demonstrated that fibronectin and fibrinogen bind to a common class of sites that overlap only partially with those sites recognizing laminin. Therefore, growth in the presence of hemoglobin induces expression on C. albicans of a class of promiscuous receptors that bind fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and type IV collagen and specific receptors for some ECM proteins, such as laminin. Binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen to the promiscuous site produces a linear Scatchard plot, indicating that a homogeneous class of receptors accounts for binding of each of these ligands. Because some of these ECM proteins bind to each other, we could not examine heterologous displacement between all pairs of proteins. Using fibrinogen as a tracer for binding to the promiscuous receptor, however, we can show that native type I collagen does not bind to this receptor. Although C. albicans apparently has receptors that mediate adhesion to type I collagen and thrombospondin-1, these receptors are probably distinct from the promiscuous receptor because their binding and ability to promote adhesion are not affected by growth with hemoglobin.Studies in other organisms provide precedent for both specific and shared promiscuous receptors for ECM proteins. Promiscuous integrins have been identified in mammalian cells. The best defined of these are the platelet integrin IIbIIIa (αIIb/β3), which binds to fibrinogen, thrombospondin, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor (25Yamada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the leukocyte β2 integrin CR3 (CD11b/CD18, reviewed in Ref. 26Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells also express several families of scavenger receptors that bind multiple ligands (27Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Among these, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and CD36 have been demonstrated to bind to several ECM proteins (28Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Asch A.S. Barnwell J. Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. J. Clin.

Microbial interactions with multiple ECM proteins are also frequently observed.Staphylococcus aureus interacts with fibronectin, laminin, collagens, thrombospondin-1, and elastin (31Park P. Roberts D. Grosso L. Park W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W. Mecham R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23399-23406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reviewed in (32Roberts D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Some of these interactions are mediated by distinct receptors, but aS. aureus protein that binds several ECM proteins has also been reported (34McGavin M. Krajewska-Pictrasik D. Ryden C. Hook M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2479-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blood stages of the protozoan pathogen responsible for malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, recognize the host proteins thrombospondin-1, CD36, VCAM1, E-selectin, and ICAM1 via a family of related cell surface receptors (35Borst P. Bitter W. McCulloch R. Van Leeuwen F. Rudenko G. Cell. 1995; 82: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The promiscuous receptor on C. albicans resembles a mammalian cell scavenger receptor (27Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar) in that the proteins bound are apparently unrelated in sequence, but only a subset of proteins are recognized by the receptor.Previous studies of extracellular matrix interactions with C. albicans have identified candidate receptors for fibronectin (5Klotz S.A. Hein R.C. Smith R.L. Rouse J.B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4679-4681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Klotz S. Smith R. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 163: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), laminin (16Lopez-Ribot J. Casanova M. Monteagudo C. Sepulveda P. Martinez J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 742-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fibrinogen (36Lopez-Ribot J. Martinez J. Chaffin W. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and entactin (37Lopez-Ribot J.L. Chaffin W.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4564-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an analog of mammalian integrin β subunits that may mediate adhesion to epithelial cells (reviewed in Ref. 15Hostetter M.K. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Limited evidence has been obtained for partial competition between laminin, fibronectin, and entactin for binding to cell wall extracts of C. albicans (37Lopez-Ribot J.L. Chaffin W.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4564-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no competition was observed between fibrinogen and the complement receptor (36Lopez-Ribot J. Martinez J. Chaffin W. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin inhibited binding of C. albicans to several ECM proteins, including fibronectin, laminin, and types I and IV collagen. This inhibition does not reflect binding of the glycosaminoglycans to a C. albicans binding site shared with these proteins but probably resulted from sequestration of ligands after binding of heparin to the proteins (38Klotz S.A. Smith R.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 78: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Up-regulated expression of potential receptors for selected ECM proteins was observed at the functional level by increased binding activity and adhesion to the immobilized proteins as well as at the protein level as increased expression of several surface proteins onC. albicans, including a 55-kDa protein. Binding of FN to the cells differentially protected the protein from chemical modification (Fig. 7), suggesting that it may directly mediate hemoglobin-induced interactions with fibronectin. The same 55-kDa protein was also identified as a major protein bound to a FN affinity column and eluted with acetic acid. Proteins of 68–72 kDa were identified previously as putative receptors for laminin, fibrinogen, and C3d (9Bouchara J. Tronchin G. Annaix V. Robert R. Senet J. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 48-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are reviewed in (3Calderone R. Braun P. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins with molecular masses of 60 and 105 kDa were identified as potential FN receptors in uninducedC. albicans by affinity chromatography on immobilized FN (5Klotz S.A. Hein R.C. Smith R.L. Rouse J.B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4679-4681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Klotz S.A. Rutten M.J. Smith R.L. Babcock S.R. Cunningham M.D. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 14: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because lyticase was used to release the surface proteins, protease contamination in the lyticase could result in some degradation of the receptor. Thus, the native molecular mass of the receptor identified here may be larger than 55 kDa.The finding that hemoglobin is a potent regulator of the binding of C. albicans to several ECM proteins may contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of systemic candidasis. Hemoglobin is an abundant circulating protein in the body, and it is often present in sites of tissue injury. C. albicans may readily encounter hemoglobin at sites of tissue injury, which may in turn change its binding to ECM proteins in the tissue. Furthermore, virulent strains of C. albicans express a hemolytic activity that could release hemoglobin from erythrocytes exposed to C. albicans (39Manns J. Mosser D. Buckley H. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5154-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, hyphal cells of C. albicans were reported to bind to human hemoglobin, suggesting that this organism expresses hemoglobin receptors (40Watanabe T. Tanaka H. Nakao N. Mikami T. Matsumoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Induction of ECM binding to C. albicans by hemoglobin would facilitate colonization of this organism after it enters the vascular compartment. Therefore, defining of the mechanism by which hemoglobin regulates adherence in this pathogen could identify new targets to prevent or treat C. albicans infections. Both solution phase cell binding assays and adhesion to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins demonstrate that growth of C. albicans in a defined medium containing hemoglobin coordinately up-regulates interactions with laminin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and type IV collagen.

Wyers F. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol.

A subunit related to RPB7 has been identified in both human and Arabidopsis RNA polymerase II (6Khazak V. Sadhale P.P. Woychik N.A. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 759-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Ulmasov T. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23165-23169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but a subunit related to RPB4 has not been reported for human, plant, or fission yeast enzymes (2Woychik N.A. Young R.A.

Furthermore, in purified human, plant, and fission yeast RNA polymerase II enzymes, there is no subunit like yeast RPB4 that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa (9Sakurai H. Miyao T.

Here we report on the sequence of an Arabidopsis cDNA, AtRPB15.9, which encodes a protein related to yeast RPB4. Antibodies raised against the AtRPB15.9 recombinant protein were used to confirm the existence of this subunit in a variety of purified plant RNA polymerase II enzymes. DEAE-Sephadex chromatography was used to determine if the plant subunit dissociates from RNA polymerase II under mildly denaturing conditions. A renaturation protocol with recombinant yeast RPB4 and RPB7 subunits and related subunits from Arabidopsis was used to determine if these subunits formed stable complexes in vitro. An EST clone from an oilseed rape (Brassica napus) cDNA library (GenBankTM accession number H07557) was identified that encoded a protein related to yeast RPB4 and a human EST clone (GenBankTM accession number W87848). The B. napus EST clone was provided by Dr. Tae-Ju Cho (Department of Biochemistry, Chung-Buk National University, Cheong-Ju, South Korea) and was used to screen 220,000 plaque-forming units of anArabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) suspension culture cell cDNA library in λZAP II (19Regard F. Bardet C. Tremousaygue D. Moisan A. Lescure B. Alexos M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using standard techniques (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar,21Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). The cDNA library was provide by Dr. Michele Alexos. 3Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire des Relations Plantes-Microorganisms, Center INRA d'Auzeville, F-31326 Castanet-Tolosan, France. Twenty-three positive clones were identified and purified. Most of the clones were approximately the same size, and two of these were sequenced. The two clones contained complete ORFs with identical sequences, except that the two clones had 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of different lengths, and one clone contained an unprocessed intron. The cDNA clone lacking the intron is referred to as AtRPB15.9. A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) genomic DNA was isolated, digested with restriction enzymes, subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose, and blotted onto a HybondTM-N+membrane (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) using standard techniques (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar,22Dellaporta S.L. Woods J. Hicks J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1983; 1: 19-21Crossref Scopus (6378) Google Scholar). The AtRPB15.9 cDNA was labeled with 32P using the Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The labeled probe was hybridized to the Southern blot in 6 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 1% nonfat dry milk, 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml herring testes DNA at 68 °C. After hybridization, membranes were washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl + 0.015m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 25 °C, 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 25 °C, and 0.2× SSC and 1.0% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C. Northern blotting was carried out with 2 μg of poly(A)+RNA isolated from A. thaliana suspension culture cells (23Doelling J.H. Pikaard C.S. Plant Cell Rep. 1993; 12: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using a standard protocol (21Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from total RNA using the Poly(A)TtractTM mRNA isolation system I (Promega Corp.). Poly(A)+ RNA was denatured with glyoxal and Me2SO, subjected to electrophoresis in a 2.5% agarose gel (composed of a 2:1 blend of NuSieve GTG-agarose (FMC, Rockland ME) to DNA grade agarose (Fisher Biotech, Fair Lawn NJ)), and blotted onto a HybondTM-N+ membrane using standard protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization with a 32P-labeled AtRPB15.9 cDNA probe was carried out as described for Southern blot hybridization. The ORF and 3′-untranslated region from the B. napus EST cDNA clone (discussed above) was amplified by PCR. This cDNA is referred to as BnRPB15.9, and the ORF encoded a protein of 139 amino acids that showed 97% identity to AtRPB15.9. For PCR, an oligonucleotide that incorporated a NdeI site at the translational start codon, an oligonucleotide that hybridized to the vector, and PwoDNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR product was inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-16b (Novagen, Madison WI) and was used to transform Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison WI). His-tagged BnRPB15.9 was expressed in E. coli as described by Studier and Moffatt (24Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar) and was purified on Ni2+-NTA agarose columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified His-tagged BnRPB15.9 subunit was dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline (21Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar), and the dialysate was subcutaneously injected into rabbits (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Serum was collected after the second and third boosts. IgGs containing BnRPB15.9 antibodies were purified on Affi-Gel protein A columns (Bio-Rad) and further purified by affinity chromatography on His-tagged BnRPB15.9 affinity columns (His-tagged BnRPB15.9 linked to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad)) as recommended by Harlow and Lane (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, purified RNA polymerase II enzymes were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar), and subunits were visualized by silver staining (27Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford MA) by electroblotting. Protein blots were probed with affinity-purified anti-His-tagged BnRPB15.9 antibodies, followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham) and a chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). Dot blots (1 μl) on 1-cm2 pieces of BA-S nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) were made with step fractions (80, 140, and 300 mm (NH4)2SO4) from 2-ml DEAE-Sephadex columns. The samples chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex included purified wheat germ and ArabidopsisRNA polymerase II, reconstituted recombinant ArabidopsisRPB4/RPB7, and reconstituted and Ni2+-NTA-purifiedArabidopsis His-tagged RPB4/RPB7. Samples were treated for 3 h in a buffer containing 2 m urea before chromatography and chromatographed by step elution in a buffer containing 2 m urea (12Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peak fractions from the 80, 140, and 300 mm (NH4)2SO4steps were dialyzed to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm(NH4)2SO4, and 10% glycerol and dot-blotted. Dot blots were incubated with affinity-purified antibodies raised against Ni2+-NTA-purified recombinant His-tagged BnRPB15.9 (RPB4) or cauliflower RPB19.5 (RPB7) (13Ulmasov T. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23165-23169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and antibody binding to subunits was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) as recommended by the supplier. RNA polymerase II enzymes were purified as described previously (8Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5085-5094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Guilfoyle T.J. Hagen G. Malcolm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 640-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Jendrisak J.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4639-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Purified wheat germ RNA polymerase II (1.5 mg) in 3 ml of storage buffer (28Jendrisak J.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4639-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of mildly denaturing buffer containing 1.2 m urea at 4 °C (11Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6450-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dialyzed enzyme was chromatographed on a 12× 0.8-cm column of DEAE-Sephadex A25 with a 40-ml linear gradient of 80–350 mm ammonium sulfate in buffer containing 1.2 m urea (11Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6450-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatographic fractions (0.7 ml) were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol, assayed for RNA polymerase activity (18Guilfoyle T.J. Hagen G. Malcolm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 640-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and analyzed in SDS-PAGE (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). ORFs encoding Arabidopsis AtRPB15.9 and AtRPB19.5 and yeast RPB4 (ScB32) and RPB7 (ScB16) were amplified from Arabidopsis cDNA clones or yeast genomic DNA using Pwo DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR products were ligated into pET-16b (Novagen, Madison WI) between NdeI and BamHI sites for plasmids that encode His-tagged subunits or between NcoI and BamHI for plasmids that encode untagged subunits. All recombinant RNA polymerase subunits accumulated as insoluble products in E. coli. Recombinant subunits were renatured, and subunit interactions were analyzed on Ni2+-NTA agarose columns as described by Larkin and Guilfoyle (29Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12824-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with the exception that untagged subunits were added at 2-fold molar excess to His-tagged subunits. Renatured AtRPB15.9 and AtRPB19.5 complexes were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography using a 120-ml HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol (29Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12824-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The column was run at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and 2.4-ml fractions were collected and analyzed in 10% gels (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). Molecular masses of subunits were calculated as recommended by Stellwagen (30Stellwagen E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A search of the EST data base revealed B. napus (oilseed rape; GenBankTM accession number H07557) and Brassica rapa (Chinese cabbage; GenBankTM accession numberL38192), EST clones that encoded proteins related to the yeast RPB4 or ScB32 RNA polymerase II subunit (31Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The B. napus EST clone was used as a probe to isolate cDNA clones from an A. thaliana suspension culture cell cDNA library (19Regard F. Bardet C. Tremousaygue D. Moisan A. Lescure B. Alexos M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). AnArabidopsis cDNA clone (AtRPB15.9) was sequenced that contained an ORF encoding a protein of 15.9 kDa with a pI of 4.9. The amino acid sequences encoded by the B. napus EST cDNA clone and the Arabidopsis cDNA were 97% identical (data not shown). ESTs were also identified for human cDNA clones (GenBankTM accession numbers U85510 and U89387) related to yeast RPB4. The AtRPB15.9 protein is 18.8 and 37.0% identical to yeast RPB4 (ScB32) and human RPB4, respectively (Fig. 1). In contrast to the Arabidopsis and human proteins, yeast RPB4 contains a highly charged insertion of 70 amino acids within the middle of the protein. This insertion results in a yeast RPB4 subunit that contains 221 amino acids with a molecular mass of 25.4 kDa (31Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas the Arabidopsis protein contains 139 amino acids with a molecular mass of 15.9 kDa, and the human protein contains 142 amino acids with a molecular mass of 16.3 kDa. On Southern blots, the AtRPB15.9 cDNA probe hybridized to single bands of A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) genomic DNA that was digested with a variety of restriction endonucleases (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that the AtRPB15.9 protein is encoded by a single copy gene in Arabidopsis. On Northern blots with poly(A)+ RNA prepared from Arabidopsis suspension culture cells, the AtRPB15.9 cDNA probe hybridized to a mRNA of about 800 bases (Fig. 2 B). The size of this mRNA is appropriate for encoding a protein of 15.9 kDa and is in agreement with size estimates of cDNA inserts in cDNA clones encoding AtRPB15.9. To determine if the AtRPB15.9 protein is found in Arabidopsis and other plant RNA polymerase II enzymes, polyclonal antibodies were raised against the B. napusrecombinant protein (BnRPB15.9), and affinity-purified antibodies were used to probe blots of purified RNA polymerase II from a variety of plants. Fig. 3 B (lanes 2–7) shows that affinity purified anti-BnRPB15.9 antibodies bind to a subunit of about 14–15 kDa in Arabidopsis, cauliflower, soybean, pea, tobacco, and wheat RNA polymerase II, which represents the seventh or eighth largest subunit in each enzyme. No subunit in purified plant RNA polymerase I or III reacted with the anti-BnRPB15.9 antibody (data not shown). In wheat RNA polymerase II (Fig. 3 A, lane 7), the subunits were more clearly resolved and/or efficiently stained with silver, and the eighth largest subunit in this enzyme bound to the BnRPB15.9 antibodies. The apparent molecular mass of this plant subunit (i.e. 14–15 kDa) in the gel system used here (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar) is slightly smaller than that observed with the Laemmli gel system (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar), where this subunit migrates as the eighth largest subunit with an apparent molecular mass of 17.0 kDa (15Jendrisak J.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,18Guilfoyle T.J. Hagen G. Malcolm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 640-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant AtRPB15.9 protein migrated with a apparent molecular mass of 15.3 kDa in this SDS-PAGE system (Fig. 3, lane 1). With similar amounts of RNA polymerases applied to the SDS gel, the antibody binding signal was approximately equal for each RNA polymerase II analyzed. The signal with the more distantly related monocotyledon wheat, however, was less than that observed with dicotyledon RNA polymerase II enzymes (i.e. Arabidopsis, cauliflower, soybean, pea, and tobacco). Results with purified plant RNA polymerase II indicate the RPB4-related subunit has a mobility about half the size of yeast RPB4 (i.e. 14–17 kDa in plants, depending on the gel system, and 32 kDa in yeast). RPB4 (ScB32) and RPB7 (ScB16) dissociate from yeast RNA polymerase II that has been incubated in 1.2 m urea (11Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6450-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the RPB4-like subunit dissociates from wheat RNA polymerase II under mildly denaturing conditions, purified wheat RNA polymerase II was treated with 1.2m urea and chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex using a linear salt gradient containing 1.2 m urea as described by Ruetet al. (11Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6450-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromatographic fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and protein blotting with an anti-BnRPB15.9 antibody. Fig. 4 shows that little if any wheat RPB17 subunit (the RPB4-like subunit) dissociates from the enzyme under these conditions as determined by Coomassie Blue staining of subunits (Fig. 4 A) and immunoblotting (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, there is no apparent dissociation of the wheat RPB21 subunit (i.e. the wheat subunit related to yeast RPB7) (13Ulmasov T. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23165-23169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as determined by Coomassie Blue staining under these mildly denaturing conditions. This contrasts with yeast RPB4 and RPB7, which appear to dissociate as a complex from the enzyme under mildly denaturing conditions and are resolved from an RNA polymerase II core on DEAE resins (11Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6450-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant reconstituted ArabidopsisRPB15.9/RPB19.5 complexes were subjected to the same chromatographic procedure on DEAE-Sephadex. The reconstituted subunits failed to bind to the DEAE-Sephadex column under these conditions and were recovered in the breakthrough fractions (80 mm(NH4)2SO4) (data not shown). These results suggest that plant RPB4 and RPB7 subunits are more stably associated with the RNA polymerase II enzyme compared with yeast RPB4 and RPB7. To further test the stable association of plant RPB4 and RPB7 subunits with the enzyme, wheat and Arabidopsis RNA polymerase II were pretreated with 2 m urea for 3 h and chromatographed on DEAE Sephadex columns in the presence of 2m urea (12Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstituted recombinantArabidopsis RPB15.9/RPB19.5, reconstituted recombinant and Ni2+-NTA purified Arabidopsis His-tagged RPB15.9/RPB19.5, and purified wheat germ and Arabidopsis RNA polymerase II were each pretreated with 2 m urea and chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex. Samples were applied at 80 mm (NH4)2SO4 and step-eluted at 140 mm and 300 mm(NH4)2SO4 in buffer containing 2m urea (12Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SDS gel in Fig. 5 A shows that the bulk of the Arabidopsis reconstituted recombinant RPB4/RPB7 subunits failed to bind to DEAE-Sephadex and eluted in the 80 mm(NH4)2SO4 breakthrough fractions. In contrast, no RPB4 or RPB7 subunit was detected in the breakthrough fractions with wheat or Arabidopsis RNA polymerase II, and the bulk of the enzyme eluted at 300 mm(NH4)2SO4. To confirm that RPB4 and RPB7 subunits were stably associated with wheat and Arabidopsis RNA polymerase II enzymes that were treated with 2 m urea, dot blots of the peak fractions from the 80, 140, and 300 mm (NH4)2SO4steps were tested with affinity-purified antibodies raised against BnRPB15.9 (anti-RPB4) and cauliflower 19.5 (anti-RPB7). Results in Fig. 5 B confirm that RPB4 and RPB7 subunits in the plant enzymes did not dissociate from the enzymes pretreated with 2 murea and subjected to chromatography on DEAE Sephadex in the presence of 2 m urea. Results from two additional experiments (data not shown) support the above experiments on the stable association of RPB4/RPB7 subunit in wheat RNA polymerase II. First the wheat enzyme was pretreated with 2m urea and applied to a phosphocellulose column in buffer (the same buffer that was used for DEAE-Sephadex chromatography) containing 75 mm(NH4)2SO4 and 2 m urea. The column was washed with that application buffer, and RNA polymerase was step-eluted in buffer containing 150 mm(NH4)2SO4 and 2 m urea. SDS gel electrophoresis and dot-blotting with anti BnRPB15.9 and anti-cauliflower RPB19.5 antibodies showed that the plant RPB4 and RPB7 subunits eluted exclusively with RNA polymerase at 150 mm(NH4)2SO4. Under the same conditions, Arabidopsis reconstituted recombinant RPB4/RPB7 subunits failed to bind to the phosphocellulose column, and these subunits were recovered in the breakthrough fractions. Second, wheat RNA polymerase II, which was step-eluted from the phosphocellulose column, was reacted with affinity-purified BnRPB15.9 antibodies in 2m urea. SDS gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitate (recovered on a protein A resin) revealed that all subunits were present and that there was no preferential immunoprecipitation of RPB4/RPB7 subunits. Yeast RPB4 and RPB7 are thought to interact with one another and to dissociate and associate with RNA polymerase II as a heterodimer (10Dezelee S. Wyers F. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6450-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if yeast RPB4 and RPB7 and Arabidopsis AtB15.9 and AtB19.5 subunits formed stable heterodimers in vitro, recombinant subunits were expressed in E. coli, recovered as insoluble proteins, and renatured as described by Tang et al. (33Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and Larkin and Guilfoyle (29Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J.

https://openalex.org/W2007829930,"Two primary cleavage sites have been identified within the interglobular domain of the cartilage aggrecan core protein: one is between amino acid residues Asn341 and Phe342, where many matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have been shown to cleave; and the other is between amino acid residues Glu373 and Ala374. Although cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 site is believed to play a critical role in cartilage aggrecan degradation in arthritic diseases, the enzyme responsible for cleavage at this site, “aggrecanase,” has not been identified. Members of the ADAM (adisintegrin andmetalloproteinase) family of proteins, which shows structural homology to the snake venom hemorrhagic metalloproteinases (reprolysins), have recently been demonstrated to be expressed in articular chondrocytes. Because many ADAM family members have a putative proteinase function, this raises the possibility that aggrecanase may be a member of this family of proteases. To examine whether reprolysins have the ability to cleave aggrecan at either the aggrecanase site or the MMP site, the snake venom hemorrhagic toxin metalloproteinase HT-d (atrolysin C) was tested for its ability to cleave bovine aggrecan monomer. Cleavage was monitored using the BC-3 antibody, which recognizes aggrecan fragments with the new NH2 terminus ARGSV generated by cleavage at the aggrecanase site, and with the AF-28 antibody, which recognizes aggrecan fragments with the new NH2 terminus FFGVG generated by cleavage at the MMP site. Cleavage at both the aggrecanase and MMP sites occurred in a concentration-dependent manner with 100 nmatrolysin C or greater. AF-28-reactive fragments were generated by 30 min of incubation, and levels were maximal by 8 h; BC-3-reactive fragments were detected at 2 h and continued to increase through 48 h, thus suggesting that atrolysin C can cleave at the MMP and aggrecanase sites. NH2-terminal aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at the aggrecanase site were also detected using antisera recognizing the new COOH terminus, NITEGE, formed by cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 bond, indicating that cleavage at this site does not require prior cleavage at the MMP site. These data provide the first demonstration that a reprolysin can cleave the core protein of aggrecan and the first example of a specific protease that can cleave at the aggrecanase site independent of cleavage at the MMP cleavage site.

Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan of cartilage and provides this tissue with its mechanical properties of compressibility and elasticity. Aggrecan monomers interact with hyaluronic acid (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronic acid; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; bHA, biotinylated hyaluronic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronic acid; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; bHA, biotinylated hyaluronic acid. and are usually found as part of a large aggregate containing 10–100 monomers/HA molecule. The primary role of aggrecan is to swell and hydrate the framework of cartilage collagen fibrils thus providing cartilage with its properties of compressibility and elasticity. The NH2 terminus of the aggrecan monomer core protein is comprised of two globular domains called G1 and G2 which are separated by an interglobular domain that spans about 150 residues in length. The G2 region is followed by a long central glycosaminoglycan attachment region and a COOH-terminal globular domain, G3 (1Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. Dudhia J. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R.

Proteolytic cleavage within the interglobular domain is believed to be responsible for the loss of aggrecan from cartilage. However, the enzyme responsible for aggrecan cleavage in these diseases has yet to be identified.Two major sites of proteolytic cleavage have been identified within the interglobular domain, one between amino acids Asn341 and Phe342 and the other between Glu373 and Ala374. Many matrix metalloproteinases, including MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, and -13, have been shown to cleave aggrecan at the Asn341-Phe342 site, but to date attempts to generate cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 site with a number of MMPs and other purified proteases have been relatively unsuccessful (3Flannery C.R.

Thus, cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 site has been attributed to an as yet unidentified enzyme given the name “aggrecanase” because of its ability the cleave the aggrecan core molecule.A novel family of metalloproteinases named ADAMs (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase) has been described (10McKie N.

These proteins are structurally related to the snake venom hemorrhagic toxins (reprolysins) and contain minimally a metalloproteinase domain, and some members have additional domain structures such as NH2-terminal propeptide domains, disintegrin domains, and cysteine-rich domains. Cell-associated ADAMs also contain an epidermal growth factor-like transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain at the COOH terminus of the molecule. Recent studies have demonstrated that human articular chondrocytes express mRNA for three members of the ADAMs family, ADAM-10, -12, and -15 (15McKie N. Edwards T. Dallas D.J. Houghton A. Stringer B. Graham R. Russell G. Croucher P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, some ADAM proteins have been shown to be up-regulated at the mRNA level by interleukin-1 (16Dalas D.J. Edwards T.E. Russell R.G.G. McKie N. Croucher P.I. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 326Google Scholar), suggesting that their expression may be inflammation-associated. Members of the reprolysin family of enzymes have been shown to degrade basement membranes and cleave the extracellular matrix molecules, type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin (17Fox J.W. Bjarnason J.B. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Disease. Taylor and Francis, 1996: 47-81Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures of reprolysins show that their structure is similar to that of the astacin family and the MMPs, especially within the active site region (18Zhang D. Botos I. Gomis-Ruth F. Doll R. Blood C. Njoroge F.G. Fox J.W. Bode W. Meyer E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8447-8451Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Taken together these data open the possibility that ADAM family members may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the cartilage extracellular matrix.In this study we investigated the ability of a reprolysin, atrolysin C, to cleave the aggrecan core protein within the interglobular domain. Using the monoclonal antibody BC-3, which recognizes the NH2-terminal neoepitope ARGSVIL, generated by cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 aggrecanase site (19Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughly P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the monoclonal antibody AF-28, which recognizes the NH2-terminal neoepitope FFGVG, generated by cleavage at the Asn341-Phe342 MMP site (20Fosang A.J. Last K. Gardiner P. Jackson D.C. Brown L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), we demonstrate that atrolysin C is capable of cleaving cartilage aggrecan at both the aggrecanase site and the MMP site. Our results also show that these cleavages occur concomitantly, unlike cleavage by MMP-8, which required complete depletion of the preferred Asn341-Phe342 MMP site to clip at the aggrecanase site (8Fosang A.J. Last K. Neame P.J. Murphy G. Knauper V. Tschesche H. Hughers C.E. Caterson B. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 305: 347-351Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Arner E.C. Decicco C.P. Cherney R.

These findings establish that a reprolysin is able to cleave aggrecan at the aggrecanase site and open the possibility that the as yet unidentified cartilage aggrecanase enzyme may be a member of the ADAM family of proteins.DISCUSSIONIn the work reported here, we demonstrate that atrolysin C at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm cleaves aggrecan at both at the Asn341-Phe342 MMP site and at the Glu373-Ala374 aggrecanase site. The ability to cleave aggrecan between amino acids Glu373 and Ala374 makes atrolysin C the only enzyme to date, other than neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), to be shown capable of cleaving aggrecan at the aggrecanase site (8Fosang A.J. Last K. Neame P.J. Murphy G. Knauper V. Tschesche H. Hughers C.E. Caterson B. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 305: 347-351Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Arner E.C. Decicco C.P. Cherney R. Tortorella M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9294-9299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that recombinant human MMP-8 cleaves native aggrecan in freeze-thawed bovine nasal cartilage at the Glu373-Ala374 aggrecanase site at concentrations similar to those effective in these studies with atrolysin C. However, MMP-8 was found to cleave preferentially at the Asn341-Phe342 MMP site and only cleaved at the Glu373-Ala374 aggrecanase site when complete depletion of substrate containing the preferred cleavage site was achieved (9Arner E.C. Decicco C.P. Cherney R. Tortorella M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9294-9299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, atrolysin C appears to cleave simultaneously at both the Glu373-Ala374 aggrecanase site and the Asn341-Phe342 MMP site. This is supported by the ability of atrolysin C to generate the G1-NITEGE species. Both the AF-28-reactive species generated by cleavage at the MMP site and the NITEGE-reactive species generated by cleavage at the aggrecanase site were observed after a 30-min incubation with atrolysin C. The appearance of the NITEGE epitope prior to the appearance of the ARGSVIL epitope, which is present on the COOH-terminal fragment generated by this same cleavage, is most likely caused by the different affinities of the BC-3 and NITEGE antibodies for their respective antigens. Since the MMP site (Asn341-Phe342) is between the G1 at the NH2 terminus of the aggrecan core protein and the aggrecanase site (Glu373-Ala374), prior cleavage at the MMP site would preclude the generation of a G1-NITEGE species. Thus, cleavage at the aggrecanase site by atrolysin C could not require previous cleavage at the MMP site as is the case with MMP-8. Generation of all three species, ARGSVIL, FFGVG, and NITEGE, by atrolysin C is only consistent with this protease independently clipping at the MMP and aggrecanase sites or clipping first at the aggrecanase site and then further processing some of the COOH-terminal fragments by cleavage at the MMP site. Cleavage of aggrecan by atrolysin C differs from that by aggrecanase generated in chondrocyte cultures stimulated with interleukin-1 or retinoic acid where aggrecanase is apparently capable of cleaving at the Glu373-Ala374 bond in the completeabsence of any detectable cleavage at the MMP site (26Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayala J. Kimura J.H. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Flannery C.R. Carlson S.S. Iwata M. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2550-2556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).The MAB2005 Western and bHA analysis suggest that atrolysin C first cleaves aggrecan between the G2 and G3 globular domains, to produce three large fragments with an intact G1 domain, a 215 kDa doublet and a 190 kDa band. These fragments are then processed further via cleavage within the interglobular domain at the MMP Asn341-Phe342 and aggrecanase Glu373-Ala374 sites to produce fragments that lack a G1 domain. Cleavage of aggrecan by atrolysin C at these two sites can be achieved at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm. Thus, concentrations of atrolysin C effective in cleaving aggrecan at both the Asn341-Phe342 and Glu373-Ala374 sites are within the range of concentrations of MMP-1 and MMP-3 (0.03–0.6 μm) reported to be present in synovial fluids of patients with arthritis (27Walakovits L.A. Moore V.L. Bhardwaj N. Gallick G.S. Lark M.W. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 28Loehmander S.L. Hoerrner L.A. Lark M.W. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).The pattern of BC-3-reactive fragments generated upon cleavage of aggrecan by atrolysin C was different from that which we previously found to be produced upon cleavage of cartilage aggrecan in response to interleukin-1 stimulation of bovine nasal cartilage (9Arner E.C. Decicco C.P. Cherney R. Tortorella M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9294-9299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although several bands of BC-3-reactive aggrecan fragments were seen in response to both endogenously generated aggrecanase and to atrolysin C, the high molecular mass band at ∼230 kDa, which represents the COOH-terminal aggrecan fragment formed upon initial cleavage by aggrecanase within the interglobular domain, was not generated by cleavage with atrolysin C. These data suggest that although atrolysin C has the ability to cleave at the Glu373-Ala374 bond, it does not exhibit the same preference as the cartilage aggrecanase for cleavage sites within the aggrecan molecule.Although atrolysin C is a snake venom metalloproteinase and not found in many species, ADAM family members, which have been demonstrated in mammalian cell types, are related both in amino acid sequence and in domain structure to the reprolysin family of enzymes. ADAM-10,-12, and -15, which are present on the membranes of articular chondrocytes (15McKie N. Edwards T. Dallas D.J. Houghton A. Stringer B. Graham R. Russell G. Croucher P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), contain a zinc binding domain in an HEXXHXXGXXH conformation suggesting that they may have metalloproteinase activity, and catalytic activity has been demonstrated for ADAM 10 (29Howard L. Glynn P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, these ADAMs in chondrocytes may have the ability to function in aggrecan degradation. In addition, hydroxamates designed as inhibitors of MMPs have been shown to inhibit reprolysins (30Andrews H.A. Plumpton T.A. Harper G.P. Cawston T.E. Agents Actions. 1992; 37: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and some of these inhibitors are also effective in blocking stimulated cartilage aggrecan degradationin vitro.Our findings that a reprolysin can cleave aggrecan and, more importantly, has the ability to cleave at the Glu373-Ala374 bond, opens the possibility that the unidentified cartilage aggrecanase may be a member of the reprolysin/ADAM family of proteins. Further studies are under way to determine if any of the known ADAM proteins are capable of cleaving aggrecan specifically at the aggrecanase site. Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan of cartilage and provides this tissue with its mechanical properties of compressibility and elasticity. Aggrecan monomers interact with hyaluronic acid (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronic acid; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; bHA, biotinylated hyaluronic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronic acid; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; bHA, biotinylated hyaluronic acid. and are usually found as part of a large aggregate containing 10–100 monomers/HA molecule.

Proteolytic cleavage within the interglobular domain is believed to be responsible for the loss of aggrecan from cartilage. However, the enzyme responsible for aggrecan cleavage in these diseases has yet to be identified.

Our results also show that these cleavages occur concomitantly, unlike cleavage by MMP-8, which required complete depletion of the preferred Asn341-Phe342 MMP site to clip at the aggrecanase site (8Fosang A.J.

These findings establish that a reprolysin is able to cleave aggrecan at the aggrecanase site and open the possibility that the as yet unidentified cartilage aggrecanase enzyme may be a member of the ADAM family of proteins. DISCUSSIONIn the work reported here, we demonstrate that atrolysin C at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm cleaves aggrecan at both at the Asn341-Phe342 MMP site and at the Glu373-Ala374 aggrecanase site. The ability to cleave aggrecan between amino acids Glu373 and Ala374 makes atrolysin C the only enzyme to date, other than neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), to be shown capable of cleaving aggrecan at the aggrecanase site (8Fosang A.J.

Tortorella M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9294-9299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that recombinant human MMP-8 cleaves native aggrecan in freeze-thawed bovine nasal cartilage at the Glu373-Ala374 aggrecanase site at concentrations similar to those effective in these studies with atrolysin C. However, MMP-8 was found to cleave preferentially at the Asn341-Phe342 MMP site and only cleaved at the Glu373-Ala374 aggrecanase site when complete depletion of substrate containing the preferred cleavage site was achieved (9Arner E.C. Decicco C.P. Cherney R. Tortorella M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9294-9299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, atrolysin C appears to cleave simultaneously at both the Glu373-Ala374 aggrecanase site and the Asn341-Phe342 MMP site. This is supported by the ability of atrolysin C to generate the G1-NITEGE species. Both the AF-28-reactive species generated by cleavage at the MMP site and the NITEGE-reactive species generated by cleavage at the aggrecanase site were observed after a 30-min incubation with atrolysin C. The appearance of the NITEGE epitope prior to the appearance of the ARGSVIL epitope, which is present on the COOH-terminal fragment generated by this same cleavage, is most likely caused by the different affinities of the BC-3 and NITEGE antibodies for their respective antigens. Since the MMP site (Asn341-Phe342) is between the G1 at the NH2 terminus of the aggrecan core protein and the aggrecanase site (Glu373-Ala374), prior cleavage at the MMP site would preclude the generation of a G1-NITEGE species. Thus, cleavage at the aggrecanase site by atrolysin C could not require previous cleavage at the MMP site as is the case with MMP-8. Generation of all three species, ARGSVIL, FFGVG, and NITEGE, by atrolysin C is only consistent with this protease independently clipping at the MMP and aggrecanase sites or clipping first at the aggrecanase site and then further processing some of the COOH-terminal fragments by cleavage at the MMP site. Cleavage of aggrecan by atrolysin C differs from that by aggrecanase generated in chondrocyte cultures stimulated with interleukin-1 or retinoic acid where aggrecanase is apparently capable of cleaving at the Glu373-Ala374 bond in the completeabsence of any detectable cleavage at the MMP site (26Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayala J. Kimura J.H. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Flannery C.R. Carlson S.S. Iwata M. Sandy J.D. J. Biol.

These fragments are then processed further via cleavage within the interglobular domain at the MMP Asn341-Phe342 and aggrecanase Glu373-Ala374 sites to produce fragments that lack a G1 domain. Cleavage of aggrecan by atrolysin C at these two sites can be achieved at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm. Thus, concentrations of atrolysin C effective in cleaving aggrecan at both the Asn341-Phe342 and Glu373-Ala374 sites are within the range of concentrations of MMP-1 and MMP-3 (0.03–0.6 μm) reported to be present in synovial fluids of patients with arthritis (27Walakovits L.A.

Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).The pattern of BC-3-reactive fragments generated upon cleavage of aggrecan by atrolysin C was different from that which we previously found to be produced upon cleavage of cartilage aggrecan in response to interleukin-1 stimulation of bovine nasal cartilage (9Arner E.C. Decicco C.P. Cherney R. Tortorella M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9294-9299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although several bands of BC-3-reactive aggrecan fragments were seen in response to both endogenously generated aggrecanase and to atrolysin C, the high molecular mass band at ∼230 kDa, which represents the COOH-terminal aggrecan fragment formed upon initial cleavage by aggrecanase within the interglobular domain, was not generated by cleavage with atrolysin C. These data suggest that although atrolysin C has the ability to cleave at the Glu373-Ala374 bond, it does not exhibit the same preference as the cartilage aggrecanase for cleavage sites within the aggrecan molecule.Although atrolysin C is a snake venom metalloproteinase and not found in many species, ADAM family members, which have been demonstrated in mammalian cell types, are related both in amino acid sequence and in domain structure to the reprolysin family of enzymes. ADAM-10,-12, and -15, which are present on the membranes of articular chondrocytes (15McKie N. Edwards T. Dallas D.J. Houghton A. Stringer B. Graham R. Russell G. Croucher P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Glynn P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, these ADAMs in chondrocytes may have the ability to function in aggrecan degradation. In addition, hydroxamates designed as inhibitors of MMPs have been shown to inhibit reprolysins (30Andrews H.A. Plumpton T.A. Harper G.P. Cawston T.E. Agents Actions. 1992; 37: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and some of these inhibitors are also effective in blocking stimulated cartilage aggrecan degradationin vitro.Our findings that a reprolysin can cleave aggrecan and, more importantly, has the ability to cleave at the Glu373-Ala374 bond, opens the possibility that the unidentified cartilage aggrecanase may be a member of the reprolysin/ADAM family of proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1987758470,"The vav proto-oncogene is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells and encodes a 95-kDa protein that contains multiple structural domains. Vav is involved in the expansion of T and B cells, in antigen-mediated proliferative responses, and in the induction of intrathymic T cell maturation. It becomes rapidly and transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated upon triggering of a large number of surface receptors and catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on Rac-1. We now provide evidence for the specific interaction of Vav with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C. Vav and hnRNP C interact both in vivo and in vitro mediated through the carboxyl Src homology 3 domain of Vav and the proline-rich motif located in the nuclear retention sequence of hnRNP C. More importantly, Vav-hnRNP C complexes are present in living hematopoietic cells and both proteins localize in the nuclei, mainly on perichromatic fibrils but also on clusters of interchromatin granules. The Vav-hnRNP C interaction is regulated by poly(U) RNA, although a basal association is still detected in the absence of RNA. Furthermore, RNA homopolymers differentially alter the binding affinity of Vav to hnRNP C and hnRNP K. We propose that Vav-hnRNP interactions may be established in an RNA-dependent manner.

Oncogenic vav was originally isolated on the basis of its transforming properties in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (1Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The corresponding cellular gene, the proto-oncogene vav, is only expressed in cells of hematopoietic lineage (2Katzav S. Cleveland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, recently, a homologue of vav, vav2, has been identified and is more widely expressed (3Henske E.P. Short M.P. Jozwiak S. Bovey C.M. Ramlakhan S. Haines J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1995; 59: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). Vav and Vav2 have over 50% identical residues, and both harbor a number of conserved domains found in molecules involved in protein-protein interactions and signaling events (Fig. 1 A) (see Ref. 5Romero F. Fischer S. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar for review). Vav becomes rapidly and transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated upon triggering of a variety of surface receptors in almost every hematopoietic cell. These include T cell receptor/CD3, CD2, and CD28 on T cells, IgM receptor and CD19 on B cells, the IgE high affinity FcεRI receptor on mast cells, the lipopolysaccharide receptor on monocytes/macrophages, and several cytokine and tyrosine kinase receptors (5Romero F. Fischer S. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav in all these cell types suggests an important role for this protein in signal transduction of hematopoietic cells. The Syk-Zap protein-tyrosine kinases have recently been shown to participate in tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav (6Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert C.C. Mustein T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Vav also binds to a hematopoietic specific protein, SLP-76, and after antigen receptor activation, the two proteins synergistically activate NF-AT and IL-2gene expression (7Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chimericvav −/− rag-2 −/− mice have shown that Vav participates in the expansion of both T and B cells and is essential for antigen-mediated proliferative responses and for induction of intrathymic T cell maturation (8Zhang R. Alt F.W. Davidson L. Orkin S.H. Swat W. Nature. 1995; 374: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 9Tarakhovsky A. Turner M. Schaal S. Mee P.J. Duddy L.P. Rajewsky K. Tybulewicz V.L.

Nature. 1995; 374: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of Vav, little is known about its function. Recently, it has been shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on Rac-1. Rac-1 is implicated in cell proliferation and cytoskeletal organization, and stimulates c-Jun kinase, a downstream element in the signaling pathway of this GTPase (11Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar, 12Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). As Vav exhibits a striking combination of structural motifs and is localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (13Clevenger C.V. Ngo W. Sokol D.L. Luger S.M. Gewirtz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13246-13253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is likely that Vav is involved in several distinct cellular functions. It has been reported that the carboxyl SH3 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology domain; C-SH, carboxyl-SH; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RBD, RNA-binding domain; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NRS, nuclear retention sequence; IG, interchromatin granule(s); PF, perichromatin fibril(s). (C-SH3) of Vav interacts with the proline-rich sequences of hnRNP K, which has a role in the regulation of the late steps of RNA biogenesis and transport of mRNA (15Hobert O. Jallal B. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20225-20228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bustelo X.R. Suen K.L. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This interaction has been detected mainly in the cytoplasmic fraction (16Bustelo X.R. Suen K.L. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have shown that the same C-SH3 domain of Vav also interacts with Ku-70 independently of the presence of a proline motif (14Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ku-70 is the DNA-binding element of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, which has been implicated in DNA repair, replication, recombination, and transcription. In addition, it has recently been shown that the leucine zipper motif of Vav associates with ENX-1 (17Hobert O. Jallal B. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3066-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). enx-1 is a novel human gene homolog of the Drosophila Enhancer of Zeste gene, a member of the Polycomb group of genes, which code for transcriptional regulators of homeobox gene expression. To further identify proteins capable of physically associating with Vav, we studied a positive clone isolated from a Jurkat cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system using as bait the SH2 and SH3 domains of Vav. In this paper, we provide evidence for the interaction of Vav with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C. hnRNP C proteins (C1 of 41,000 and C2 of 43,000Mr proteins) are among the most abundant hnRNPs which bind to nascent pre-messenger RNA at an early posttranscriptional stage and are exclusively localized in the nuclei (see Ref. 18Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar for review). In particular, they bind strongly to the intron polypyrimidine tract of pre-mRNA (19Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3519-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and this binding is negatively regulated by serine/threonine hyperphosphorylation (20Mayrand S.H. Dwen P. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7764-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In vitro, hnRNP C proteins have been involved in pre-mRNA splicing (21Choi Y.D. Grabowski P.J. Sharp P.A. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1986; 231: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Using a variety of approaches, we characterized the Vav-hnRNP C association and analyzed the influence of RNA homopolymers on this interaction as well as the potential role of Vav as a hnRNP-interacting molecule. Yeast pVJL10 derivatives included those containing SHVAV (residues 623–837 of human Vav), point mutant SHVAV P833L, SH3-C Vav (residues 787–837), SH3-C′ Vav (residues 813–837), and SH3-N′/SH2 Vav (residues 623–812) (14Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the RasV12 and Raf proteins were used as controls (14Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell.

The mutants SHVAV Y836F and v90PA were constructed in the yeast two-hybrid vectors pVJL10-SHVAV and pGAD-v90, respectively, using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH.

Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) was grown at 30 °C in YPD medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% glucose, and sequentially transformed with pVJL10-SHVAV and a Jurkat cell cDNA library (14Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Double transformants were plated on yeast drop-out medium lacking Trp, Leu, His, Lys, and uracil (22Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). They were grown for 5 days at 30 °C, after which colonies were patched on the same medium and replica-plated on Whatman 40 filters to test for β-galactosidase activity (23Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Positive clones were rescued and tested for specificity by retransformation into L40 either with pVJL10-SHVAV or with extraneous targets (pLexA-RasV12, pLexA-Lamin, or pVJL10) (14Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Sequences of point mutations and cDNA inserts from positive clones of the two-hybrid screening were performed on both strands with an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 373A) using the Sanger dideoxy-termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons were done with the FASTA program. Jurkat cells (clone J77.6.8) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Boehringer Mannheim), 2 mml-Glu, penicillin, and streptomycin, in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. UT7-S Epo cells (25Pallard C. Gouilleux L. Bénit L. Cocault L. Souyri M. Levy D. Groner B. Gisselbrecht S. Dusanter-Fourt I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2847-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) were maintained in α-medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum and erythropoietin at 1–2 units/ml. Cell lysis was performed with 108 cells/ml at 4 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mmsodium vanadate, 10% glycerol, 0.875% Brij 96 (polyoxylethylene-10-oleylether), 0.125% Nonidet P-40, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin for 20 min. The extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was placed in N2 and stored at −80°C. Jurkat and UT7-S Epo cells were prepared according to Ref. 26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar, with minor modifications. Briefly, cells grown to mid-log phase were harvested by centrifugation and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). All subsequent steps were performed on ice. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were allowed to stand for 10 min (or until no intact cells were observed under the microscope). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was mixed with buffer B (0.3 m HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.4m KCl, and 0.03 m MgCl2) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The high speed supernatant was designated as the S100 fraction. Pelleted nuclei were recentrifugated at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove residual cytoplasmic material. These crude nuclei were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and nuclear protein extracted on ice for 30 min. Nuclear extract was obtained by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. S100 and nuclear fractions were dropped in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Expression of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins was induced 4 h at 30 °C by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for GST-v90 and 125 nm for GST-Vav SH2/SH3-C. The fusion proteins were isolated from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). Lysates from Jurkat and UT7-S Epo cells (107 or 2 × 107) were incubated for 2 h with fusion protein (0.5–1 μg) bound to glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads. The beads were washed six times in lysis buffer and dissolved into sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sample buffer, incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the different antibodies. Peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG from donkey, anti-mouse IgG from sheep, and anti-rat IgG from sheep were from Amersham (Les Ulis, France). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system (ECL, Amersham) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Anti-Vav polyclonal antibodies were from Dr. A. Altman 2A. Altman, unpublished data. and Drs. M. Barbacid and X. R. Bustelo (Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Princeton) (27Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M. Nature. 1992; 356: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Anti-Vav polyclonal antibody for electron microscopy was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Vav monoclonal antibody was from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Raf1 polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-hnRNP C (4F4) antibody was provided by Dr. G. Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania) (28Dreyfuss G. Choi Y.D. Adam S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), N3H10 (anti-Ku-70) monoclonal antibody by Dr. W. H. Reeves (University of North Carolina) (29Reeves W.H. Satoh M. Wang J. Ajmani A.K. van Venrooij W.J. Maini R.N. Manual of Biological Markers of Disease. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 1-22Google Scholar), and anti-hnRNP K (B4B6) monoclonal antibody by Drs. J. Celis and K. Dejgaard (30Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Kruse T.A. Gesser B. Nielsen H. Celis J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After centrifugation of UT7-S Epo cells, the cell pellets were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m Sörensen phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. After another centrifugation at the end of fixation, the resulting pellets were washed with phosphate buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of methanol (30, 50, 70, and 90%), and embedded in Lowicryl K4M (31Roth J. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 513-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Polymerization was carried out under long wavelength UV light (Philips fluorescence tubes T6, 6 watts) for 5 days at −20 °C and for 1 day at room temperature. Ultrathin sections were mounted on carbon-Formvar-coated gold grids (200-mesh). For immunolabeling, thin sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature either on a drop of anti-Vav polyclonal antibody (diluted 1/50 in PBS) or anti-hnRNP C monoclonal antibody (diluted 1/5000). After 15 min in PBS, the grids were floated for 10 min on a drop of either 1/50 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG or 1/50 of anti-mouse IgG. Both second antibodies being conjugated to gold particles 10 nm in diameter (Biocell Research Laboratories, Cardiff, United Kingdom). After a final PBS wash, the grids were rapidly rinsed in distilled water and air-dried. Before observation, grids were processed according to the RNP preferential staining method of Bernhard (32Bernhard W. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1969; 27: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). For controls, a 1/10 dilution of normal rabbit serum or 1/10 dilution of normal mouse ascites fluid were used instead of anti-Vav and anti-hnRNP C, respectively. The peptide blocking experiments were done with GST fusion proteins preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 50–100 μm amounts of the polyproline peptide YPARVPPPPPIARAV derived from hnRNP C proteins (residues 126/139–140/153 of hnRNP C1/C2, respectively). For RNA experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with poly(U), poly(rA), poly(rG), or poly(rC) RNA (Pharmacia) or nuclear RNA (preheated 10 min at 65 °C) at several concentrations before adding antibodies for coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Nuclear extracts from Jurkat and UT7-S Epo cells (1.5–3 × 107) were diluted 2.5 times with buffer C (see “Subcellular Fractionation”) lacking NaCl and supplemented with 0.05% Brij 96. After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with preimmune serum for 30 min and protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-Vav or preimmune serum, followed by protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. After centrifugation, the beads were washed six times in PBS, 10% glycerol, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Eluted proteins were dissolved into SDS-sample buffer, incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Equivalent amounts of S100 fractions were directly used for coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Nuclear RNA was prepared by the acid/guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Digestions with RNase (400 μg/ml) were carried out with preboiled bovine RNase I A (Pharmacia) for 45 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were used for coimmunoprecipitation experiments. To study the signaling mechanism involved in hematopoietic cell development, we searched for proteins bound to Vav using the yeast two-hybrid approach. A Jurkat T cell cDNA library was screened using as bait SHVAV (residues 623–837 of human Vav) fused to the carboxyl terminus of the LexA DNA-binding domain. This portion of Vav includes the SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains (Fig. 1 A), structures commonly involved in protein-protein interactions of signaling molecules. The v90 polypeptide was identified as interacting specifically with SHVAV both by the induction of lacZexpression and by the growth of yeast in absence of histidine, the two reporter genes used in the two-hybrid system. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed because neither the RasV12/v90 polypeptide nor the LexA DNA-binding domain/v90 polypeptide transactivated the reporter genes (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, full-length Csk, another protein with SH2 and SH3 domains, did not interact with the v90 polypeptide, whereas the full-length Vav was clearly positive (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the yeast plasmid revealed that v90 encoded a 170-amino acid-long polypeptide identical to residues 120–290 of hnRNP C1 (or 133–303 of hnRNP C2) (34Swanson M.S. Nakagawa T.Y. Le Van K. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1731-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). hnRNP C1 and C2 proteins are two isoforms generated from a single gene by alternative splicing of a common pre-mRNA (35Burd C.G. Swanson M.S. Gorlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and are restricted to the nucleus in interphase cells (36Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). They have an amino-terminal domain containing an RNA-binding domain (RBD) with two highly conserved sequences called RNP1 and RNP2, and a carboxyl-terminal essentially composed of an acidic domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and a nuclear retention sequence (NRS) (18Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 35Burd C.G. Swanson M.S. Gorlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 36Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These carboxyl-terminal domains are included in the v90 polypeptide. Interestingly, the NRS contains a proline-rich motif classically involved in protein-protein interaction with SH3-containing proteins. To validate the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system, the interaction of hnRNP C and Vav was studied in another expression system. The cDNA fragment of v90 was subcloned into a pGEX derivative to generate a chimeric GST-v90. The expressed fusion protein was purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Lysates from Jurkat and UT7-S Epo cells (a growth factor-dependent human megakaryoblastic cell line) (25Pallard C. Gouilleux L. Bénit L. Cocault L. Souyri M. Levy D. Groner B. Gisselbrecht S. Dusanter-Fourt I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2847-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) were incubated with the Sepharose beads bound to GST-v90, washed, and the eluted proteins resolved on gels and immunoblotted with an anti-Vav monoclonal antibody. Fig. 1 D shows that Vav interacts with GST-v90 in both Jurkat and UT7-S Epo hematopoietic cell lines, whereas there is no interaction with GST alone. Additionally, the Vav-GST-v90 interaction remained unchanged when nonspecific binding sites on the GST beads were blocked by preincubation with an excess of soluble GST (data not shown). In the inverse experiments in particular, GST-Vav SH2/SH3-C (15Hobert O. Jallal B. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20225-20228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also bound hnRNP C proteins (see below). Taken together, these results indicate that Vav and hnRNP C specifically interact in the yeast system and in vitro. To further delineate the Vav interacting domain, three fragments of SHVAV cDNA subcloned in frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain were used (14Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar): the intact C-SH3 of Vav (SH3-C Vav), the COOH-terminal half of Vav C-SH3 (SH3-C′ Vav), and the SHVAV lacking the COOH-terminal half of C-SH3 (SH3-N′/SH2). The study of these subclones by the two-hybrid system showed that the C-SH3 of Vav is responsible for the interaction with v90 polypeptide (Fig. 2 A). The SH3-C′ Vav was still able to bind the COOH-terminal region of hnRNP C, but SH3-N′/SH2 Vav could not interact with the v90 polypeptide. Further confirmation of the association of hnRNP C with the C-SH3 domain of Vav was obtained by analysis of the P833L mutation of SHVAV. This mutation is analogous to an SH3 mutation found previously to abrogate the function of the Grb2 homolog Sem5 in the vulva differentiation pathway of Caenorhabditis elegans (37Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 38Clark S.G. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B (third lane), the P833L mutation completely abolished the interaction of SHVAV with the v90 polypeptide in the yeast two-hybrid system. As a negative control, a SHVAV Y836F mutant, which maintains the ability to bind polyproline motifs, interacted with v90 at the same level as the wild-type polypeptide (Fig. 2 B, fourth lane). As all Vav subclones and point mutants were produced in similar amount in L40 strain, these experiments define the C-SH3 domain of Vav as the binding site for hnRNP C. We next sought to identify the hnRNP C sequence involved in the interaction with Vav. hnRNP C proteins have a proline-rich sequence stretch, YPARVPPPPPIARAV (35Burd C.G. Swanson M.S. Gorlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 C), which resembles previously identified SH3 binding motifs (39Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) and is contained in the v90 subclone. We examined whether this proline-rich sequence was responsible for the Vav-hnRNP C interaction. First, the ability of GST-Vav SH2/SH3-C (15Hobert O. Jallal B. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20225-20228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to bind hnRNP C was tested. As hnRNP C proteins are completely restricted to the nucleus (36Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), subcellular fractionations were performed (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purity of the fractions were assessed on Jurkat and UT7-S Epo cells by the absence of Raf proteins in the nuclei fraction and the absence in the cytoplasmic fraction of hnRNP C (Fig. 3, A–C). Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells were incubated with Sepharose beads carrying GST-Vav and the filters blotted with anti-hnRNP C monoclonal antibody. In these conditions hnRNP C interacted with GST-Vav (Fig. 3 D,third lane). On lighter exposures, the closely migrating hnRNP C1 and C2 proteins were both detected. No interaction was detected with GST alone. Similar results were obtained with extracts from UT7-S Epo cells (data not shown). Therefore, the chimeric GST-Vav SH2/SH3-C recognized full-length human hnRNP C proteins in vitro. Next, a proline-rich peptide (YPARVPPPPPIARAV) was used to block the Vav-hnRNP C interaction. To this end, GST-Vav SH2/SH3-C were preincubated with the polyproline peptide, followed by incubation with Jurkat nuclear extracts. Western blot analyses with anti-hnRNP C showed that 50 μm peptide largely decreased the Vav-hnRNP C interaction and 100 μm almost completely abolished this association (Fig. 3 D). The same peptide was tested in the Vav-Ku-70 interaction, which implicates the same C-SH3 domain of Vav but is independent of the presence of a proline-rich motif (14Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, these experiments were used as a cont"
https://openalex.org/W1972221158,"Bacillus subtilis PyrR has been shown to mediate transcriptional attenuation at three separate sites within the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic (pyr) operon. Molecular genetic evidence suggests that regulation is achieved by PyrR binding to pyr mRNA. PyrR is also a uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase). Recombinant PyrR was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, physically and chemically characterized, and examined with respect to both of these activities. Mass spectroscopic characterization of PyrR demonstrated a monomeric mass of 20,263 Da. Gel filtration chromatography showed the native mass of PyrR to be dependent on protein concentration and suggested a rapid equilibrium between dimeric and hexameric forms. The UPRTase activity of PyrR has a pH optimum of 8.2. The Km value for uracil is very pH-dependent; the Km for uracil at pH 7.7 is 990 ± 114 μm, which is much higher than for most UPRTases and may account for the low physiological activity of PyrR as a UPRTase. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, PyrR was shown to bind pyr RNA that includes sequences from its predicted binding site in the second attenuator region. Binding of PyrR to pyr RNA was specific and UMP-dependent with apparent Kd values of 10 and 220 nm in the presence and absence of UMP, respectively. The concentration of UMP required for half-maximal stimulation of binding of PyrR to RNA was 6 μm. The results support a model for the regulation of pyr transcription whereby termination is governed by the UMP-dependent binding of PyrR to pyr RNA and provide purified and characterized PyrR for detailed biochemical studies of RNA binding and transcriptional attenuation.

The Bacillus subtilis pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) operon encodes all of the enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of UMP and two additional cistrons encoding a uracil permease and the regulatory protein PyrR (1Lerner C.G. Stephenson B.T. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2202-2206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Quinn C.L. Stephenson B.T. Switzer R.L. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5013-5016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of molecular genetic evidence it was proposed that PyrR regulatespyr expression through a transcriptional attenuation mechanism that acts at three separate sites within the operon, which are located in the 5′-untranslated leader, between the first (pyrR) and second (pyrP) genes, and between the second and third (pyrB) genes of the operon (3Turner R.J. Lu Y. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3708-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lu Y. Turner R.J. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1315-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PyrR is proposed to regulate the ratio of terminated to readthrough transcripts at each attenuation site by permitting the formation of a ρ-independent transcription terminator when exogenous pyrimidines are available. The binding of PyrR to pyr mRNA interferes with the formation of an alternative upstream stem-loop structure, the antiterminator, which is otherwise kinetically and thermodynamically favored. The presence of a conserved sequence within the 5′-stem of each antiterminator suggested a site within the pyr mRNA for interaction with PyrR (3Turner R.J. Lu Y. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3708-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this site is the locus of severalcis-acting mutants in the first pyr attenuator which are deficient in repression by pyrimidines (6Ghim S.-Y. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2351-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PyrR functions as a novel uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase), 1The abbreviations used are: UPRTase, uracil phosphoribosyltransferase; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl α-1-pyrophosphate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. catalyzing the formation of UMP and pyrophosphate from uracil and 5-phosphoribosyl α-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) despite its lack of primary sequence similarity to other known UPRTases (3Turner R.J.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 271-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The UPRTase activity of PyrR was first discovered by Ghim and Neuhard (8Ghim S.-Y. Neuhard J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3698-3707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who characterized the pyrR gene from Bacillus caldolyticus. The role of the enzymatic function of PyrR is not known; Bacillus subtilis possesses an additional UPRTase that has been shown to be quantitatively more important than PyrR (3Turner R.J. Lu Y. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3708-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Martinussen J. Glaser P. Andersen P.S. Saxild H.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 271-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that UMP and PRPP function as negative and positive regulators, respectively, of the pyr operon (3Turner R.J. Lu Y. Switzer R.L. J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 353-355Google Scholar) was used for the growth of cultures for plasmid purification and the purification of native PyrR. Media were supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin when cells harboring plasmids were grown. All liquid cultures were grown aerobically at 37 °C. B. subtilis PyrR was expressed in E. colifrom plasmid pTSROX3 (pUC18 (12Norrander, J., Kempe, T., and Messing, J. Gene(Amst.) 26, 101–106.Google Scholar) into which a 0.79-kilobase pairEcoRI-SphI fragment bearing the pyrpromoter, 5′-leader, and pyrR from pTS185 (3Turner R.J. Lu Y. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3708-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted), in which PyrR expression was driven by tandem lac and pyr promoters. E. coli SØ408 (relA1 rpsL254 metB1 upp-11, from J. Neuhard, University of Copenhagen), a strain lacking endogenous UPRTase activity, bearing pTSROX3 was grown in 3 liters of Luria broth, supplemented with 97 μg of ticarcillin and 3 μg of clavulanic acid/ml of culture. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in cold 0.9% NaCl, and stored at −80 °C. All enzyme purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. The pH values for Tris buffers were determined at 25 °C. The cells were resuspended with 8 ml of 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, per g of cell paste, disrupted by sonication on ice, and cell debris removed by centrifugation. Streptomycin sulfate (0.11 volume of a 10% solution freshly prepared in 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0) was added, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Further contaminants were precipitated with 0.538 volume of saturated ammonium sulfate, which was buffered with 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, and removed by centrifugation. PyrR was precipitated from the supernatant solution by the addition of 0.857 volume of buffered saturated ammonium sulfate and collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was resuspended in 4 ml of buffer R (100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 10 mmNa+Pi, 100 mm NaCl) for every g of the cell paste used. The solution was dialyzed against buffer R. The entire sample was loaded onto a 2.2 × 21-cm Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) column that had been equilibrated in buffer R. Buffer R (400 ml) was allowed to flow through the column, and PyrR was eluted using an 800-ml linear NaCl gradient, from 100 to 300 mm, in 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 10 mmNa+Pi. Fractions from the trailing half of the PyrR peak, which eluted at a conductivity equivalent to 217–238 mm NaCl, were pooled. The pooled PyrR sample was then concentrated approximately 6-fold by pressure dialysis. Additional impurities were precipitated with an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate and removed by centrifugation. PyrR was precipitated from the supernatant fluid by the addition of another equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate, then collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, per g of cell paste used and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5. The dialyzed solution was divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. UPRTase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of [2-14C]uracil to [14C]UMP by modifications of the method of Rasmussen et al. (13Rasmussen U.B. Mygind B. Nygaard P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 881: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Method 1 was used during development of the purification of PyrR. The assay conditions were pH 9.0 at 37 °C, 50 mm Tris acetate, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm PRPP, and 0.1 mm [14C]uracil (about 4.4 × 104 dpm/assay). The assay mix (20 μl, containing all components but PRPP) was combined with 20 μl of enzyme, which was diluted in 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 9.7, and 1 mg/ml BSA. Reactions were preheated for 1 min at 37 °C, initiated with 10 μl of 6 mm PRPP, and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. (For purified PyrR after the Q-Sepharose step it was necessary to stabilize the enzyme by including 3 mm PRPP in the assay mix and initiating the reactions with 10 μl of 0.5 mm[14C]uracil.) The reactions were stopped by heating at 100 °C for 1 min. Separation of the product [14C]UMP from [14C]uracil on DEAE-cellulose paper was essentially as described for Method 2 below. After purified PyrR was available the assay was further optimized, and Method 2 was used for kinetic characterization of the purified protein. Each assay contained 20 μl of 0.125m buffer, 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 times the desired final concentration of PRPP. PyrR was diluted into 100 mm buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA immediately before assay, and 20 μl was mixed with 20 μl of assay mix and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of [14C]uracil at 5 × the desired final concentration (1.5–6 × 105 cpm). Reactions occurred at 37 °C, and 5-μl samples taken at various reaction times were spotted onto 1-cm2 squares of DEAE-cellulose paper (Whatman) and dried rapidly. The spotting was found to stop the reaction very quickly, so heating was not necessary. The DEAE-cellulose paper was washed four times for 20 min each with water and once for 15 min with methanol. To determine the total14C counts in each reaction mixture duplicate 5-μl samples from each tube were spotted onto squares of DEAE-cellulose which were not washed. Radioactivity on the DEAE-cellulose paper squares was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Kinetic data were analyzed using the KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA) computer program. At least five concentrations of each substrate were used at each pH value reported; the data fit well to a Ping Pong Bi Bi rate equation at all pH values. For ESI-MS, PyrR was dissolved in a 50% acetonitrile (v/v) and 0.1% formic acid (v/v) solution by repeated desalting using a MicroconTM 10 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) until all salts were reduced to picomolar concentrations. The sample was submitted to the University of Illinois School of Chemical Sciences Mass Spectrometry Laboratory for ESI-MS analysis on a VG Quattro (quadrupole-hexapole-quadrupole) mass spectrometer system (Fisons Instruments, VG Analytical; Manchester, U. K.). Data acquisition and processing were controlled by the VG MassLynx (version 2.0) data system (Micromass, Manchester, U. K.). MaxEnt (maximum entropy) software (Micromass) was used for the processing and analysis of zero charge state electrospray data. Cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups were titrated with 4 mm5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoate), measuring the increase in absorbance at 412 nm as described by Ellman (14Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). The buffer used for titration of native PyrR was 0.1 m KPi, pH 7.3, containing 1 mm EDTA; for denatured PyrR the buffer was 0.1m Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.4. The concentration of PyrR was determined from its extinction coefficient of 7,100 m−1 cm−1 at 275 nm. A column (1-cm diameter, 95-cm height, 75-ml bed volume) of Sephadex G-150 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used to determine the native molecular weight of PyrR. The buffer used was 50 mmTris acetate, pH 7.5. The column was loaded with 0.6–1.0-ml samples of PyrR and eluted at 4 °C. Proteins used to construct aMr standard curve for the column were myoglobin, chicken serum albumin, yeast hexokinase, and bovine γ-globulin. The protein concentrations in the eluted fractions were determined by their absorbance at 280 nm; when the protein was too dilute or the fractions contained UMP, the protein was determined using the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) with reagents purchased from Bio-Rad. A template for in vitro run-off transcription of pyr mRNA nucleotides +682 to +761, which correspond to the anti-antiterminator (or “binding loop”) from the pyrR-pyrP intercistronic region, was created using PCR. The PCR was performed using the forward primer 5′-CGGAATTC TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATATGAAAACGAATAATAGATCACCTTTTTAA-3′ (where an EcoRI site is underlined and is immediately upstream of a bacteriophage T7 promoter in italics), the reverse primer 5′-CGGGATCCTTTTTGGGCCTTTGTTGTG-3′ (where aBamHI site is underlined), and the pLS361 plasmid (5Lu Y. Turner R.J. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1315-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template. The purified PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into similarly digested pUC18 to create pBSBL2. This plasmid template was linearized withBamHI before its inclusion in the transcription reaction. Similarly, templates for in vitro run-off transcription of pyr mRNA nucleotides +722 to +796 and +772 to +809, which correspond to the antiterminator and terminator, respectively, from the pyrR-pyrP intercistronic region, were created using PCR. The antiterminator template pBSAT2 was synthesized using the primers 5′-CGGAATTC TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGAGGTTGCAAAGAGGTG-3′ (where an EcoRI site is underlined and is immediately upstream of a bacteriophage T7 promoter in italics), 5′-CGGGATCC ACGCGTTTACGCAAAGAGGCATACAAAG-3′ (where a BamHI site is underlined, and an MluI site is in italics), and pLS361 as template. The purified PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into similarly digested pUC18 to create pBSAT2. This plasmid template was linearized with MluI before its inclusion in the transcription reaction. The terminator template pBST2 was synthesized using the primers 5′-CGGAATTC TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGTCTTTGTATGCCTCTTTGC-3′ (where an EcoRI site is underlined and is immediately upstream of a bacteriophage T7 promoter in italics), 5′-CGTCTAGACCTCTTTGCTTTTTTACGC-3′ (where anXbaI site is underlined), and pLS361 as template. The purified PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and ligated into similarly digested pUC18 to create pBST2. This plasmid template was linearized with XbaI before its inclusion in the transcription reaction. To create a template that contained the same pyr nucleotides as pBSBL2 but was designed to transcribe the antisense RNA strand corresponding to the anti-antiterminator, two synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were annealed and used as the template to produce run-off transcripts directly. The first oligonucleotide, or “top strand,” corresponds to the core T7 promoter sequence (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATA-3′). The second oligonucleotide, or “bottom strand,” has a sequence that anneals to the T7 promoter at one end and also nucleotides that are complementary to the desiredpyr transcript (pyr mRNA nucleotides +761 to +682). The sequence of the bottom strand oligonucleotide was 5′-TATGAAAACGAATAATAGATCACCTTTTTAAGGGCAATCCAGAGAGGTTGCAAAGAGGTGCACAACAAAGGCCCAAAAAGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′ (the sequence complementary to the T7 promoter oligonucleotide is underlined). The top strand (30 pmol) and bottom strand (25 pmol) oligonucleotides were annealed according to the procedure of Milligan and Uhlenbeck (16Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). pyr RNA for use in the electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay was prepared by in vitro run-off transcription using the MEGAshortscriptTM kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) as described by the manufacturer, except that 1 μl of 75 mmATP diluted 1:500 in RNase-free H2O and 5 μl of [α-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) were added to each 20-μl reaction mixture. The full-length RNA product was purified by electrophoresis on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) containing 8m urea. The RNA was visualized by autoradiography, excised, and eluted with 1 ml of 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA in RNase-free H2O at room temperature for at least 3 h. The elution solution was extracted twice with acid phenol:chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was washed twice with cold absolute ethanol and air dried. The RNA was resuspended in RNase-free TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in RNase-free H2O). The molar concentration of each RNA species was determined from the radioactivity of the full-length RNA, the specific radioactivity of the ATP in the transcription mixture, and the number of adenine residues in each transcript. Each RNA was diluted in RNase-free TE to a stock concentration of 500 pm. Nonspecific RNA was prepared as above but using the plasmid templates as follows. An 18 S rRNA transcript was prepared using the template provided with the Ambion MEGAshortscriptTM kit; an actin transcript was prepared using the template provided with the Ambion MAXIscriptTM kit; and an RNA corresponding to multiple cloning site DNA was prepared using pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI) linearized with HindIII. Gel shifts were performed using a Bio-Rad PROTEAN® IIxi electrophoresis apparatus with the core cooled to 2 °C and the buffer recirculating between the upper and lower reservoirs. All gel shifts were run on 6% native polyacrylamide (79:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gels containing 12.5 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 2.5% glycerol (v/v), using 12.5 mmTris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm magnesium acetate as running buffer. Gels were pre-run at 150 V for 90 min and then cooled by recirculation for 1 h. RNA-binding reaction mixtures were loaded onto the gel with tracking dyes in a separate lane. The gel was subjected to electrophoresis at 30 V for 15 min followed by 300 V for 3 h. The gel was blotted onto filter paper, dried, and radioactivity was visualized by exposing the gels to x-ray film. For quantitation of the binding data, the dried gel was exposed to a storage PhosphorImage screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), after which the data were quantitated with a PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software. Binding curves were fit to hyperbolae, and binding constants were calculated using the KinetAsyst computer program as described above. RNA-binding reaction mixtures were assembled on ice. The binding conditions were modified from the procedure of Batey and Williamson (17Batey R.T. Williamson J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 16 μl of binding mix, 2 μl of PyrR (diluted as described below), and 2 μl RNA (prepared as described below; final concentration of 50 pm RNA). The binding mix gave final assay concentrations of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm potassium acetate, UMP (when added), 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 5 μg/ml heparin, 0.01% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma; Igepal CA-630 is an analog of Nonidet P-40), and 0.08 unit/μl placental RNase inhibitor (Ambion). PyrR was diluted using 12.5 mmTris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, which contained 1 mg/ml RNase-free acetylated BSA (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Because PyrR has poor thermostability at high dilution, the protein must be thawed on ice and diluted immediately before use. To minimize alternate RNA secondary structures, the RNA was heated to 75 °C for 15 min, slow cooled for 1 h, and cooled on ice for 5 min before its incorporation into the binding mixture. The completed binding reactions were incubated on ice for 1 h before loading on the gel. Immediately before loading them onto the gel, 2 μl of RNase-free 50% glycerol was added to the reaction mixtures. B. subtilis DNA specifying the pyr promoter, 5′-leader, and pyrR was cloned into pUC18 to generate plasmid pTSROX3, in which the expression of pyrR was driven from the tandemlac and pyr promoters. pTSROX3-encoded PyrR was expressed to about one-third of the total cell protein in E. coli strain SØ408. In other experiments (not shown) the addition of uracil to the growth medium did not reduce the amount of pTSROX3-encoded PyrR produced in a different strain of E. coli. Thus, although the PyrR protein regulates its own expression in B. subtilis (3Turner R.J. Lu Y. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3708-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such regulation was not observed in anE. coli background. Because transcriptional attenuation of pyr genes can be demonstrated with purified PyrR and E. coli RNA polymerase in vitro (9Lu Y. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7206-7211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that the failure to see such attenuation in vivo might reflect significant differences in the intracellular concentrations of the regulatory metabolites UMP and PRPP in the two species. The procedure for purification of PyrR is relatively simple. The most effective step is ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose. The prior steps were used primarily to remove non-protein contaminants so that the fractionation on Q-Sepharose would be more reproducible. The subsequent ammonium sulfate fractionation is useful to concentrate the protein and to remove some very minor contaminating proteins, but it frequently resulted in losses of activity and a reduced specific activity. This step can be omitted for many uses of the purified PyrR. At least four trace-contaminating proteins can be detected in the best preparations of PyrR on overloaded SDS-polyacrylamide gels (not shown); we estimate these preparations to be at least 98% pure. Specific UPRTase activities (using assay Method 1) of purified PyrR preparations have ranged from 6 to 11 μmol/min/mg at pH 9. Two preparations of purified PyrR were subjected to ESI-MS analysis. Three major components, comprising about 95% of the total protein, were resolved (results for one of the preparations are shown in Fig. 1). The mass of the most abundant component of each sample, approximately 70%, was 20,263 ± 2 Da. Another component, comprising approximately 10% of each preparation, had a mass of 131–132 Da smaller than the main component, which matches the change in mass expected for removal of the NH2-terminal methionine that is known to be present on the bulk of PyrR produced in E. coli (3Turner R.J. Lu Y. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3708-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third major component, which comprised about 12% of the total protein, was 28 Da smaller than the most abundant component. This component and several other minor components were not identified. The mass of the major components differed by 75 Da from the mass predicted by the previously deduced amino acid sequence of PyrR (3Turner R.J. Lu Y. Switzer R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3708-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy led us to re-examine the nucleotide sequence of pyrR. Two GC dinucleotide inversions were discovered which require codons 34 and 53 to be changed from encoding a serine (UCG) and proline (CCG) to codons encoding cysteine (UGC) and arginine (CGC), respectively. These corrections to the PyrR sequence led to a calculated molecular mass (20,263) that matched exactly the value determined by ESI-MS. The corrected PyrR sequence contains one cysteinyl residue/monomer, whereas the previously deduced sequence predicted none. Titration of the sulfhydryl content of PyrR with 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoate) (14Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of 0.8 mol/mol cysteine with the native enzyme and 1.1 mol/mol when PyrR was denatured with 0.5% SDS. Furthermore, the corrected residues, Cys-34 and Arg-53, are identical to the amino acid residues found in the corresponding positions in the deduced sequence of the highly homologous PyrR from B. caldolyticus (8Ghim S.-Y. Neuhard J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3698-3707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ultraviolet spectrum of PyrR at pH 7.5 yielded an extinction coefficient of 7.1 mm−1 cm−1 at 275 nm based on determination of its concentration by the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), which matched very well with an extinction coefficient at 275 nm of 7.5 mm−1 cm−1calculated for the protein from a content of five tyrosine residues and no tryptophan residues predicted from the deduced sequence. Furthermore, this result indicates that the purified protein does not contain significant amounts of nucleotide or nucleic acid contaminants. The native molecular weight of PyrR was determined by gel filtration chromatography at various protein concentrations and in the presence and absence of the ligands UMP or PRPP (Table I). In general, most of the PyrR migrated on gel filtration as a single, active peak whose apparent molecular weight was dependent on the concentration of PyrR loaded. Average molecular weights from 60,000 to 100,000 were observed; given the subunit molecular weight of 20,000, these values correspond to trimeric to pentameric states of aggregation. X-ray crystallographic analysis has identified two forms of PyrR, one dimeric and the other hexameric. 2Tomchick, D. R., Turner, R. J., Smith, J. L., and Switzer, R. L. (1998) Structure, in press. We interpret the behavior of PyrR on gel filtration chromatography to indicate that the dimeric and hexameric forms of PyrR are in rapid equilibrium and that the average molecular weight values observed reflect shifts in that equilibrium toward the hexameric form as the PyrR concentration is increased. Mg2+ and UMP tend to favor the more aggregated form, whereas Mg2+ and PRPP favor the less aggregated form of PyrR, but these effects are small, and in no case is the protein fully converted to one state of aggregation. In the absence of stabilizing ligands PyrR has some tendency to form highly aggregated inactive species. A much more pronounced ability of substrates to affect the state of aggregation of the UPRTase from E. coliwas reported by Jensen and Mygind (18Jensen K.F. Mygind B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), who found that substrates converted the enzyme from a low molecular weight form, probably a dimer, to a high molecular weight form, probably a hexamer. B. subtilis PyrR shares with E. coli UPRTase the ability to be stabilized and activated by prior incubation with Mg2+ and PRPP (see below), but we did not find evidence for promotion of aggregation of PyrR by this"

(EC 2.4.1.17) catalyze the reaction of UDP-glucuronic acid with substrates bearing a variety of different functional groups, including OH, NH2, SH2, and COOH. Because the glucuronides are usually less biologically active, more polar, and readily excreted from organisms, the UGTs are considered important for the general detoxification and elimination of a host of endogenous and exogenous substances, such as bilirubin, steroids, environmental pollutants, carcinogens, and dietary substances. Molecular cloning evidence indicates the existence of two large families of UGTs, UGT1 and UGT2 (1Tephly T.R. Burchell B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 276-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). UGT1 family members are encoded by a unique gene complex, UGT1, which utilizes exon sharing to generate ≥12 isozyme forms with homologous but unique amino-terminal (≈287 amino acids) and identical carboxyl-terminal sequences (245 amino acids) (2Ritter J.K.

Biochem. 1995; 117: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). UGT2 family members, in contrast, appear to be encoded by independent genes. Each UGT exhibits its own unique profile of substrate and tissue specificity and regulation by exposure to endogenous or xenobiotic compounds (1Tephly T.R. Burchell B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 276-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A recent focus of our studies has been the UGT isozymes responsible for the glucuronidating activity of rat liver microsomes toward benzo(a)pyrene metabolites. Benzo(a)pyrene is a prototype of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a class of carcinogens introduced into the environment from the partial combustion of organic material (e.g. tobacco). Although metabolism is a fundamental requirement for their carcinogenicity (reviewed in Ref. 4Gelboin H.V. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1107-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), their mutagenic properties are also subject to the activity of detoxification enzymes, such as the UGTs (5Hu Z. Wells P.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 334-342PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hu Z. Wells P.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 127: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Vienneau D.S. DeBoni U.

Because PAHs and oltipraz are known to induce transcription of other metabolizing enzymes by mechanisms involving the arylhydrocarbon receptor and/or oxidative stress (15Hankinson O. Annu. Rev.

To characterize the mechanism of PAH inducibility of rat UGT1A6, Emiet al. (18Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3952-3958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have cloned and characterized the UGT1A6 gene promoter. The structure of the transcription unit was unusual in that it was composed of six rather than the five exons that are typical of other UGT1 transcription units (2Ritter J.K. Chen F. Sheen Y.Y.

A putative XRE with the core sequence characteristic of all known XREs, 5′-GCGTG-3′, was identified between −134 and −129 upstream from the transcriptional start site. This sequence was shown to be a functional XRE, mediating 9–15-fold inducibility of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter enzyme. These observations suggest that this particular sequence motif underlies the in vivo regulation of UGT1A6 by PAHs. In this paper, we describe a study aimed at characterizing the mechanism of the increase in steady state UGT1A7 mRNA level by PAH and oltipraz. Nuclear runoff data indicate that increased gene transcription is the primary mechanism of mRNA accumulation in response to these agents. Characterization and sequencing of the UGT1A7 promoter and 5′-flanking region indicated several differences from UGT1A6, including its basic exon composition, the existence of >30 transcription start points, and the absence of any functional XRE or AREs in its immediate 5′ flanking sequence. Rats used in this study were male Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Animal handling and experimentation for this study were carried out with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Virginia Commonwealth University. β-Naphthoflavone and 3-methylcholanthrene were from Aldrich and Sigma, respectively. Oltipraz was from the Chemoprevention Branch, National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). The rat genomic DNA library (in bacteriophage EMBL3 SP6-T7) was fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Custom oligonucleotides used in this study for primer extension and gene sequencing were synthesized by the Nucleic Acid Synthesis and Purification Core Resource of the Massey Cancer Center (Virginia Commonwealth University). Cultures of primary rat hepatocytes were prepared by the Hepatocyte Isolation and Preservation Core Facility of the Liver Center at the Medical College of Virginia (Virginia Commonwealth University). LipofectinTM cationic liposomes and Luciferase Assay SystemTM were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. pRUGT1.6 contains a 783-bp fragment from the 5′ end (bases +28 to +810) of the UGT1A6 cDNA (8Kessler F.K. Ritter J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The plasmid p1.4XB contains a 1499-bp XhoI-BamHI fragment from the extreme 5′ end of the bacteriophage clone λRPT-6 inserted into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pSK+. The plasmid p2.0XB contains the 5′ XhoI-BamHI fragment of λVIP-14 cloned into XhoI-BamHI cut pSK+. pLC14 (+9/+697) corresponds to a 690-bp fragment from the 5′ end of the LC14 (UGT1A7) cDNA cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). pRBA-6 is a pCR2.1-based plasmid containing a 597-bp fragment of the rat β-actin cDNA amplified from rat liver cDNA using primers 5′-AGA CTA CCT CAT GAA GAT CCT GAC C-3′ and 5′-GGA CTG TTA CTG AGC TGC GTT TTA C-3′, respectively. p340XP is a pSK+ based plasmid containing the 340-bpXbaI-PstI fragment from p1.4XB. pHCYP1A1B5 represents the 5′ BamHI fragment of the human CYP1A1 cDNA (including 18-bases of the 5′ untranslated region, the complete 1563-base open reading frame, and 130 bases of the 3′ untranslated region) (8Kessler F.K. Ritter J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The base luciferase vector for construction of all chimericUGT1A7-luciferase reporter plasmids was pGL3-Basic (Promega). p-965/+56 1A7-Luc and p+56/-965 1A7-Luc were generated by cloning the 1.0-kbp PvuII fragment of p1.4XB into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic in the correct and reverse orientations, respectively. p-1600-/+56-UGT1A7 Luc, containing an additional 600-bp 5′ extension of the UGT1A7 5′ flanking region, was obtained by blunt-end cloning the 5′ most PvuII fragment from p2.0XB into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic. pSTM11 was a gift from S. McGill and Dr. R. Prough (Louisville, KY) and was derived by cloning the 1.1-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragment from the 5′ flanking region of UGT1A6 into pGL3-Basic. A rat genomic DNA library (1 × 106 independent plaque-forming units) was first screened using Escherichia coli K802 as the host strain and pRUGT1.6 insert labeled to high specific activity (>1 × 109 dpm/μg) by random hexamer priming as described, yielding clones λRPT6, λRPT12, and λRPT19. One of these, λRPT6, also hybridized with a probe prepared from pLC14 (+9/+697). The library was rescreened using the pLC14 +9/+697 insert as probe, but a large number of clones were hybridized. These clones appear to correspond toUGT1A7-like exons. To narrow the number, the filters were rehybridized using a probe prepared from the EcoRV-EcoRI fragment flanking the UGT1A6 locus, yielding phage clone λVIP-14. Large-scale phage DNA purification was carried out as recommended byCLONTECH. The nucleotide sequence of a 1.4-kbpXhoI-BamHI fragment from λRPT-6 was determined using the dideoxy chain termination method with a commercially available kit (SequenaseTM, U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and custom-made oligonucleotide primers. Total RNA was isolated by the acid phenol method (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar) from livers of rats receiving either vehicle alone (1 ml/kg 30% polyethylene glycol-1450 (v/v) for 3 days), oltipraz (90 mg/ml, 300 mg/kg/day for 3 days), or β-naphthoflavone dissolved in corn oil (12 mg/ml, 80 mg/kg/day for 3 days). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted by cellulose poly(dT) affinity chromatography (Boehringer Mannheim,). Two non-overlapping UGT1A7 antisense primers (6.375 and 6.376) were end-labeled with32P using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 bacteriophage polynucleotide kinase to ≥1 × 109 dpm/μg and purified by centrifugation through Chroma Spin columns (CLONTECH). Primers (≈1 × 105dpm/assay) were hybridized to poly(A)+ RNA (10 μg) from each group for 16 h at 42 °C in 40 mm PIPES, 1 mmEDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, and 40% formamide. The primer-annealed RNA was then precipitated and dissolved in 1 μl of deionized water prior to extension using AMV-reverse transcriptase (25 units, Promega) in 10 μl of 1× AMV-reverse transcriptase buffer (Promega) containing 0.2 mm each dNTP, RNasin (20 units, Promega), and 0.5 μg of actinomycin D. The products were analyzed on a 7 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. A 32P-labeled riboprobe corresponding to the antisense strand of the sequence between the XbaI and PstI sites (positions −337 and +12 with respect to the UGT1A7 translation start) was synthesized in a reaction containing NotI-linearized p340XP (0.25 μg), 1× riboprobe synthesis buffer (supplied by Promega), 10 mmdithiothreitol, RNAsin (20 units), ATP/GTP/UTP (5 mm each), [α-32P]CTP (50 μCi, 12 μm), and T7 RNA polymerase (20 units, Promega) in a total volume of 20 μl for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was treated with RQ1 DNase (2 units, Promega) for 30 min, and the riboprobe was purified by centrifugation through a spin column (5′ → 3′, Inc., Boulder, CO). Riboprobe (5 × 105 cpm) was mixed with yeast tRNA, control rat liver RNA, or oltipraz-treated rat liver RNA (10 or 50 μg) in 50 μl containing 40 mm PIPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, and 40 or 80% formamide. The samples were treated with 300 μl of RNase (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml RNase T1, 40 μg/ml RNase A) for 30 or 60 min. After digestion with proteinase K (100 μg/tube), the products were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated prior to analysis on a 7m urea, 8% acrylamide, 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA gel. The procedure used for hepatic nuclei isolation was based on that of Lee et al. (20Lee K.L. Isham K.R. Johnson A. Kenney F.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 3/group) were euthanized 12 h after treatment with a single dose of either vehicle (30% polyethylene glycol-1450, 3 ml/kg, intragastric), oltipraz (90 mg/ml suspension, 3 ml/kg, intragastric), or β-naphthoflavone (12 mg/ml in corn oil, 5 ml/kg, intraperitoneal). Livers were perfused in situ with 50 ml of ice-cold 0.9% saline and removed, and 3-g samples were minced into small pieces with scissors in 3 volumes of 0.3m sucrose in Buffer A (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a brief homogenization using a Polytron homogenizer (set on low speed), samples were completely homogenized in 50-ml Potter-Elvjeham glass homogenizing tubes with a drill-driven Teflon pestle (three passes), and nuclei were then isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described. The final nuclear pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 40% glycerol, and stored in aliquots of 200 μl at −70 °C. Nuclei concentrations were between 20 and 26 × 106nuclei/200 μl. For nuclear runoff assays, nuclei were thawed, mixed with 50 μl of a 5× buffer containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.75 m KCl, 12.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 100 μCi [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. RQ1 DNase (10 units) was added, and reactions were incubated for an additional 5 min. Yeast tRNA (50 μg) was then added, and labeled nascent RNA was isolated by the method of Fei and Drake (21Fei H. Drake T.A. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 838PubMed Google Scholar). RNA (8 × 106 cpm) was hybridized to Nytran membranes containing 5 μg of immobilized,XhoI-linearized pRBA-6, pHCYP1A1B5, pLC14 +9/+697, and pSK+ in 7 ml of 10 mm Tris-ethane sulfonic acid, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS for 48 h at 65 °C. Membranes were washed and exposed to film (7-day exposure at −80 °C with medium intensifying screen) and then to a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging cassette (1 day). Exposure were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Northern analyses of total RNA isolated from liver tissue (0.3 g) or primary rat hepatocytes (8 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) was carried out as described (8Kessler F.K. Ritter J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Probes were prepared from DNA inserts purified by low melting point agarose electrophoresis and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (8 × 105) isolated from collagenase-perfused livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats were plated on gelatin-coated plastic tissue culture dishes (35 mm), and 6 h later, the medium was removed and cells were washed once with serum-free medium (Williams E containing 0.6 μg/ml insulin, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 1 μm dexamethasone, fungizone, and gentamicin). LipofectinTM (7.5 μg/dish) mixed with reporter plasmid (1.5 μg) in 1.5 ml of serum-free medium was then added to the plate. After overnight (≥12 h) incubation in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh serum-free medium containing the inducing agents at the indicated concentration. Twenty-four h later, the medium was again removed and replaced with fresh inducer-containing medium. Cells were harvested at 48 h following the start of drug treatment. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a Berthold Lumat LB9501 luminometer. To investigate the mechanism of the inducer-associated increases in liver UGT1A7 mRNA level, nuclear runoff assays were carried out using nuclei isolated from rats 12 h after treatment with vehicle (30% polyethylene glycol), 250 mg/kg oltipraz or 80 mg/kg β-naphthoflavone. The Northern analysis of β-actin, cytochrome P4501A, and UGT1A7 transcripts at this time point is shown in Fig. 1 A. Quantitation by phosphorimaging showed that oltipraz and β-naphthoflavone elevated the CYP1A mRNA 10- and 173-fold, respectively, and the UGT1A7 mRNA 19- and 43-fold. β-actin RNA levels were only slightly affected (2.5- and 2.8-fold for oltipraz and β-naphthoflavone, respectively). A representative autoradiograph from a nuclear runoff assay (using nuclei from animals 2, 6, and 8) is shown in Fig. 1 B. In the vehicle control, the rate of β-actin mRNA synthesis was the highest of the three mRNAs assayed and was not affected by either oltipraz or β-naphthoflavone treatment. In contrast, transcriptional rates of CYP1A and UGT1A7 were significantly increased by each agent. When signal intensities were corrected for background binding to vector alone, the oltipraz and β-naphthoflavone treatments produced increases of 4.4- and 29-fold for CYP1A1 and 3.7- and 8.4-fold for UGT1A7, respectively (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained in a second nuclear runoff analysis using nuclei from animals 3, 5, and 9. These results indicate that the increases in mRNA level are due primarily to increased rates of mRNA synthesis. To learn more about the mechanism(s), we isolated four genomic DNA clones from the UGT1A7/UGT1A6 locus using 5′ fragments of the UGT1A6 and/or LC14 cDNAs as probes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The overlap relationships of these clones (designated λRPT6, λRPT12, λRPT19, and λVIP14) was determined by restriction site mapping of XhoI,BamHI, and EcoRI sites (Fig. 2 A) together with Southern analysis. Two of the clones, λRPT6 and λVIP14, hybridized with both the UGT1A6 and LC14 probes. Together the cloned inserts form a contig of ≈27 kb. A detailed restriction map is included in Fig. 2 B to establish the identity of the DNA investigated in this study. In agreement with the report of Emi et al. (3Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the UGT1A6-amino-terminal coding exon was localized to a 5.1-kbp internalEcoRI fragment of λRPT6 immediately 5′ of two smallEcoRI fragments (0.5 and 0.9 kb). The UGT1A6*leader exon was localized by the presence of HindIII,PvuII, and HindIII sites 2 kb 5′, 0.1 kb 5′, and 0.3 kb 3′ of the EcoRI site in the exon, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The UGT1A7 exon was localized in clones λRPT6 and λVIP14 by Southern analysis with pLC14 (+9/697) insert, which revealed an exon with an internal BamHI site mapping 1.4 and 2.0 kb from the termini of λRPT6 and λVIP14, respectively. Consistent with its identity as the LC14 origin, the exon also contained a PvuII and a PstI site 0.25 and 0.44 kb, respectively, upstream of the BamHI site. To establish this conclusively, the 1.4-kbXhoI-BamHI fragment at the terminus of λRPT-6 was cloned (p1.4XB) and sequenced (Fig. 3; 1499 bp total). The 3′-486-bp sequence extending from the BamHI site were identical to the LC14 5′ end. To define the UGT1A7 transcription unit, we carried out primer extension and RNase protection experiments. For primer extension, two antisense primers, 6.375 and 6.376, with an offset of 32 bases, were utilized for analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from the livers of vehicle-, oltipraz-, and β-naphthoflavone-treated rats. The results are presented in Fig. 4. As expected, the products were only visible in samples from inducer-treated animals, especially with β-naphthoflavone. In these samples, similar ladders of extension products with the expected length differential of 32 bases were seen. In both reactions, the longest product maps to a guanosine residue at position −85 from the translation start codon. This residue is designated as base +1 in Fig. 3 and maps 11 bases upstream of the first base in one of the cDNA clones isolated from RALA255–10G LCS-3 cDNA library (clone LC11). To determine whether the multiple bands corresponded to multiple transcription start points or were due to artifacts in the extension reaction, we carried out RNase protection analysis using a radiolabeled riboprobe corresponding to the region between the XbaI and PstI sites at −337 and +12 with respect to the start of translation. The results are shown in Fig. 5 A. A ladder of bands corresponding to more than 30 different protection products were observed in all the lanes with oltipraz-treated RNA samples, whereas relatively few bands were detected in the vehicle sample. Using a T3-primed pSK+ sequencing reaction to estimate the 5′ site of initiation, we observed a good correlation between the data generated by primer extension analyses and RNase protection (Fig. 5 B) including bases where transcription is initiated and their relative intensity (abundance). Five distinct clusters of start sites between the guanosine at −85 and a cytosine at −40 were evident in the oltipraz sample, with the major cluster being group D. In the control rat sample, start sites in group D also predominated, with a few detected in group C and none in the remaining clusters. These results strongly suggest that multiple transcription start points are utilized for rat UGT1A7 transcription. They also show conclusively that transcription begins in a region immediately flanking the UGT1A7 coding exon and rule out the existence of a noncoding UGT1A7 leader exon exon analogous toUGT1A6* (Fig. 2). In view of the proximity of UGT1A7 and UGT1A6 and their common regulation, it was of interest to compare the sequences of the two promoter regions. No obvious tracts of homology or identity were observed in the proximal promoter region (only bases −400 to −1 of the UGT1A6 promoter were reported). The low identity is consistent with the low overall similarity of the UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 amino-terminal sequences, indicating a fairly distant evolutionary relationship. Similar to UGT1A6, however, UGT1A7contains sequences closely matching known CCAAT enhancer-binding protein and hepatic nuclear factor 3-binding sites (Fig. 3). Analysis of the mechanism(s) of the inducer-mediated increases in UGT1A7 transcription requires an appropriate cellular model. Previous studies carried out with an immortalized SV40-transformed adult rat hepatocyte cell line (RALA LCS) indicated high constitutive UGT1A7 mRNA expression compared with in vivo expression. Fig. 6 compares the in vivo and in vitro responses to Ah receptor agonists and oltipraz at the level of mRNA. The low constitutive expression of UGT1A7 mRNA observed in vivo in livers of untreated rats (Fig. 6, lane 4) is maintained in untreated primary rat hepatocytes (lane 1). Treatment with aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists and with oltipraz leads to a strong stimulation of UGT1A7 mRNA both in vivo (Fig. 6,lanes 6 and 5, respectively) and in primary hepatocytes (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). β-Actin mRNA was highly expressed both in vivo and in hepatocytes in vitro but was not affected by either treatment. Some qualitative differences were observed in the constitutive expression and inducibility of the CYP1A RNAs as detected using the human CYP1A probe. Compared with in vivo, oltipraz was not as effective at inducing the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs in primary hepatocytes in vitro. Overall, the data lend support for the usefulness of primary rat hepatocytes as a cellular"
https://openalex.org/W1997293521,"The vacuolar type proton-translocating ATPase of clathrin-coated vesicles is composed of two large domains: an extramembranous catalytic sector and a transmembranous proton channel. In addition, two polypeptides of 50 and 57 kDa have been found to co-purify with the pump. These proteins, termed SFD (sub-fifty-eight-kDadimer) activate ATPase activity of the enzyme and couple ATPase activity to proton flow (Xie, X.-S., Crider, B.P., Ma, Y.-M., and Stone, D. K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28509–25815). It has also been reported that the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump contains AP50, a 50-kDa component of the AP-2 complex responsible for the assembly of clathrin-coated pits, and that AP50 is essential for function of the proton pump (Liu, Q., Feng, Y., and Forgac, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 31592–31597). We demonstrate through the use of anti-AP50 antibody, identical to that of the latter study, that hydroxylapatite chromatography removes AP50 from impure proton pump preparations and that purified proton pump, devoid of AP50, is fully functional.To determine the true molecular identity of SFD, both the 50- and 57-kDa polypeptides were directly sequenced. A polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was used to screen a bovine brain cDNA library, yielding independent full-length clones (SFD-4A and SFD-21); these were identical in their open reading frames and encoded a protein with a predicted mass of 54,187 Da. The SFD-21 clone was then used in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-based strategy to isolate a related, but distinct, transcript present in bovine brain mRNA. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of this isolate are identical to SFD-21 except that the isolate contains a 54-base pair insert in the open reading frame, resulting in a protein with a predicted mass of 55,933 Da. Both clones had 16% identity toVMA13 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. No sequence homology between the SFD clones and AP50 was detectable. Anti-peptide antibodies were generated against an epitope common to the two proteins and to the unique 18-amino acid insert of the larger protein. The former reacted with both components of native SFD, whereas the latter reacted only with the 57-kDa component. We term the 57- and 50-kDa polypeptides SFDα and SFDβ, respectively.

It has also been reported that the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump contains AP50, a 50-kDa component of the AP-2 complex responsible for the assembly of clathrin-coated pits, and that AP50 is essential for function of the proton pump (Liu, Q., Feng, Y., and Forgac, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 31592–31597). We demonstrate through the use of anti-AP50 antibody, identical to that of the latter study, that hydroxylapatite chromatography removes AP50 from impure proton pump preparations and that purified proton pump, devoid of AP50, is fully functional. To determine the true molecular identity of SFD, both the 50- and 57-kDa polypeptides were directly sequenced. A polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was used to screen a bovine brain cDNA library, yielding independent full-length clones (SFD-4A and SFD-21); these were identical in their open reading frames and encoded a protein with a predicted mass of 54,187 Da. The SFD-21 clone was then used in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-based strategy to isolate a related, but distinct, transcript present in bovine brain mRNA. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of this isolate are identical to SFD-21 except that the isolate contains a 54-base pair insert in the open reading frame, resulting in a protein with a predicted mass of 55,933 Da. Both clones had 16% identity toVMA13 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. No sequence homology between the SFD clones and AP50 was detectable. Anti-peptide antibodies were generated against an epitope common to the two proteins and to the unique 18-amino acid insert of the larger protein. The former reacted with both components of native SFD, whereas the latter reacted only with the 57-kDa component. We term the 57- and 50-kDa polypeptides SFDα and SFDβ, respectively. Vacuolar, or V-type, proton translocating ATPases are found in diverse eukaryotic endomembrane compartments and plasma membranes of epithelia, macrophages, and specialized polarized cells. Their functional roles reflect this broad distribution and range from processing receptor-ligand complexes in endosomes to osteoclast-mediated bone dissolution (1Stone D.K. Xie X.-S.

Preparations of the proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles contain at least nine proteins of 116, 70, 58, 57, 50, 40, 39, 34, and 33 kDa, as well as four smaller polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 10–17 kDa (4Xie X.-S.

This polypeptide composition is similar to that of most V-type pumps, reflecting intense phylogenetic conservation (8Kane P.M. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg.

Functional domains of the coated vesicle proton pump include VB, 1The abbreviations used are: VB, the bafilomycin-sensitive proton channel of V-type proton pumps; VC, the peripheral, catalytic sector of V-type proton pumps; bp, base pair; C12E9, polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether; HTP, hydroxylapatite; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SFD (sub-fifty-eight-kDadimer), the 50–57-kDa polypeptide heterodimer required for function of the vacuolar proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. a proton channel that is probably composed of the 116-, 39-, and 17-kDa components (5Crider B.P. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and VC, the catalytic sector of the complex consisting of a set of polypeptides of 70, 58, 40, 34, 33, 15, 14, and 10 kDa (6Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Separation of VC from the holoenzyme results in marked changes in enzyme activity; although native enzyme hydrolyzes Mg-ATP at a rate 3-fold higher than Ca-ATP, isolated VC can hydrolyze ATP in the presence of Ca2+, but not Mg2+, and cannot support ATP-driven, vectorial proton movement (7Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reassembled purified VB and VC to yield a complex with Mg-ATPase and proton pumping activities similar to those of native enzyme. Essential to this reconstitution was a heretofore unrecognized 50–57-kDa polypeptide heterodimer, which we termed SFD, forsub-fifty-eight-kDa dimer (6Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Others recently reported that the 50-kDa subunit of the AP-2 clathrin assembly complex is present in their preparation of the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump and that AP50 might function as a kinase, catalyzing autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of the 58-kDa subunit of the pump (13Meyers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9184-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that AP50 was essential for the function and assembly of the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump (14Liu Q. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31592-31597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although such an interaction could explain the basis whereby endomembrane acidification is regulated by an organellar specific mechanism, these reports are not easily reconciled with the prior demonstrations that AP-2 (and its component, AP50) is found only in plasma membrane-associated clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (15Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,16Phan H.L. Finlay J.A. Chu D.S. Tan P.K. Kirchhausen T. Payne G.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1706-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and that clathrin-coated vesicles associated with the plasma membrane cannot acidify their interiors (17Fuchs R. Ellinger A. Pavelka M. Mellman I. Klapper H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4811-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,18Anderson R.G.W. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 529-543Google Scholar). 2Acidification activity in clathrin-coated vesicle preparations probably arises from Golgi-derived clathrin-coated vesicles, which are associated with AP-1 (17Fuchs R. Ellinger A. Pavelka M. Mellman I. Klapper H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4811-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Anderson R.G.W. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 529-543Google Scholar). To investigate this point, and to identify the 50- and 57-kDa polypeptides of SFD and their role(s) in pump function, we studied the possible relationship of the 50-kDa component of SFD to AP50. Recently, we reported that phosphorylation of 50- and 58-kDa polypeptides was observed only with impure clathrin-coated vesicle pump preparations and that purified pump required SFD for function but lacked any kinase activity (6Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (This observation, however, did not exclude the possibility that the 50-kDa component of SFD is AP50, since the primary structure of the latter (19Thurrieau C. Brosius J. Burne C. Jolles P. Keen J.H. Madeleine R.J. Chow E.P. Ramachandran K.L. Kirchhausen T. DNA. 1988; 7: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) lacks any known nucleotide binding motif, and its role as a kinase is conjectural.) We now demonstrate that AP50 itself is not a component of the purified clathrin-coated vesicle pump; nor is it required for ATP-driven proton translocation. Through direct protein sequencing and molecular cloning, we show that the 50- and 57-kDa components of SFD are highly related proteins that probably arise through an alternative splicing mechanism. These subunits are termed SFDα (57 kDa) and SFDβ (50 kDa). They share 16% identity to a 54-kDa polypeptide of the yeast vacuolar proton pump encoded by the VMA13 gene (20Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No homology, however, exists between these proteins and AP50 or any AP isoforms. These studies demonstrate that SFD, and not AP50, is required for function of the vacuolar-type proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles. Isolation of clathrin-coated vesicles from bovine brains (21Nandi P.K. Irace G. Van Jaarsveld P.O. Lippoldt R.E. Edelhoch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5881-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and preparations of liposomes from purified lipids (22Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8913-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were performed as reported. Purification of the proton-translocating ATPase of clathrin-coated vesicles was performed by sequential solubilization with C12E9, hydroxylapatite (HTP) chromatography, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, and glycerol gradient centrifugations (4Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2492-2495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); purified H+-ATPase had a specific activity of 14–16 μmol Pi·mg protein−1·min−1. Purified proton pump was depleted of SFD by treatment with Zwittergent 3-16, followed by glycerol gradient centrifugation, as reported (6Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified AP-2 (μ2) complex from rat brain and chicken anti-AP50 (μ2) IgY were the generous gifts of Dr. Thomas Kirchhausen (Harvard University). Goat anti-chicken IgY antibody was obtained from Pierce, HTP (Bio-GEL HTP) was from Bio-Rad; restriction enzymes, T4 DNA sequencing ligase, and a nick translation kit were from Boehringer Mannheim; DNA sequencing reagents and enzymes and the GeneAmp PCR reagent kit were from Perkin-Elmer; Escherichia coli strains XL1-Blue and BB4 and helper phages R408 were from Stratagene; radioactive reagents were from Amersham Corp.; nitrocellulose membranes for plaque lift were from Millipore Corp.; and chemicals for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad. A bovine brain cDNA library was the generous gift of Dr. Richard Dixon, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. The sources of other materials used in this study have been identified previously (3Mattsson J.P. Schlesinger P.H. Keeling D.J. Teitelbaum S.L. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2492-2495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Crider B.P. Xie X.-S.

About 200 pmol of each of the 50- and 57-kDa components of SFD were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide), and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride filters, from which the 50- and 57-kDa polypeptide bands were excised, and digested with trypsin or LysCin situ (23Fernandez J. Demlott M. Aatherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Released peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a 2.1 × 150-mm RP300 column from Perkin-Elmer and were subjected to automated Edman degradation using a model 477A amino acid sequencer from Applied Biosystems with the manufacturer's standard program and chemicals. To obtain a DNA probe for screening a bovine cDNA library, four rounds of PCR were performed. The first PCR was carried out with a bovine cDNA library as template, using two primers (I, 5′-GCIGCIGCIGT(T/C)TGIGG(T/C)TG(T/C)TC-3′; II, 5′-GTIATIGAICA(G/A)(C/T)TIGGIGGIAA-3′) based upon primary peptide sequence. After 30 cycles of PCR, this reaction generated one dominant band of ∼500 bp, but sequencing revealed that this arose from primer I annealing to two separate sites in a transcript that did not encode amino acids flanking those used to design primer I. Under the premise that a genuine, relevant PCR product had also been produced (at a much lower copy number than the ∼500-bp product), a second PCR reaction was performed. The reaction mix was diluted 100-fold, and 1 μl of the diluted reaction mixture was used as template in this second PCR reaction using primer II and primer III (III, 5′-TATTCCCA(A/G)TT(A/G)TGIACCATIA(A/G)(T/C)TT-3′) that was designed according to an expressed sequence tag clone (TO6491) identified by screening expressed sequence tag data bases with peptide sequences obtained from the direct sequencing of the 50-kDa component of SFD. This second round of PCR amplified a 120-bp fragment. To generate a larger DNA fragment suitable for cDNA library screening, the sequence of the 120-bp fragment was used to design two additional primers (IV, 5′-AGACTGGAGTTGTTTACCAAGATA-3′; V, 5′-CTTCTGTACAGCCAGGAGGGCGTT-3′). Primer IV and T3 promotor primer were used in the third round of PCR, using bovine brain cDNA library as template. The reaction mix was diluted 100-fold, and 1 μl of the diluted reaction mixture was used as template in the final round of PCR using primer V and T3 promotor primer. This round of PCR generated an 856-bp fragment that was used to screen the library. The 856-bp PCR fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation and used to screen a bovine brain cDNA library in λZAP, which had been transfected into E. coli strain BB4. Plaques were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by a double-lift procedure (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). The membranes were then prehybridized for at least 4 h at 60 °C in a solution containing 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS. Hybridization was performed at 60 °C overnight with the same solution plus labeled probe, which was added at a concentration of 5–10 × 105 cpm/ml of hybridization solution. Duplicate positive clones were rescreened through one or more cycles until purified plaques were obtained. About 1.3 × 106 independent clones were screened, yielding two independent, full-length clones, SFD-4A and SFD-21. Based upon the sequences of SFD-4A and SFD-21, two primers were synthesized (VI, 5′-TCCTCCTGCCTCTTCTGGATC-3′; and VII, 5′-GGTCTTCTATCCCAGGTGACT-3′) and used for RT-PCR. In brief, 0.1 mg of bovine brain poly(A+) mRNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)16 as primer. SFD coding sequences were then amplified by PCR using primers VI and VII. Two fragments were amplified and were subsequently TA-cloned (24Clark J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9677-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), using an Invitrogen TA cloning kit and the manufacturer's protocol. Four full-length clones, SFD-RT1, -2, -3, and -4, resulted from this approach. Sequencing of SFD-RT1, -2, -3, and -4 was carried out with ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase and subjected to sequencing analysis using a model 377 ABI PRISM DNA Sequencer. The positive clones were fully sequenced in both orientations using T7promotor, M13 reverse sequencing primers, and sequence-specific oligonucleotides as primers. DNA and protein data base searches were performed using PC GENE and the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package. Clones SFD-RT1, -2, and -3 were identical and were subsequently shown to encode the 50-kDa polypeptide of SFD, which we term SFDβ. SFD-RT4 encoded the related 57-kDa polypeptide of SFD, which we term SFDα. A peptide common to the predicted translations of SFDα and SFDβ (CEMKRSPEEKQEMLQTEGS) and an SFDα-specific peptide (CKLRGSGVTAETGTUSSSD) were synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used for immunization of New Zealand White rabbits (3Mattsson J.P. Schlesinger P.H. Keeling D.J. Teitelbaum S.L. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielding Q48 and Q50 antisera, respectively. For Western blot analysis, protein samples were separated by 11% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper. Immunodetection was performed using immune serum at a 1:5,000 dilution and an Amersham ECL Western blotting system. Immunoblot protocols using rabbit polyclonal anti-70-kDa subunit antibody (1:5,000 dilution) have been described previously (3Mattsson J.P. Schlesinger P.H. Keeling D.J. Teitelbaum S.L. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-rat AP50 (μ2) IgY from chicken was used at a 1:20,000 dilution, and secondary antibody (goat, anti-chicken IgY) was used at a 1:40,000 dilution. Rabbit polyclonal anti-39-kDa antiserum was generated against recombinant bovine brain 39-kDa polypeptide. This antiserum was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Protein determination (25Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar) and SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar) were performed as reported. Partially purified proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles was reconstituted into liposomes prepared from pure lipids by the freeze-thaw, cholate dilution method, as reported (23Fernandez J. Demlott M. Aatherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Proton pumping was assessed by ATP-dependent quenching of acridine orange in an Aminco DW 2C dual wavelength spectrophotometer as ΔA492–540. Proteoliposomes (1.2 μg of protein) were diluted into 1.5 ml of assay buffer consisting of 150 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Na-Tricine (pH 7.0), and 7 μm acridine orange. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1.3 mm ATP and 1 μm valinomycin and were terminated with the addition of 1 μmbis-(hexafluoroacetonyl)acetone. Fig. 1 illustrates key preparations used to investigate the possible role of AP50 in function of the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump. SDS-PAGE (panel A), and immunoblot analysis (panel B) were performed using protein amounts chosen to achieve approximately equal staining of polypeptide(s) in the proximity of 50 kDa. As shown in panel B, AP50 is present in clathrin-coated vesicles (lane 1) but was not detected in partially purified pump after HTP chromatography (lane 2), fully purified pump (lane 3), or SFD (lane 4). As positive controls, the antibody is shown to react with the AP50 component of biochemically prepared μ2 complex (lane 5) and recombinant AP50 (lane 6); the latter has a slightly greater Mrthan native AP50 because of histidine residues and a factor Xa cleavage site at the amino terminus. The results of Fig. 1 indicate that AP50 was not present in our pump preparation after HTP chromatography. To further address this point, the distribution of polypeptides eluted during HTP chromatography was examined by SDS-PAGE, as shown in Fig. 2 A. Lanes 3–10show fractions sequentially eluted by a linear (0–300 mm) NaPi gradient, and lane 11 shows a fraction eluted by a 1 m NaPi wash performedafter the gradient. Also illustrated are Western blot analysis performed on the fractions of panel A, using antibodies directed against AP50 (panel B), the 70-kDa proton pump subunit (panel C), and the 39-kDa proton pump subunit (panel D). As shown (panel B), AP50 is not eluted by the standard gradient used to prepare proton pump (lanes 3–10) but was released by a 1 mNaPi step wash (lane 11). In contrast, proton pump components are effectively eluted by the 0–300 mmgradient, as indicated by the simultaneous elutions of the 70-kDa subunit of VC (panel C) and the 39-kDa component of VB (panel D) in lanes 3–7. Notably, neither peripheral (70-kDa) nor membrane-associated (39-kDa) components are eluted by the 1 m NaPi wash (panels C and D, lane 11), demonstrating full separation of the pump components and AP50. Next, the HTP elution fraction shown in Fig. 2, lane 5, was subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation. Resultant purified proton pump (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) that is devoid of AP50 (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) catalyzes a high rate of proton pumping after reconstitution into liposomes prepared from pure lipids (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that the 50-kDa component of the V-pump of clathrin-coated vesicles is not AP50, claims to the contrary (13Meyers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9184-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Liu Q. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31592-31597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) not withstanding. To determine the genuine molecular identity of the 50- and 57-kDa components of SFD, these polypeptides were purified and subjected to Edman degradation. Both were blocked at their amino termini, and internal peptides were generated by digestion with trypsin or LysC. After separation by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, Edman degradation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first indication of similarity of the 57- and 50-kDa polypeptides came from the pattern of peptides generated by trypsin digestion. As shown in Fig. 4, nearly identical elution profiles were obtained for the peptides derived from the 57- and 50-kDa polypeptides (panels A and B, respectively). Shown in Table I are the primary sequences obtained from analysis of tryptic and LysC-derived peptides. Notably, sequences obtained from peaks (T2 and T8) of the 57- and 50-kDa polypeptides were identical. Comparison of these sequences with those of data bases revealed that there was no significant sequence homology except for T1, which showed identity with a human expressed sequence tag (TO6491).Table ISequences of tryptic and Lys C peptides of the 57- and 50-kDa subunits of SFDPeptideSequence (designation)AmountpmolTrypsin 57 kDaQLQSEQPQTAAAR (T1)7SVIEQLGGK (T2)14LGESVQDLSSF (T8) 50 kDaSVIEQLGGK (T2)14LGESVQDLSSFADYS (T8)3Lys-C 50 kDaLLEVSRDPQVLAVAAHDVGEYVRHYPV (L22)10 Open table in a new tab As outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” the primary sequences of the peptides prepared from the 50- and 57-kDa polypeptides were used to generate an 856-bp PCR product that was then used to probe a bovine brain cDNA library; ultimately, two independent, full-length clones (SFD4 and SDF 21) were isolated. The sequence of SFD21, its predicted amino acid sequence, and alignment with the peptides of T1, T2, T8, and L22 are shown in Fig. 5. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide composed of 465 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 54,187 Da. Because of the apparent homology found by direct sequencing of the 50- and 57-kDa subunits of SFD, we sought to clone a second cDNA that might encode the other of the two polypeptides. As outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” a PCR-based approach ultimately yielded four clones (SFD-RT1, -2, -3, and -4) from bovine brain poly(A)-enriched mRNA. Of these, SFD-RT1, -2, and -3 were identical to one another and to SFD21. SFD-RT4, however, had a sequence identical to SFD21, except that it contained a 54-bp insert, resulting in a protein composed of 483 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55,933 Da. The nucleotide sequence of SFD-RT4 is compared with that of SFD21 in Fig. 5. As shown, these sequences are identical in both the coding and noncoding regions, save the 54-bp insert at nucleotide position 727 of SFD21. The predicted amino acid alignments of SFD-RT4, and SFD21 are of course identical, except for the putative 18-amino acid insert at position 175 (Fig. 6). Based on the differences in mass of the predicated proteins encoded by SFD-RT4 and SFD-21, we presumed that these were equivalent to the 57- and 50-kDa components of SFD, respectively. Provisionally, we assume that these two proteins are isoforms, and we term the product of SFD-RT4 (and the 57-kDa polypeptide) SFDα and the product of SFD-21 (and the 50-kDa polypeptide) SFDβ. 3The predicted masses of SFDα and SFDβ are in approximate accord with molecular radii based upon electrophoretic mobility. At present, we have no evidence of postranslational modification of either species. Data bank searches revealed that SFD polypeptides have 53% (gene T14F9.1) and 40% (gene F52E1.10) identity to probable homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, 23% identity to a probable homologue (gene SPAC7D4.10) in Schizisaccharomyces pombe, and 16% identity to a 54-kDa subunit of the vacuolar proton pump of S. cerevisiae that is encoded by the VMA13 gene (20Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); alignments of the predicted amino acid sequences of these proteins with SFDα and SFDβ are shown in Fig. 6. To further establish the relationship of these two polypeptides to SFD, we generated antibodies to synthetic peptides predicted from the translated nucleotide sequences of the 57- and 50-kDa components of SFD. The first of these, Q48, was generated against an epitope common to SFDα and -β, while the second, Q50, was generated against the predicted unique 18-amino acid insert present in SFDα. Shown in Fig. 7 are the results of Western blot analysis using these antibodies. As shown, antiserum directed against the common epitope (Q48) reacts with both the 57- and 50-kDa subunits present in holoenzyme (panel B, lane 1) and in purified SFD (panel B, lane 3). In contrast, antibody Q50, directed against the unique 18-amino acid insert of SFDα, reacts only with the 57-kDa component of purified pump (panel C, lane 1) and SFD (panel C,lane 3). Neither antiserum reacted with V-pump that had been selectively depleted of SFD (panels B and C,lane 2). The results of this study demonstrate that the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump is highly active in the absence of AP50 (Fig. 3) and that SFDα and -β are distinct from AP50. It is important to note that these conclusions are in part based on the use of the identical antibody used in the previous reports (13Meyers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9184-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that AP50 was required for function of the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump. We believe differences between our results and those published previously are in part due to variations in the methods of preparation of active H+-ATPase from clathrin-coated vesicles that were employed in the two studies. Purification of the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump, in our hands, is achieved by an extended protocol consisting of solubilization of stripped clathrin-coated vesicle membranes with C12E9, followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min, HTP chromatography, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, and glycerol gradient centrifugation. Enzyme, thus prepared, has a specific activity of 14–16 μmol Pi·mg protein−1·min−1 and is dependent upon phospholipid (optimally, phosphatidylserine) for activation of ATPase activity, and liposomes for reconstitution of proton pump activity (4Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2492-2495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, reports of the role of AP50 in the function of clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump were based on studies of enzyme prepared by an abbreviated version of our protocol. The isolation protocol of these studies (13Meyers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9184-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Liu Q. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31592-31597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) consisted of treating stripped vesicles with C12E9, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, and glycerol gradient centrifugation. The resultant preparation has a specific activity of 6 μmol Pi·mg protein−1·min−1. It is thus possible that the preparation of proton pump used by others was contaminated with AP50 and that their attempts to directly sequence the 50-kDa component yielded residues from the amino terminus of AP50, but not SFDβ, which was not susceptible to amino terminus sequencing in our hands. Other claims regarding the role of AP50 in pump structure and function, such as the reported stoichiometry of about 1 mol of AP50/mol of proton pump (13Meyers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9184-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Liu Q. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31592-31597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) remain inexplicable. In particular, the report that the AP2 complex is itself fundamentally required for both pump activity and the reassembly of dissociated proton pump components (14Liu Q. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31592-31597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is in direct conflict with the previous biochemical (6Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and current molecular characterizations of SFD from our laboratory. Irrespective of these points, it is clear that inclusion of HTP chromatography as a pump purification step results in separation of AP50 from fully functional enzyme (see above); thus, we find no support for the notion (14Liu Q. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31592-31597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that AP50 is required for acidification catalyzed by the proton pump of clathrin-coated vesicles. Molecular cloning of the components of SFDα and -β demonstrates that they differ only by a 54-bp “insert” present in the former. Because of nucleotide identity at all other positions, including noncoding regions at the 3′- and 5′-ends of the clones, it is most likely that this difference in sequences is due to alternative splicing, as has been shown for a number of V-pump subunits. It is further possible that SFDα and SFDβ are isoforms. Biochemical studies will be required to determine if there are requirements for both components in the function of a single pump or whether a single form is sufficient for function. Sequence homology of SFDα and -β with the VMA13 product (20Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) underscores the apparent similarity in function of these components in V-pumps from bovine brain and yeast, respectively. Specifically, SFD was shown to activate Mg-ATPase activity of the V-pump of clathrin-coated vesicles and to functionally couple ATP hydrolysis to proton flow. Also, V-pump selectively depleted of SFD remains intact but cannot support proton pumping (6Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.-M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These characteristics are highly similar to those observed in VMA13 knock-out experiments, where it was found that the V-pump of yeast vacuoles, although assembled, was inactive with regard to ATPase and proton pumping activities (20Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-specific regulation of V-pump activity is an issue of broad interest that relates to the maintenance and generation of different pH gradients in organelles of the constitutive trafficking pathways and to the role that this interorganelle pH gradient plays in targeting nascent proteins to their ultimate cellular destinations. Although it is possible that AP50 and V-type proton pumps interact to produce some currently undefined function, our data refute the notion that AP50 is an organelle-specific regulator of V-pump function and specifically demonstrate that AP50 is not required for pump activity. We thus are focused on determining the molecular characteristics of SFD and its role in the function of V-type proton pumps."
https://openalex.org/W2074455385,"Cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) is abundantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller cells of the retina, where it is thought to function in retinoid metabolism and visual pigment regeneration. Mutations in human CRALBP that destroy retinoid binding have been linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. To identify the DNA elements that regulate expression of the human CRALBP gene in the RPE, transient transfection studies were carried out with three CRALBP-expressing human RPE cell culture systems. The regions from −2089 to −1539 base pairs and from −243 to +80 base pairs demonstrated positive regulatory activity. Similar activity was not observed with cultured human breast, liver, or skin cells. Since sequence analysis of the −243 to +80 region identified the presence of two photoreceptor consensus element-1 (PCE-1) sites, elements that have been implicated in photoreceptor gene regulation, the role of these sequences in RPE expression was examined. Mutation of either PCE-1 site significantly reduced reporter activity, and mutation or deletion of both sites dramatically reduced activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis with RPE nuclear extracts revealed two complexes that required intact PCE-1 sites. These studies also identified two identical sequences (GCAGGA) flanking PCE-1, termed the binding CRALBP element (BCE), that are also important for complex formation. Southwestern analysis with PCE-1/BCEcontaining probes identified species with apparent masses near 90–100 and 31 kDa. These results begin to identify the regulatory regions required for RPE expression of CRALBP and suggest that PCE-1-binding factor(s) may play a role in regulating RPE as well as photoreceptor gene expression.

The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 1The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; CRALBP, cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein; PCE, photoreceptor consensus element; BCE, binding CRALBP element; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; SW, Southwestern. 1The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; CRALBP, cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein; PCE, photoreceptor consensus element; BCE, binding CRALBP element; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; SW, Southwestern. is a polarized monolayer of cells between the photoreceptors and choroid of the eye. Its primary function is maintaining and nourishing the rod and cone photoreceptor cells, including the synthesis of 11-cis-retinal for phototransduction (1Bok D. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1993; 17: 89-195Google Scholar). The critical importance of the RPE to the health of photoreceptors has been further illustrated by recent findings that mutations in either of two genes differentially and abundantly expressed in the RPE, namely the cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) and RPE-65, can cause early onset autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (2Maw M.A. Kennedy B.N.

The in vivo functions of CRALBP and RPE-65 have yet to be clarified; however, they are both thought to be involved in vitamin A metabolism. A retinal degeneration possibly associated with gene regulation in the RPE has been described for the vitiligo mouse; the vitiligo mouse exhibits genetic defects in transcription factor Mi and may also suffer from abnormal vitamin A metabolism (5Sidman R.L. Kosaras B. Tang M. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 1097-1115PubMed Google Scholar). CRALBP appears to serve as a substrate carrier protein in the mammalian visual cycle, modulating whether 11-cis-retinol is stored as an ester in the RPE or oxidized by 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase to 11-cis-retinal for visual pigment regeneration (6Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3106-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Saari J.C. Sporn M.A. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 351-385Google Scholar). The protein carries 11-cis-retinal and/or 11-cis-retinol as an endogenous ligand in the RPE and Müller cells of the retina (7Saari J.C. Sporn M.A. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 351-385Google Scholar). Notably, the R150Q CRALBP mutation linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa destroys the retinoid binding functionality of the protein (2Maw M.A. Kennedy B.N. Knight A. Bridges R. Roth K. Mani E. Mukkadan J. Nancarrow D. Crabb J.W. Denton M.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). CRALBP is also present in ciliary body, cornea, and transiently in iris, but not in rod and cone photoreceptors. Within the ciliary epithelium, an anterior to posterior gradient of CRALBP expression exists with more abundant expression in the pars plicata region relative to the pars plana region (8Martin-Alonso J.-M. Ghosh S. Hernando N. Crabb J.W. Coca-Prados M. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, CRALBP has been found in oligodendrocytes of the optic nerve and brain, but without retinoid ligands, and CRALBP is also expressed in glia cells of the pineal gland (9Saari J.L. Huang J. Possin D.E. Fariss R.N. Leonard J. Garwin G.G. Crabb J.W. Milam A.H. Glia. 1997; 21: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). During development, CRALBP is expressed in the rat RPE at E13 and in Müller cells at P1 (10De Leeuw A.M. Gaur V.P. Saari J.C. Milam A.H. J. Neurocytol. 1990; 19: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), before 11-cis-retinoids or the isomerase responsible for generating 11-cis-retinoids can be found in the RPE (9Saari J.L. Huang J. Possin D.E. Fariss R.N. Leonard J. Garwin G.G. Crabb J.W. Milam A.H. Glia. 1997; 21: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Apparently, the protein serves functions unrelated to visual pigment regeneration in brain and tissues not involved in the visual cycle and may bind ligands other than retinoids. Due to the apparent importance of CRALBP in the visual cycle, its role in retinal disease, and its usefulness as a model system for the study of RPE gene regulation, we have begun to explore the mechanisms controlling its expression in the RPE. The structure of RLBP1, the gene encoding human CRALBP, has been reported, including the transcription start site and 3130 bases of sequence from the 5′-flanking region (11Intres R. Goldflam S. Cook J.R. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25411-25418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is composed of eight exons, with untranslated regions in exons 1, 2, and 8, and is located on human chromosome 15q26 (12Sparkes R.S. Heinzmann C. Goldflam S. Kojis T. Saari J.C. Mohandas T. Klisak I. Bateman J.B. Crabb J.W. Genomics. 1992; 12: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previously, we noted the existence of two photoreceptor consensus elements between CRALBP gene positions −170 and −141 (5′-GAAGGCACTTAGGCAGGACATTTAGGCAGG-3′) (11Intres R. Goldflam S. Cook J.R. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25411-25418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The consensus sequence CAATTAG, designated PCE-1 in vertebrates and RCS-1 in Drosophila, has been identified in a number of mammalian retina-specific genes (e.g. arrestin, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, rhodopsin, and red and green opsin) and in Drosophila rhodopsin genes and has been proposed to direct photoreceptor cell-specific expression (13Kikuchi T. Raju K. Breitman M.L. Shinohara T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mutation of PCE-1 sites in gene constructs from the proximal promoters of arrestin (14Kikuchi T. Wawrousek E. Lee R. Di Camillo S. Kusuzaki K. Shinohara T. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1995; 36 (Abstr. 3566): S772Google Scholar) and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (15Bobola N. Hirsch E. Albini A. Altruda F. Noonan D. Ravazzolo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1289-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) also appears to significantly reduce photoreceptor reporter gene expression in transgenic mice. The PCE-1-rich region of the RLBP1 proximal promoter exhibits significant homology to the 26-bp Ret-1 element in the rat opsin gene, which has been reported to direct opsin expression in rod photoreceptors in vivo (16Yu X. Leconte L. Martinez J.A. Barnstable C.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2494-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, efforts have been initiated to determine the mechanisms controlling CRALBP cell-specific expression. The possibility was considered that PCE-1 might also regulate gene expression in the RPE, not just in photoreceptor cells. We report here transient transfection results, nuclear protein binding studies, and Southwestern analyses that suggest that PCE-1 influences CRALBP gene expression in the RPE. Early passage nontransformed human RPE cell cultures (17Campochiaro P.A. Hackett S.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen Co.) and, for some transfections, were grown on plates coated with Matrigel (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or bovine corneal endothelial cell matrix (17Campochiaro P.A. Hackett S.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The spontaneously immortalized human D407 RPE cell line (18Davis A.A. Bernstein P.S. Bok D. Turner T. Nachtigal M. Hunt R.C. Invest. Ophthalmol & Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 955-964PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 2% fetal bovine serum plus 210 mm Me2SO (Fluka). The nontransformed human ARPE-19 RPE cell line (19Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) was obtained as a gift from Dr. L. Hjelmeland (University of California, Davis, CA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human breast (MCF-7), human liver (HepG2), and human skin fibroblast transformed cell lines (available through the American Type Culture Collection) were grown in minimum Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human retinal tissue was obtained from Dr. Arthur Polans and the RS Dow Neurological Sciences Institute/Good Samaritan Hospital (Portland, OR). Extracts from RPE cell cultures and human retinas were prepared with Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors (25 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmbenzamidine), boiled for 4 min, electrophoresed on 12% gels according to Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with IgG-purified polyclonal anti-CRALBP peptide antibodies S17L, K25Q, and S31F as described previously (20Crabb J.W. Gaur V.P. Garwin G.G. Marx S.V. Chapline C. Johnson C.M. Saari J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16674-16683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that immunoreactivity was detected with the commercial enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). Human recombinant CRALBP (Mr = 36,343), used as a control, was produced in bacteria using the pET3a vector as described (21Crabb J.W. Chen Y. Goldflam S. West K. Kapron J. Redfern C. Methods in Molecular Biology. 89. Human Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 91-104Google Scholar). The protein concentration of cell extracts was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). RNA was isolated from RPE cell cultures using the RNAzol protocol (Cinna-Biotec), and first strand synthesis was performed using reverse transcriptase and the Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR of resulting cDNA templates was performed with a hot start at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The primers used were CCCTGACTTCCTATCCTAGG and CTTCTGCAAGGTGTGG, designed upon human CRALBP gene positions 823–842 and 1318–1333, respectively, and span intron 2 (gene position 935–1204). PCR products were evaluated by Southern analysis using a 241-bp 32P-labeled probe constructed by PCR using the human CRALBP cDNA as a template and the above primers. Promoter regions of RLBP1 were amplified by PCR from a 4.7-kb 5′-genomic subclone (11Intres R. Goldflam S. Cook J.R. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25411-25418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting products were ligated upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL2 vector (Promega). Seven wild-type CRALBP-luciferase reporter gene constructs were created based on size and orientation; wild-type constructs were designated 0.2, 0.3, 0.3R, 0.8, 1.6, 2.1, and 2.3, where R indicates reverse orientation and the number reflects the approximate size of the CRALBP promoter region in kilobases. The 3′-end of all the constructs was RLBP1position +80; the 5′-end varied as indicated under “Results.” Eight mutant CRALBP-luciferase reporter gene constructs were also created and are defined under “Results.” Mutant constructs containing 4–5 altered nucleotides in individual PCE sites were created with single-stranded DNA according to Kunkel et al. (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) and designated pce-dM (for mutation in the distal PCE at RLBP1positions −165 to −159) and pce-pM (for mutation in the proximal PCE at RLBP1 positions −152 to −146). Briefly, phosphorylated mutant oligonucleotides were annealed to single-stranded DNA prepared in Escherichia coli dut −,ung − CJ236 cells from the 0.3-kb wild-type reporter gene construct. The oligonucleotide primers and correspondingRLBP1 gene positions used to prepare pce-dM and pce-pM were−183GTGAAGGGTTCTTGAAGGCtgcagGGCAGGACATTTAGGCAG−142 and−167GGCACTTAGGCAGGAtcTgcAGGCAGGAGAGAAAACCTGG−128, respectively. These primers introduced a PstI restriction site in place of PCE-1, which facilitated screening of mutants and generation of pce-2M and pce-∂M. Second strand synthesis was performed with T4 polymerase, and the mutant plasmid was amplified in E. coli dut+, ung +DH5α cells. To create mutant constructs with altered bases in both PCE sites, complementary oligonucleotides containing the mutations were synthesized (69 and 61 nucleotides, respectively), annealed, and ligated into the 0.3pce-pM mutant construct following digestion withNcoI/PstI, yielding mutant construct 0.3pce-2M. To create a deletion mutant lacking both PCE sites, the 93-bp fragment excised from 0.3pce-pM by PstI digestion was ligated into 0.3pce-dM following PstI digestion, yielding mutant construct 0.3pce-∂M. NcoI/HindIII fragments from the 0.3-kb series of mutants were ligated into the 2.1-kb wild-type reporter gene construct followingNcoI/HindIII cleavage, yielding the corresponding 2.1-kb series of mutant constructs. The structures of all reporter constructs were verified by automated fluorescent DNA sequence analysis. Cells were transfected 12–24 h after plating in 6-well plates using either the LipofectAMINE/Lipofectin protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.) or the calcium phosphate procedure (23Kumar R. Chen S. Scheurer D. Wang Q.-L. Duh E. Sung C.-H. Rehemtulla A. Swaroop A. Adler R. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29612-29618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cell extracts and medium were assayed for reporter activity ∼48 h after transfection. Transfections of cells utilized 1.75 μg of reporter construct and 0.25 μg of pCMV-SEAP or pXGH5 control construct (Nichols Diagnostics, Inc.) to normalize transfection efficiency to secreted alkaline phosphatase or human growth hormone expression, respectively. Luciferase luminescence was quantified in cell extracts with an EC & G Berthold LB 96P luminometer in the presence of 210 mm coenzyme A. Protein concentration in cell extracts was determined using the BCA assay. For data interpretation, luciferase activity (relative luciferase units/μg of protein cell extract) was normalized to the internal control (secreted alkaline phosphatase or human growth hormone) to correct for variation in transfection efficiency, and results from separate experiments were averaged following normalization to the luciferase activity exhibited by the 2.1-kb wild-type construct. Nuclear extracts for EMSA were prepared essentially according to Andrews and Faller (24Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Bovine retinal tissue was obtained from JA & WL Lawson Co. (Lincoln NE); rat seminal vesicle extract was obtained from Dr. Martin Tenniswood (Adirondack Biomedical Research Institute, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, tissue (1 g) was homogenized in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm benzamidine. Following bench-top centrifugation (500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the pellet fraction was resuspended in 400 μl of cold 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine. For cell cultures, confluent cells were scraped into 1.5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min, and resuspended as described above. After a 10-min incubation on ice for lysis, cells were vortexed for 10 s, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 × g). For high salt extraction of nuclear proteins, pellets were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7), 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine and then centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was harvested. Protein concentration in cell extracts was determined using the BCA assay. Oligonucleotide probes (see Table I) were synthesized with 5′-overhangs and radioactively labeled by Klenow fill-in reactions (Promega). Nuclear extracts were incubated with a 2000-fold molar excess of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at room temperature for 10–30 min in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm EDTA, and 22% glycerol (plus unlabeled probe in competition assays) before adding 1–10 ng of labeled probe. After an additional 10–30-min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were stopped and electrophoresed on 4–6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography.Table IOligonucleotide probesWild-type CRALBP PCE42−175 gatcTTCTTGAAGGCACTTAG GCAGGA CATTTAG GCAGGAGA−138Wild-type CRALBP PCE29−167GGCACTTAG GCAGGA CATTTAG GCAGGAG−139PCE29-pce-2MGGCtgcagG GCAGGA tcTgcAG ACAGGAGpce29-bce-2MGGCACTTAGctgcagCATTTAGctgcagGPCE29-p&b-2MGGCtgcagGctgcagtcTgcAGctgcagGArrestin-42−41 gatcAAACAAGAAACAAAAGCTTTCAATTAGCTATTCCTCTC−4Clusterin−88 gatcTCTCTGGCGTGAGTCACGCAGGTT−65 Open table in a new tab Southwestern analysis was performed according to published methods (25Morabito M.A. Yu X.

Nuclear extract from human D407 RPE cells and prestained molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) on 8% gels under reducing conditions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (overnight at 4 °C using 50 mA of constant voltage), and the membrane was stained briefly with Ponceau S. Membrane-immobilized nuclear proteins were denatured in Southwestern (SW) buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 30 min at 4 °C and then slowly renatured. The renaturation process involved successive dilutions and incubations (2 × 15 min, 4 °C) in SW buffer, reducing the guanidine hydrochloride molarity to 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.38, and 0.18 and finally to zero. Following renaturation, the membranes was incubated for 4–6 h at 4 °C in SW buffer containing 5% nonfat dried milk. For binding studies, replicate lanes of the blot were cut into vertical strips and incubated overnight at 4 °C in SW buffer containing 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) and radiolabeled DNA probe; unlabeled DNA probes were included for competition studies. The strips were then washed with three changes of SW buffer, and the membrane was reassembled and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C overnight with an intensifying screen. Molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) included lysozyme (18.5 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (27.5 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (32 kDa), ovalbumin (49.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (80 kDa), and phosphorylase b (106 kDa). Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequence analysis were performed in the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the Adirondack Biomedical Research Institute using Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division instrumentation and reagents (Model 393 DNA/RNA synthesizer, Model 373 DNA Sequencer, and the PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit). Interpretation of DNA sequence results was facilitated by the use of Sequencher 3.0 software (Gene Codes). Human CRALBP gene sequence upstream of the translation start site was inspected for consensus transcription factor-binding sites manually and by computer using SIGNAL SCAN 2Available on the World Wide Web athttp://bimas.dcrt.nih. gov:80/molbio/signal/. and the Ghosh transcription factor data base (27Ghosh D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 445-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Three human RPE cell culture systems were used to study regulation of RLBP1, namely early passage nontransformed RPE cell cultures (17Campochiaro P.A. Hackett S.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and RPE cell lines ARPE-19 (19Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) and D407 (18Davis A.A. Bernstein P.S. Bok D. Turner T. Nachtigal M. Hunt R.C. Invest. Ophthalmol & Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 955-964PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown by Western and Northern analyses that the early passage nontransformed RPE cultures and ARPE-19 cells express CRALBP (17Campochiaro P.A. Hackett S.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). We used Western analysis and reverse transcription-PCR to confirm the CRALBP expression in D407 RPE cells previously detected by immunocytochemical methods (18Davis A.A. Bernstein P.S. Bok D. Turner T. Nachtigal M. Hunt R.C. Invest. Ophthalmol & Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 955-964PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against the CRALBP N-terminal 17 residues, C-terminal 31 residues, or a near N-terminal domain revealed a protein band with a slightly lower apparent mass in the D407 RPE cell extract compared with CRALBP in the human retinal extract or the purified recombinant control (Fig. 1). The strongest detection of CRALBP in the D407 RPE cell extract was obtained with the C-terminal antibody; no detection was apparent with the N-terminal antibody; and an intermediate level of detection was obtained with the third antibody. These results suggest that partial N-terminal proteolysis had occurred during protein extraction from the cultured cells as previously seen by Western analysis of CRALBP extracted from rat Müller cell cultures (28Sarthy V.P. Brodjian S.J. Dutt K. Kennedy B.N. French R.P. Crabb J.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 212-216PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the documented lability of the N terminus of CRALBP to proteolysis (20Crabb J.W. Gaur V.P. Garwin G.G. Marx S.V. Chapline C. Johnson C.M. Saari J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16674-16683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other Western analyses, the immunopositive bands could be competed away by excess purified recombinant CRALBP, but not by excess bovine serum albumin (data not shown). More intense immunodetection of CRALBP was apparent in the retinal extract than in the RPE cell culture extract; limited proteolysis was not apparent in the retinal extract. Reverse transcription-PCR using RNA from each of the three RPE cell culture systems followed by Southern blotting demonstrated the presence of CRALBP mRNA (data not shown). For these analyses, the PCR primers flanked intron 2 of RLBP1, and the Southern results distinguished CRALBP cDNA (241 bp) from genomic DNA (511 bp). Because the CRALBP N terminus is encoded within the reverse transcription-PCR product, these results also establish that the CRALBP mRNA in these RPE cells encodes an intact N terminus. Consistent with previous observations (17Campochiaro P.A. Hackett S.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), greater apparent levels of CRALBP mRNA and protein were observed in nontransformed RPE cells grown on Matrigel or bovine corneal endothelial cell matrix than when grown on plastic. These results, together with the previous reports, establish that CRALBP is expressed in the three RPE cell culture systems used in this study. As a first step toward identifying the elements in the CRALBP gene responsible for its expression in the RPE, we transfected reporter gene constructs containing 0.3–2.3 kb of the human CRALBP gene promoter region into three human RPE cell model systems and into several human non-ocular cell systems (Fig. 2). The results with all three RPE cells were similar and showed that the 2.1- and 2.3-kb CRALBP-reporter gene constructs direct high level luciferase expression in the RPE cells, but not in the non-ocular cells. Also evident, the 0.3-kb CRALBP-reporter gene construct, but not the reverse orientation (0.3R) construct, directs above background level luciferase expression in the RPE (Fig. 2, C–E). This suggests that basal promoter elements in RLBP1 exist between −243 and +80 bp. The results also suggest that element(s) that enhance CRALBP expression in RPE cells exist between −2089 and −1539 bp. None of the CRALBP-reporter constructs directed significant levels of luciferase expression in cultures of human liver or skin cells, although low levels of nonspecific leaky expression were observed in cultures of human breast cells (Fig. 2, F–H). The presence of two PCE-1 sequences in the −243 to +80 region was intriguing given that similar sequences have been implicated in the regulation of photoreceptor-specific gene expression (13Kikuchi T.

Comparison of ECM prepared by previously published methods demonstrated that cytochalasin B-prepared material yielded the highest endogenous apoE, representing 23.6% of that in cell monolayers. ECM prepared with EDTA or Triton X-100 exhibited decreased levels of apoE, 3 and 6%, respectively. ECM bound very low density lipoprotein poorly (5–6% of the monolayer capacity); however, these incubations dramatically increased the apoE content of the ECM. Heparinase or suramin decreased apoE of the ECM by 19.6 and 37.3%, respectively, suggesting association with heparin sulfate proteoglycans. EDTA or EGTA also displaced 35% of the apoE, suggesting a Ca2+-dependent association. Incubation with phosphatidylcholine vesicles (PCV) displaced 30% of the apoE, suggesting that lipid content affects association of apoE with the ECM. Data derived from sequential incubations with combinations of suramin, EGTA, and PCV were consistent with the presence of two distinct pools of apoE on the HepG2 ECM, one releasable with suramin and EGTA and the other releasable with lipids. Exogenously applied lipid-free apoE readily bound to the ECM; however, increasing the lipid content decreased its association. Lipid-free apoE could be equally displaced from the ECM with PCV or suramin. When lipid-free apoE adsorbed to microtiter wells was incubated with a triglyceride emulsion or palmitoyloleyl phosphatidylcholine micelles, the immunoreactivity of 3H1 (but not other antibodies), a monoclonal antibody against an epitope in the C-terminal domain of apoE, increased about 4-fold. In a similar manner, incubation of ECM with lipid dramatically increased the immunoreactivity of 3H1, indicating that apoE of the ECM exists in a lipid-poor form. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the increased immunoreactivity was due to an increase in the number of antibody binding sites. In conclusion, the ECM contains two pools of lipid-poor apoE. One pool associates with the ECM through heparin sulfate proteoglycans- and Ca2+-dependent interactions. A second pool of apoE dissociates from the ECM upon lipidation. The lipid-sensitive pool of apoE may participate in secretion or efflux of lipids or in the capture of lipoproteins by providing the apoE needed for receptor-mediated uptake.

In the liver, the abundant gaps and fenestrations of the sinusoidal endothelial cells form an open network that allows an efficient exchange of macromolecules between the blood and hepatocytes (1Martinez-Hernandez A. Amenta P.S. Virchows Arch. Abt. A Pathol. Anat. 1993; 423: 1-11Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The endothelium is separated from the hepatocyte plasmalemma by the space of Disse that contains irregular clumps of extracellular matrix (2Martinez-Hernandez A. Lab.

Major components of the hepatic ECM include collagen type III, collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin (2Martinez-Hernandez A. Lab. Invest. 1984; 51: 57-74PubMed Google Scholar, 7Geerts A. Geuze H.J.

In the liver, the ECM is a discontinuous structure and is therefore unlikely to have an efficient filtration function as described for more organized matrices of other tissues (11Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. 3rd Ed. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing, NY1994: 971-995Google Scholar). A potential function for the hepatic ECM, suggested by the presence of HSPG, could involve a role in lipoprotein metabolism. Lipoprotein lipase readily interacts with HSPG of the ECM elaborated by bovine corneal endothelial cells (12Chajek-Shaul T. Friedman G. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Biochim.

ApoE is also associated with the basolateral surface of hepatic parenchymal cells (22Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Guo L.S.S. Krisans S. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1589-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the surface of HepG2 cells (16Lilly-Stauderman M. Brown T.L. Balasubramaniam A. Harmony J.A.K. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these latter studies, incubation of cells with heparin, suramin, or heparinase increased the apoE content of the surrounding medium, suggesting attachment with the cell surface via HSPG. Cell surface apoE appears to be internalized upon perfusion of the liver with chylomicron remnants (21Shimano H. Namba Y. Ohsuga J. Kawamura M. Yamamoto K. Shimada M. Gotoda T. Harada K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in lipoprotein internalization. In the present study, we have measured the specific binding of radiolabeled antibodies against apoE to the ECM of HepG2 cells to directly resolve the nature of the relationship between apoE and the ECM. Our results suggest that significant amounts of endogenous apoE associate with the ECM through HSPG-, divalent metal ion-, and lipid-dependent interactions. We provide evidence that the HSPG- and EGTA-releasable pools of apoE represent a single population that is distinct from a lipid-releasable pool. We also demonstrate that apoE of the ECM is lipid-poor and dissociates with the addition of lipid. This property could allow ECM apoE to participate either in lipoprotein secretion or in lipoprotein uptake. Na125I was obtained from Amersham Corp. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada).

POPC cholate micelles were prepared as described by Sparks et al.(30Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were cultured in EMEM growth medium containing 10 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Confluent cultures were split 1:6 to 1:8 (∼100,000 cells/cm2) into 12-well plates for individual experiments. On the day prior to surface labeling experiments, fresh medium was added to the cells. All experiments were done on fully confluent cultures. Extracellular matrix was prepared from fully confluent HepG2 cell monolayers by three methods. All ECM preparations were washed three times with ice-cold PBS-BSA prior to experiments. ECM was prepared by the Triton X-100 method of Owensby et al. (5Owensby D.A. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was aspirated from HepG2 cells and replaced with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and then the solubilized cells were aspirated off and replaced with ice-cold PBS containing 2 mg/ml of fatty acid-free BSA and 1.7 mm CaCl2 (PBS-BSA). ECM was prepared by incubation of HepG2 cell monolayers with PBS containing 3 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 5 min at 37 °C as described by Owensby et al. (5Owensby D.A. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ECM was prepared from HepG2 monolayers by a modification of the cytochalasin B method of Mai and Chung (6Mai S. Chung A.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 152: 500-5093Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of a 1 mg/ml stock of cytochalasin B in ethanol was added directly to the HepG2 cell monolayers in complete medium to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and then transferred to ice. The cell monolayers lifted off the plates as sheets of cells when subjected to repeated aspirations of medium with a P1000 pipette. The apoE content of cell monolayers or ECM was determined using radiolabeled 7C9. This monoclonal antibody recognizes an N-terminal epitope of apoE and provides determinations of ECM apoE that are independent of lipid content (see below). Cells were prechilled for 15 min on ice and then washed three times in ice-cold PBS-BSA. Iodinated mAb (5 × 105 cpm/ml), diluted in PBS-BSA, was added to wells containing either cell monolayers or ECM and incubated at 4 °C for 2–4 h. To determine nonspecific binding, a 100-fold excess of cold mAb was added to replicate wells. Following antibody incubations, the cells or ECM were washed three times in cold PBS containing 1.7 mm CaCl2 and then solubilized with 1 ml of 0.5 m NaOH. Radioactivity was measured in a γ counter, and the results for antibody binding are expressed as the mean specific binding/well. Experiments were always performed in triplicate for both total and nonspecific binding in multiwell plates. In some studies, radiolabeled 3H1 was used to characterize apoE of the cell surface or ECM. In these experiments, ECM or HepG2 cell monolayers were first incubated at 4 or 37 °C for 1 h in the absence and presence of 1 mg of Liposyn II or POPC micelles/ml. The lipids were removed by two washes with PBS-BSA, and the incubations with radiolabeled 3H1 were performed at 4 °C as described above for 7C9. Competition Scatchard analysis was performed on cell monolayers that had been preincubated in the absence or presence of 1 mg/ml Liposyn II. These fractions were incubated with a constant amount of125I-mAb and a range of concentrations of the same unlabeled mAb in triplicate wells for each point. HepG2 cells or ECM were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in PBS-BSA. Human VLDL (100 μg/ml, final concentration) was then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound lipoproteins were removed with three washes with PBS-BSA. VLDL particles bound to the cell surface or ECM were detected by the addition of radiolabeled 1D1 or 7C9 (500,000 cpm/ml). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled antibody. Antibody incubations were continued for 2–4 h at 4 °C. Unbound antibody was removed with three washes with ice-cold PBS, and then the cell fractions were solubilized with 0.5 N NaOH. Radioactivity was measured in a γ counter, and the results were expressed as the mean specific antibody binding/well. Specific VLDL binding to cell monolayers or ECM was also determined by the addition of 125I-VLDL (500,000 cpm/ml; 20–40 ng of protein) in PBS-BSA in the absence and presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled VLDL. These incubations were conducted at 4 °C for 2 h and were followed by three washes with ice-cold PBS-BSA and solubilization with 0.5 N NaOH. Radioactivity was measured in a γ counter, and the results were expressed as the mean specific VLDL binding/well. A solid phase radioimmunoassay was used to examine the effect of apoE lipidation on the immunoreactivity of our monoclonal antibodies. Briefly 0.5 μg of lipid-free apoVLDL or 5 μg of VLDL in 100 μl of PBS was immobilized by passive adsorption to 96-well microtiter plates for 16 h at 4 °C. Unbound material was removed with three washes of PBS, and then the wells were incubated with 100-μl volumes of Liposyn II or POPC cholate micelles (0–0.4 mg/ml) in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS and blocked with 300 μl of PBS containing 1% fatty-acid free BSA for 2 h at 20 °C. 125I-labeled anti-apoE antibody (100,000 cpm/well) was added and incubated for 2 h at 20 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS-BSA and counted. ECM was prepared from confluent monolayers grown in T-175 cm2 flasks (2 flasks/matrix preparation) as described above. 7 ml of Laemmli sample buffer (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) containing SDS (2%) and 2-mercaptoethanol (5% w/v) was added to each T-175 flask and allowed to solubilize the matrices overnight at 25 °C with gentle rocking. The samples were concentrated approximately 5-fold (final volume 2.8 ml) in Centriprep 10 units (Amicon) and then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Cell or ECM proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% separating gel; 3% stacking gel) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Bio-Rad). PBS containing powdered milk (3% w/v) was used to block the nitrocellulose membranes and to dilute antibody stocks. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with gentle rocking for 1 h at 25 °C with rabbit antiserum specific for human fibronectin (Sigma), human apoE, or human LRP followed by incubation for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Peroxidase activity was detected using the chemiluminescence method of Boehringer Mannheim. Previous reports have characterized cell surface apoE indirectly by measuring increases in medium apoE following incubation of cells with heparin or heparinase at 37 °C (16Lilly-Stauderman M. Brown T.L. Balasubramaniam A. Harmony J.A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 190-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Deng J. Rudick V. Rudick M. Dory L. J.

These results are likely to be complicated by secretion of apoE. In this study, we have assessed cell surface apoE directly by determining the specific binding of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies against apoE to the cell surface or to the ECM of HepG2 cells. Monoclonal 7C9, which recognizes residues 1–15 of the N-terminal domain of apoE, was incubated with HepG2 monolayers at 4 °C to minimize membrane turnover and secretion. Fig. 1 demonstrates that there is significant and specific binding of 125I-7C9 to the HepG2 cell surface (top panel). In contrast a monoclonal IgG against an irrelevant antigen (atrial natriuretic factor) displayed no specific binding to HepG2 cells (data not shown). Suramin promoted a 36% decrease in the apparent binding of 125I-7C9 to the cell surface (top panel). The decreased 7C9 binding observed after suramin incubations results from displacement of apoE from cell surface HSPG and is paralleled by a 2-fold increase in the amount of apoE in the surrounding media (bottom panel). Control experiments have shown that suramin exerts no effect on the apoE radioimmunoassay (not illustrated). Collectively the data argue that the specific binding of 7C9 to the cell surface accurately reflects the levels of cell surface apoE. We reasoned that the ECM and its complement of HSPG should interact with secreted apoE and present a simplified system to study the interaction of apoE with extracellular components. Consequently, ECM was prepared by three previously published methods that utilize incubations with 3 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, or 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B to release cells from the matrix. Scanning electron microscopy and immunefluorescence microscopy of ECM produced by these methods demonstrates an organized macromolecular network that is enriched in vitronectin and fibronectin (5Owensby D.A. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as laminin and entactin (6Mai S. Chung A.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 152: 500-5093Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) but is devoid of cells and cell fragments. In agreement with these earlier reports, our ECM preparations demonstrated no adherent cells or cell fragments when examined by standard light microscopy (not illustrated). Cell homogenates and ECM, prepared from a 96-fold greater surface area were also analyzed by Western blotting. Fibronectin (Fig. 2 A), an established matrix protein, stained intensely in the cytochalasin B prepared material and was readily detected in the Triton X-100 and EDTA-prepared material. The large subunit of LRP (∼550 kDa) was readily observed in whole cell fractions but was absent from all the matrix preparations (Fig. 2 B). This demonstrated the absence of contaminating membrane-associated proteins in these preparations. In agreement with the findings of others (5Owensby D.A. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the recovery of protein in the matrix fractions represented less than 1% of the originating cell material, which is consistent with the absence of contaminating cell membrane protein. Table I compares the binding of 7C9 to the HepG2 cell surface and the ECM prepared by the three methods. The ECM preparation protocols yield matrices with significantly different abilities to bind 7C9, in descending order are cytochalasin B ECM > Triton X-100 ECM > EDTA ECM. In contrast, cell free wells treated in an identical manner retained only background levels of radiolabeled antibody. Matrix prepared by the cytochalasin B method bound 125I-7C9 to levels representing 23.6% of that bound by HepG2 cell monolayers. The Triton X-100 and EDTA preparations represented only 6.0% and 3.0% of the monolayer capacity, respectively. The ECM preparations and whole cell homogenates were also analyzed by Western blotting with anti-human apoE (Fig. 2 C). In the whole cell homogenates, two bands in the 32–34 kDa range are readily visible and represent sialylated (Fig. 2 C, upper band) and non-sialylated forms of apoE (32Zannis V.I. vanderSpek J. Silverman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13415-13421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weisgraber K.H. Shinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12029-12034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both bands are visible in the ECM preparations although the upper sialylated band of apoE predominates. Band intensity is greatest in the cytochalasin B-prepared material, indicating, in agreement with the 125I 7C9 binding analysis of Fig. 1, that this method of preparation yields matrix with the highest endogenous apoE content. The variable 7C9 binding activity of the preparations could be explained by a differential loss of apoE during the procedures or by reduced binding of 7C9 due to conformational changes in apoE brought about by ECM preparation. We first tested the effects of the matrix preparation procedures on apoE that had been exogenously bound to the ECM. To minimize the concentration of endogenous apoE, we used apoE-poor Triton X-100 ECM. Incubation of Triton X-100-derived ECM with conditioned medium at 4 °C results in a 4-fold increase in the 7C9 binding activity (Table II). The apoE-enriched ECM were then subjected to one of the three preparation protocols and a PBS control, washed twice with PBS-BSA, and then incubated with 125I-7C9 (Fig. 3). The EDTA and Triton X-100 protocols reduced the 125I-7C9 binding activity by 70 and 40%, respectively. In contrast to these harsh extraction procedures, the cytochalasin B protocol did not decrease the apoE content of the ECM relative to control incubations. The recoveries of exogenous"

We studied this interaction by measuring the adherence of ICAM-1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to immobilized, purified Mac-1. Nucleotide sequence information was obtained for the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of three antibodies (44aacb, MY904, and 118.1) shown to block Mac-1-mediated cell adherence. Peptides were synthesized based on the predicted amino acid sequences of the CDRs and tested for the ability to block cell adhesion to Mac-1. Peptides derived from CDR1 of 44aacb, CDR2 of 118.1, and CDRs 1 and 3 of MY904 heavy chains were found to possess blocking activity at 10–100 μm. This may indicate that one or two CDRs contribute disproportionately to the antibody binding affinity. The binding of ligands to Mac-1 has been shown to require a region of the α-chain known as the I- or A-domain. We have recombinantly produced Mac-1 I-domain, and show that it is also capable of supporting the adherence of ICAM-1-expressing CHO cells. The adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells to the I-domain is inhibited by 44aacb and 118.1 and by the CDR peptides from 44aacb and 118.1. By using phage display of peptide libraries based on the 118.1 CDR peptide with five residues randomized, we were able to identify a novel peptide inhibitor of Mac-1 with substitutions at all five positions.

The extravasation of white blood cells to sites of inflammation and the phagocytosis of opsinized microorganisms by these cells is clearly crucial to host defense. However, the mounting of an inappropriately large mobilization of phagocytic cells is thought to contribute to organ damage in sepsis, in adult respiratory distress syndrome, and following reperfusion of ischemic tissue (1Weiss S.J.

Adhesion: Its Role in Inflammatory Disease. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Activated neutrophils are recruited into tissues or are sequestered in the microcirculation of the lung and liver; in either case tissue is damaged upon their degranulation and release of enzymes and activated oxygen species. Interruption of neutrophil extravasation or oxidative burst may be an effective means of damage control in these situations. Mac-1 is a cell surface glycoprotein contributing to several myeloid cell functions including adherence to and transmigration across the endothelium, binding and phagocytosis of opsinized particles, and the oxidative burst (3Diamond M.S.

It is a heterodimer of two transmembrane proteins, CD11b (αM) and CD18 (β2), the latter also being part of the related integrins LFA-1, p150/95, and αDβ2.

Marlin S.D. Stratowa C. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 925-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). However, the complexity of the functions involving Mac-1 results in part from the fact that an array of ligands besides ICAM-1 is also recognized by this molecule, including iC3b, fibrinogen, and factor X (3Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The precise residues of Mac-1 and ICAM-1 mediating their interaction are not known, although the domains responsible have been elucidated. Ig domain 3 of ICAM-1 has clearly been implicated in binding to Mac-1, whereas domain 1 mediates binding to the related adhesion molecule, LFA-1 (8Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). CD11b contains a 200-amino acid “inserted domain” or “I domain,” so called due to its presence only in the other β2 integrins and in the VLA α1 and α2 subunits and its absence in most other integrins. Antibodies to this domain can block ICAM-1 binding, as well as that of iC3b and fibrinogen (3Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Mutations within the I-domain of Mac-1 have been shown to prevent binding of ICAM-1 and iC3b (9Kamata T. Wright R.

Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The Mac-1 I-domain has been expressed recombinantly, and there are some data suggesting that it interacts with fibrinogen, iC3b, and soluble ICAM-1 (4Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 12Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the I-domain can support the adherence of ICAM-1-expressing cells independent of other domains of Mac-1 has not been previously demonstrated. The lack of information on the precise sequences within ICAM-1 and Mac-1 that interact has precluded modeling of small molecule inhibitors. One approach to overcoming this problem that has proven successful in other cases has been to use CDR sequences from antibodies directed at the active site as lead structures. Antibodies useful in this regard have been either developed as anti-idiotypic to the ligand (13Saragovi H.U. Fitzpatrick D. Raktabutr A. Nakanishi H. Kahn M. Greene M.I. Science. 1991; 253: 792-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or simply chosen by virtue of their ligand blocking activity (14Taub R. Gould R.J. Garsky V.M. Ciccarone T.M. Hoxie J. Friedman P.A. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As well as providing lead inhibitors, in some cases CDRs have shared sequence similarity with a portion of the known ligand, implicating that sequence in receptor binding (14Taub R. Gould R.J.

Several antibodies that block the adherence of ICAM-1 to both Mac-1 and to the I-domain have been sequenced to allow determination of CDR structures. Peptides based on these CDR structures are shown to block the adherence of ICAM-1 to both Mac-1 and the I-domain. Peripheral blood leukocytes were purified from “Buffy coats” (Stanford Medical School Blood Center, Stanford, CA). Buffy coats were diluted 1:1 with HBSS and layered on Histopaque (Sigma) gradients as described (17Endemann G. Feng Y. Bryant C.M. Hamilton G.S. Perumattam J. Mewshaw R.E. Liu D.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 5-12PubMed Google Scholar). Both mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell layers were collected, and red blood cells were lysed one or two times as necessary. Mac-1 was purified from lysates of the remaining leukocytes by immunoaffinity chromatography essentially as described by Diamond et al. (6Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. deFougerolles A.R. Stacker S.A. Garcia-Aguilar J. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3129-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) and purity assessed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 1 A). The construction of the I-domain was based on a plasmid construct reported by Michishitaet al. (11Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The I-domain of human Mac-1 from the glycine residue at position 111 to the alanine at position 318 was generated using synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR. Eight overlapping oligonucleotides were synthesized and combined in a stepwise PCR procedure to generate the final 603-base pair fragment. The 5′-most oligo included a BamHI site present naturally in the Mac-1 gene sequence, whereas the 3′-most oligo included an addedEcoRI site. The internal EcoRI site in this I-domain region was eliminated via a single base change from A to T at the third position in the glutamate codon at position 179 (a silent mutation). Each pair of oligonucleotides sharing partial complementarity was annealed and subjected to PCR (3′ at 94 °C, followed by 10 cycles of 1′ at 94 °C, 2′ at 55 °C, and 3′ at 72 °C) using 250 μm dNTPs and VENT polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The PCR products were then mixed, melted for 3′ at 94 °C, and subjected to PCR as described above. After assembly of all of the oligos, the resultingBamHI-EcoRI fragment was cloned into the pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) vector at the BamHI and EcoRI sites, resulting in an in-frame fusion with an N-terminal domain encoding glutathione S-transferase. The glutathioneS-transferase-I-domain fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli cells (strain JM101). Overnight cultures of E. coli JM101 were diluted 1:10 with L broth medium containing ampicillin and grown for 1 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (1 mm) was added to induce expression of the fusion protein, and after 3 h of growth, bacteria were pelleted and frozen at −80 °C. Pellets derived from a 1-liter culture were then thawed and resuspended in 18 ml of cold PBS, pH 7.4, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added at 1 mm, and the samples were disrupted on ice at 10,000 p.s.i. in a French Press (SLM Instruments, Inc., Rochester, NY). 20% Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1%, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional rocking. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (1.5 ml, Pharmacia) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed once in PBS plus 0.35 m NaCl and washed four times with PBS and were resuspended in 5 ml of PBS. 200 units of human thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) was added to cleave the I-domain from the fusion protein, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. NaCl and MgCl2 were added to the cleaved soluble recombinant I-domain at final concentrations of 0.35 m and 1 mm, respectively, and the samples were then passed through a 700-μl benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia) column to remove the thrombin. The flow-through was assayed for thrombin activity using Chromozym TH (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) as a substrate, and the clearance was greater than 150-fold. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Typical yields of the recombinant I-domain were 3–5 mg/liter bacterial culture. Electrospray ionization was performed on a Finnigan SSQ 7000 mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) in the positive ion mode. Liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy was performed using a capillary reversed phase column with a flow rate into the mass spectrometer of 5 μl/min. To map tryptic peptides, electrophoresis of I-domain protein was carried out in 12% polyacrylamide followed by transfer to Immobilon (70 V, 60 min; Ref.18Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In situ tryptic digestion was carried out according to the method of Wong et al. (19Wong S.C. Grimley C. Padua A. Bourell J.H. Henzel W.J. Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1993: 371-378Crossref Google Scholar). Capillary HPLC was performed using a Valco tee to split the 200 μl/min flow from an HP 1090 HPLC PV5, driving the capillary system (Vydac C18 0.32 × 250-mm column, maintained at 40 °C, Microtech Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) at 5 μl/min. The gradient was as follows: 0 min, 100% A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O); 40 min, 30% B (0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile); 50 min, 60% B; 51 min, 0%B; 72 min, 0% B. The adherence of human neutrophils to wells coated with human serum was carried out exactly as described previously (17Endemann G. Feng Y. Bryant C.M. Hamilton G.S. Perumattam J. Mewshaw R.E. Liu D.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 5-12PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells were stably transfected with an expression vector encoding human ICAM-1 (20Madden K. Janczak J. McEnroe G. Lim D. Hartman T. Liu D. Stanton L. Inflamm. Res. 1997; 46: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and their adherence was assessed as follows. ICAM-1-CHO cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and used at 80% confluence. Cells were loaded with calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 5 μm in HBSS++ for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then detached from the flask with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA (15 min, 37 °C), washed in HBSS++ containing 0.1% HSA (Sigma), and resuspended in HBSS++ containing 0.5% HSA at 2 × 106/ml. 96-well plates were coated with purified Mac-1 or I-domain in HBSS++ (50 μl/well) for 2 h at 37 °C. In the case of Mac-1, β-octylglucoside at a final concentration of 0.15% was present in the coating solution. For each lot of Mac-1, the optimal protein concentration for coating the wells (5–13 μg/ml) was determined as that which best supported the adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells but not of vector-CHO cells. Wells were washed twice with HBSS++ containing 0.1% HSA and blocked with HBSS++ supplemented with 0.5% HSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Test compounds were preincubated in blocked wells for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 μl, and then 50 μl of cells were added for an additional 60-min incubation. Nonadherent cells were removed by gently inverting plates and blotting on paper towels. Wells were washed twice with HBSS++ containing 0.1% HSA. Adherent cells were quantitated in a 96-well fluorescence plate reader (IDEXX Labs, Westbrook, ME). HSA lots were tested in this assay to find those that gave a minimal background adherence and a maximal adherence to Mac-1. All incubations in HBSS++ were carried out without CO2. Hybridoma cells producing the anti-Mac-1 monoclonal antibodies LM2/1 (murine IgG1), 44aacb (murine IgG2a κ) and MY904 (murine IgG1 κ) were from ATCC (21Miller L.M. Schwarting R. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2891-2900PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dana N. Styrt B. Griffin J.D. Todd R.F. Klempner M.S. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3259-3263PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridoma cell line secreting mAb 118.1 (murine IgG1κ) was generated from a Balb/C mouse immunized according to Diamond et al.(3Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Spleen cells were mixed in a 5:1 ratio with FOX-NY murine myeloma cells (ATCC 1732 CRL) and fused by slow addition of polyethylene glycol 1500 (0.5 ml/108 cells, Boehringer Mannheim). After 1 min at 37 °C, the cell suspension was slowly diluted in RPMI, centrifuged at 200 × g for 7 min, and resuspended in selection medium (RPMI 1640, 20% fetal bovine serum, Pen/Strep, AAT media supplement (Sigma), and STM Mitogen (RIBI ImmunoChem Research Inc.)). After 9 days of growth in 96-well culture plates, the hybridoma supernatants were screened for antibodies binding to purified Mac-1 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay adapted from Diamond and Springer (23Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Serum-free conditioned media from the hybridoma lines were harvested from confluent roller bottles, and antibodies were purified by protein A chromatography using PROSEP-A affinity resin (BioProcessing, Ltd.) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. mRNA was isolated from 44aacb, MY904, and 118.1 hybridoma cells (108 cells each, grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES) using the Mini RiboSep™ mRNA Isolation Kit (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). Following first strand cDNA synthesis using a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Corp.), VH and VL regions were amplified (Vent DNA polymerase, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) using the following primers: VH regions, upstream primer 5′-GCAGAATTCSARGTSCARTTRCARCA and downstream primer 5′-GCAGAATTCGGGGCCAGTGGATAGAC; VL regions, downstream primer 5′-GCAGAATTCGGTGGGAAGATGGATACAGTT coupled to upstream primers 5′-GCAGAATTCACMCARTCHCCAGTNAT (44aacb), 5′-GCAGAATTCGAYATYGTBCTGACNCA (MY904), or 5′-GCAGAATTCGAYGTBGTKATGACMCA (118.1) (S = C or G; R = A or G; M = A or C; Y = C or T; K = G or T; H = A, C, or T; B = C, G, or T; and N = A, C, T, or G). The sequences of the downstream primers were based on the conserved nucleotide sequences of the 5′-ends of the constant regions of the heavy and light chains. The upstream primers were designed from either the experimentally determined N-terminal amino acid sequences of the three antibodies or deduced N-terminal “consensus” amino acid sequences of murine immunoglobulin variable regions from GenBank™. The mouse codon usage was also considered when degenerate primers were designed. An EcoRI site was introduced at the 5′-end of all the primers to facilitate cloning. PCR was performed for 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, and bands were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. The correctly sized PCR products were digested with EcoRI, gel-purified, and ligated into EcoRI-digested pUC9 vector DNA. The ligated DNA was then transformed into E. coli JM101 by electroporation, and clones were selected on LB plates containing ampicillin. For each VH or VL region, three or four positive clones were picked, DNA was prepared using the Wizard miniprep system (Promega, Madison, WI), and the PCR product carried in the plasmid DNA was sequenced. Two peptide libraries were constructed in which the library inserts were directly linked to the N terminus of the C-terminal domain of M13 gene III as described (24Garrard L.J. Yang M. O'Connell M.P. Kelley R.F. Henner D.J. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1373-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The GYXDXYXGXIXYN and GXIXPXYXGXTYN libraries were prepared using synthetic oligonucleotides containing core sequences GGA TAT NNS GAT NNS TAC NNS GGT NNS ATT NNS TAC AAC and GGA NNS ATT NNS CCT NNS TAT NNS GGT NNS ACC TAC AAC, respectively. The nucleotides were made double-stranded by extension with Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs) from a 5′ primer. The resulting products were gel purified using MERmaid spin kit (Bio101 Inc., Vista, CA) and inserted into the BstEII and BamHI sites of the phagemid vector pAL53. 2D. L. Damm, B. L. Garrick, K. McFadden, D. D. Lesikar, A. B. Lucas, and R. T. White, manuscript in preparation. The library-containing vectors were then transfected into E. coli Top10F′ cells using 10–12 electroporations. The yields of the two primary libraries were 0.5–1 × 107. Libraries were packaged into phage particles by infection of the transfected E. coliTop10F′ library with M13KO7 helper phage, resulting in expression of less than one copy of the peptide-gene III protein per phage (24Garrard L.J. Yang M. O'Connell M.P. Kelley R.F. Henner D.J. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1373-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Phage expressing Mac-1 binding peptides were selected by panning on 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Corning) coated with Mac-1 (0.5 μg/well in HBSS++ containing 0.15% β-octylglucoside for 2 h at 37 °C). After the wells were washed and blocked with HBSS++ supplemented with 0.5% HSA, 10 μl of partially purified phage (∼5 × 1011 cfu) was added to the wells in a total volume of 100 μl of the same buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h while shaking. The unbound phage particles were then removed by washing with 100 μl of HBSS++/0.05% Tween six times quickly on ice. Bound phage were eluted with 200 μl of 100 mmcitrate buffer, pH 3.0/0.1% Tween for 30 min at room temperature with shaking and neutralized with 25 μl of 1 m Tris base. The wells were then washed three times with 100 μl of PBS, and eluates and washes were combined. The eluted phage were titered and amplified and carried through three more rounds of enrichment by panning on Mac-1. The stringency of the PBS wash conditions was increased in successive rounds as follows: nine quick washes at room temperature in round 2, followed by two additional washes for 10 min each with shaking in round 3 and three washes for 10 min each with shaking in round 4. Phage were randomly selected for sequencing after round 4. Purified Mac-1 has been shown to support the adherence of ICAM-1-expressing L-cells (6Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. deFougerolles A.R. Stacker S.A. Garcia-Aguilar J. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3129-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). To determine whether the I-domain of Mac-1 could similarly support the adherence of cells expressing ICAM-1, this domain was expressed recombinantly in E. coli. Analysis of the purified protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a major band migrating as expected and in some cases a minor band with slightly slower migration (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of the purified protein by mass spectrometry showed a major peak of 24,103 Da, in agreement with the molecular mass predicted for this construct. Also revealed was a minor peak of 25,102 Da, present at approximately 10–20% the level of the major peak in different preparations. To determine the source of the additional 1000 Da, the proteins in the I-domain preparation were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to both N-terminal sequence analysis and tryptic peptide mapping. Both the 24- and 25-kDa proteins had the expected N-terminal sequence of GSNLRQQP. The 24- and 25-kDa bands showed a similar tryptic map pattern with the exception of the C-terminal peptide (IFANSS; mass, 638 Da), which disappeared from the digest of the 25-kDa band. A new peptide (mass, 1634 Da) was evident in the map of the 25-kDa protein. The mass of the new peptide was 997 Da larger than the predicted C-terminal peptide, similar to the mass difference observed in the intact molecules, and thus we conclude that the added mass is contained at the C terminus. The 1634-Da peptide could be accounted for by translation of the usual stop codon in the pGEX-2T expression vector as a tryptophan residue, translation of 10 additional vector residues prior to the next stop codon, and proteolytic trimming of three C-terminal vector residues, resulting in the tryptic peptide IFANSSWLTDDLPR. Purified recombinant I-domain was tested for the ability to support the adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the I-domain did support the adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells, in a concentration-dependent manner. For this particular lot of I-domain, 10–30 μg/ml in the solution used to coat the wells resulted in good adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells and low background adherence of vector-transfected CHO cells. The adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells was blocked by the anti-Mac-1 antibody 44aacb. However, at high levels of I-domain, vector-transfected CHO cells were also adherent, and this adherence was blocked by 44aacb. These results indicate that the I-domain of Mac-1 interacts not only with ICAM-1 but also with an unknown receptor on CHO cells. This interaction with a CHO cell receptor is not unique to the recombinant I-domain, because vector-CHO cells also adhered to high levels of purified Mac-1, and this adherence was similarly blocked by 44aacb (data not shown). To verify that under typical assay conditions with low substrate level, the observed adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells was due to ICAM-1 rather than endogenous CHO receptors for Mac-1, a blocking ICAM-1 antibody was preincubated with cells prior to addition to the plate. This antibody completely blocked the adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells to both the I-domain and to Mac-1 (Fig. 2 B). The number of fluorescently labeled ICAM-1-CHO cells adhering to the I-domain under optimal conditions was typically 3–4-fold less than that adhering to Mac-1. The anti-Mac-1 antibodies 44aacb and MY904 block the Mac-1-mediated adherence of neutrophils (17Endemann G. Feng Y. Bryant C.M. Hamilton G.S. Perumattam J. Mewshaw R.E. Liu D.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 5-12PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dana N. Styrt B. Griffin J.D. Todd R.F. Klempner M.S. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3259-3263PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody 118.1 was generated as described under “Materials and Methods” and also shown to block Mac-1-mediated neutrophil adherence (data not shown). 44aacb, MY904, and 118.1 were found to bind to Mac-1 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format with EC50 values of 12.0, 9.3, and 10.7 nm, respectively. Preincubation of these antibodies with Mac-1 (Fig. 3 A) resulted in inhibition of the adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells with IC50values of 50–500 pm in four assays. The three antibodies also blocked I-domain-mediated adherence (Fig. 3 B) with IC50 values of 1–3 nm in four assays. LM 2/1, which does not block neutrophil adherence, does not block ICAM-1-CHO adherence to Mac-1 (Fig. 3 A). mRNA isolated from hybridoma cells producing 44aacb, MY904, and 118.1 was used to determine the nucleotide sequence encoding the CDRs of each of the antibodies. The deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Table I. Peptides were synthesized corresponding to the underlined portions of the sequences in Table I. These peptides were tested for inhibition of ICAM-1-CHO cell adherence to Mac-1 (Table I). One or two HC CDRs from each antibody blocked Mac-1-mediated adherence with an IC50 at or below 106 μm. Of the light chain CDR peptides made for antibodies 44aacb and MY904, none possessed blocking activity. Two of the active HC CDR peptides were also tested for blocking activity in the adherence assay using the I-domain as a substrate. HC CDR1 from 44aacb and HC CDR2 from 118.1 were found to possess comparable blocking activity in this assay (data not shown).Table ICDR regions from anti-Mac-1 antibodiesAmino acid sequencesIC501-aPeptides (underlined portions) representing the CDR regions plus some flanking sequences were synthesized and tested for inhibition of ICAM-1-CHO adherence to Mac-1; data shown are mean ± SDEV.μMHeavy chain CDR1 44aacbYTFTNYWINWVKQ33.2 ± 20 (5) MY904YTFSNYWIEWVKQ77.9 ± 19.6 (2) 118.1YSFTDYNMYWVKQ>100 (2)Heavy chain CDR2 44aacbEWIGNIYPSDTYINHNQKFKDKA>100 (1) MY904EWIGEILPGSDSTNYNQKFKGKA>100 (1) 118.1EWIGYIDPYYGGITYNQIFKGKA30.4 ± 6.1 (4)Heavy chain CDR3 44aacbAVYFCTRSAY...ANYFDYWGQG>100 (2) MY904AVYFCARGGIITTAHYFDYWGQG106 ± 9.7 (4) 118.1AVYSCAIGGSYGWCS...YWGQG>200 (1)L"

Unexpectedly, Ala197 retained complete activity in the SP-A functions of carbohydrate binding, type II cell binding, inhibition of surfactant secretion, lipid binding, lipid aggregation, and lipid uptake by type II cells. The results unambiguously demonstrate that Arg197 is not mechanistically essential for SP-A function. The Lys197 mutation displayed all functions of the wild type protein but exhibited a 2-fold increase in lipid uptake activity. The His197 mutation displayed all SP-A functions studied except for lipid uptake. The results obtained with the His197 mutation clearly demonstrate that lipid aggregation alone by SP-A is insufficient to promote lipid uptake by type II cells.

SP-A is composed of four distinct domains (1Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): 1) an amino-terminal domain that forms interchain disulfide bonds; 2) a collagen-like domain containing multiple Gly-X-Y repeats; 3) a neck region composed of an amphipathic helix and a hydrophobic domain; and 4) a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The mature protein forms an oligomeric bouquet structure composed of six trimeric subunits which are covalently joined via disulfide bonds (1Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A binds and aggregates phospholipid vesicles at physiological concentrations of Ca2+ (3Benson B.J. Williams M.C.

Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These in vitro properties are thought to reflect some of the functions of SP-A in vivo that include structural reorganization and recycling of surfactant lipids. Other important Ca2+-dependent functions of SP-A include high affinity binding to specific receptors on alveolar type II cells and negative regulation of surfactant secretion (6Kuroki Y. Mason R.J.

Physiol. 1993; 264: L338-L344PubMed Google Scholar). The protein stimulates macrophage chemotaxis and can enhance phagocytosis of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (11van Iwaarden J.F. van Strijp J.A.G.

McGowan S.E. Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5343-5351PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A also enhances FcR- and CR1-mediated phagocytosis (14Tenner A.J. Robinson S.L. Borchelt J. Wright J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13923-13928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins that interact with SP-A have been identified on alveolar type II cells and macrophages (15Chroneos Z.C. Abdulrasulnia R. Whitsett J.A. Rice W.R. Shepherd V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16375-16383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Stevens P.A. Wissel H. Sieger D. Meienreis-Sudau V. Rustow B. Biochem.

Mutations in the CRD affect specific type II cell receptor binding, phospholipid binding and aggregation, and inhibition of surfactant secretion as well as augmentation of phospholipid uptake by alveolar type II cells (18Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The simultaneous substitutions E195Q and R197D of the CRD alter carbohydrate binding specificity, prevent SP-A-mediated phospholipid uptake and aggregation of phospholipid, and destroy the ability of SP-A to compete with its radiolabeled counterpart for surface receptors on alveolar type II cells. These results implicate the Glu195 and Arg197 as essential amino acids in SP-A function. This previous conclusion for SP-A is consistent with results first obtained with the closely related MBP-A that defined the active site for carbohydrate binding (20Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 21Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The work with MBP-A followed solution of the crystal structure and unambiguously defined the carbohydrate and Ca2+-binding sites of the protein. Work with SP-A using site-directed mutagenesis has largely followed from extrapolation of the MBP-A data. In this study, we examined the specific role of amino acid Arg197 of the SP-A in the interaction of the protein with the type II cell receptor and lipids. Position 197 was replaced with amino acids Ala, Lys, His, Asp, and Asn. These mutants were prepared using the baculovirus expression system in invertebrate (Sf9) cells. Recombinant rat SP-A has been shown to have all of the functions of native SP-A with respect to lipid interactions and regulation of surfactant secretion by type cells (22McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary objective of this study was to understand how essential the basic residue at position 197 is for multiple SP-A functions. Our results demonstrate unexpectedly that a basic residue at position 197 is not required for SP-A function. Substitutions at position 197 further reveal that SP-A-mediated lipid aggregation is insufficient to promote lipid association and uptake by type II cells. In addition, we show that mutant R197H is defective exclusively in the lipid uptake process. Surfactant was isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats 28 days after an intratracheal instillation of 10 mg of silica in saline (23Dethloff L.A. Gilmore L.B. Brody A.R. Hook G.E.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Native SP-A was isolated and purified from surfactant extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage as described previously by Kuroki et al. (6Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5566-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The 125I-SP-A was prepared using the method of Bolton-Hunter as described previously (6Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5566-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The 125I-SP-A (552–690 cpm/ng) used in the receptor-binding experiments was greater than 95% precipitable, 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Mutant SP-A cDNAs (R197A, R197K, R197H, R197N, and R197D) were synthesized using a 1.6-kilobase SP-A cDNA template (22McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mutagenic oligonucleotide primers by the overlap extension method of polymerase chain reaction (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with Bsu36I and MscI before ligation intoBsu36I/MscI-digested pGem7zf/SP-A vector. The entire polymerase chain reaction-amplified region of each mutant was sequenced to confirm the presence of only a single mutation. The 1.6-kilobase SP-A cDNA containing the mutation was digested and ligated into Bsu36I and XmaI-digested pVL1392/SP-A vector. The mutant proteins were expressed in the baculovirus system as described by O'Reilly (25O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses were produced by cotransfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with the pVL1392/SP-A vector and linearized Autographa californica virus (Baculogold, Pharmingen). Plaques containing recombinant baculoviruses were isolated and amplified to 107-108 plaque-forming units/ml before protein expression. Recombinant proteins were secreted from infectedTrichoplusia ni cells and purified from contaminants in serum-free Excell 400 medium by absorption to mannose-Sepharose 6B, as described previously (22McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alveolar type II cells were isolated by tissue dissociation with elastase and purification on metrizamide gradients (26Dobbs L. Mason R. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The type II cells were seeded at 2 × 106/35-mm dish in 2 ml of the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For measurement of phosphatidylcholine secretion, the type II cells were cultured with DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum containing [3H]choline (0.5 μCi/ml) for 20 h, washed to remove unincorporated precursor and subjected to agonist/antagonist treatment as described (27Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3388-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surfactant lipid secretion was induced with 10−7m12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Wild type and mutant forms of SP-A were added to cultures to antagonize TPA action. Isolated type II cells were cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum for 20 h. The assay was carried out as described previously (28Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell monolayers were washed with DMEM and incubated with 1 μg/ml 125I-SP-A and varying concentrations of unlabeled SP-A (either wild type or mutant) in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, for 4 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, each dish was placed on ice, and the monolayers were washed 3 times with ice-cold buffer B (50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and 1 time with ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) before solubilization in 1 ml of 0.1n NaOH. The amount of bound 125I-SP-A was quantified using a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined as the amount of 125I-SP-A bound in the presence of 50 μg/ml unlabeled native rat SP-A. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC),l-α-lecithin (egg phosphatidylcholine) (egg PC),l-α-phosphatidylglycerol (egg sodium salt) (egg PG), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)) (DPPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. 1-Palmitoyl 2-[3H]palmitoyl-L3-phosphatidylcholine ([3H]DPPC) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. For phospholipid uptake experiments, liposome mixtures (DPPC:egg PC:DPPG or DPPC:egg PC:egg PG (7:2:1)) containing 2 μCi of [3H]DPPC (specific activity of 50 Ci/mmol) per mg of liposomes were dried under nitrogen and hydrated (concentration of 1 mg/ml) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.15m NaCl at 48 °C for 1 h. Unilamellar liposomes were prepared by sonication of the lipid mixture with a microprobe at 25 watts for 10 min while the tube was immersed in an external waterbath (45 °C), followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 1 h to remove multilamellar liposomes. For liposome aggregation experiments, the lipid mixture (DPPC:egg PC:egg PG (7:2:1)) was dried under nitrogen and hydrated (concentration of 1 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15m NaCl at 48 °C for 1 h, followed by sonication and centrifugation as described above. For liposome binding experiments, a lipid mixture (DPPC:DPPG (9:1)) was dried from organic solvent and hydrated (concentration of 1 mg/ml) in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 mm NaCl at 48 °C for 1 h before vigorous vortexing. Freshly isolated type II cells were washed one time in DMEM containing 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) (DMEM/HEPES), and resuspended in DMEM/HEPES at 107/ml. The phospholipid uptake experiment was carried out using 1 × 106 cells per tube as described previously (19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unilamellar liposomes (100 μg/ml) were mixed with 10 μg/ml of the SP-A variants in a cuvette in 500 μl of 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.5 mm EDTA. After 3 min, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. Light scattering (A400) was measured for 7 min in a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer. All measurements were made at ambient temperature. Multilamellar liposomes (100 μg) were mixed with 200 ng of SP-A or mutants in 50 μl of 10 mmTris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 20 mg/ml bovine albumin (fatty-acid free). For control conditions, multilamellar liposomes and SP-A or mutants were mixed in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA, and 20 mg/ml bovine albumin (fatty-acid free). After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, binding was determined by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (29Kawada H. Horiuchi T. Shannon J.M. Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. Mason R.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to determine the SP-A concentration of the supernatant and pellet fractions. Percent binding was calculated from [SP-Apellet]/[SP-Asupernatant + SP-Apellet] × 100. The SP-A proteins were characterized by electrophoresis in 8–16% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar) as well as immunoblotting with anti-SP-A IgG (31Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5844) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic protein assay kit (BCA) (Pierce, Rockford, IL). In an effort to understand the role of Arg197 in SP-A structure and function, this position was substituted with Ala, Lys, His, Asp, and Asn and the recombinant proteins expressed using baculovirus vectors. We have previously shown that rat SP-A expressed in insect cells (S. frugiperda and T. ni), yields a modified form of the protein with altered glycosylation, hydroxylation of prolines, and oligomerization (22McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these structural alterations to the recombinant protein, it exhibits all of the functions of its counterpart purified from lung lavage. The wild type recombinant protein recovered from insect cells is designated SP-Ahyp because of its reduced hydroxyproline content. In SP-A proteins, Arg197 was substituted to give R197A, R197K, R197H, R197N, and R197D variants that were expressed in T. ni cells and purified from culture media by affinity chromatography using mannose-Sepharose. The proteins were recovered in high yield and the success of the affinity chromatography demonstrates that all of the mutants retained the Ca2+-dependent lectin property of the native protein. Previously, we reported that the tandem substitution of Glu195 and Asp197 altered the carbohydrate binding specificity. The binding specificity of the Ala197mutant was examined in detail, using mannose- and galactose-Sepharose, and found to be identical to wild type recombinant protein. The electrophoretic properties of the proteins were also determined (data not shown). All of the mutant proteins display electrophoretic properties under both reducing and nonreducing conditions that are virtually identical to SP-Ahyp. Further analysis of the recombinant proteins using immunoblotting (data not shown) also demonstrates that the purified proteins are genuine SP-A variants and reveals that they oligomerize to the same extent as previously shown for SP-Ahyp (19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results from the above experiments clearly establish the lectin activity of the mutant recombinant proteins and demonstrate that their covalent organization is the same as that of the wild type recombinant protein. SP-A interacts with a specific receptor on type II cells and the binding site appears to reside within the CRD (19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor binding is required for inhibition of surfactant secretion and enhancement of phospholipid uptake activities by SP-A (18Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether Arg197 of the CRD is essential for this function, we examined the ability of the R197A, R197H, R197K, R197N, and R197D mutants to compete with125I-native rat SP-A for high affinity binding to isolated type II cells. Surprisingly, the Ala197 mutation competed for receptor binding as well as the wild type recombinant protein. This result was unexpected since previous work had implicated Arg197 as an essential residue in multiple SP-A functions (19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the IC50 for the Ala197 mutant is approximately 8 μg/ml compared with that of 9 μg/ml for its wild type counterpart. Both His197 and Lys197 substitutions gave weaker competition for 125I-rat SP-A binding, with the IC50 values greater than 20 μg/ml for both mutants. The activities for Asp197 and Asn197 mutants were lower than those shown for the preceding mutants with slight inhibition observed at concentrations of 40 μg/ml (data not shown). The results demonstrate that a basic amino acid at position 197 is not required for high affinity binding of SP-A to its receptor. In addition, charge reversal is not tolerated at that position. SP-A inhibits phosphatidylcholine secretion by cultured type II cells after interaction with a specific receptor (28Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of the Arg197 substitution on this biological activity. The Ala197 and Lys197mutants were the strongest inhibitors of secretion with the IC50 values of 0.05 and 0.06 μg/ml, respectively, compared with both native rat SP-A and recombinant SP-A which had IC50 values of 0.075 and 0.1 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 2). The His197 mutant was a weaker inhibitor with an IC50 value of 0.2 μg/ml (Fig. 2). Consistent with the finding for receptor binding, the Asp197 and Asn197 mutations were significantly weaker requiring 10 μg/ml levels to approach maximal inhibition of secretion (Fig. 3).Figure 3Specificity of SP-A antagonism of phospholipid secretion. The secretion of [3H]PC from alveolar-type II cells in response to TPA and SP-A variants was measured in either the absence (▪) or presence (□) of 0.25m α-methylmannoside. Native rat SP-A is indicated as SP-A. Concanavalin A is indicated as ConA. Data shown are means ± S.E. for four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additionally, we also determined whether the above described inhibition of phospholipid secretion occurs via specific or generic receptor binding on the type II cell surface. The experiments were carried out by incubating TPA-stimulated type II cell cultures with either SP-A variants or the lectin concanavalin A in the presence or absence of 0.25 m α-methylmannoside. The competition of α-methylmannoside with concanavalin A (ConA) for a generic lectin receptor results in a reversal of inhibition of phospholipid secretion (28Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that the Ala197, Lys197, and His197 mutants inhibit secretion by the specific SP-A receptor. In contrast, the inhibition effected by high concentrations of concanavalin A and the Asn197variant was reversed in the presence of α-methylmannoside, indicating that these proteins act through a generic lectin receptor, rather than the specific SP-A receptor. The Asp197 mutation displayed weak inhibition of secretion that was not efficiently reversed by α-methylmannoside. Collectively, the results indicate that the Ala, Lys, and His substitutions give relatively potent and specific inhibition of secretion whereas the Asp and Asn mutations give weak inhibition, with the Asn effect being nonspecific. SP-A has been implicated in phospholipid recycling in the lung. The protein may enhance phospholipid uptake into type II cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (33Ryan R.M. Morris R.E. Rice W.R. Ciraolo G. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we examined the effect of the five mutants at position 197 upon SP-A-mediated phospholipid uptake. The Lys197 mutation facilitated the highest phospholipid uptake (15.12 ± 2.5% at 10 μg/ml,n = 5), whereas the His mutation yielded barely detectable activity (3.08 ± 0.8% at 10 μg/ml,n = 5), as shown in Fig. 4. The Ala197 mutation had the same potency as both native rat SP-A and the wild type recombinant protein. Neither the Asp nor Asn mutants were capable of augmenting lipid uptake (not shown). These results indicate that a basic amino acid at position 197 is not required for lipid uptake. Moreover, the conservative substitution of Lys for Arg clearly enhances lipid uptake 2-fold (Fig. 4). In contrast, the His mutation yields a protein that is relatively inactive in promoting lipid uptake by type II cells despite near normal interactions with the cells otherwise. The CRD of SP-A participates in both phospholipid binding and aggregation activities (18Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Arg197 in both phospholipid binding and aggregation was also examined. Both lipid binding and aggregation by wild type and mutant SP-A's requires calcium as shown in Figs.5 and 6. The phospholipid binding of the Ala, Lys, His, Asp, and Asn197 mutants was comparable and about 30% less potent (50% binding) than that of native SP-A (81.6% binding) (Fig. 5). However, the binding ability of these mutants was not significantly different from the wild type recombinant protein. Examination of Ca2+-dependent lipid aggregation revealed that the R197A, R197H, and R197K mutants were comparable in activity to the SP-A isolated from lung lavage and of slightly higher activity than the wild type recombinant protein (Fig. 6). In contrast, the Asp197 replacement yielded a protein that was very weak at lipid aggregation and the Asn197 protein was inactive. The results provide clear evidence that a basic amino acid at position 197 of SP-A is not required for either phospholipid binding or aggregation.Figure 6Lipid aggregation by position 197 mutants. Unilamellar liposomes (DPPC:egg PC:egg PG, 7:2:1) were incubated with native rat SP-A (▪), SP-Ahyp (▴), Ala197 (□), His197 (•), Lys197(Δ), Asp197 (○), and Asn197 (×) at 25 °C for 3 min before the addition of Ca2+. Lipid aggregation was measured as light scattering (A400) for 7 min. All proteins were at 10 μg/ml except Asp197 and Asn197 which were at 20 μg/ml. Data from different experiments were normalized to an end absorbance of 1.0 for native rat SP-A. The data are means of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results from previous studies of SP-A structure and function implicated both Glu195 and Arg197 as essential residues in carbohydrate binding, receptor binding, and lipid aggregation and binding (19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on the basic residue, Arg197. Our initial hypothesis was that the positive charge due to Arg197 was an important factor for the CRD functions. This hypothesis was predicated on previous studies using Arg modifying reagents with SP-A (28Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effect of the charged group by substitution with Ala (uncharged, short side chain), His (imidazole side chain, uncharged at pH 7.4), or Lys (amino alkyl side chain, positively charged), Asp (charge reversal), or Asn (uncharged, medium side chain). If the positive charge group of Arg197is essential for the CRD functions, one would anticipate that the Ala substitution would abolish all activities, His substitution would show pH-dependent acquisition of function, Lys substitution may retain some or all functions, and Asp and Asn substitutions would be inactive. All five mutants were purified on mannose-Sepharose affinity columns, indicating that correct folding and the lectin properties of the protein were preserved. All mutants were shown by both gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis to be comparable in denatured molecular size and covalent oligomerization to the wild type recombinant protein expressed in insect cells (22McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three mutants (Ala, His, and Lys197) competed for binding to the high affinity receptor present on isolated type II cells. The Ala197 mutant was as effective as its wild type counterpart and more effective than the His197 and the Lys197 mutants. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the positive charge at position 197 is not an essential factor in receptor occupancy. The Asp and Asn197 substitutions were essentially inactive ligands for the specific high affinity receptor. The Asp197 result demonstrates that charge reversal is not tolerated at this position. The Asn197 substitution indicates that a neutral medium side chain group is also unfavored. The Ala, Lys, and His substitutions of Arg197 did not significantly change the inhibitory action of SP-A upon TPA-stimulated surfactant secretion. We conclude that these SP-A variants recognized the high affinity receptor because the inhibition of secretion was not reversed by α-methylmannoside which competes for the nonspecific concanavalin A-binding sites. These findings also demonstrate that basic residues at position 197 are not required for inhibition of secretion. The Asn197 protein failed to demonstrate specific inhibition of surfactant lipid secretion and the Asp197 protein was a very weak inhibitor. Interestingly, the results from the receptor binding competition assay showed that the His197 and Lys197 mutants did not compete very well (IC50 > 20 μg/ml) against125I-native SP-A for the specific receptor on type II cells surface. However, in the surfactant secretion measurements, the Lys197 mutant was nearly twice as effective as the wild type Arg197 form but the His197 mutant was about 50% as potent. This disparity between the specific receptor binding and the inhibition of surfactant secretion is similar to results from studies by Kuroki et al. (28Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and McCormacket al. (22McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is not well understood. There is clearly not an exact correlation between the receptor binding results and the inhibition of secretion. The difference between the two activities may occur as a consequence of a more efficient coupling of inhibition of secretion to specific receptors, as proposed by Kuroki et al. (28Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, two different receptor populations could account for the differences between binding and inhibition of surfactant secretion. The uptake of surfactant lipid by type II cells, mediated by SP-A, may be one of several phospholipid clearance mechanisms in the lung (5Wright J.R. Wager R.E. Hawgood S. Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results from the double substitution of Glu195 and Arg197 (19McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that both amino acids are involved in the uptake process. However, our current findings show that Arg197 is unlikely to be essential for this activity. As the results clearly show, the Ala197 mutation readily enhanced the uptake of phospholipid similar to native SP-A and surpassed that of recombinant wild type SP-A. This latter finding effectively ruled out an obligatory role for a positive charge at position 197. By comparison, the His197 mutant containing an uncharged imidazole group was essentially inactive at 10 μg/ml. The results indicate that a positive charge is not required at position 197 and that a bulky uncharged or weakly protonated group is ineffective. Consistent with their relative inactivity in other SP-A functions, the Asn and Asp197 mutants failed to promote lipid uptake. Despite the absence of a requirement for a positive charge at position 197 for function, a Lys substitution clearly enhances lipid uptake almost 2-fold at a protein concentration of 10 μg/ml. The action of the Lys197 protein highlights an inconsistency in the data. Although the Lys197 protein is a poorer competitor of125I-labeled SP-A binding to the cell surface than the native or wild type recombinant protein, it is more effective than the native or wild type recombinant protein at facilitating lipid uptake. The results suggest that either the interaction with lipid or the specific process of lipid uptake (distinct from receptor binding) is enhanced by Lys197. Our preferred interpretation is that Lys197 functions more efficiently than other proteins in the lipid uptake process. Comparatively, the Lys197 mutant does not compete for receptor occupancy, bind, or aggregate lipid any better than the His197 protein. However, the difference between His and Lys197 mutants at lipid uptake is dramatic, with the His substitution being essentially inactive. The results clearly indicate that the amino acid at position 197 can play a unique role in the lipid uptake reaction. Phospholipid aggregation is another method used to measure SP-A lipid interactions. This process may reflect the role of SP-A in lipid reorganization and formation in the alveolus (34Haagsman H. Elfring R. van Buel B.L.M. Voorhout W.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of aggregation is still unknown. It is unlikely that lipid aggregation occurs via a lectin carbohydrate interaction between SP-A oligosaccharides and the CRD's in conjunction with phospholipid binding (22McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ruano M.L.F. Miguel E. Perez-Gil J. Casals C. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although previous work implicated Arg197in lipid aggregation, the current study shows that the Ala, Lys, and His mutants at this position aggregated unilamellar liposomes better than wild type recombinant SP-A. The findings presented in this report also provide strong evidence that lipid aggregation and lipid uptake by type II cells are not completely interdependent. The distinction between lipid aggregating and uptake phenomena is important since the work of Horowitz et al. (36Horowitz A.D. Moussavian B. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L69-L79PubMed Google Scholar) has suggested that SP-A promotes the association of lipid aggregates with the surface of type II cells. Specifically, the results with the His197 mutant clearly demonstrate that lipid aggregation activity, alone, is not sufficient to ensure uptake of lipid by type II cells. This important observation suggests that lipid uptake requires specific interplay between SP-A and the type II cell as well as lipid. The results clearly argue against a mechanism of lipid uptake by type II cells that is merely the nonspecific uptake of lipoprotein aggregates. The findings highlight the His197 and Lys197 proteins as important new tools for examining the lipid uptake process. The structural alteration imposed by His197 appears quite specific for reducing the lipid uptake reaction without eliminating other SP-A functions. The in vitro functions measured in these studies are thought to reflect the interactions of SP-A with lipids and alveolar type II cells that occur in vivo. Mice homozygous for null alleles of SP-A have been produced, and they exhibit no evidence for gross defects in surfactant secretion, recycling, or biophysical surfactant function (37Ikegami M.

The genetic experiments indicate that SP-A is not essential and imply the presence of redundant mechanisms for its functions. The silent phenotype of the SP-A null animals currently makes the exact relationship between the in vitroexperiments and the in vivo activity of SP-A unclear. In summary, this study demonstrates that Arg197 of SP-A is not essential for binding to carbohydrate, binding to the high affinity receptor on type II cells, inhibition of surfactant secretion, enhancement of phospholipid uptake, and phospholipid aggregation and binding. The positive charge of this residue is not involved in mediating the functions of the CRD. The results also show that the SP-A-mediated augmentation of phospholipid uptake by type II cells can be specifically enhanced and inhibited and is not directly correlated with the phospholipid aggregation.
