https://openalex.org/W2081021969,"Although potentiostats are the foundation of modern electrochemical research, they have seen relatively little application in resource poor settings, such as undergraduate laboratory courses and the developing world. One reason for the low penetration of potentiostats is their cost, as even the least expensive commercially available laboratory potentiostats sell for more than one thousand dollars. An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate, it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food- and drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection, and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly instructions are available in the supporting information and are released under an open hardware license."
https://openalex.org/W2054989377,"Physiological aging of the brain is accompanied by ubiquitous degeneration of neurons and oligodendrocytes. An alteration of the cellular matrix of an organ impacts its macroscopic viscoelastic properties which can be detected by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) – to date the only method for measuring brain mechanical parameters without intervention. However, the wave patterns detected by MRE are affected by atrophic changes in brain geometry occurring in an individual's life span. Moreover, regional variability in MRE-detected age effects is expected corresponding to the regional variation in atrophy. Therefore, the sensitivity of brain MRE to brain volume and aging was investigated in 66 healthy volunteers aged 18–72. A linear decline in whole-brain elasticity was observed (−0.75%/year, R-square = 0.59, p<0.001); the rate is three times that determined by volume measurements (−0.23%/year, R-square = 0.4, p<0.001). The highest decline in elasticity (−0.92%/year, R-square = 0.43, p<0.001) was observed in a region of interest placed in the frontal lobe with minimal age-related shrinkage (−0.1%, R-square = 0.06, p = 0.043). Our results suggest that cerebral MRE can measure geometry-independent viscoelastic parameters related to intrinsic tissue structure and altered by age."
https://openalex.org/W2087794984,"The aggregation of the natively disordered protein, Tau, to form lesions called neurofibrillary tangles is a characteristic feature of several neurodegenerative tauopathies. The polyanion, heparin, is commonly used as an inducer in studies of Tau aggregation in vitro, but there is surprisingly no comprehensive model describing, quantitatively, all aspects of the heparin-induced aggregation reaction. In this study, rate constants and extents of fibril formation by the four repeat domain of Tau (Tau4RD) have been reproducibly determined over a full range of heparin and protein concentrations. The kinetic role of heparin in the nucleation-dependent fibril formation reaction is shown to be limited to participation in the initial rate-limiting steps; a single heparin molecule binds two Tau4RD molecules, forming an aggregation-competent protein dimer, which then serves as a building block for further fibril growth. Importantly, the minimal kinetic model that is proposed can quantitatively account for the characteristic bell-shaped dependence of the aggregation kinetics on the stoichiometry of protein to heparin. Very importantly, this study also identifies for the first time short and thin, rod-like protofibrils that are populated transiently, early during the time course of fibril formation. The identification of these protofibrils as bona fide off-pathway species has implications for the development of therapies for tauopathies based on driving fibril formation as a means of protecting the cell from smaller, putatively toxic aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2045776845,"The six major genetic lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are strongly associated with specific geographical regions, but their relevance to bacterial virulence and the clinical consequences of infection are unclear. Previously, we found that in Vietnam, East Asian/Beijing and Indo-Oceanic strains were significantly more likely to cause disseminated tuberculosis with meningitis than those from the Euro-American lineage. To investigate this observation we characterised 7 East Asian/Beijing, 5 Indo-Oceanic and 6 Euro-American Vietnamese strains in bone-marrow-derived macrophages, dendritic cells and mice. East Asian/Beijing and Indo-Oceanic strains induced significantly more TNF-α and IL-1β from macrophages than the Euro-American strains, and East Asian/Beijing strains were detectable earlier in the blood of infected mice and grew faster in the lungs. We hypothesised that these differences were induced by lineage-specific variation in cell envelope lipids. Whole lipid extracts from East Asian/Beijing and Indo-Oceanic strains induced higher concentrations of TNF-α from macrophages than Euro-American lipids. The lipid extracts were fractionated and compared by thin layer chromatography to reveal a distinct pattern of lineage-associated profiles. A phthiotriol dimycocerosate was exclusively produced by East Asian/Beijing strains, but not the phenolic glycolipid previously associated with the hyper-virulent phenotype of some isolates of this lineage. All Indo-Oceanic strains produced a unique unidentified lipid, shown to be a phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosate dependent upon an intact pks15/1 for its production. This was described by Goren as the ‘attenuation indictor lipid’ more than 40 years ago, due to its association with less virulent strains from southern India. Mutation of pks15/1 in a representative Indo-Oceanic strain prevented phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosate synthesis, but did not alter macrophage cytokine induction. Our findings suggest that the early interactions between M. tuberculosis and host are determined by the lineage of the infecting strain; but we were unable to show these differences are driven by lineage-specific cell-surface expressed lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2092928019,"Background Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays a crucial role in growth and patterning during embryonic development, and also in stem cell maintenance and tissue regeneration in adults. Aberrant Shh pathway activation is involved in the development of many tumors, and one of the most affected Shh signaling steps found in these tumors is the regulation of the signaling receptor Smoothened by the Shh receptor Patched. In the present work, we investigated Patched activity and the mechanism by which Patched inhibits Smoothened. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the well-known Shh-responding cell line of mouse fibroblasts NIH 3T3, we first observed that enhancement of the intracellular cholesterol concentration induces Smoothened enrichment in the plasma membrane, which is a crucial step for the signaling activation. We found that binding of Shh protein to its receptor Patched, which involves Patched internalization, increases the intracellular concentration of cholesterol and decreases the efflux of a fluorescent cholesterol derivative (BODIPY-cholesterol) from these cells. Treatment of fibroblasts with cyclopamine, an antagonist of Shh signaling, inhibits Patched expression and reduces BODIPY-cholesterol efflux, while treatment with the Shh pathway agonist SAG enhances Patched protein expression and BODIPY-cholesterol efflux. We also show that over-expression of human Patched in the yeast S. cerevisiae results in a significant boost of BODIPY-cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, we demonstrate that purified Patched binds to cholesterol, and that the interaction of Shh with Patched inhibits the binding of Patched to cholesterol. Conclusion/Significance Our results suggest that Patched may contribute to cholesterol efflux from cells, and to modulation of the intracellular cholesterol concentration. This activity is likely responsible for the inhibition of the enrichment of Smoothened in the plasma membrane, which is an important step in Shh pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W2089403477,"The RIP kinases have emerged as essential mediators of cellular stress that integrate both extracellular stimuli emanating from various cell-surface receptors and signals coming from intracellular pattern recognition receptors. The molecular mechanisms regulating the ability of the RIP proteins to transduce the stress signals remain poorly understood, but seem to rely only partially on their kinase activities. Recent studies on RIP1 and RIP2 have highlighted the importance of ubiquitination as a key process regulating their capacity to activate downstream signaling pathways. In this study, we found that XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 not only directly bind to RIP1 and RIP2 but also to RIP3 and RIP4. We show that cIAP1 and cIAP2 are direct E3 ubiquitin ligases for all four RIP proteins and that cIAP1 is capable of conjugating the RIPs with diverse types of ubiquitin chains, including linear chains. Consistently, we show that repressing cIAP1/2 levels affects the activation of NF-κB that is dependent on RIP1, -2, -3 and -4. Finally, we identified Lys51 and Lys145 of RIP4 as two critical residues for cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination and NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2053423866,"Ras small GTPases undergo dynamic equilibrium of two interconverting conformations, state 1 and state 2, in the GTP-bound forms, where state 2 is recognized by effectors, whereas physiological functions of state 1 have been unknown. Limited information, such as static crystal structures and 31P NMR spectra, was available for the study of the conformational dynamics. Here we determine the solution structure and dynamics of state 1 by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR analysis of an H-RasT35S mutant in complex with guanosine 5′-(β, γ-imido)triphosphate (GppNHp). The state 1 structure shows that the switch I loop fluctuates extensively compared with that in state 2 or H-Ras-GDP. Also, backbone 1H,15N signals for state 2 are identified, and their dynamics are studied by utilizing a complex with c-Raf-1. Furthermore, the signals for almost all the residues of H-Ras·GppNHp are identified by measurement at low temperature, and the signals for multiple residues are found split into two peaks corresponding to the signals for state 1 and state 2. Intriguingly, these residues are located not only in the switch regions and their neighbors but also in the rigidly structured regions, suggesting that global structural rearrangements occur during the state interconversion. The backbone dynamics of each state show that the switch loops in state 1 are dynamically mobile on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale, and these mobilities are significantly reduced in state 2. These results suggest that multiconformations existing in state 1 are mostly deselected upon the transition toward state 2 induced by the effector binding.

Small GTPases H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras, collectively called Ras, are the products of the ras proto-oncogenes and function as molecular switches by cycling between the GTP-bound active and the GDP-bound inactive forms in intracellular signaling pathways controlling proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of cells. GTP hydrolysis on Ras is markedly stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins, whereas conversion from the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form is promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (1Vetter I.R.

Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Structural studies of Ras showed that structural differences between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms universally exist in two flexible regions, called switch I (residues 32–38 in H-Ras) and switch II (residues 60–75 in H-Ras) (1Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). GTP-sensitive orientation of the switch regions enables Ras to interact with their effectors such as Raf kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (2Corbett K.D. Alber T. Trends Biochem.

The x-ray structures of H-Ras·GppNHp by itself or in complex with its effectors revealed the state 2 conformation in which the switch I and switch II regions are fixed by hydrogen bonds of the backbone amides of Thr-35 and Gly-60, respectively, with the γ-phosphate oxygen atoms of the nucleoside triphosphate (1Vetter I.R.

In these state 1 structures, Thr-45 (corresponding to Thr-35 in H-Ras) of M-Ras and Ser-35 of H-RasT35S are not capable of interacting with the guanine nucleotide and magnesium ion, causing marked deviation of the switch I loop from the nucleotide (13Shima F.

A similar switch I loop deviation was observed in the conformation of nucleotide-free H-Ras in complex with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. In the structure of the H-Ras-Sos complex, the helical hairpin segment of Sos opens wide the nucleotide-binding site, causing deviation of the switch I loop of H-Ras further away from this site (16Boriack-Sjodin P.A.

Heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy is the most suitable technique to examine detailed conformational dynamics of proteins in solution. Nevertheless, structural studies on the GTP-bound Ras using this technique have been hampered by chemical exchange processes at intermediate rates on the NMR time scale that result in broadening or even disappearance of the resonance signals (18Hu J.S.

Although the solution structure of RalB·GppNHp in state 1 was recently determined by this technique, backbone amide resonances were not observed for several residues in the switch regions. In the case of H-Ras in complex with GppNHp or GTPγS, backbone amide 1H,15N HSQC cross-peaks underwent extreme broadening for most of the residues in the P-loop (residues 10–17) and switch I and switch II regions (19Ito Y.

These results imply that the exchange processes are an intrinsic property of H-Ras in the nucleoside triphosphate form. The analysis of 15N spin relaxation relaxation-compensated Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill measurements showed that the exchange processes involve a major part of the H-Ras structure (21O'Connor C. Kovrigin E.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10244-10246Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, conformational species representing the exchange processes have not been characterized. In this study, we report successful assignments of the backbone resonances for state 1 and state 2 by 1H and 15N NMR analysis of H-RasT35S·GppNHp and H-Ras·GppNHp in complex with c-Raf-1 RBD, respectively. Moreover, the backbone resonances for almost all the residues of H-Ras·GppNHp are successfully identified by measurement at low temperature. Comparison of these resonance data proves that the chemical exchange process observed in 1H and 15N NMR of H-Ras·GppNHp corresponds to the interconversion between state 1 and state 2. Also, analysis of the backbone dynamics by measuring 15N relaxation times and heteronuclear NOEs reveals a significant difference in rapid internal motions of the switch regions between state 1 and state 2. Furthermore, the solution structure of state 1 is solved with H-RasT35S·GppNHp for the first time. It shows unique conformations of the switch regions, some of which are very similar to those of the nucleotide-free form found in the H-Ras-Sos complex. These structural features characteristic of state 1 will be discussed in relation to results of H-Ras/Sos binding experiments. Residues 1–166 of human H-Ras and H-RasT35S were expressed as fusions with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli using pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare). M9 minimal media containing 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose/15NH4Cl were used to express the uniformly 15N-labeled and 15N/13C-labeled proteins, respectively. Proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose and eluted by cleavage with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). After further purification by ion exchange chromatography to a final purity of >95% as measured by SDS-PAGE, they were loaded with GppNHp (Sigma). Human c-Raf-1 RBD consisting of residues 51–130 was purified as described (7Liao J. Shima F. Araki M. Ye M. Muraoka S. Sugimoto T. Kawamura M. Yamamoto N. Tamura A. Kataoka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

For the 100% 2H 2O samples, the protein solutions were incubated at 34 °C for 4 days after buffer displacement and filtration with a filter (0.2 μm pore size). Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements as described (22Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker DMX-750 spectrometer on protein samples of 1.0–2.0 mm concentration at 25 °C unless stated otherwise.

Triple-resonance spectra of HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, and HBHA(CO)NH were acquired on 13C,15N-labeled H-Ras·GppNHp. 15N-Separated TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC spectra were recorded on 15N-labeled H-Ras·GppNHp and H-RasT35S·GppNHp. Two-dimensional homonuclear 1H NOESY spectra were recorded on the unlabeled proteins. Mixing times of all NOESY experiments were 100 ms. The backbone 1HN and 15N resonances of H-Ras·GppNHp alone were assigned at 5 °C by analyzing the 1H,15N HSQC and 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC spectra at 5, 15, and 25 °C. In the presence of c-Raf-1 RBD, the 1HN and 15N resonances at 5 °C were identified by pursuing the traces of the individual cross-peaks in the 1H,15N HSQC spectra at 5, 15, and 25 °C. All chemical shifts were referenced to 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate sodium salt. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C on 1.5 mm 15N-labeled H-RasT35S·GppNHp. 15N T1, T2, and heteronuclear NOE measurements were performed using the pulse sequence previously reported (24Farrow N.A.

The intensity decays were fitted using an equation I(t) = I0 exp(−t/T1,2). 1H,15N steady-state heteronuclear NOE measurements were carried out by recording a pair of spectra with and without proton saturation using a total recycle delay of 3.2 s in which proton saturation of 3 s was achieved by applying 120° proton pulses every 5 ms. The NOE values were analyzed by calculating the peak height ratios obtained from reference and saturated experiments (Isat/Iref). The series of experiments was also performed on a mixture containing 1.5 mm 15N-labeled H-Ras·GppNHp and 1.8 mm unlabeled c-Raf-1 RBD in which state 2 was predominantly populated (5Geyer M.

In the N-terminal sequence (GPLGSD) corresponding to remainder of the cleavage site by PreScission protease, intense NMR signals indicated that this region is unstructured with high mobility. Interproton distance restraints were obtained from the 13C-separated NOESY-HSQC, 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC, and two-dimensional homonuclear 1H NOESY spectra recorded at 25 °C. Standard pseudo atom distances were used when they were needed. Structures were calculated by using the program CYANA 2.1 (26Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

A large number of ambiguous NOE peaks were identified by iterative calculations using structures computed from unambiguously assigned peaks, whereas 568 NOEs were excluded from the calculation because of overlapping with other signals or difficulty to remove ambiguity. A total of 3116 meaningful NOE upper distance restraints were finally obtained by CYANA, including 1021 long range distances.

The GppNHp nucleotide was modeled by adding distance restraints to coordinate the Mg2+ ion to three water molecules, the O2β and O2γ of GppNHp and the side-chain oxygen atom of Ser-17 as shown in the x-ray structure of H-RasT35S·GppNHp (13Shima F.

A total of 100 structures was generated by using CYANA, then the 20 structures with the lowest target function that had no NOE violations more than 0.2 Å and no dihedral angle violations more than 5° were refined using CNS. The lowest energy structures finally obtained were selected to represent three-dimensional structure and analyzed using PROCHECK-NMR software (29Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W.

In the two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectrum for H-Ras·GppNHp, it was previously reported that the backbone amide 1H,15N cross-peaks could not be detected for residues 10–13 in the P-loop, 31–39 in or near switch I, and 57–64 and 71 in or near switch II (19Ito Y. Yamasaki K. Iwahara J. Terada T. Kamiya A. Shirouzu M. Muto Y. Kawai G. Yokoyama S. Laue E.D. Wälchli M. Shibata T. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9109-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Its temperature and magnetic field dependencies indicated that these regions undergo the structural conversion between two or more stable conformations, named as “polysterism”(19Ito Y. Yamasaki K. Iwahara J. Terada T. Kamiya A. Shirouzu M. Muto Y. Kawai G. Yokoyama S. Laue E.D. Wälchli M. Shibata T. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9109-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The structural basis for this polysterism has been unknown even though it looks in parallel with the interconversion between state 1 and state 2 observed in the 31P NMR spectrum of H-Ras·GppNHp (5Geyer M. Schweins T. Herrmann C. Prisner T. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10308-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). On the other hand, H-RasT35S·GppNHp exists almost exclusively in state 1 as revealed by its 31P NMR spectrum, showing that each phosphate resonance, especially that of the γ-phosphate, yields a single peak equivalent to the state 1 peak of H-Ras·GppNHp (9Spoerner M. Herrmann C. Vetter I.R. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4944-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated this mutant protein by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. In contrast to the case of H-Ras·GppNHp, complete assignments of the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances were achieved for all the 166 residues of H-RasT35S·GppNHp by analysis of the seven triple-resonance NMR spectra (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The assigned resonances were expected to represent the chemical shift positions for state 1. 31P NMR studies showed that binding to c-Raf-1 RBD shifts the conformational equilibrium of H-Ras·GppNHp toward state 2 (5Geyer M. Schweins T. Herrmann C. Prisner T. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10308-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Spoerner M. Herrmann C. Vetter I.R. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4944-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the 1H,15N HSQC spectra of H-Ras·GppNHp, the addition of c-Raf-1 RBD generated cross-peaks corresponding to the P-loop and the switch regions, which were missing in its free form (19Ito Y. Yamasaki K. Iwahara J. Terada T. Kamiya A. Shirouzu M. Muto Y. Kawai G. Yokoyama S. Laue E.D. Wälchli M. Shibata T. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9109-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We thus attempted to assign the complete backbone resonances of 13C,15N -labeled H-Ras·GppNHp in complex with unlabeled c-Raf-1 RBD. However, the backbone 1HN and 15N resonances, which are correlated with the intraresidue and sequential 13Cα resonances, were observed for only 134 residues through the HNCA and HN(CO)CA spectra because the sensitivity of the triple-resonance three-dimensional NMR spectra became notably lower in the presence of c-Raf-1 RBD. Therefore, we assigned all the backbone 1HN and 15N resonances excluding Glu-31 by combining the analysis of 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC spectrum, which gives especially intense cross-peaks correlating 1HN of one residue to 1Hα and 1Hβ of the intra- and preceding residues. Nonetheless, ambiguities inherent in the assignments for the residues 30–36 could not be removed as NOEs or 13Cα,1HN correlations were detected partially for these residues concomitantly with broadening of the 1H,15N HSQC cross-peaks even in the presence of an equimolar amount of c-Raf-1 RBD. In a similar manner, we assigned all the backbone 1HN and 15N resonances of 13C,15N-labeled H-RasT35S·GppNHp in complex with unlabeled c-Raf-1 RBD, except for Glu-31, Asp-33, Ser-35, and Ile-36. The assigned resonances for H-Ras·GppNHp and H-RasT35S·GppNHp, bound to c-Raf-1 RBD, were almost identical excluding the residue 35 and its adjacent region, and expected to represent the chemical shift positions for state 2. We assigned the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances for most of the 166 residues of H-Ras·GppNHp through analysis of the triple-resonance NMR spectra by referring to the previous assignments (19Ito Y. Yamasaki K. Iwahara J. Terada T. Kamiya A. Shirouzu M. Muto Y. Kawai G. Yokoyama S. Laue E.D. Wälchli M. Shibata T. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9109-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We failed to detect the 1H,15N cross-peaks for most of the residues in the P-loop and the switch regions when the measurements were done at 25 °C as reported (19Ito Y. Yamasaki K. Iwahara J. Terada T. Kamiya A. Shirouzu M. Muto Y. Kawai G. Yokoyama S. Laue E.D. Wälchli M. Shibata T. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9109-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the spectrum measured at 5 °C yielded 20 additional cross-peaks, some of which are indicated by solid boxes in Fig. 1. When these new peaks were compared with the state 1 and state 2 peaks, measured at 5 °C on H-RasT35S·GppNHp and the H-Ras·GppNHp·c-Raf-1 RBD complex, respectively, most of them were found overlapped with state 1 or state 2 peaks of the residues whose signals were undetectable upon the measurement of H-Ras·GppNHp at 25 °C. For example, two new peaks of H-Ras·GppNHp indicated by ‡ and † in Fig. 1 coincided with the state 1 (H-RasT35S·GppNHp) and state 2 (H-Ras·GppNHp·c-Raf-1 RBD complex) peaks of Gly13, respectively. Similarly, two separate peaks corresponding to both state 1 and state 2 were identified for Gly-10, Gly-12, and Gly-60 (Fig. 1). For most of the residues in the switch regions, one or both of the peaks for the two states were overlapped with other peaks, preventing accurate identification. Furthermore, the measurement at 5 °C caused splitting of several cross-peaks as indicated by boxes drawn by dotted lines in Fig. 1. In most of these cases, one of the split peaks overlapped with the state 1 peak, whereas the other was located near the state 2 peak. For example, Gly-15 gave a single peak at 25 °C, whereas it was split into two peaks at 5 °C as indicated by * and # in Fig. 1, which coincided with the state 1 and state 2 peaks, respectively. The new results obtained for the H-Ras·GppNHp spectra at 5 °C could be ascribable to the difference in the static magnetic field strength, i.e. 17.6T compared with 9.4 (14.1)T in the previous work (19Ito Y. Yamasaki K. Iwahara J. Terada T. Kamiya A. Shirouzu M. Muto Y. Kawai G. Yokoyama S. Laue E.D. Wälchli M. Shibata T. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T.

Intensity ratios and chemical shift differences of the split peaks unambiguously assigned were plotted against the amino acid sequence (Fig. 2, A and B). Most of the intensity ratios (Istate1/Istate2) were distributed in the range of 0.3–0.8 with the mean value of 0.53, which was close to the equilibrium constant between state 1 and state 2 (1/K12) with the value of 0.6, derived from the 31P NMR (8Spoerner M.

https://openalex.org/W2067363949,"Irreversible inhibition by molecular oxygen (O(2)) complicates the use of [FeFe]-hydrogenases (HydA) for biotechnological hydrogen (H(2)) production. Modification by O(2) of the active site six-iron complex denoted as the H-cluster ([4Fe4S]-2Fe(H)) of HydA1 from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was characterized by x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the iron K-edge. In a time-resolved approach, HydA1 protein samples were prepared after increasing O(2) exposure periods at 0 °C. A kinetic analysis of changes in their x-ray absorption near edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra revealed three phases of O(2) reactions. The first phase (τ(1) ≤ 4 s) is characterized by the formation of an increased number of Fe-O,C bonds, elongation of the Fe-Fe distance in the binuclear unit (2Fe(H)), and oxidation of one iron ion. The second phase (τ(2) ≈ 15 s) causes a ∼50% decrease of the number of ∼2.7-Å Fe-Fe distances in the [4Fe4S] subcluster and the oxidation of one more iron ion. The final phase (τ(3) ≤ 1000 s) leads to the disappearance of most Fe-Fe and Fe-S interactions and further iron oxidation. These results favor a reaction sequence, which involves 1) oxygenation at 2Fe(H(+)) leading to the formation of a reactive oxygen species-like superoxide (O(2)(-)), followed by 2) H-cluster inactivation and destabilization due to ROS attack on the [4Fe4S] cluster to convert it into an apparent [3Fe4S](+) unit, leading to 3) complete O(2)-induced degradation of the remainders of the H-cluster. This mechanism suggests that blocking of ROS diffusion paths and/or altering the redox potential of the [4Fe4S] cubane by genetic engineering may yield improved O(2) tolerance in [FeFe]-hydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W2053038488,"Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a lysosomal catabolic pathway that controls cellular homeostasis and survival. It has recently emerged as an attractive target for the treatment of a variety of degenerative diseases and cancer. The targeting of autophagy has, however, been hampered by the lack of specific small molecule inhibitors. Thus, we screened two small molecule kinase inhibitor libraries for inhibitors of rapamycin-induced autophagic flux. The three most potent inhibitors identified conferred profound inhibition of autophagic flux by inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes. Notably, the autophagy inhibitory effects of all three compounds were independent of their established kinase targets, i.e. ataxia telangiectasia mutated for KU55933, protein kinase C for Gö6976, and Janus kinase 3 for Jak3 inhibitor VI. Instead, we identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) as a direct target of KU55933 and Gö6976. Importantly, and in contrast to the currently available inhibitors of autophagosome formation (e.g. 3-methyladenine), none of the three compounds inhibited the cell survival promoting class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signaling at the concentrations required for effective autophagy inhibition. Accordingly, they proved to be valuable tools for investigations of autophagy-associated cell death and survival. Employing KU55399, we demonstrated that autophagy protects amino acid-starved cells against both apoptosis and necroptosis. Taken together, our data introduce new possibilities for the experimental study of autophagy and can form a basis for the development of clinically relevant autophagy inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2025786012,"Introduction Chemotherapy may induce deleterious effects in normal tissues, leading to organ damage. Direct vascular injury is the least characterized side effect. Our aim was to establish a real-time, in vivo molecular imaging platform for evaluating the potential vascular toxicity of doxorubicin in mice. Methods Mice gonads served as reference organs. Mouse ovarian or testicular blood volume and femoral arterial blood flow were measured in real-time during and after doxorubicin (8 mg/kg intravenously) or paclitaxel (1.2 mg/kg) administration. Ovarian blood volume was imaged by ultrasound biomicroscopy (Vevo2100) with microbubbles as a contrast agent whereas testicular blood volume and blood flow as well as femoral arterial blood flow was imaged by pulse wave Doppler ultrasound. Visualization of ovarian and femoral microvasculature was obtained by fluorescence optical imaging system, equipped with a confocal fiber microscope (Cell-viZio). Results Using microbubbles as a contrast agent revealed a 33% (P<0.01) decrease in ovarian blood volume already 3 minutes after doxorubicin injection. Doppler ultrasound depicted the same phenomenon in testicular blood volume and blood flow. The femoral arterial blood flow was impaired in the same fashion. Cell-viZio imaging depicted a pattern of vessels' injury at around the same time after doxorubicin injection: the wall of the blood vessels became irregular and the fluorescence signal displayed in the small vessels was gradually diminished. Paclitaxel had no vascular effect. Conclusion We have established a platform of innovative high-resolution molecular imaging, suitable for in vivo imaging of vessels' characteristics, arterial blood flow and organs blood volume that enable prolonged real-time detection of chemotherapy-induced effects in the same individuals. The acute reduction in gonadal and femoral blood flow and the impairment of the blood vessels wall may represent an acute universal doxorubicin-related vascular toxicity, an initial event in organ injury."
https://openalex.org/W1973307041,"Macrophages play a central role in innate immunity, however mechanisms regulating macrophage survival are not fully understood. Herein we describe a novel apoptotic pathway involving α2-6 sialylation of the TNFR1 death receptor by the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase. Variant glycosylation of TNFR1 has not previously been implicated in TNFR1 function, and little is known regarding the TNFR1 glycan composition. To study sialylation in macrophages, we treated U937 monocytic cells with PMA, which stimulates both macrophage differentiation and apoptosis. Interestingly, macrophage differentiation induces ST6Gal-I down-regulation, leading to reduced α2-6 sialylation of selected receptors. To prevent loss of α2-6 sialylation, we forced constitutive expression of ST6Gal-I, and found that this strongly inhibited PMA-induced apoptosis. Given that PMA-mediated apoptosis is thought to result from up-regulation of TNFα, which then activates TNFR1, we next evaluated the α2-6 sialylation of TNFR1. U937 cells with forced ST6Gal-I displayed TNFR1 with elevated α2-6 sialylation, and this was associated with diminished TNFα-stimulated apoptosis. Correspondingly, removal of α2-6 sialylation from TNFR1 through either neuraminidase treatment or expression of ST6Gal-I shRNA markedly enhanced TNFα-mediated apoptosis. To confirm the physiologic importance of TNFR1 sialylation, we generated overexpressing ST6Gal-I transgenic mice. Peritoneal macrophages from transgenic lines displayed TNFR1 with elevated α2-6 sialylation, and these cells were significantly protected against TNFα-stimulated apoptosis. Moreover, greater numbers of thioglycollate-induced peritoneal cells were observed in transgenic mice. These collective results highlight a new mechanism of TNFR1 regulation, and further intimate that loss of α2-6 sialylation during macrophage differentiation may limit macrophage lifespan by sensitizing cells to TNFα-stimulated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2094442678,"Two large-scale mass mortality events (MMEs) of unprecedented extent and severity affecting rocky benthic communities occurred during the summers of 1999 and 2003 along the coasts of the NW Mediterranean Sea. These mortality outbreaks were associated with positive thermal anomalies. In this study, we performed an analysis of inter-regional and inter-annual differences in temperature (T) conditions associated with MMEs of the red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata by analyzing high resolution T time series (hourly records for 3 to 8 years) from four regions of the NW Mediterranean with differing hydrological conditions and biological impacts. High resolution records allowed a detailed analysis using classical and new descriptors to characterize T anomalies. We were able to determine that the MMEs were triggered by two main types of positive thermal anomalies, with the first type being characterized by short periods (2 to 5 days) with high Mean T reaching more than 27°C in some regions and being associated with high intra-day and intra-period variability, while the second type of anomaly presented long duration (near one month) at warm T (24°C) with low intra-period variability. Inter-regional patterns arose; some regions displayed both types of anomalies, while others exhibited only one type. The results showed that T conditions should be considered as the main factor that explains the observed inter-regional and inter-annual differences in mortality impacts. In explaining these differences, the late timing of T anomalies, in addition to their magnitude was found to be determinant. Finally, by combining thermotolerance experimental data with the maximal T stress conditions observed in the four regions, we were able to determine the differential risk of mass mortality across regions. We conclude that expanding high resolution T series is important for the development of sound management and conservation plans to protect Mediterranean marine biodiversity in the face of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W1993556784,"CYLD is a lysine 63-deubiquitinating enzyme that inhibits NF-κB and JNK signaling. Here, we show that CYLD knock-out mice have markedly increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in peripheral lymphoid organs but not in the thymus. In vitro stimulation of CYLD-deficient naive T cells with anti-CD3/28 in the presence of TGF-β led to a marked increase in the number of Foxp3-expressing T cells when compared with stimulated naive control CD4(+) cells. Under endogenous conditions, CYLD formed a complex with Smad7 that facilitated CYLD deubiquitination of Smad7 at lysine 360 and 374 residues. Moreover, this site-specific ubiquitination of Smad7 was required for activation of TAK1 and p38 kinases. Finally, knockdown of Smad7 or inhibition of p38 activity in primary T cells impaired Treg differentiation. Together, our results show that CYLD regulates TGF-β signaling function in T cells and the development of Tregs through deubiquitination of Smad7."

Accordingly, the Drosophila model has been successfully used to understand the pathophysiology of human metabolic diseases such as obesity. Body fat stores in species as different as humans and flies consist of neutral lipids, mainly triacylglycerols. Changes in body fat storage are a diagnostic phenotype of lipometabolism imbalances of genetic or environmental origin. Various methods have been developed to quantify Drosophila body fat storage. The most widely used method adopts a commercial coupled colorimetric assay designed for human serum triacylglycerol quantification, which is based on glycerol content determination after enzymatic conversion of glycerides into glycerol. The coupled colorimetric assay is compatible with large-scale genetic screen approaches and has been successfully applied to characterize central regulators of Drosophila lipometabolism. Recently, the applicability of the coupled colorimetric assay for Drosophila storage fat quantification has been questioned in principle. Here we compare the performance of the coupled colorimetric assay on Drosophila samples with thin layer chromatography, the “gold standard” in storage lipid analysis. Our data show that the presented variant of the coupled colorimetric assay reliably discriminates between lean and fat flies and allows robust, quick and cost-effective quantification of Drosophila body fat stores."

We have studied CFTR structure by electron crystallography. The data were compared with existing structures of other ATP-binding cassette transporters. The protein was crystallized in the outward facing state and resembled the well characterized Sav1866 transporter. We identified regions in the CFTR map, not accounted for by Sav1866, which were potential locations for the regulatory region as well as the channel gate. In this analysis, we were aided by the fact that the unit cell was composed of two molecules not related by crystallographic symmetry. We also identified regions in the fitted Sav1866 model that were missing from the map, hence regions that were either disordered in CFTR or differently organized compared with Sav1866. Apart from the N and C termini, this indicated that in CFTR, the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix 5/11 and its associated loop could be partly disordered (or alternatively located)."
https://openalex.org/W2168508594,"Pathogen-triggered activation of the inflammasome complex leading to caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production involves similar sensor proteins between mouse and human. However, the specific sensors used may differ between infectious agents and host species. In mice, Francisella infection leads to seemingly exclusive activation of the Aim2 inflammasome with no apparent role for Nlrp3. Here we examine the IL-1β response of human cells to Francisella infection. Francisella strains exhibit differences in IL-1β production by influencing induction of IL-1β and ASC transcripts. Unexpectedly, our results demonstrate that Francisella activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in human cells. Francisella infection of THP-1 cells elicits IL-1β production, which is reduced by siRNA targeting of NLRP3. Moreover, in reconstituted 293T cells, Francisella triggers assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. In addition, inhibitors of reactive oxygen species, cathepsin B, and K(+) efflux pathways, known to specifically influence NLRP3, substantially but not completely impair the Francisella-elicited IL-1β response, suggesting the involvement of another inflammasome pathway. Finally, shRNA targeting of NLRP3 and AIM2 reveals that both pathways contribute to the inflammasome response. Together these results establish NLRP3 as a cytosolic sensor for Francisella in human cells, a role not observed in mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2086058798,"Coccinellid communities across North America have experienced significant changes in recent decades, with declines in several native species reported. One potential mechanism for these declines is interference competition via intraguild predation; specifically, increased predation of native coccinellid eggs and larvae following the introduction of exotic coccinellids. Our previous studies have shown that agricultural fields in Michigan support a higher diversity and abundance of exotic coccinellids than similar fields in Iowa, and that the landscape surrounding agricultural fields across the north central U.S. influences the abundance and activity of coccinellid species. The goal of this study was to quantify the amount of egg predation experienced by a native coccinellid within Michigan and Iowa soybean fields and explore the influence of local and large-scale landscape structure. Using the native lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata as a model, we found that sentinel egg masses were subject to intense predation within both Michigan and Iowa soybean fields, with 60.7% of egg masses attacked and 43.0% of available eggs consumed within 48 h. In Michigan, the exotic coccinellids Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis were the most abundant predators found in soybean fields whereas in Iowa, native species including C. maculata, Hippodamia parenthesis and the soft-winged flower beetle Collops nigriceps dominated the predator community. Predator abundance was greater in soybean fields within diverse landscapes, yet variation in predator numbers did not influence the intensity of egg predation observed. In contrast, the strongest predictor of native coccinellid egg predation was the composition of edge habitats bordering specific fields. Field sites surrounded by semi-natural habitats including forests, restored prairies, old fields, and pasturelands experienced greater egg predation than fields surrounded by other croplands. This study shows that intraguild predation by both native and exotic predators may contribute to native coccinellid decline, and that landscape structure interacts with local predator communities to shape the specific outcomes of predator-predator interactions."

We present a velocity-based approach for modeling animal movement in space and time that allows for temporal heterogeneity in an animal's response to the environment, allows for temporal irregularity in telemetry data, and accounts for the uncertainty in the location information. Population-level inference on movement patterns and resource selection can then be made through cluster analysis of the parameters related to movement and behavior. We illustrate this approach through a study of northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) movement in the Bering Sea, Alaska, USA.

https://openalex.org/W2008208369,"ENPP1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1) is an established regulator of tissue mineralization. Previous studies demonstrated that ENPP1 is expressed in differentiated osteoblasts and that ENPP1 influences matrix mineralization by increasing extracellular levels of inorganic pyrophosphate. ENPP1 is also expressed in osteoblastic precursor cells when stimulated with FGF2, but the role of ENPP1 in preosteoblastic and other precursor cells is unknown. Here we investigate the function of ENPP1 in preosteoblasts. We find that ENPP1 expression is critical for osteoblastic differentiation and that this effect is not mediated by changes in extracellular concentration levels of phosphate or pyrophosphate or ENPP1 catalytic activity. MC3T3E1(C4) preosteoblastic cells, in which ENPP1 expression was suppressed by ENPP1-specific shRNA, and calvarial cells isolated from Enpp1 knock-out mice show defective osteoblastic differentiation upon stimulation with ascorbate, as indicated by a lack of cellular morphological change, a lack of osteoblast marker gene expression, and an inability to mineralize matrix. Additionally, MC3T3E1(C4) cells, in which wild type or catalytic inactive ENPP1 expression was increased, exhibited an increased tendency to differentiate, as evidenced by increased osteoblast marker gene expression and increased mineralization. Notably, treatment of cells with inorganic phosphate or pyrophosphate inhibited, as opposed to enhanced, expression of multiple genes that are expressed in association with osteoblast differentiation, matrix deposition, and mineralization. Our results indicate that ENPP1 plays multiple and distinct roles in the development of mineralized tissues and that the influence of ENPP1 on osteoblast differentiation and gene expression may include a mechanism that is independent of its catalytic activity."

However, the key proteolytic steps in prochemerin activation in vivo remain to be established. Previously, we have shown that C-terminal cleavage of chem163S by plasmin to chem158K, followed by a carboxypeptidase cleavage, leads to the most active isoform, chem157S. To identify and quantify the in vivo chemerin isoforms in biological specimens, we developed specific ELISAs for chem163S, chem158K, and chem157S, using antibodies raised against peptides from the C terminus of the different chemerin isoforms. We found that the mean plasma concentrations of chem163S, chem158K, and chem157S were 40 ± 7.9, 8.1 ± 2.9, and 0.7 ± 0.8 ng/ml, respectively. The total level of cleaved and noncleaved chemerins in cerebrospinal fluids was ∼10% of plasma levels whereas it was elevated ∼2-fold in synovial fluids from patients with arthritis. On the other hand, the fraction of cleaved chemerins was much higher in synovial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid samples than in plasma (∼75%, 50%, and 18% respectively). Chem158K was the dominant chemerin isoform, and it was not generated by ex vivo processing, indicating that cleavage of prochemerin at position Lys-158, whether by plasmin or another serine protease, represents a major step in prochemerin activation in vivo. Our study provides the first direct evidence that chemerin undergoes extensive proteolytic processing in vivo, underlining the importance of measuring individual isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2004256141,"The β2 subunit of class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) contains a diferric tyrosyl radical cofactor (Fe2III-Tyr•) that is essential for nucleotide reduction. The β2 subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a heterodimer of Rnr2 (β) and Rnr4 (β′). Although only β is capable of iron binding and Tyr• formation, cells lacking β′ are either dead or exhibit extremely low Tyr• levels and RNR activity depending on genetic backgrounds. Here, we present evidence supporting the model that β′ is required for iron loading and Tyr• formation in β in vivo via a pathway that is likely dependent on the cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3/Grx4 and the Fe-S cluster protein Dre2. rnr4 mutants are defective in iron loading into nascent β and are hypersensitive to iron depletion and the Tyr•-reducing agent hydroxyurea. Transient induction of β′ in a GalRNR4 strain leads to a concomitant increase in iron loading and Tyr• levels in β. Tyr• can also be rapidly generated using endogenous iron when permeabilized Δrnr4 spheroplasts are supplemented with recombinant β′ and is inhibited by adding an iron chelator prior to, but not after, β′ supplementation. The growth defects of rnr4 mutants are enhanced by deficiencies in grx3/grx4 and dre2. Moreover, depletion of Dre2 in GalDRE2 cells leads to a decrease in both Tyr• levels and ββ′ activity. This result, in combination with previous findings that a low level of Grx3/4 impairs RNR function, strongly suggests that Grx3/4 and Dre2 serve in the assembly of the deferric Tyr• cofactor in RNR.

https://openalex.org/W2141829395,"The ubiquitous mammalian Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE1 has critical functions in regulating intracellular pH, salt concentration, and cellular volume. The regulatory C-terminal domain of NHE1 is linked to the ion-translocating N-terminal membrane domain and acts as a scaffold for signaling complexes. A major interaction partner is calmodulin (CaM), which binds to two neighboring regions of NHE1 in a strongly Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Upon CaM binding, NHE1 is activated by a shift in sensitivity toward alkaline intracellular pH. Here we report the 2.23 Å crystal structure of the NHE1 CaM binding region (NHE1(CaMBR)) in complex with CaM and Ca(2+). The C- and N-lobes of CaM bind the first and second helix of NHE1(CaMBR), respectively. Both the NHE1 helices and the Ca(2+)-bound CaM are elongated, as confirmed by small angle x-ray scattering analysis. Our x-ray structure sheds new light on the molecular mechanisms of the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of NHE1 and enables us to propose a model of how Ca(2+) regulates NHE1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1973991760,"Transplanted neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs) produce mostly astrocytes in injured spinal cords. Lithium stimulates neurogenesis by inhibiting GSK3b (glycogen synthetase kinase 3-beta) and increasing WNT/beta catenin. Lithium suppresses astrogliogenesis but the mechanisms were unclear. We cultured NSCs from subventricular zone of neonatal rats and showed that lithium reduced NSC production of astrocytes as well as proliferation of glia restricted progenitor (GRP) cells. Lithium strongly inhibited STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation, a messenger system known to promote astrogliogenesis and cancer. Lithium abolished STAT3 activation and astrogliogenesis induced by a STAT3 agonist AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-D-ribofuranoside), suggesting that lithium suppresses astrogliogenesis by inhibiting STAT3. GSK3β inhibition either by a specific GSK3β inhibitor SB216763 or overexpression of GID5-6 (GSK3β Interaction Domain aa380 to 404) did not suppress astrogliogenesis and GRP proliferation. GSK3β inhibition also did not suppress STAT3 activation. Together, these results indicate that lithium inhibits astrogliogenesis through non-GSK3β-mediated inhibition of STAT. Lithium may increase efficacy of NSC transplants by increasing neurogenesis and reducing astrogliogenesis. Our results also may explain the strong safety record of lithium treatment of manic depression. Millions of people take high-dose (>1 gram/day) lithium carbonate for a lifetime. GSK3b inhibition increases WNT/beta catenin, associated with colon and other cancers. STAT3 inhibition may reduce risk for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2000414753,"A changing global climate can threaten the diversity of species and ecosystems. We explore the consequences of catastrophic disturbances in determining the evolutionary and demographic histories of secluded marble trout populations in Slovenian streams subjected to weather extremes, in particular recurrent flash floods and debris flows causing massive mortalities. Using microsatellite data, a pattern of extreme genetic differentiation was found among populations (global F(ST) of 0.716), which exceeds the highest values reported in freshwater fish. All locations showed low levels of genetic diversity as evidenced by low heterozygosities and a mean of only 2 alleles per locus, with few or no rare alleles. Many loci showed a discontinuous allele distribution, with missing alleles across the allele size range, suggestive of a population contraction. Accordingly, bottleneck episodes were inferred for all samples with a reduction in population size of 3-4 orders of magnitude. The reduced level of genetic diversity observed in all populations implies a strong impact of genetic drift, and suggests that along with limited gene flow, genetic differentiation might have been exacerbated by recurrent mortalities likely caused by flash flood and debris flows. Due to its low evolutionary potential the species might fail to cope with an intensification and altered frequency of flash flood events predicted to occur with climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2061494329,"Transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in scleroderma or systemic sclerosis (SSc), but the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. The immediate-early gene Egr-1 is an inducible transcription factor with key roles in mediating fibrotic TGF-ß responses. To elucidate Egr-1 function in SSc-associated fibrosis, we examined change in gene expression induced by Egr-1 in human fibroblasts at the genome-wide level. Using microarray expression analysis, we derived a fibroblast “Egr-1-responsive gene signature” comprising over 600 genes involved in cell proliferation, TGF-ß signaling, wound healing, extracellular matrix synthesis and vascular development. The experimentally derived “Egr-1-responsive gene signature” was then evaluated in an expression microarray dataset comprising skin biopsies from 27 patients with localized and systemic forms of scleroderma and six healthy controls. We found that the “Egr-1 responsive gene signature” was substantially enriched in the “diffuse-proliferation” subset comprising exclusively of patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) of skin biopsies. A number of Egr-1-regulated genes was also associated with the “inflammatory” intrinsic subset. Only a minority of Egr-1-regulated genes was concordantly regulated by TGF-ß. These results indicate that Egr-1 induces a distinct profibrotic/wound healing gene expression program in fibroblasts that is associated with skin biopsies from SSc patients with diffuse cutaneous disease. These observations suggest that targeting Egr-1 expression or activity might be a novel therapeutic strategy to control fibrosis in specific SSc subsets."
https://openalex.org/W2088163646,"Cytoplasmic dynein is a 1.2-MDa multisubunit motor protein complex that, together with its activator dynactin, is responsible for the majority of minus end microtubule-based motility. Dynactin targets dynein to specific cellular locations, links dynein to cargo, and increases dynein processivity. These two macromolecular complexes are connected by a direct interaction between dynactin's largest subunit, p150(Glued), and dynein intermediate chain (IC) subunit. Here, we demonstrate using NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry that the binding footprint of p150(Glued) on IC involves two noncontiguous recognition regions, and both are required for full binding affinity. In apo-IC, the helical structure of region 1, the nascent helix of region 2, and the disorder in the rest of the chain are determined from coupling constants, amide-amide sequential NOEs, secondary chemical shifts, and various dynamics measurements. When bound to p150(Glued), different patterns of spectral exchange broadening suggest that region 1 forms a coiled-coil and region 2 a packed stable helix, with the intervening residues remaining disordered. In the 150-kDa complex of p150(Glued), IC, and two light chains, the noninterface segments remain disordered. The multiregion IC binding interface, the partial disorder of region 2 and its potential for post-translational modification, and the modulation of the length of the longer linker by alternative splicing may provide a basis for elegant and multifaceted regulation of binding between IC and p150(Glued). The long disordered linker between the p150(Glued) binding segments and the dynein light chain consensus sequences could also provide an attractive recognition platform for diverse cargoes."
https://openalex.org/W1982275335,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels with a modular structure. The ion channel itself shares structural similarity, albeit an inverted membrane topology, with P-loop channels. Like P-loop channels, prokaryotic GluR subunits (e.g. GluR0) have two transmembrane segments. In contrast, eukaryotic GluRs have an additional transmembrane segment (M4), located C-terminal to the ion channel core. However, the structural/functional significance of this additional transmembrane segment is poorly defined. Although topologically similar to GluR0, mammalian AMPA receptor (GluA1) subunits lacking the M4 segment do not display surface expression. This lack of expression is not due to the M4 segment serving as an anchor to the ligand-binding domain because insertion of an artificial polyleucine transmembrane segment does not rescue surface expression. Specific interactions between M4 and the ligand-binding domain are also unlikely because insertion of polyglycines into the linker connecting them has no deleterious effects on function or surface expression. However, tryptophan and cysteine scanning mutagenesis of the M4 segment, as well as recovery of function in the polyleucine background, defined a unique face of the M4 helix that is required for GluR surface expression. In the AMPA receptor structure, this face forms intersubunit contacts with the transmembrane helices of the ion channel core (M1 and M3) from another subunit within the homotetramer. Thus, our experiments show that a highly specific interaction of the M4 segment with an adjacent subunit is required for surface expression of AMPA receptors. This interaction may represent a mechanism for regulating AMPA receptor biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1992078033,"The role of phosphoinositides has been thoroughly described in many signalling and membrane trafficking events but their function as modulators of membrane structure and dynamics in membrane fusion has not been investigated. We have reconstructed models that mimic the composition of nuclear envelope precursor membranes with naturally elevated amounts of phosphoinositides. These fusogenic membranes (membrane vesicle 1(MV1) and nuclear envelope remnants (NER) are critical for the assembly of the nuclear envelope. Phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyphosphoinositides, with polyunsaturated fatty acid chains that were identified in the natural nuclear membranes by lipid mass spectrometry, have been used to reconstruct complex model membranes mimicking nuclear envelope precursor membranes. Structural and dynamic events occurring in the membrane core and at the membrane surface were monitored by solid-state deuterium and phosphorus NMR. “MV1-like” (PC∶PI∶PIP∶PIP2, 30∶20∶18∶12, mol%) membranes that exhibited high levels of PtdIns, PtdInsP and PtdInsP2 had an unusually fluid membrane core (up to 20% increase, compared to membranes with low amounts of phosphoinositides to mimic the endoplasmic reticulum). “NER-like” (PC∶CH∶PI∶PIP∶PIP2, 28∶42∶16∶7∶7, mol%) membranes containing high amounts of both cholesterol and phosphoinositides exhibited liquid-ordered phase properties, but with markedly lower rigidity (10–15% decrease). Phosphoinositides are the first lipids reported to counterbalance the ordering effect of cholesterol. At the membrane surface, phosphoinositides control the orientation dynamics of other lipids in the model membranes, while remaining unchanged themselves. This is an important finding as it provides unprecedented mechanistic insight into the role of phosphoinositides in membrane dynamics. Biological implications of our findings and a model describing the roles of fusogenic membrane vesicles are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2028783246,"Background To estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a project administering de-worming and weekly iron-folic acid supplementation to control anaemia in women of reproductive age in Yen Bai province, Vietnam. Methods and Findings Cost effectiveness was evaluated using data on programmatic costs based on two surveys in 2006 and 2009 and impact on anaemia and iron status collected in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Data on initial costs for training and educational materials were obtained from the records of the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology and the Yen Bai Malaria Control Program. Structured questionnaires for health workers at district, commune and village level were used to collect ongoing distribution and monitoring costs, and for participants to collect transport and loss of earnings costs. The cost per woman treated (defined as consuming at least 75% of the recommended intake) was USD0.76 per annum. This estimate includes financial costs (for supplies, training), and costs of health care workers' time. Prevalence of anaemia fell from 38% at baseline, to 20% after 12 months. Thus, the cost-effectiveness of the project is assessed at USD 4.24 per anaemia case prevented per year. Based on estimated productivity gains for adult women, the benefit:cost ratio is 6.7∶1. Cost of the supplements and anthelminthics was 47% of the total, while costs of training, monitoring, and health workers' time accounted for 53%. Conclusion The study shows that weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming is a low-cost and cost-effective intervention and would be appropriate for population-based introduction in settings with a high prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency and low malaria infection rates."
https://openalex.org/W2036021072,"α-Galactosides are non-digestible carbohydrates widely distributed in plants. They are a potential source of energy in our daily food, and their assimilation by microbiota may play a role in obesity. In the intestinal tract, they are degraded by microbial glycosidases, which are often modular enzymes with catalytic domains linked to carbohydrate-binding modules. Here we introduce a bifunctional enzyme from the human intestinal bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus E1, α-galactosidase/sucrose kinase (AgaSK). Sequence analysis showed that AgaSK is composed of two domains: one closely related to α-galactosidases from glycoside hydrolase family GH36 and the other containing a nucleotide-binding motif. Its biochemical characterization showed that AgaSK is able to hydrolyze melibiose and raffinose to galactose and either glucose or sucrose, respectively, and to specifically phosphorylate sucrose on the C6 position of glucose in the presence of ATP. The production of sucrose-6-P directly from raffinose points toward a glycolytic pathway in bacteria, not described so far. The crystal structures of the galactosidase domain in the apo form and in complex with the product shed light onto the reaction and substrate recognition mechanisms and highlight an oligomeric state necessary for efficient substrate binding and suggesting a cross-talk between the galactose and kinase domains."

https://openalex.org/W1980521034,"We have shown previously that the ubiquitin ligase MID1, mutations of which cause the midline malformation Opitz BBB/G syndrome (OS), serves as scaffold for a microtubule-associated protein complex that regulates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Here, we show that the MID1 protein complex associates with mRNAs via a purine-rich sequence motif called MIDAS (MID1 association sequence) and thereby increases stability and translational efficiency of these mRNAs. Strikingly, inclusion of multiple copies of the MIDAS motif into mammalian mRNAs increases production of the encoded proteins up to 20-fold. Mutated MID1, as found in OS patients, loses its influence on MIDAS-containing mRNAs, suggesting that the malformations in OS patients could be caused by failures in the regulation of cytoskeleton-bound protein translation. This is supported by the observation that the majority of mRNAs that carry MIDAS motifs is involved in developmental processes and/or energy homeostasis. Further analysis of one of the proteins encoded by a MIDAS-containing mRNA, namely PDPK-1 (3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1), which is an important regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin/PP2A signaling, showed that PDPK-1 protein synthesis is significantly reduced in cells from an OS patient compared with an age-matched control and can be rescued by functional MID1. Together, our data uncover a novel messenger ribonucleoprotein complex that regulates microtubule-associated protein translation. They suggest a novel mechanism underlying OS and point at an enormous potential of the MIDAS motif to increase the efficiency of biotechnological protein production in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2129785863,"The goal of the current study was to investigate how salience-driven and goal-driven processes unfold during visual search over multiple eye movements. Eye movements were recorded while observers searched for a target, which was located on (Experiment 1) or defined as (Experiment 2) a specific orientation singleton. This singleton could either be the most, medium, or least salient element in the display. Results were analyzed as a function of response time separately for initial and second eye movements. Irrespective of the search task, initial saccades elicited shortly after the onset of the search display were primarily salience-driven whereas initial saccades elicited after approximately 250 ms were completely unaffected by salience. Initial saccades were increasingly guided in line with task requirements with increasing response times. Second saccades were completely unaffected by salience and were consistently goal-driven, irrespective of response time. These results suggest that stimulus-salience affects the visual system only briefly after a visual image enters the brain and has no effect thereafter."

Old age and multiple co-morbidities are known risk factors for death. The association of clinical presentations with mortality in pulmonary tuberculosis patients remains an issue of controversy.This prospective observational study enrolled newly diagnosed, culture-proven pulmonary tuberculosis patients from five medical centers and one regional hospital, which were referral hospitals of TB patients. Radiographic findings and clinical symptoms were determined at the time of diagnosis. Patients who died for any reason during the course of anti-TB treatment were defined as mortality cases and death that occurred within 30 days of initiating treatment was defined as early mortality. Clinical factors associated with overall mortality and early mortality were investigated.A total of 992 patients were enrolled and 195 (19.7%) died. Nearly one-third (62/195, 31.8%) of the deaths occurred before or within 30 days of treatment initiation. Older age (RR = 1.04, 95%CI: 1.03-1.05), malignancy (RR = 2.42, 95%CI: 1.77-3.31), renal insufficiency (RR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.12-2.80), presence of chronic cough (RR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.47-0.84), fever (RR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.09-1.94), and anorexia (RR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.07-2.06) were independently associated with overall mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated significantly higher mortality in patients present with fever (p<0.001), anorexia (p = 0.005), and without chronic cough (p<0.001). Among patients of mortality, those with respiratory symptoms of chronic cough (RR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.33-0.98) and dyspnea (HR = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.27-0.98) were less likely to experience early mortality. The radiological features were comparable between survivors and non-survivors.In addition to demographic characteristics, clinical presentations including the presence of fever, anorexia, and the absence of chronic cough, were also independent predictors for on-treatment mortality in pulmonary tuberculosis patients."

https://openalex.org/W2073155158,"Virus capsid assembly constitutes an attractive target for the development of antiviral therapies; a few experimental inhibitors of this process for HIV-1 and other viruses have been identified by screening compounds or by selection from chemical libraries. As a different, novel approach we have undertaken the rational design of peptides that could act as competitive assembly inhibitors by mimicking capsid structural elements involved in intersubunit interfaces. Several discrete interfaces involved in formation of the mature HIV-1 capsid through polymerization of the capsid protein CA were targeted. We had previously designed a peptide, CAC1, that represents CA helix 9 (a major part of the dimerization interface) and binds the CA C-terminal domain in solution. Here we have mapped the binding site of CAC1, and shown that it substantially overlaps with the CA dimerization interface. We have also rationally modified CAC1 to increase its solubility and CA-binding affinity, and designed four additional peptides that represent CA helical segments involved in other CA interfaces. We found that peptides CAC1, its derivative CAC1M, and H8 (representing CA helix 8) were able to efficiently inhibit the in vitro assembly of the mature HIV-1 capsid. Cocktails of several peptides, including CAC1 or CAC1M plus H8 or CAI (a previously discovered inhibitor of CA polymerization), or CAC1M+H8+CAI, also abolished capsid assembly, even when every peptide was used at lower, sub-inhibitory doses. To provide a preliminary proof that these designed capsid assembly inhibitors could eventually serve as lead compounds for development of anti-HIV-1 agents, they were transported into cultured cells using a cell-penetrating peptide, and tested for antiviral activity. Peptide cocktails that drastically inhibited capsid assembly in vitro were also able to efficiently inhibit HIV-1 infection ex vivo. This study validates a novel, entirely rational approach for the design of capsid assembly interfacial inhibitors that show antiviral activity."

Methods. Healthy subjects performed two experiments that consisted of different prescribed outdoor walking protocols. Experiment 1. We studied the accuracy of the DG100 for detecting bouts of walking and resting. Experiment 2. We studied the accuracy of the DG100 for estimating distances and speeds of walking.Experiment 1. The performance in the detection of bouts, expressed as the percentage of walking and resting bouts that were correctly detected, was 92.4% [95% Confidence Interval: 90.6-94.3]. Experiment 2. The coefficients of variation [95% Confidence Interval] for the accuracy of estimating the distances and speeds of walking were low: 3.1% [2.9-3.3] and 2.8% [2.6-3.1], respectively.The DG100 produces acceptable accuracy both in detecting bouts of walking and resting and in estimating distances and speeds of walking during the detected walking bouts. However, before we can confirm that the DG100 can be used to study walking with respect to health and clinical studies, the inter- and intra-DG100 variability should be studied.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00485147."
https://openalex.org/W2028827278,"We have cloned the Yarrowia lipolytica TPS1 gene encoding trehalose-6-P synthase by complementation of the lack of growth in glucose of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae tps1 mutant. Disruption of YlTPS1 could only be achieved with a cassette placed in the 3' half of its coding region due to the overlap of its sequence with the promoter of the essential gene YlTFC1. The Yltps1 mutant grew in glucose although the Y. lipolytica hexokinase is extremely sensitive to inhibition by trehalose-6-P. The presence of a glucokinase, insensitive to trehalose-6-P, that constitutes about 80% of the glucose phosphorylating capacity during growth in glucose may account for the growth phenotype. Trehalose content was below 1 nmol/mg dry weight in Y. lipolytica, but it increased in strains expressing YlTPS1 under the control of the YlTEF1 promoter or with a disruption of YALI0D15598 encoding a putative trehalase. mRNA levels of YlTPS1 were low and did not respond to thermal stresses, but that of YlTPS2 (YALI0D14476) and YlTPS3 (YALI0E31086) increased 4 and 6 times, repectively, by heat treatment. Disruption of YlTPS1 drastically slowed growth at 35°C.

The aim of the collaborative cross-cultural European study of adult well being (ESAW) is to frame the concept of aging successfully within a causal model that embraces physical health and functional status, cognitive efficacy, material security, social support resources, and life activity. Within the framework of this project, we show here that the degree of heterogeneity among people who view aging in a positive light is significantly lower than the degree of heterogeneity of those who hold a negative perception of aging. We base this conclusion on our analysis of a survey involving 12,478 people aged 50 to 90 from six West European countries. We treat the survey database as a bipartite network in which individual respondents are linked to the actual answers they provide. Taking this perspective allows us to construct a projected network of respondents in which each link indicates a statistically validated similarity of answers profile between the connected respondents, and to identify clusters of individuals independently of demographics. We show that mental and physical well-being are key factors determining a positive perception of aging. We further observe that psychological aspects, like self-esteem and resilience, and the nationality of respondents are relevant aspects to discriminate among participants who indicate positive perception of aging."

Exposure of primary human dermal fibroblasts to live infective T. cruzi trypomastigotes or their shed/secreted products results in a rapid down-regulation of the fibrogenic genes collagenIα1, fibronectin and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2). Here we demonstrate the ability of a secreted/released T. cruzi factor to antagonize ctgf/ccn2 expression in dermal fibroblasts in response to TGF-ß, lysophosphatidic acid or serum, where agonist-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases Erk1/2, p38 and JNK was also inhibited. Global analysis of gene expression in dermal fibroblasts identified a discrete subset of TGF-ß-inducible genes involved in cell proliferation, wound repair, and immune regulation that are inhibited by T. cruzi secreted/released factors, where the genes exhibiting the highest sensitivity to T. cruzi are known to be regulated by MAP kinase-activated transcription factors. Consistent with this observation, the Ets-family transcription factor binding site in the proximal promoter region of the ctgf/ccn2 gene (−91 bp to −84 bp) was shown to be required for T. cruzi-mediated down-regulation of ctgf/ccn2 reporter expression. The cumulative data suggest a model in which T. cruzi-derived molecules secreted/released early in the infective process dampen MAP kinase signaling and the activation of transcription factors that regulate expression of fibroblast genes involved in wound repair and tissue remodelling, including ctgf/ccn2. These findings have broader implications for local modulation of ECM synthesis/remodelling by T. cruzi during the early establishment of infection in the mammalian host and highlight the potential for pathogen-derived molecules to be exploited as tools to modulate the fibrogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W2105943643,"Behavioural ecologists increasingly recognise spatial memory as one the most influential cognitive traits involved in evolutionary processes. In particular, spatial working memory (SWM), i.e. the ability of animals to store temporarily useful information for current foraging tasks, determines the foraging efficiency of individuals. As a consequence, SWM also has the potential to influence competitive abilities and to affect patterns of sympatric occurrence among closely related species. The present study aims at comparing the efficiency of SWM between generalist (Glossophaga soricina) and specialist (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) nectarivorous bats at flowering patches. The two species differ in diet – the generalist diet including seasonally fruits and insects with nectar and pollen while the specialist diet is dominated by nectar and pollen yearlong – and in some morphological traits – the specialist being heavier and with proportionally longer rostrum than the generalist. These bats are found sympatrically within part of their range in the Neotropics. We habituated captive individuals to feed on artificial flower patches and we used infrared video recordings to monitor their ability to remember and avoid the spatial location of flowers they emptied in previous visits in the course of 15-min foraging sequences. Experiments revealed that both species rely on SWM as their foraging success attained significantly greater values than random expectations. However, the nectar specialist L. yerbabuenae was significantly more efficient at extracting nectar (+28% in foraging success), and sustained longer foraging bouts (+27% in length of efficient foraging sequences) than the generalist G. soricina. These contrasting SWM performances are discussed in relation to diet specialization and other life history traits."
https://openalex.org/W2037958717,"When growing in its native habitat, Thlaspi goesingense can hyperaccumulate 1.2% of its shoot dry weight as nickel. We reported previously that both constitutively elevated activity of serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and concentration of glutathione (GSH) are involved in the ability of T. goesingense to tolerate nickel. A feature of SAT is its feedback inhibition by l-cysteine. To understand the role of this regulation of SAT by Cys on GSH-mediated nickel tolerance in T. goesingense, we characterized the enzymatic properties of SATs from T. goesingense. We demonstrate that all three isoforms of SAT in T. goesingense are insensitive to inhibition by Cys. Further, two amino acids (proline and alanine) in the C-terminal region of the cytosolic SAT (SAT-c) from T. goesingense are responsible for converting the enzyme from a Cys-sensitive to a Cys-insensitive form. Furthermore, the Cys-insensitive isoform of SAT-c confers elevated resistance to nickel when expressed in Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana, supporting a role for altered regulation of SAT by Cys in nickel tolerance in T. goesingense.

Hyperaccumulators can absorb and store high concentration of metal(loid)s in their aerial tissues without showing symptoms of toxicity (1Krämer U. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 517-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Nickel hyperaccumulators have been defined as plants with nickel concentrations higher than 1,000 μg of nickel/g in their aerial dry weight (2Brooks R. Lee J. Reeves R. Jaffre T. J. Geochem. Explor. 1977; 7: 49-57Crossref Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The genus Thlaspi (Brassicaceae) contains species that can hyperaccumulate nickel, and various Thlaspi species have been used to understand the mechanism of nickel hyperaccumulation. Among Thlaspi nickel hyperaccumulators, Thlaspi goesingense occurs on Austrian nickel-rich ultramafic (serpentine) soils (3Reeves R. Brooks R. J. Geochem. Explor. 1983; 18: 275-283Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), where it has been reported to accumulate 5,476 ± 974 μg/g nickel in shoot dry biomass (4Kramer U. Smith R.D. Wenzel W.W. Raskin I. Salt D.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This high nickel concentration in T. goesingense is more than 20-fold higher than the nonaccumulator Silene cucubalus, which contained 252 ± 146 μg/g nickel in shoot dry biomass, although these two species were collected from the same site (4Kramer U. Smith R.D. Wenzel W.W. Raskin I. Salt D.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Glutathione (GSH) is proposed to be an important antioxidant compound in reducing oxidative stress induced by the high concentration of nickel accumulated by the nickel hyperaccumulator T. goesingense (5Freeman J.L. Persans M.W. Nieman K. Albrecht C. Peer W. Pickering I.J. Salt D.E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2176-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Nickel concentrations in the shoot are strongly correlated with GSH and its precursors l-cysteine (Cys) and O-acetylserine (OAS) 2The abbreviations used are: OASO-acetylserineSATserine acetyltransferaseOAS-TLO-acetylserine (thiol) lyaseSAT-ccytosolic SATSAT-pplastid SATSAT-mmitochondrial SATsGFPsynthetic GFP. in various Thlaspi hyperaccumulators and nonaccumulators (5Freeman J.L.

Furthermore, the elevated OAS, Cys, and GSH contents in T. goesingense are probably due to elevated serine acetyltransferase (SAT; EC 2.3.1.30) activity (5Freeman J.L. Persans M.W. Nieman K. Albrecht C. Peer W. Pickering I.J. Salt D.E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2176-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). By expressing the gene encoding the mitochondrially targeted SAT from T. goesingense (TgSAT-m) in the nonaccumulator Arabidopsis thaliana, Freeman et al. (5Freeman J.L. Persans M.W. Nieman K. Albrecht C. Peer W. Pickering I.J. Salt D.E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2176-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) showed that elevated GSH content reduces nickel-induced oxidative stress and enhances nickel resistance. X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed no significant presence of Ni-S complexes in either transgenic A. thaliana expressing TgSAT-m (5Freeman J.L. Persans M.W. Nieman K. Albrecht C. Peer W.

O-acetylserine serine acetyltransferase O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase cytosolic SAT plastid SAT mitochondrial SAT synthetic GFP. SAT is involved in the biosynthesis of OAS from acetyl-CoA and serine, and Cys is synthesized by O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 4.2.99.8) from OAS and sulfide. SAT and OAS-TL form the cysteine synthase complex, an important regulatory complex (8Droux M. Ruffet M.L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Feldman-Salit A. Wirtz M. Hell R. Wade R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386: 37-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cys is a precursor for GSH biosynthesis through the action of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (EC 6.3.2.2) and glutathione synthetase (EC 6.3.2.3) (10Rausch T. Gromes R. Liedschulte V. Müller I. Bogs J. Galovic V. Wachter A. Plant Biol. 2007; 9: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). SAT is known as the first rate-limiting enzyme in Cys synthesis (11Kredich N.M. J. Biol.

There are at least three known compartmental isoforms of SAT in plants, localized in the cytosol, chloroplast, and mitochondria, as observed in multiple species, such as A. thaliana (18Noji M.

Biochem. 1999; 266: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Citrullus vulgaris (20Saito K. Yokoyama H. Noji M. Murakoshi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16321-16326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Saito K. Inoue K. Fukushima R. Noji M. Gene. 1997; 189: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In A. thaliana, there are three cytosolic SATs, one mitochondrial SAT, and a chloroplast SAT (22Kawashima C.G. Berkowitz O. Hell R. Noji M. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). One of the features of SAT is that at least one SAT isoform is sensitive to feedback inhibition by Cys. The sensitivity of SAT to inhibition by Cys differs between plant species and subcellular compartments. The sensitivity of SAT to Cys has been mainly reported in cytosolic SAT isoforms in various species (18Noji M. Inoue K. Kimura N. Gouda A. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32739-32745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20Saito K. Yokoyama H. Noji M. Murakoshi I. J. Biol.

Krishnan H.B. Planta. 2004; 218: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SAT insensitive to Cys has been reported for the plastidic and mitochondrial SAT isoforms (18Noji M. Inoue K. Kimura N. Gouda A. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32739-32745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 22Kawashima C.G. Berkowitz O. Hell R. Noji M. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Cys feedback inhibition of SAT is part of the sensor system that maintains the Cys concentration in various subcellular compartments (26Noji M. Saito K. Amino Acids. 2002; 22: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). SAT has two important domains: a protein-protein interaction domain for the interaction of SAT/SAT and SAT/OAS-TL and a domain for Cys-dependent regulation. It is known that several amino acids in the C-terminal region of SAT play important roles in both Cys and OAS-TL binding (19Inoue K. Noji M. Saito K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Mino K. Hiraoka K. Imamura K. Sakiyama T. Eisaki N. Matsuyama A. Nakanishi K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1874-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of SAT is also involved in Cys inhibition, although this region does not have a catalytic domain (19Inoue K. Noji M. Saito K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that an increased Cys insensitivity of SAT in T. goesingense is a possible mechanism to account for at least part of the increased OAS production observed in T. goesingense and which we have shown leads to elevated GSH and nickel resistance (5Freeman J.L. Persans M.W. Nieman K. Albrecht C. Peer W. Pickering I.J. Salt D.E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2176-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we characterized the enzymatic properties of the cytosolic (SAT-c), plastid (SAT-p), and mitochondrial (SAT-m) isoforms of SAT from T. goesingense. Furthermore, we heterologously expressed SAT with contrasting Cys sensitivities from T. goesingense in A. thaliana and Escherichia coli to assess the effect of overproduction of Cys-insensitive and Cys-sensitive SAT isoforms on nickel resistance. Several E. coli strains were used. For general cloning, TOP10F′ (F− mcrA Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) Φ80lacZΔM15 ΔlacX74 deoR recA1 araD139 Δ(araA-leu)7697 galU galK rpsL endA1 nupG) and DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 (phi80 lacZ ΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gryA96 thi-1 relA1) were used. For recombinant protein expression experiments, Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (F− ompT hsdSB (rB− mB−) gal dcm lacY1 (DE3) pLysSRARE6, Cmr, Novagen) was used. E. coli strain JM15 (cysE tfr), which lacks SAT activity and requires Cys for growth, was kindly provided by the Yale E. coli Genetic Stock Center and used for functional complementation with the various SAT constructs. For plant transformation, disarmed Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 was used. All pGreen constructs were transformed with pSoup plasmid DNA into Agrobacterium using electroporation. To clone the SAT coding region from A. thaliana and T. goesingense into the E. coli expression vector pET32(a)+ (Novagen), full-length open reading frame specific primers for PCR were designed. AtSAT-c (AtSerat1;1, U30298), TgSAT-m (AY618468), TgSAT-p (AY618469), and TgSAT-c (AY618470) were used as the template for PCR amplification. For the generation of recombinant protein pET32-AtSAT-c, the 5′ primer was 5′-CCATGGAAATGCCACCGGCCGGAGAACT-3′ (NcoI), and 3′ primer was 5′-GAATTCCAACTTTATATGATGTAATCTG-3′ (EcoRI). The NcoI and EcoRI-digested fragment was inserted into NcoI and EcoRI-linearized pET32(a)+ expression vector. For the pET32-TgSAT-m, 5′ primer was 5′-TTACCTGCCTATCATGTTCCCGGTCACAATGC-3′ (BspMI), and 3′ primer was 5′-TTAAGCTTTCAAATTACATAATCCGAC-3′ (HindIII). For the pET32-TgSAT-p, 5′ primer was 5′-TTGAAGACAACATGGCACCGTGCATCG-3′ (BbsI), and 3′ primer was 5′-TTAAGCTTTTAGATAACGTAAT CAGAC-3′ (HindIII). For the pET32-TgSAT-c, 5′ primer was 5-TTACCTGCTAATCATGCCGCCTGCCG-3′ (BspMI), and 3′ primer was 5′-TTGAATTCTCAAATAATGTAATCTGACC-3′ (EcoRI). All PCR products were directly ligated into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) after purification of PCR products using a PCR product purification kit (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmids were fragmented using a pair of restriction enzymes: BspMI and HindIII for TgSAT-m, BbsI and HindIII for TgSAT-p, and BspMI and EcoRI for TgSAT-c. Fragments of the three SAT genes were ligated into linearized pE32(a)+. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the T7 and S-tag sequences in pET32(a)+ for primer design. To produce the domain-swapped constructs between TgSAT-c and AtSAT-c (At-N/Tg-C and Tg-N/At-C), pET32-AtSAT-c and pET32-TgSAT-c were used as templates for digestion and ligation. The unique BglII restriction site, in both the pET32(a)+ vector and SAT coding region, was used to prepare the domain-swapped constructs. After treatment of both pET32-AtSAT-c and TgSAT-c with BglII, two fragments from each reaction were eluted from 0.8% agarose gel using a gel elution kit. For the At-N/Tg-C construct, an ∼400-bp fragment from pET32-AtSAT-c was ligated into BglII-linearized pET32-TgSAT-c, and vice versa for the Tg-N/At-C. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For site-directed mutagenesis of SAT, a combination of 5′ gene-specific primer harboring the point mutation and a 3′ primer with an EcoRI site was used. For the C268P point mutation, the 5′ primer 5′-GACGTGCCTCCTCGAGGTACTGCGGTTG-3′ (BgmBI) was used. For the G270A point mutation, the 5′ primer 5′-GACGTGCCTTGTCGAGCTACTGCGGTTG-3′ (BgmBI) was used. For the C268P/G270A point mutation, the 5′ primer 5′-GACGTGCCTCCTCGAGCTACTGCGGTTG-3′ (BgmBI) was used. The common 3′ gene-specific primer was 5′-GAATTCCAACTTTATATGATGTAATCTG (EcoRI). The BgmBI and EcoRI-treated fragments of each of the PCR products were ligated into pET32-ATSAT-c, which was linearized with BgmBI and EcoRI. The resultant cDNAs in the pET32 vector, which were in frame with the N-terminal thioredoxin, S-tag, and His6 tag, were transformed into the Rosetta DE3 pLysS E. coli strain (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). For protein expression, cells were grown at 30 °C in liquid Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At an optical density of 0.6 measured at 600 nm, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added, and the culture was grown for 10 h at 30 °C. For purification of recombinant protein, bacterial cells were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in BugBuster (Novagen), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature for the disruption of the E. coli cells. After clarification by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 25 min, recombinant proteins were affinity-purified using TALON cobalt resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined in each fraction using bicinchoninic acid colorimetric detection and quantification assay (BCA protein assay kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL) using a bovine serum albumin standard curve. Recombinant proteins were freshly purified for each experiment. The activity of recombinant SAT proteins was assayed according to Noji et al. (18Noji M. Inoue K. Kimura N. Gouda A. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32739-32745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA, 1 mm serine, and a known amount of the purified recombinant SAT protein. Assays were carried out in a final reaction volume of 0.1 ml at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by the addition of serine, and the decrease in acetyl-CoA was monitored spectrophotometrically by absorption at 232 nm. The nmol of acetyl-CoA cleaved during the assay were calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 4,500 m−1 cm−1 (18Noji M. Inoue K. Kimura N. Gouda A. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32739-32745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For the measurement of nickel resistance in E. coli expressing various SAT constructs, strains were grown in liquid LB medium. All SAT cDNAs tested, including three SAT cDNAs from T. goesingense, SAT-c from A. thaliana, domain-swapped SAT constructs, and point-mutated SAT constructs, were expressed in cysE− E. coli from the pET32(a)+ vector. Nickel resistance was measured in liquid LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), with or without nickel acetate (2 mm) at 30 °C in a shaking incubator at 300 r.p.m. for 24 h, and growth was measured as optical density at 600 nm (A600). In this assay, a starter culture containing various strains hosting the SAT constructs was initiated in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and subcultured at an A600 of 0.6 three consecutive times. After a final A600 of 0.6 was achieved, 200 μl of culture was subcultured into 20 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), with or without nickel acetate (2 mm). After 24 h, A600 was measured, and cultured cells were harvested at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were washed twice by resuspension in 0.9% NaCl and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Collected cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For determination of Cys and GSH concentrations in E. coli, we used a modified procedure of Saby et al. (28Saby S. Leroy P. Block J.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5600-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, frozen samples were resuspended with vigorous vortexing for 5 min in 0.1 m HCl containing 2 mm disodium EDTA (4 °C) and sonicated twice for 5 min in an ultrasound bath (Prolabo 670/H; power, 9) at 4 °C. Suspensions were incubated for 10 min in an ice bath and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and fast thawed in a water bath at 30 °C three times and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. For the determination of Cys and GSH in plants, extraction was performed according to Tsakraklides et al. (29Tsakraklides G. Martin M. Chalam R. Tarczynski M.C. Schmidt A. Leustek T. Plant J. 2002; 32: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Shoot tissue (minimum 0.05 g, fresh weight) was harvested, weighed, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue was ground to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle at 4 °C. The fine powder was resuspended with extraction buffer containing 0.1 m HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and N-acetyl cysteine as an internal standard. After grinding and vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a refrigerated centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube. For the derivatization of samples from E. coli and plants, 75 μl of sample in 0.1 m HCl and 1 mm EDTA was added into analysis buffer containing a final concentration of 75 mm sodium borate (pH 9.5–10) and 4 mm DTT, which was vortexed for 3 min, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After incubation, 12 mm bromobimane was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The final volume of the reaction mixture was 100 μl, and the reaction was terminated with the same volume of 20% (v/v) acetic acid. Derivatized samples were analyzed using the AccQ Tag amino acid analysis system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) using a Waters HPLC system consisting of a Waters Separation module 2695 with a Waters 2475 fluorescence detector. For the heterologous expression studies, SAT coding regions were cloned into the pGreen 0299 plant transformation vector. For the heterologous expression of TgSAT-c, the 5′ primer was 5′- GCTCTAGAATGCCGCCTGCCGGAGAA-3′ (XbaI), and the 3′ primer was 5′-GGAATTCTCAAATAATGTAATCTGACC-3′ (EcoRI). The XbaI and EcoRI-digested fragment was inserted into XbaI and EcoRI-linearized pGreen vector. For the overexpression of AtSAT-c and the three point-mutated constructs, the 5′ primer was 5′-CGGGATCCATGCCACCGGCCGGAGAAC-3′ (BamHI), and the 3′ primer was 5′-GGAATTCTTATATGATGTAATCTGACCA-3′ (EcoRI). AtSAT-c, C268P, G270A, and C268P/G270A pET32(a)+ constructs were used as the template for PCR amplification. The BamHI and EcoRI-digested fragment was inserted into BamHI and EcoRI-linearized pGreen vector. For plant growth in soil, seeds were planted in Scotts (Marysville, OH) Redi-earth artificial soil mix and cold-treated at 4 °C for 5 days to synchronize germination. Seeds were germinated in a climate-controlled room at 19–24 °C with 10 h of photosynthetically active light at an intensity of 90–150 μmol m−2 s−1. A. thaliana was transformed using Agrobacterium by floral dipping (30Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformed seedlings were selected on glyphosate-ammonium (Pestanal, Sigma-Aldrich). To check segregation ratios in the T2 and T3 generation, at least 200 seeds were sown onto the surface of sterilized 2.22 g/liter MS medium (Caisson Laboratory, Inc.), containing 1× MS vitamin stock (Caisson Laboratory, Inc.), 100 μm glyphosate-ammonium, and 1.2% agar (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 × 15-mm polystyrene Petri dishes. The T2 lines, showing an ∼75% survival rate (single T-DNA insertion), were selected. T3 seeds collected from the individual T2 plants were again selected on 100 μm glyphosate-ammonium containing MS medium, and only lines showing 100% survival were selected (homozygous for single insertion). Homozygous plant lines for the SAT transgene in the T3 generation were used in all experiments presented. For the protoplast transient expression, the SAT coding regions were amplified from the pET32(a)+ constructs using PCR with 5′ primer 5′-GCTCTAGAATGTTCCCGGTCACAAGTC-3′ (XbaI) and 3′ primer 5′-TCCCCCGGGAATTACATAATCCGACCA-3′ (SmaI) for TgSAT-m, 5′ primer 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGCACCGTGCATCGACA-3′ (XbaI) and 3′ primer 5′- TCCCCCGGGGATAACGTAATCAGACC-3′ (SmaI) for TgSAT-p, 5′ primer 5′-GCTCTAGAATGCCGCCTGCCGGAGAA-3′ (XbaI) and 3′ primer 5′-TCCCCCGGGAATAATGTAATCTGACC-3′ (SmaI) for TgSAT-c, and 5′ primer 5′-CGGGATCCATGCCACCGGCCGGAGAAC-3′ (BamHI) and 3′ primer 5′-TCCCCCGGGTATGATGTAATCTGACCA-3′ (SmaI) for AtSAT-c and point mutation constructs. All PCR products were confirmed by sequencing and were inserted into the XbaI and SmaI or BamHI and SmaI sites of the plasmid pUC-sGFP to create chimeric GFP fusion constructs under the control of the CaMV 35S (Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S) promoter. For the protoplast isolation and plasmid transformation, leaf tissues from 5-week-old plants were collected and incubated with 30 ml of enzyme solution containing 0.25% Marcerozyme R-10 (Yokult Honsha Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 1% Cellulase R10 (Yokult Honsha Co., Ltd.), 500 mm mannitol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MES-KOH (pH 5.6) for 8 h with gentle agitation (50–75 r.p.m) at 22 °C in dark conditions. Incubated mixtures were filtered through a 70-μm nylon mesh and were washed with the same volume of W5 solution containing 154 mm NaCl, 125 ml CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, and 1.5 mm MES. After centrifuging at 46 × g for 5 min, protoplasts were resuspended in fresh W5 solution and overlaid onto a 20-ml 21% (w/w) sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min. The intact protoplasts were transferred to tubes containing 40 ml of W5 solution and incubated at 4 °C at least 5 h before plasmid transformation. Polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation was used for transformation of sGFP fusion constructs into A. thaliana protoplast (31Jin J.B. Kim Y.A. Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Images were captured with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Co., Jena, Germany) using the XF116 (exciter, 474AF20; dichroic, 500 DRLP; emitter, 605DF50) filter set for GFP. For the stable expression of GFP fusion constructs, the sGFP coding region was amplified with 5′ primer 5′-TCCCCCGGGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG-3′ (SmaI) and 3′ primer 5′-CGGAATTCTTAGGACTTGTACAGC-3′ (EcoRI). The PCR product was confirmed by sequencing and inserted into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of the plasmid pGreen 0299 plant transformation vector under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter to make pGreen-sGFP constructs. All PCR-amplified SAT cDNAs from the pET32(a)+ vector constructs were fused in frame to sGFP. A. thaliana was transformed using Agrobacterium by floral dipping (30Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformed seedlings were selected on glyphosate-ammonium. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser-scanning microscope. The fixed 488 nm was used to excite the GFP, and the fluorescence emitted between 492 and 537 nm was collected. Chlorophyll was simultaneously excited using the 633 nm, and the emission was collected between 647 and 721 nm. Mitotracker was excited using 594 nm, and emission was collected between 562 and 620 nm. A transmitted light image was also collected for reference. Images were processed using the Zeiss imaging software and Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). The measurement of nickel resistance of A. thaliana heterologously expressing SAT was performed on agar plates according to Freeman et al. (5Freeman J.L. Persans M.W. Nieman K. Albrecht C. Peer W. Pickering I.J. Salt D.E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2176-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Surface-sterilized seeds were sown onto the surface of half-strength MS medium (Caisson Laboratory, Inc.) containing 1.2% agar (Sigma-Aldrich) as concentric circles 5 mm apart around a central filter paper disc (6-mm diameter; BD Biosciences) soaked with 50 μl of 100 mm nickel acetate. After 13 days of growth at 19–24 °C with 10 h of 90–150 μmol m−2 s−1 photosynthetically active light, both upright seedlings with secondary leaves and seedlings with hooked roots that represent root growth to the bottom of the agar were recorded for each ring. For Cys and GSH analysis, seedlings were collected, and Cys and GSH were measured using a Waters HPLC system as described previously. Statistical analyses were performed using Office Excel 2007 software from Microsoft. One-way analysis of variance was done to test the equality of three or more means. Student's t tests were done to statistically compare pairs of means. Statistically significant differences were determined at a 5% level of probability for all comparisons. IC50 was calculated using software as described by Brooks (33Brooks S.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar). We had previously cloned TgSAT-m (AY618468), TgSAT-p (AY618469), and TgSAT-c (AY618470) from T. goesingense using a nickel sensitivity suppression screen in E. coli (5Freeman J.L. Persans M.W.

Microbiol. 2005; 71: 8627-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The predicted subcellular localization of these proteins (TgSAT-c, TgSAT-m, and TgSAT-p) was determined by stable expression of translational fusions of SAT with GFP in A. thaliana (supplemental Fig. 1). As predicted from the targeting sequences, TgSAT-m was found to be localized to the mitochondria. The GFP signal observed from TgSAT-p-GFP was found to co-localize with autofluorescence from chlorophyll A. The GFP signal from AtSAT-c-GFP localized to the cytoplasm as previously reported by Kawashima et al. (22Kawashima C.G. Berkowitz O. Hell R. Noji M. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The GFP signal from TgSAT-c-GFP also localized to the cytosol as predicted from the homology to AtSAT-c. These data were collected from at least 10 independent A. thaliana transgenic plant lines stab"
https://openalex.org/W2103823220,"Recent phylogenetic works have begun to address long-standing questions regarding the systematics of Campanula (Campanulaceae). Yet, aspects of the evolutionary history, particularly in northwestern North America, remain unresolved. Thus, our primary goal in this study was to infer the phylogenetic positions of northwestern Campanula species within the greater Campanuloideae tree. We combined new sequence data from 5 markers (atpB, rbcL, matK, and trnL-F regions of the chloroplast and the nuclear ITS) representing 12 species of Campanula with previously published datasets for worldwide campanuloids, allowing us to include approximately 75% of North American Campanuleae in a phylogenetic analysis of the Campanuloideae. Because all but one of North American Campanula species are nested within a single campanuloid subclade (the Rapunculus clade), we conducted a separate set of analyses focused specifically on this group. Our findings show that i) the campanuloids have colonized North America at least 6 times, 4 of which led to radiations, ii) all but one North American campanuloid are nested within the Rapunculus clade, iii) in northwestern North America, a C. piperi – C. lasiocarpa ancestor gave rise to a monophyletic Cordilleran clade that is sister to a clade containing C. rotundifolia, iv) within the Cordilleran clade, C. parryi var. parryi and C. parryi var. idahoensis exhibit a deep, species-level genetic divergence, and v) C. rotundifolia is genetically diverse across its range and polyphyletic. Potential causes of diversification and endemism in northwestern North America are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1965705624,"Background Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass whose activity is upregulated in adult heart failure (HF); however, its role in congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. Methods We studied myostatin and IGF-1 expression via Western blot in cardiac tissue at varying degrees of myocardial dysfunction and after biventricular support in CHD by collecting myocardial biopsies from four patient cohorts: A) adult subjects with no known cardiopulmonary disease (left ventricle, LV), (Adult Normal), (n = 5); B) pediatric subjects undergoing congenital cardiac surgery with normal RV size and function (right ventricular outflow tract, RVOT), (n = 3); C) pediatric subjects with worsening but hemodynamically stable LV failure [LV and right ventricle (LV, RV,)] with biopsy collected at the time of orthotopic heart transplant (OHT), (n = 7); and D) pediatric subjects with decompensated bi-ventricular failure on BiVAD support with biopsy collected at OHT (LV, RV, BiVAD), (n = 3). Results The duration of HF was longest in OHT patients compared to BIVAD. The duration of BiVAD support was 4.3±1.9 days. Myostatin expression was significantly increased in LV-OHT compared to RV-OHT and RVOT, and was increased more than double in decompensated biventricular HF (BiVAD) compared to both OHT and RVOT. An increased myostatin/IGF-1 ratio was associated with ventricular dysfunction. Conclusions Myostatin expression in increased in CHD, and the myostatin/IGF-1 ratio increases as ventricular function deteriorates. Future investigation is necessary to determine if restoration of the physiologic myostatin/IGF-1 ratio has therapeutic potential in HF."
https://openalex.org/W2128187509,"Representations in the cortex are often distributed with graded firing rates in the neuronal populations. The firing rate probability distribution of each neuron to a set of stimuli is often exponential or gamma. In processes in the brain, such as decision-making, that are influenced by the noise produced by the close to random spike timings of each neuron for a given mean rate, the noise with this graded type of representation may be larger than with the binary firing rate distribution that is usually investigated. In integrate-and-fire simulations of an attractor decision-making network, we show that the noise is indeed greater for a given sparseness of the representation for graded, exponential, than for binary firing rate distributions. The greater noise was measured by faster escaping times from the spontaneous firing rate state when the decision cues are applied, and this corresponds to faster decision or reaction times. The greater noise was also evident as less stability of the spontaneous firing state before the decision cues are applied. The implication is that spiking-related noise will continue to be a factor that influences processes such as decision-making, signal detection, short-term memory, and memory recall even with the quite large networks found in the cerebral cortex. In these networks there are several thousand recurrent collateral synapses onto each neuron. The greater noise with graded firing rate distributions has the advantage that it can increase the speed of operation of cortical circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2055197837,"The BarA/UvrY two-component system is well conserved in species of the γ-proteobacteria and regulates numerous processes predominantly by controlling the expression of a subset of noncoding small RNAs. In this study, we identified and characterized the BarA/UvrY two-component system in the gammaproteobacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Functional interaction of sensor kinase BarA and the cognate response regulator UvrY was indicated by in vitro phosphotransfer studies. The expression of two predicted small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), CsrB1 and CsrB2, was dependent on UvrY. Transcriptomic analysis by microarrays revealed that UvrY is a global regulator and directly or indirectly affects transcript levels of more than 200 genes in S. oneidensis. Among these are genes encoding key enzymes of central carbon metabolism such as ackA, aceAB, and pflAB. As predicted of a signal transduction pathway that controls aspects of central metabolism, mutants lacking UvrY reach a significantly higher OD than the wild type during aerobic growth on N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) while under anaerobic conditions the mutant grew more slowly. A shorter lag phase occurred with lactate as carbon source. In contrast, significant growth phenotypes were absent in complex medium. Based on these studies we hypothesize that, in S. oneidensis MR-1, the global BarA/UvrY/Csr regulatory pathway is involved in central carbon metabolism processes."
https://openalex.org/W2104593435,"In a cell, peptidyl-tRNA molecules that have prematurely dissociated from ribosomes need to be recycled. This work is achieved by an enzyme called peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. To characterize the RNA-binding site of Escherichia coli peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, minimalist substrates inspired from tRNA(His) have been designed and produced. Two minisubstrates consist of an N-blocked histidylated RNA minihelix or a small RNA duplex mimicking the acceptor and TψC stem regions of tRNA(His). Catalytic efficiency of the hydrolase toward these two substrates is reduced by factors of 2 and 6, respectively, if compared with N-acetyl-histidyl-tRNA(His). In contrast, with an N-blocked histidylated microhelix or a tetraloop missing the TψC arm, efficiency of the hydrolase is reduced 20-fold. NMR mapping of complex formation between the hydrolase and the small RNA duplex indicates amino acid residues sensitive to RNA binding in the following: (i) the enzyme active site region; (ii) the helix-loop covering the active site; (iii) the region including Leu-95 and the bordering residues 111-117, supposed to form the boundary between the tRNA core and the peptidyl-CCA moiety-binding sites; (iv) the region including Lys-105 and Arg-133, two residues that are considered able to clamp the 5'-phosphate of tRNA, and (v) the positively charged C-terminal helix (residues 180-193). Functional value of these interactions is assessed taking into account the catalytic properties of various engineered protein variants, including one in which the C-terminal helix was simply subtracted. A strong role of Lys-182 in helix binding to the substrate is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2010014534,"Background The mortality rate from unnatural deaths for South Africa is nearly double the world average. Reliable data are limited by inaccurate and incomplete ascertainment of specific causes of unnatural death. This study describes trends in causes of unnatural death between 1992 and 2008 in a cohort of South African miners. Methodology/Principal Findings The study used routinely-collected retrospective data with cause of death determined from multiple sources including the mine's human resources database, medical records, death registration, and autopsy. Cause-specific mortality rates and Poisson regression coefficients were calculated by calendar year and age group. The cohort included 40,043 men. One quarter of all 2937 deaths were from unnatural causes (n = 805). Causes of unnatural deaths were road traffic accidents 38% (109/100,000 py), homicides 30% (88/100,000 py), occupational injuries 17% (50/100,000 py), suicides 8% (24/100,000 py), and other accidents 6% (19/100,000 py). Rates of unnatural deaths declined by 2% (95%CI -4%,-1%) per year over the study period, driven by declining rates of road traffic and other accidents. The rate of occupational injury mortality did not change significantly over time (-2% per year, 95%CI -5%,+2%). Unnatural deaths were less frequent in this cohort of workers than in the South African population (IRR 0.89, 95%CI 0.82–0.95), particularly homicides (IRR 0.48, 95%CI 0.42–0.55). Conclusions/Significance Unnatural deaths were a common cause of preventable and premature death in this cohort of miners. While unnatural death rates declined between 1992 and 2008, occupational fatalities remained at a high level. Evidence-based prevention strategies to address these avoidable deaths are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W1985411561,"Mitochondrial bioenergetic processes are central to the production of cellular energy, and a decrease in the expression or activity of enzyme complexes responsible for these processes can result in energetic deficit that correlates with many metabolic diseases and aging. Unfortunately, existing computational models of mitochondrial bioenergetics either lack relevant kinetic descriptions of the enzyme complexes, or incorporate mechanisms too specific to a particular mitochondrial system and are thus incapable of capturing the heterogeneity associated with these complexes across different systems and system states. Here we introduce a new composable rate equation, the chemiosmotic rate law, that expresses the flux of a prototypical energy transduction complex as a function of: the saturation kinetics of the electron donor and acceptor substrates; the redox transfer potential between the complex and the substrates; and the steady-state thermodynamic force-to-flux relationship of the overall electro-chemical reaction. Modeling of bioenergetics with this rate law has several advantages: (1) it minimizes the use of arbitrary free parameters while featuring biochemically relevant parameters that can be obtained through progress curves of common enzyme kinetics protocols; (2) it is modular and can adapt to various enzyme complex arrangements for both in vivo and in vitro systems via transformation of its rate and equilibrium constants; (3) it provides a clear association between the sensitivity of the parameters of the individual complexes and the sensitivity of the system's steady-state. To validate our approach, we conduct in vitro measurements of ETC complex I, III, and IV activities using rat heart homogenates, and construct an estimation procedure for the parameter values directly from these measurements. In addition, we show the theoretical connections of our approach to the existing models, and compare the predictive accuracy of the rate law with our experimentally fitted parameters to those of existing models. Finally, we present a complete perturbation study of these parameters to reveal how they can significantly and differentially influence global flux and operational thresholds, suggesting that this modeling approach could help enable the comparative analysis of mitochondria from different systems and pathological states. The procedures and results are available in Mathematica notebooks at http://www.igb.uci.edu/tools/sb/mitochondria-modeling.html."
https://openalex.org/W2046585102,"The aggregation of the baker's yeast prion Sup35p is at the origin of the transmissible [PSI(+)] trait. We and others have shown that molecular chaperones modulate Sup35p aggregation. However, other protein classes might be involved in [PSI(+)] formation.We designed a functional proteomic study that combines two techniques to identify modulators of Sup35p aggregation and describe the changes associated to [PSI(+)] formation. The first allows measuring the effect of fractionated Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytosolic extracts from [PSI(+)] and [psi(-)] yeast cells on Sup35p assembly. The second is a multiplex qualitative and quantitative comparison of protein composition of active and inactive fractions using a gel-free and label-free LC-MS approach. We identify changes in proteins involved in translation, folding, degradation, oxido-reduction and metabolic processes.Our functional proteomic study provides the first inventory list of over 300 proteins that directly or indirectly affect Sup35p aggregation and [PSI(+)] formation. Our results highlight the complexity of the cellular changes accompanying [PSI(+)] formation and pave the way for in vitro studies aimed to document the effect of individual and/or combinations of proteins identified here, susceptible of affecting Sup35p assembly."
