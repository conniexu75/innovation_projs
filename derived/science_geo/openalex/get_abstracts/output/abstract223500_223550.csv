However, in order to meet that role, more efficient thermoelectric materials are needed that are suitable for high-temperature applications. We show that the material system AgPb m SbTe 2+ m may be suitable for this purpose. With m = 10 and 18 and doped appropriately, n -type semiconductors can be produced that exhibit a high thermoelectric figure of merit material ZT max of ∼2.2 at 800 kelvin. In the temperature range 600 to 900 kelvin, the AgPb m SbTe 2+ m material is expected to outperform all reported bulk thermoelectrics, thereby earmarking it as a material system for potential use in efficient thermoelectric power generation from heat sources."
https://openalex.org/W2159460045,"A genetic interaction network containing approximately 1000 genes and approximately 4000 interactions was mapped by crossing mutations in 132 different query genes into a set of approximately 4700 viable gene yeast deletion mutants and scoring the double mutant progeny for fitness defects. Network connectivity was predictive of function because interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and similar patterns of interactions tended to identify components of the same pathway. The genetic network exhibited dense local neighborhoods; therefore, the position of a gene on a partially mapped network is predictive of other genetic interactions. Because digenic interactions are common in yeast, similar networks may underlie the complex genetics associated with inherited phenotypes in other organisms."

The role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling in such epithelial-mesenchymal interactions was determined by conditional inactivation of the TGF-beta type II receptor gene in mouse fibroblasts (Tgfbr2fspKO). The loss of TGF-beta responsiveness in fibroblasts resulted in intraepithelial neoplasia in prostate and invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the forestomach, both associated with an increased abundance of stromal cells. Activation of paracrine hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling was identified as one possible mechanism for stimulation of epithelial proliferation. Thus, TGF-beta signaling in fibroblasts modulates the growth and oncogenic potential of adjacent epithelia in selected tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1974482866,"A crucial aim upon completion of whole genome sequences is the functional analysis of all predicted genes. We have applied a high-throughput RNA-interference (RNAi) screen of 19,470 double-stranded (ds) RNAs in cultured cells to characterize the function of nearly all (91%) predicted Drosophila genes in cell growth and viability. We found 438 dsRNAs that identified essential genes, among which 80% lacked mutant alleles. A quantitative assay of cell number was applied to identify genes of known and uncharacterized functions. In particular, we demonstrate a role for the homolog of a mammalian acute myeloid leukemia gene (AML1) in cell survival. Such a systematic screen for cell phenotypes, such as cell viability, can thus be effective in characterizing functionally related genes on a genome-wide scale."

In a manner similar to that of entangled ropes, polymer chains can slide past but not through each other. Tube models of polymer dynamics and rheology are based on the idea that entanglements confine a chain to small fluctuations around a primitive path that follows the coarse-grained chain contour. Here we provide a microscopic foundation for these highly successful phenomenological models. We analyze the topological state of polymeric liquids in terms of primitive paths and obtain parameter-free, quantitative predictions for the plateau modulus, which agree with experiment for all major classes of synthetic polymers."
https://openalex.org/W2118060829,"Translocation of the small GTP-binding protein Rac1 to the cell plasma membrane is essential for activating downstream effectors and requires integrin-mediated adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix. We report that active Rac1 binds preferentially to low-density, cholesterol-rich membranes, and specificity is determined at least in part by membrane lipids. Cell detachment triggered internalization of plasma membrane cholesterol and lipid raft markers. Preventing internalization maintained Rac1 membrane targeting and effector activation in nonadherent cells. Regulation of lipid rafts by integrin signals may regulate the location of membrane domains such as lipid rafts and thereby control domain-specific signaling events in anchorage-dependent cells."

These Fe particles display magnetic properties that match those of bulk iron as evidenced by magnetic and Mössbauer measurements. The nanoparticles adopt a cubic shape with edges of 7 nanometers and are incorporated into extended crystalline superlattices containing nanocubes in close proximity and with their crystallographic axes aligned. These superlattices are formed in solution, precipitate in high yield, and may be redissolved and redeposited as two-dimensional arrays."

In skin, dermal microvascular endothelial cells must also react to danger signals from the surrounding tissue and immediately participate by initiating the wound repair process. Components of the extracellular matrix such as hyaluronan are rapidly broken down into smaller molecular weight oligosaccharides in a wound, and these can activate a variety of biological processes. This study set out to determine if hyaluronan fragments released following injury can stimulate endothelial cells and what mechanism is responsible for this response. Using genechip microarray analysis, a response to hyaluronan fragments was detected in endothelial cells with the most significant increase observed for the chemokine IL-8. This observation was verified with qualitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and ELISA in human endothelial cell culture, and in a mouse model by observing serum levels of MIP-2 and KC following hyaluronan fragment administration in vivo. Activation was TLR4-dependent, as shown by use of TLR4 blocking antibody and TLR4-deficient mice, but not due to the presence of undetected contaminants as shown by inactivation following digestion with the hyaluronan-degrading enzyme chondroitinase ABC or incubation with the hyaluronan-specific blocking peptide Pep-1. Inactivation of LPS activity failed to diminish the action of hyaluronan fragments. These observations suggest that endogenous components of the extracellular matrix can stimulate endothelia to trigger recognition of injury in the initial stages of the wound defense and repair response.

These observations suggest that endogenous components of the extracellular matrix can stimulate endothelia to trigger recognition of injury in the initial stages of the wound defense and repair response. Prompt recognition and response to injury is critical for activation of epithelial innate defense mechanisms, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and initiation of the repair process. The response to injury may involve exposure to exogenous foreign molecules such as microbial coat components. Tissue damage in sterile compartments such as fetal skin wounds also triggers defense and repair mechanisms. Many exogenous triggers of injury or danger have been identified, such as LPS, 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EC, endothelial cell; ECM, extracellular matrix; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hyaluronan; sHA, small molecular weight HA; IL, interleukin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. peptidoglycan, and other microbial components (1Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). These molecules are recognized at least in part by pattern recognition molecules such as members of the Toll family of cell surface receptors, an elegant and evolutionarily ancient system for recognition of exogenous danger (2Imler J.L. Hoffmann J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 304-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms for recognition of injury to self are less well described. Intracellular components of necrotic cells not normally seen by immune cells, components of the ECM, and stress signals such as an increase in heat-shock proteins have all been implicated as endogenous indicators of injury (3Beg A.A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 509-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 4Johnson G.B. Brunn G.J. Kodaira Y. Platt J.L. J.

Med. 2002; 195: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Among this group is hyaluronan (HA), an important structural component of the ECM that is also a common component of bacterial surfaces. This investigation sought to understand the role HA may play in the wound repair process. HA typically exists as a high molecular weight polymer greater than 106 Da and composed of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid (6Tammi R. Saamanen A.M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). HA is synthesized at the cell surface and is a uniform glycosaminoglycan since its disaccharides are not sulfated or epimerized. Thus, unlike glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfates that encode specific activity by use of a diverse disaccharide sequence, the size, concentration, and location of HA are the only variables to consider when evaluating function. Recently, small molecular weight HA (sHA) has been implicated in several biological processes including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, maturation, migration, activation of protein tyrosine kinase cascades, and inflammatory gene expression (8Chen W.Y. Abatangelo G. Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 9Deed R. Rooney P. Kumar P. Norton J.D. Smith J. Freemont A.J. Kumar S. Int. J.

Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These sHA fragments may activate repair processes and signal the immune recognition apparatus that injury has occurred. Microvascular endothelial cells (EC) exist in a crucial position. In the case of dermal microvascular EC, these cells traverse an interface between the surface epithelium and underlying connective tissue. They are able to sense danger and injury in the surrounding tissues and signal an immediate defense response (15Mantovani A. Bussolino F. Dejana E. Faseb J. 1992; 6: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Their activation is essential in the recruitment, rolling, adhesion, and extravasation of leukocytes to the site of injury and inflammation, a process that is critical to protection against pathogens (16Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Transplantation. 1990; 50: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In addition, ECs are able to respond to, and produce a variety of cytokines critical for signaling cells in both the proximal and distant environment that a repair or inflammatory process is underway. Due to the role of the dermal microvascular endothelium in sensing injury and signaling repair, we sought to determine how ECs respond to HA released from the ECM following injury. Understanding how ECs respond to the presence of HA fragments and the mechanisms involved in this signaling pathway will lend perspective as to how tissue damage is recognized and how immune modulators are recruited to the site of injury. Our findings suggest the pattern recognition receptor TLR4 participates in recognition of danger from both microbes and host injury. Media and Reagents—Human microvascular endothelial cells isolated from neonatal dermis (cryopreserved at passage 3) were purchased from Cascade Biologics and grown in Endothelial Cell Growth Media consisting of Medium 131 (Cascade) supplemented with Microvascular Growth Supplement (Cascade) and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed in 1%-serum media containing Endothelial Cell Basal Media (Clonetics), 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone acetate (Sigma), 5 × 10–5m dbcAMP (Sigma), and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). sHA (4-, 6-, and 8-mer hyaluronan fragments) were a gift from J. Simon, Department of Dermatology, Freiburg University, Germany. High molecular weight hyaluronic acid from human umbilical cord and Proteus vulgaris chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) were from Sigma. Hyalgan (HG) was manufactured by Sanofi-Synthelabo and purchased from Besse Medical Supply. LPS was purchased from Sigma and endotoxin-removal columns were from Seikagaku (followed manufacturer's instructions for endotoxin removal). TLR4 antibody, HTA125, was a gift from T. Kirkland, VA Medical Center, San Diego, CA, and the IgG control antibody for cell culture experiments was purchased from Sigma. Polymyxin B was purchased from Calbiochem and Pep-1 was synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA) as described previously (17Mummert M.E. Mohamadzadeh M. Mummert D.I. Mizumoto N. Takashima A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The LAL assay was performed using the Pyrochrome kit from Seikagaku. Millipore Microcon centrifugal filter devices (MWCO 3000) were purchased from Fisher. Wound Fluid Collection and Dot Blot—Wound fluid was isolated from sterile tubes inserted into the backs of mice for 48 h. Back fur was removed from mice with hair clippers and Nair. Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane, and betadine (povidine-iodine, 10%, Purdue Frederick) and an alcohol swab were used to clean the incision area. Incision was made by vertical tension of skin with forceps and single cut (∼1-cm long) with scissors. Blunt dissection of subcutaneous space was carefully performed with scissors and 6–8 sterile tubes (3.5-mm outside diameter from sterile nasal cannula tubing, Hudson Respiratory Care Inc.) were inserted into subcutaneous space. Wounds were closed with wound clips using wound clip applicator. After 48 h, mice were euthanized by over-anesthesia with halothane, back skin was washed with betadine, and wiped with an alcohol swab. The base of the wound clips were opened with scissors and wound fluid was collected in the wound space and in the tubing by micropipetting. Human wound fluid was collected from patients postsurgery and PGs/GAGs were isolated from human and mouse wound fluid by anion exchange purification as previously described (18Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Herndon M. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28116-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For mouse samples only, wound fluid was pooled from several different mice before PG/GAG isolation. Wound fluid and wound fluid GAG (WFGAG) was dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a dot blot apparatus. 1 μl of mouse wound fluid and 20 μl of human wound fluid was diluted in 200 μl of TBS, 200 μl of this was placed in one well of dot blot and the other 200 μl was serially diluted five times (2-fold dilutions each time). 1 μl of mouse WFGAG (one pooled sample) was blotted onto the membrane, corresponding to ∼0.05 μg of sulfated GAG. Approximately 0.5 μg of sulfated human WFGAG from three individual samples was blotted onto the membrane. Western blot blocking solution (Roche Applied Science) was used to block the blot and for primary and secondary antibody dilutions and 0.0l% Tween 20 in TBS (TBST) was used for all washes. After blocking, the blot was incubated with biotinylated-hyaluronic acid-binding protein (Seikagaku), diluted 1:1000, for 1 h at room temperature. Streptavidin-HRP, diluted 1:5000, was used as the secondary antibody, and the blot was developed with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Microarray Analysis—Endothelial cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml sHA in 1%-serum media for 6 h in 100-mm tissue culture dish (Falcon, BD Systems), after which total RNA was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy protocol and reagents. RNA was submitted to the SDVA Microarray Core Facility for biochemistry and image analysis carried out according to Affymetrix Standards. Affymetrix HuFL chips were utilized where control PBS-treated chip was compared with triplicate sHA-treated chips. Data were analyzed with MAS 5.0, and the gene list represents genes that increased at least 2-fold over control and varied by less than 35% between chips. IL-8 PCR—Endothelial cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml sHA in 1%-serum media for 6 h in 100-mm tissue culture dish (Falcon, BD Systems), and RNA isolated by Qiagen RNeasy kit. RT-PCR was performed using Ambion Retroscript Kit following the manufacturers instructions. 1 μg of RNA was used under the following PCR conditions: 80 °C for 3 min, 0 °C for 13 min, 42 °C for 1 h, 92 °C for 10 min, 4 °C hold. PCR was performed on the cDNA using IL-8 primers: 5′-GGAGAAGTTTTTGAAGAGGGCTGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAAGGCACAGTGGAACAAGGAC-3′ (backward). IL-8 PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min (23 cycles), 72 °C for 7 min, 4 °C hold. In Vitro Cell Culture Experiments—All endothelial cells were grown in Endothelial Cell Growth medium and seeded in 96-well flat bottom plates (Costar, Corning Inc.) until confluent. 8–16 h before adding samples, the cells were washed once with 1% serum medium and then 100 μl of 1% serum medium added to cultures. Endothelial cells were between passages 5 and 8 when assayed. Samples were diluted in 1% serum medium (100-μl total volume) and added to cells for indicated time points. For experiments using TLR4 and control antibodies, the antibody was added first to the cells in 1% serum medium (50-μl volume) and then the sample (i.e. sHA) in 1% serum medium (50-μl volume) was added approximately 5 min after antibody addition. Following indicated incubation, cell medium was collected into sterile 96-well U-bottom plate (Costar, Corning Inc.) and spun down at 1000 rpm for 10 min. Cell medium was removed from any pelleted material, placed in a sterile, U-bottom 96-well plate, and a small sample was assayed for IL-8 production by ELISA. The IL-8 ELISA kit was purchased from PharMingen and followed the manufacturer's protocol. HA Digestion—HA and sHA was digested completely by incubating 15 μg with 50 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC in chondroitinase buffer (50 mm Tris base/60 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0) at 37 °C overnight. Following digestion, samples were boiled for 10 min and then Microcon centrifugal filter devices were used to separate out the disaccharides generated from the enzyme that was retained in the filter. These samples were resuspended in 1% serum medium and added to endothelial cells for 24-hour incubation as described in in vitro cell culture experiments. Media samples were assayed for IL-8 production using IL-8 ELISA. In Vivo Mouse Experiments—Wild-type Balb/c mice and TLR4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μl of total volume of PBS, 100 μg of sHA, 100 μg of HA, or 25 ng of LPS for indicated concentrations and times. After specified incubation time, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and bled terminally by heart puncture. Blood was collected using a 20-gauge needle and 1-ml syringe (BD Systems). Serum was separated from whole blood collection by serum separator tubes (Ram Scientific) and placed at –20 °C until assayed. MIP-2 and KC levels were measured in serum by MIP-2 and KC ELISA (R&D Systems), respectively, following manufacturers instructions. Animal procedures were approved by the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System subcommittee on animal studies, protocol 02-037. Soluble HA Is Released Following Injury—The biological activity and functional significance of HA depends on oligosaccharide length and location relevant to responding cell types. To determine if HA is released from the ECM following injury and to measure the amount available as a potential signal to cellular components of the wound environment, HA was measured in human and mouse wound fluid generated and collected under sterile conditions. Biotinylated HA-binding protein detected abundant amounts of large molecular weight HA present in soluble form in wound fluid from both species (human > 0.32 mg/ml, mouse > 9.6 mg/ml). This HA measurement technique did not detect small molecular weight forms of HA as determined by separate analysis of purified small molecular weight HA (sHA) (4–6 oligosaccharides). However, several prior investigations have shown that endogenous hyaluronidases or reactive oxygen species in the skin or inflammatory conditions will process large molecular weight HA into smaller molecular weight forms (6Tammi R. Saamanen A.M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sampson P.M. Rochester C.L. Freundlich B. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1492-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Saari H. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1991; 50: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). sHA Triggers an Increase in Endothelial Cell IL-8 Gene Expression—Release of HA and sHA into the wound environment will expose the microvasculature to polysaccharides normally confined to the ECM or present on bacterial surfaces. To determine if this event could trigger a defensive immune response in endothelial cells, sHA was added to human microvessel dermal EC at concentrations similar to that measured in the wound environment. The transcriptional response of these cells was then explored by microarray analysis (Table I). Triplicate endothelial cell cultures treated with or without sHA were compared and analyzed using MAS 5.0. Table I lists genes that had at least a 2-fold change in expression and variance between chips of less than 35%. IL-8 transcripts had the largest increase, 56-fold.Table IMicroarray analysis of dermal endothelial cell response to sHAGeneMean fold increaseIL-856.13Melanoma growth stimulating factor21.34Stromelysin 2/MMP-1010.15ICAM-15.03Metallothineine from cadmium treated cells4.29p56 induced by IFN3.51Caveolin 13.19Syndecan 43.16Guanylate binding protein 2-interferon-inducible2.90Guanylate binding protein 1-interferon-inducible2.66Synuclein, α2.65Ikb/ MAD-32.59NFkB DNA binding subunit2.52Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type k2.38RGP3-G-protein signaling2.23Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 12.21Macrophage specific colony stimulating factor2.00Interferon-regulating factor 12.00GeneMean fold decreaseLymphocyte antigen 64 (mouse) homolog6.13Rho GTPase activating protein 55.31Glutamate receptor, ionotropic (NMDA)3.87Peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma3.60Guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)2.83Cell division cycle 25A2.10ControlsMean fold increaseGAPDH0.90β-actin1.02 Open table in a new tab To confirm the sHA-induced increase in IL-8 production suggested by gene-chip analysis, human EC IL-8 was measured directly. Qualitative RT-PCR supported an apparent increase in sHA induced IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 1a, inset). Production of IL-8 protein by cultured human EC increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, a and b) with appearance of IL-8 protein detectable ∼4 h after detection of IL-8 mRNA by RT-PCR. To determine if the increase in IL-8 production observed in cultured human ECs could occur in vivo, the effects of sHA in a mouse model of IL-8 responsiveness was determined. Mice were injected with either PBS or sHA intraperitoneally, and blood sampled after 2 h. Serum was tested for the presence of MIP-2 and KC, proposed IL-8 homologs in mice. Mice injected with sHA had a 6-fold increase in MIP-2 production over mice injected with PBS (Fig. 1c). In addition, sHA-injected mice had a 7-fold increase in KC production over PBS-injected mice (Fig. 1d). IL-8 and MIP-2 Induction by sHA is TLR4-dependent—Pattern recognition receptors such as TLR4 have been implicated in sHA-induced dendritic cell signaling and maturation. To determine if TLR4 plays a role in sHA-induced IL-8 production by EC, the effects of a TLR4 blocking antibody, and responsiveness of mice lacking functional TLR4 were evaluated. TLR4-specific blocking antibody completely abolished IL-8 release by human EC after sHA exposure while control IgG had no effect (Fig. 2a). A decrease in IL-8 production was also seen after incubation with TLR4 antibody alone. The mouse model of IL-8 responsiveness to sHA further supported a requirement for sHA to associate with TLR4. Control mice congenic to TLR4-deficient mice were injected intraperitoneal with sHA for MIP-2 measurements at 0, 2, 6, and 24 h after injection. Significant MIP-2 induction was observed in control mice after 2 h (data not shown). Control and TLR4-deficient mice were then injected with either PBS or sHA and bled after 2 h. Control mice injected with sHA had a 6-fold increase in MIP-2 compared with injection with PBS. Mice deficient in TLR4 had little MIP-2 response to sHA injection (Fig. 2b). In separate experiments, injection of LPS in control mice increased MIP-2 to ∼22 ng/ml. As expected, TLR4-deficient mice had diminished response to LPS, after injection of 25 μg of LPS MIP-2 levels slightly increased to 11 ng/ml (data not shown). In addition to MIP-2, KC was also measured in serum sampled from control and TLR4-deficient mice injected with PBS or sHA. KC was elevated 7-fold in controls injected with sHA compared with those injected with PBS. TLR4-deficient mice were unable to respond to sHA injection and did not have elevated levels of KC (data not shown). To confirm that the TLR4-dependent response of EC to sHA was due to recognition of the oligosaccharide and not due to the presence of trace contamination, several complementary experimental controls were performed. LPS contamination was directly evaluated by LAL assay for the presence of endotoxin in sHA preparations. Maximum detectable endotoxin was at 0.314 EU/ml in a 50 μg/ml sHA sample. The minimum LPS concentration required to induce an IL-8 response from EC under the assay conditions used in the present study was 1EU/ml, three times greater than the maximal amount of LPS detectable in sHA (Fig. 3a). To further eliminate the possibility that trace LPS was responsible for activity, HA preparations containing both large and small molecular weight HA were treated by passage over LPS binding columns. This did not affect the ability of HA to stimulate IL-8 (Fig. 3b). As a control for the efficiency of the LPS removal column, LPS (1 EU/ml) was added to the pharmaceutical-grade high molecular weight HA preparation lacking sHA required for stimulation of EC, then similarly treated by LPS removal column. In these controls, column treatment removed IL-8 stimulation activity. Similarly, addition of polymyxin B to EC cultures inhibited the ability of LPS but not sHA to induce IL-8 (data not shown). To directly demonstrate that sHA is responsible for stimulation of EC, a peptide inhibitor of HA binding (Pep-1) (17Mummert M.E. Mohamadzadeh M. Mummert D.I. Mizumoto N. Takashima A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and an enzyme specific for degradation of HA (chondroitinase ABC), were tested for ability to block IL-8 induction. Pep-1 completely blocked an increase in IL-8 by sHA (Fig. 3c). In separate experiments, Pep-1 did not inhibit LPS induction of IL-8 release from EC (data not shown). Chondroitinase ABC treatment that will degrade HA to inactive disaccharides abolished induction of IL-8 in both the HA preparation containing large and small molecular weight and sHA (Fig. 3d). Following injury, inflammation accompanies the wound healing process and is essential for defense against opportunistic pathogens, tissue repair, and remodeling. ECM components, such as glycosaminoglycans, have been implicated as innate signals of injury to the skin. Examples of glycosaminoglycans acting as inflammatory signals have included observations that small molecular weight HA induces dendritic cell maturation and that dermatan sulfate can induce expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells (13Termeer C.C. Hennies J. Voith U. Ahrens T. Weiss J.M. Prehm P. Simon J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1863-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 22Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Eriksson E. Detmar M. Gallo R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the current study we demonstrate that HA becomes soluble after mechanical injury. HA fragments were found to stimulate human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and induced the release of IL-8 in tissue culture. This stimulatory activity could be reproduced in vivo and the recognition of sHA was mediated by TLR4. Thus, rapid recognition of injury can be mediated by release of previously insoluble glycosaminoglycans from the extracellular matrix. These observations suggest HA and TLR4 serve as a sensitive detection system for initiation of the wound defense and repair process. HA normally exists in the epidermis and dermis as a high molecular weight polymer between 105 and 107 Da (6Tammi R. Saamanen A.M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). High molecular weight HA has been historically thought to promote tissue integrity and to provide scaffolding for cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation in the ECM (23Noble P.W. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). However, HA breakdown may serve as a signal that injury has occurred. HA fragments can diffuse between cells, and large molecular weight HA can transfer to lymph nodes by hydrodynamic movement (7Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions prior to injury the endothelial cells lining the microvasculature of the skin will be physically separated from HA and the remainder of the ECM by their basement membrane. These cells are essential to the early inflammatory process as they lie at the interface between blood and tissues, are able to regulate the traffic of molecules and cells across the vessel wall (15Mantovani A. Bussolino F. Dejana E. Faseb J. 1992; 6: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) and participate in the modulation of inflammation in part through their response and production of cytokines (24Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 427-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Following injury, release of sHA enables contact of these small polysaccharides with endothelial cells either by diffusion or as a consequence of the physical disruption of the blood vessel wall. Since the local environment of the dermis is rich in HA (25Juhlin L. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and interwoven with the microvasculature, the interaction of these two compartments is an unavoidable consequence of any form of tissue damage. Analysis of wound fluid collected aseptically from human surgical wounds or under sterile conditions following subcutaneous injury in mice confirmed prior observations that HA is released in soluble form after mechanical injury (6Tammi R. Saamanen A.M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fraser J.R.E. Laurent T.C. Evered D. Whelan J. The Biology of Hyaluronan. John Wiley & Sons, Avon1989: 41-59Google Scholar). Prior studies of skin and a variety of inflammatory conditions have shown that large molecular weight HA can be processed by hyaluronidases and reactive oxygen species to small molecular weight forms whose function in inflammation is unclear. Thus, evaluation of the consequences of an interaction between the newly generated small sHA fragments and dermal microvascular endothelial cells was a logical step toward further understanding the innate triggers of tissue repair. Microarray analysis indicated that expression of a variety of genes changes in endothelial cells upon sHA stimulation. Interpretation of microarray data is limited by the scope of the observations and limited information on the biological relevance of some of this information (27Li X. Gu W. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Microcirculation. 2002; 9: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Quantitatively minor changes in steady-state abundance of some gene transcripts may have great physiological importance. However, IL-8 was chosen for further analysis because of the magnitude of its response (56-fold increase) and its role in neutrophil recruitment. Neutrophils are important cells in innate immunity and wound healing because they provide part of the first line of defense for the host. Neutrophils possess a variety of mechanisms for inactivating bacteria and debridement of injured tissues (28Yager D.R. Nwomeh B.C. Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). IL-8 induces respiratory burst in neutrophils, generating both oxygen radicals and nitric oxide and releasing the lysosomal contents of the neutrophil, all of which participate in bacterial and tissue degradation (29Krishnaswamy G. Kelley J. Yerra L. Smith J.K. Chi D.S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 30Gillitzer R. Goebeler M. J. Leukoc Biol. 2001; 69: 513-521PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IL-8 signals keratinocyte proliferation and migration, increases the adherence of monocytes, and increases lymphocyte chemotaxis, events important in all phases of wound repair (30Gillitzer R. Goebeler M. J. Leukoc Biol. 2001; 69: 513-521PubMed Google Scholar, 31Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). Taken together, the activities of IL-8 and neutrophil recruitment represent a critical first step in preventing further bacterial infection and initiating clearing of the injured area. In the mouse, KC and MIP-2 are most closely related to human IL-8 and were thus chosen for analysis to confirm the response observed to sHA in vivo (31Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar, 32Garcia-Ramallo E. Marques T. Prats N. Beleta J. Kunkel S.L. Godessart N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6467-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 33Mancardi S. Vecile E. Dusetti N. Calvo E. Stanta G. Burrone O.R. Dobrina A. Immunology. 2003; 108: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following intraperitoneal injection, circulating MIP-2 increased 6-fold, consistent with the response observed in tissue culture. It is not clear from these data that the origin of MIP-2 is exclusively from endothelial cells in the mouse as this chemokine can be produced by several cell types (32Garcia-Ramallo E. Marques T. Prats N. Beleta J. Kunkel S.L. Godessart N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6467-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Van Damme J. Wuyts A. Froyen G. Van Coillie E. Struyf S. Billiau A. Proost P. Wang J.M. Opdenakker G. J. Leukoc Biol. 1997; 62: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the rapid response to sHA following intraperitoneal administration further confirmed the potential bioavailability of sHA to the vasculature, and established a useful animal model for identification of the mechanism responsible for recognition of sHA. Inhibition by specific blocking antibodies, and use of a mouse line deficient in functional TLR4, suggests that the increase in human IL-8 or mouse MIP-2 and KC induced by sHA is dependent on TLR4. This evolutionarily ancient pattern recognition receptor is best known at present for its ability to recognize LPS on Gram-negative bacteria. Recently, several investigations have suggested that there are many different ligands for TLR4, including both exogenous and endogenous molecules. A major limitation in the interpretation of these reports is conclusive evidence that the response observed was not due to undetected contamination by LPS. As LPS is a widely present and active at extremely low concentrations, rigorous demonstration of the identity of a TLR4 stimulatory molecule is required. In the present work, LAL assays confirmed that all reagents were free of endotoxin contamination or were well below the threshold endotoxin level required for TLR4 activation. In addition, polymyxin B, an LPS inhibitor, had no effect on sHA-treated ECs. Finally, experiments in which sHA was either inhibited by the HA blocking peptide Pep-1, or digested with chondroitinase ABC, resulted in subsequent loss of activation. The ability of these HA selective neutralizing approaches to inhibit IL-8 production by ECs further supports the conclusion that TLR4 activation is due to the presence of sHA and not contamination in the experimental setup. In addition to sHA released from endogenous sources after injury, bacteria such as Group A Streptoccous are coated in HA and can secrete hyaluronidases. Therefore, HA fragments can originate from either host or bacteria, and would be indistinguishable by themselves. This suggests that the cellular activation triggered by this stimulus it is not a self versus non-self recognition, but rather a specific phenomenon that signifies danger (35Matzinger P. Science. 2002; 296: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (3357) Google Scholar). The ability of bacterial hyaluronidases to degrade HA to inactive disaccharides as opposed to mammalian hyaluronidases that generate active hexa and octasaccharides may also reflect a system evolved by some bacteria to avoid detection. As a signal of danger, it would be important to normal tissue homeostasis that the size and abundance of HA is regulated. Existing information regarding the turnover of HA supports this hypothesis, it is proposed that ∼50% of tissue high molecular weight HA is turned over per day (7Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar, 36Tammi M.I. Day A.J. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is further estimated that 10–100 mg of HA enters the blood per day but serum levels are only 0.1% of this amount (37McCourt P.A. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. Faseb J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). Thus, an effective clearance mechanism exists for HA in the blood, perhaps associated with a mechanism for constant monitoring of tissue damage. High molecular weight HA is taken up by lymph nodes and liver but does not activate immune pathways. Therapeutically, both high molecular weight HA and hyaluronidase (39Menzel E.J. Farr C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) has been employed for modification of the host immune response (8Chen W.Y. Abatangelo G. Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 40Roman J.A. Chismol J. Morales M. Donderis J.L. Clin.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 371-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the case of wound repair, the presence of HA fragments appear to be a conserved “danger” signal, communicating to the host the presence of tissue damage through a pathway shared with identification of foreign microbial challenge. Further understanding and manipulation of this innate response system may be a useful approach to modulate wound healing.

We report that integrin-mediated activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at the leading edge is required for MT stabilization by the Rho-mDia signaling pathway in mouse fibroblasts. MT stabilization also involved FAK-regulated localization of a lipid raft marker, ganglioside GM1, to the leading edge.

https://openalex.org/W2156696618,"Insulin stimulation produced a reliable 3-fold increase in glucose uptake in primary neonatal rat myotubes, which was accompanied by a similar effect on GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α caused insulin resistance on glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation by impairing insulin stimulation of insulin receptor (IR) and IR substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, and Akt phosphorylation. Because this cytokine produced sustained activation of stress and proinflammatory kinases, we have explored the hypothesis that insulin resistance by TNF-α could be mediated by these pathways. In this study we demonstrate that pretreatment with PD169316 or SB203580, inhibitors of p38 MAPK, restored insulin signaling and normalized insulin-induced glucose uptake in the presence of TNF-α. However, in the presence of PD98059 or SP600125, inhibitors of p42/p44 MAPK or JNK, respectively, insulin resistance by TNF-α was still produced. Moreover, TNF-α produced inhibitor κB kinase (IKK)-β activation and inhibitor κB-β and -α degradation in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner, and treatment with salicylate (an inhibitor of IKK) completely restored insulin signaling. Furthermore, TNF-α produced serine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 (total and on Ser307 residue), and these effects were completely precluded by pretreatment with either PD169316 or salicylate. Consequently, TNF-α, through activation of p38 MAPK and IKK, produces serine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1, impairing its tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin and the corresponding activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, leading to insulin resistance on glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation.

Insulin increases glucose transport into cells of target tissues, primarily muscle (skeletal and cardiac) and fat (white and brown). Acute insulin treatment stimulates glucose transport in adipocytes and myocytes largely by mediating translocation of GLUT4 from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane, as reviewed previously (1Pessin J.E.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent discoveries have shown the presence of a second insulin signaling pathway leading to GLUT4 translocation in a PI3K-independent manner, involving the adaptor protein Cbl and the activation of a small GTP-binding protein, TC10 (3Khan A.H.

Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin can activate glucose uptake without producing GLUT4 translocation; this effect involves activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), as has been specifically reported for muscle cells (10Sweeney G.

Insulin resistance, defined as a smaller than normal response to a given amount of insulin, is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both genetic and environmental factors can contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Targeted disruption of insulin-like growth factor I and insulin receptor (IR) or of GLUT4, selectively, in skeletal muscle causes insulin resistance and insulin intolerance (11Bruning J.C.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has been proposed as a link between adiposity and the development of insulin resistance because (a) the majority of type 2 diabetics are obese, (b) TNF-α is highly expressed in adipose tissues of obese animals and humans (14Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6193) Google Scholar, 15Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2991) Google Scholar), and (c) obese mice lacking either TNF-α or TNF-α receptors showed protection against developing insulin resistance (16Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 17Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4832-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infusion of TNF-α to adult rats reduces systemic insulin sensitivity associated with major changes in adipocyte gene expression, favoring free fatty acid release without changes on muscle gene expression (18Ruan H.

These data suggest that impaired activity of the insulin signaling transduction pathways rather than changes in gene expression may be contributing to the development of insulin resistance in the muscle of TNF-α-treated animals. Direct exposure of fat cells to TNF-α inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in several systems including 3T3-L1 cells, human primary adipocytes, and primary brown adipocytes (19Hotamisligil G.S.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2563-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The mechanism proposed involves serine phosphorylation of IR substrate (IRS)-1 that converts IRS-1 into an inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity (21Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ser307 has been identified as a site for TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1, with activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) involved in the phosphorylation of this residue (22Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that p42/p44 and p38 MAPKs could inhibit insulin signaling by diverse mechanisms in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (23Engelman J.A. Berg A.H. Lewis R.Y. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, an enhanced basal activation of MAPKs in adipocytes from type 2 diabetic patients has been reported recently (24Carlson C.J. Koterski S. Sciotti R.J. Poccard G.B. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, other works have also implicated inhibitor κB kinase (IKK) activation by TNF-α on serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (25Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M.J. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), whereas IKK inhibition with salicylates or targeted disruption of Ikk-β produces reversal of obesity- and diet-induced insulin resistance (26Yuan M.

Biochem. 1999; 266: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and production of insulin resistance could be a consequence of sphingomyelinase or lipolytic activation by TNF-α (30Peraldi P.

However, a direct effect of TNF-α on insulin resistance in muscle, which is responsible for 80% of the glucose disposal of the body, is controversial. Several reports did not detect TNF-α inhibitory action on insulin-induced glucose uptake, although TNF-α per se highly increased basal glucose uptake (32Ranganathan S. Davidson M.B. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 1089-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Patiag D. Gray S. Idris I. Donnelly R. Clin. Sci.

Physiol. 1999; 276: E849-E855PubMed Google Scholar) observed that TNF-α had an inhibitory effect on insulin action without modifying basal glucose uptake in muscle cells. On the other hand, in most of these studies, insulin stimulation of glucose uptake was very poor because virtually all cultured skeletal muscle cell lines have been found to be deficient in GLUT4 expression. Accordingly, in this work, we have prepared primary cultures of neonatal rat myotubes that, under physiological conditions, respond to insulin by increasing glucose uptake 3-fold and increasing GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Both effects were impaired by chronic treatment with TNF-α. This cytokine, through activation of p38 MAPK and IKK, produces phosphorylation of the residue Ser307 in IRS-1, impairing the insulin signaling cascade at the level of IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1-associated PI3K and Akt activities.

The muscles from the fore and hind limbs were removed (carefully dissected to discard fat and connective tissues), washed in PBS (pH 7.5) to remove excess blood cells, triturated, and homogenized with scissors. Then the minced muscle was transferred to a Ca2+-free 0.25% trypsin solution containing 1 mm EDTA for incubation, with continuous stirring at 37 °C. Cells were collected after successive 20–30-min trypsinization periods of incubation, until all tissue was dispersed, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. The successive supernatants were filtered and reserved in growth medium. For the last incubation, the resting tissue was digested with a solution of collagenase II (Worthington) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS (100 IU/ml), 20–30 min at 37 °C with stirring. Finally, all the supernatants were centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g. The last pellet was washed with PBS, resuspended in growth medium, and pre-plated for 20–30 min in 100-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes to reduce the number of fibroblasts. The supernatant was collected, and the remaining myoblasts were diluted with growth medium to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. To facilitate adhesion of muscular cells to the plastic surface and to avoid attachment of fibroblasts, cells were seeded in collagen-coated dishes. Optimal plating densities were 1 × 106 cells in 6-well dishes and 5 × 106 cells in 100-mm-diameter dishes. Cells were cultured in growth medium (Dulbecco's minimal essential medium plus 10% horse serum) in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C during the first 3–4 days, when cells proliferated until reaching confluence, as observed under inverse light microscopy. Next, cells were cultured for an additional 4–5 days in differentiation medium (2% horse serum-Dulbecco's minimal essential medium), when cells fused and differentiated into multinucleated myotubes. Finally, myotubes were cultured overnight in serum-free, low-glucose (1000 mg/liter glucose) Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin before starting different treatments. Glucose Transport Determination—Glucose uptake was measured during the last 10 min of culture by incorporation of labeled 2-deoxyglucose. Parallel dishes were used for protein determination, and individual values were expressed as disintegrations/min/μg protein, as described previously for brown adipocytes (36Hernandez R. Teruel T. Lorenzo M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as percentage of stimulation over basal (control = 100). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (pH 7.4). After a 10-min incubation, cells were homogenized with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer using a tight-fitting pestle. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and the low-speed supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The high-speed supernatant constituted the internal membrane fraction. The pellet was washed three times and extracted in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 60 min. The Triton-soluble component (plasma membrane fraction) was separated from the Triton-insoluble material (cytoskeletal fraction) by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. Internal and plasma membrane fractions were kept at –70 °C before protein quantification and Western blotting with GLUT4 and caveolin-1 antibodies (20Teruel T. Hernandez R. Lorenzo M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2563-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations—Cells were extracted with lysis buffer I containing 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.5) and immunoprecipitated with different antibodies against IRSs, IR, p38 MAPK, or IKK-β. PI3K activity was measured in anti-IRS immunoprecipitates by in vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol as described previously (20Teruel T. Hernandez R. Lorenzo M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2563-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). p38 and IKK in Vitro Kinase Assays—These assays were performed in anti-p38 MAPK α and β and IKK-β immunoprecipitates as described previously (37Conejo R. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and two times with kinase buffer (35 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 μm Na3VO4). The kinase reaction was performed in a kinase buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 60 μm ATP, and 1 μg of MBP as a substrate for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried out and subjected to autoradiography. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer I, and cellular proteins (30 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membranes, blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), and incubated overnight with several antibodies as indicated in each case in 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% nonfat dried milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus) Western blotting protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Data Analysis—Results are means ± S.E. (n = 4 or 10) for duplicate dishes from 4 to 10 independent experiments. Statistical significance was tested with a one-way analysis of variance followed by the protected least-significant different test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. In experiments using x-ray films (Hyperfim), different exposure times were used to ensure that bands were not saturated. TNF-α Inhibits Insulin-induced Glucose Transport in a p38 MAPK-dependent Manner in Skeletal Muscle—Isolated neonatal muscle cells were differentiated in low serum until the formation of myotubes. Then, cells were shifted overnight to serum-free, low-glucose medium and further cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of 1 nm TNF-α before stimulation for 30 min with 50 nm insulin. Glucose uptake was measured during the last 10 min of culture by incorporation of labeled 2-deoxy glucose, and results were expressed as the percentage of stimulation over basal level (control = 100) (Fig. 1A). Insulin stimulation for 30 min significantly increased (3-fold) basal glucose uptake. Cells pretreated with TNF-α for 24 h showed a 3-fold higher glucose uptake than untreated cells, and under this circumstance, insulin stimulation did not further stimulate glucose uptake. Because insulin stimulation of glucose transport is mediated by the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, we decided to confirm the above-mentioned data on glucose uptake by examining GLUT4 translocation. After subcellular fractionation, GLUT4 protein in plasma membrane fractions was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Insulin increased GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane fraction 3-fold, but this effect was not produced when cells were pretreated with TNF-α before insulin stimulation. In parallel, the disappearance of GLUT4 localization in internal membrane produced by insulin was not observed when TNF-α was present together with insulin. Caveolin-1, an integral membrane protein from caveolae, was used as a marker protein of the plasma membrane, and its amount remained essentially unaltered by the different treatments used (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the increase in basal glucose uptake observed under TNF-α treatment was not the result of GLUT4 translocation, as shown in Fig. 1B. However, the levels of GLUT1 protein and mRNA detected under TNF-α treatment were increased compared with controls, without affecting the expression of GLUT4 protein (Fig. 1C). Moreover, because TNF-α treatment was performed in differentiated myotubes, no changes in the state of differentiation of the cells were observed (data not shown). The mechanism by which TNF-α produced insulin resistance on glucose uptake is far from clear and prompted us to investigate the signaling pathways elicited by chronic TNF-α treatment in skeletal muscle. Cells were deprived of serum overnight and further cultured for up to 24 h in the presence of 1nm TNF-α. At the end of the culture time, cells were collected, and protein extracts were analyzed for activation of stress kinases by Western blotting using the corresponding antibodies against phosphorylated and total p38 and p42/p44 MAPK and JNK (Fig. 2A). TNF-α produced a peak phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at 5 min, and this activation was sustained for at least 6 h of treatment. Furthermore, TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK was detectable for 6 h of treatment; these activations on MAPKs were not detectable after 24 h. JNK phosphorylation by TNF-α was detected after 30 min of stimulation, and this kinase remained active for 6 h. The changes observed in the state of phosphorylation of these kinases seem to reflect changes in their activities because the protein levels are similar in all the conditions. Next, we investigated which p38 MAPK isoform was activated by TNF-α, using in vitro kinase assays of MBP phosphorylation in immunoprecipitates against the p38 MAPK isoforms α and β (Fig. 2B). Stimulation for 5 min with TNF-α (1 nm) activated mainly the p38 MAPK activity associated with the β isoform, whereas 50 nm insulin, which has been shown to stimulate phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in C2C12 cells (38Conejo R. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), activated mainly the p38α isoform. Both isoforms were activated to a similar extent after stimulation with 500 mm sorbitol. To investigate whether the sustained activation of p38 MAPK, p42/p44 MAPK, and JNK by TNF-α could contribute to insulin resistance, we decided to impair these pathways by the use of chemical inhibitors and determine whether TNF-α was able to produce insulin resistance under those circumstances. We used SP (3 μm) to inhibit JNK, PD (20 μm) to inhibit ERK, and two different compounds (PD* (800 nm) or SB (10 μm)) as p38 MAPK inhibitors after testing the specificity and optimal inhibitory doses of these chemicals in neonatal muscle cells (Fig. 2C). Glucose uptake was determined in cells cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of 1 nm TNF-α with or without inhibitors, before stimulation for 30 min with 50 nm insulin (Fig. 1A). When cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of PD, SP, or PD*/SB, no significant changes in insulin or TNF-α-stimulated glucose uptake were detected. However, treatment with either PD* or SB completely restored insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in the presence of TNF-α, leading to a 5-fold stimulation over basal level and to a 2-fold increase over TNF-α (Fig. 1A). This effect was not observed in the presence of PD or SP. A similar restoration on insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 from internal membrane to the plasma membrane was detected in the presence of TNF and PD* for 24 h, whereas this effect was not observed in the presence of PD (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the presence of the inhibitors for 24 h did not modify the expression of GLUT4 or GLUT1 proteins (Fig. 1C). The above-mentioned data seem to indicate that although TNF-α activates several MAPKs in skeletal muscle, p38β MAPK could be the primary contributor to the TNF-α inhibitory effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. TNF-α Impairs the Insulin Signaling Cascade in a p38 MAPK-dependent Manner—The next step was to identify at which level TNF-α was interfering with the insulin signaling cascade, and whether that interference could be avoided in the presence of the inhibitor of p38 or p42/p44 MAPKs. Myotubes deprived of serum overnight were cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of 1 nm TNF-α with or without PD or PD*, before stimulation for 5 min with 50 nm insulin. Insulin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IR observed in IR immunoprecipitates, an effect that was impaired by pretreatment with TNF-α (Fig. 3A). However, treatment with PD*, but not PD, completely restored IR tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin in the presence of TNF-α. Treatment with TNF-α for 24 h not only decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR by insulin but also produced serine phosphorylation of the IR, as demonstrated in immunoprecipitates with P-Ser antibodies and Western blotting with IR β-chain antibody. However, serine phosphorylation of IR was decreased in myotubes pretreated with PD*, contributing to restoration on tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 was significantly impaired by pretreatment with TNF-α, without significant changes in IRS expression (Fig. 4, A and B). However, treatment with PD* in the presence of TNF-α completely restored tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin at the level of IRS-1, with a partial effect at the level of IRS-2. Treatment with TNF-α for 24 h produced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and this phosphorylation was precluded by pretreatment with PD*, but not PD, as demonstrated in immunoprecipitates with P-Ser antibodies and Western blotting with IRS-1 antibody (Fig. 4C). Moreover, TNF-α produced phosphorylation on the Ser307 residue of IRS-1 in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner, as demonstrated by direct Western blotting with anti-P-IRS-1(Ser307)-specific antibody. PI3K activity associated with IRSs was determined in the immune complexes after immunoprecipitation with either the anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibodies (Fig. 5A). TNF-α impaired insulin-induced PI3K activity in IRS-2 and, more evidently, in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, but this inhibitory effect was not produced in the presence of PD*. In addition, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-Akt antibodies for both regulatory residues Ser473 and Thr308 (Fig. 5B). Upon insulin stimulation, Akt was highly serine and threonine phosphorylated, and both effects were impaired by TNF-α pretreatment in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). All these dat"

Mathematics has been less intrusive in the life sciences, possibly because they have until recently been largely descriptive, lacking the invariance principles and fundamental natural constants of physics.

To study the biological consequences of MBL mutations, we expressed wild type MBL and mutated MBL in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The normal MBL cDNA (WT MBL-A) was cloned, and the three known natural and two artificial variants were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. When analyzed, WT MBL-A formed covalently linked higher oligomers with a molecular mass of about 300-450 kDa, corresponding to 12-18 single chains or 4-6 structural units.

Vorup-Jensen T. Jensenius J.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the functional MBL-MASP complex contains a small MBL-associated protein (sMAP), also named MAp19, with no serine protease activity (15Stover C.M. Thiel S. Thelen M. Lynch N.J.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). MASP-2 is a homologue of C1s of the classical complement pathway because it activates C4 and C2 (13Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T.

When MBL associated with MASP-2 binds to sugar groups on the surface of microbes, the MBL-MASP2 proenzyme is activated and cleaves sequentially C4 and C2, thereby creating the C4b2a complex, a potent C3 convertase. The MBL-MASP-1 complex is suggested to activate C3 directly (12Sato T. Endo Y. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Whether both MASP-1 and MASP-2 are bound on the same MBL molecule is still unclear. Moreover, the biological role of sMAP, as well as the substrate for the recently discovered MASP-3, remains unclear at this moment (for a recent review on MASPs, see Ref. 17Gadjeva M. Thiel S.

This polypeptide consists of four domains (Fig. 1): 1) a 20-amino acid N-terminal cysteine-rich domain involved in formation of intra- and intersubunit disulfide bonds, 2) a collagen-like domain consisting of 18-20 tandem repeats of Gly-Xaa-Yaa, 3) an α-helical coiled-coil neck region, and 4) A carbohydrate recognition domain capable of binding to a wide variety of carbohydrate arrays on the surface of microorganisms (3Neth O. Jack D.L. Dodds A.W. Holzel H. Klein N.J. Turner M.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Three polypeptides form a structural unit or subunit containing a triple helix at their collagen-like domain. Six of these units combine by interunit disulfide bonds to form the biologically active bouquet-like MBL protein (for a recent review on MBL structure, see Ref. 22Kawasaki T. Biochim. Biophys.

Two interrupt the tandem repeat Gly-Xaa-Yaa in the first (Gly) position, and the third introduces a cysteine residue in the second position.

In order to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease associations accompanying MBL variant alleles in more detail, we constructed and expressed recombinant wild type as well as variant MBL forms and investigated their structural and functional characteristics. Restriction enzymes and reverse transcriptase were from Amersham Biosciences. Taq polymerase was from Applied Biosystems. Cell culture utensils were from TPP (Trasadingen, Switzerland), except for triple bottom flasks that were from Nalge Nunc. Mannan, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, trypsin (1:250), Geneticin (G418), hypoxanthine/thymidine media supplement (HT-supplement), l-glutamine solution, penicillin-streptomycin solution, methotrexate (MTX), dialyzed fetal bovine serum, RPMI 1640, and Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium were all from Sigma. Large scale plasmid DNA isolation was performed using the Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit. Small scale DNA preparations were performed using the Quantum Prep Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Bio-Rad). General methods of molecular biology were applied as described in Ref. 44Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston K. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar. Cloning of the MBL cDNA—mRNA was isolated from the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and having the MBL genotype: HYPA/LYPB) using the Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Kit (Dynal). cDNA synthesis was done using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A PCR product was generated using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and 5′-primer (GAGATTAACCTTCCCTGAGT) and 3′-primer (GAGGGCCTGAGTGATATGAC) and cloned using the PCR-Script Amp Cloning Kit, Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Verification of correct DNA sequence was performed on Applied Biosystems sequencing equipment. The expected DNA sequence was obtained except for the silent mutation in codon 136: AACAsn → AATAsn. This construct was used for site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) and the following 5′-phosphorylated primers: MBL-B, CCCTTGGTGTCATCACGCCC; MBL-C, CCCCTTTTCTTCCTTGGTGC; MBL-D, GTGCCATCACACCCATCTTTG; MBL-E, GCCATCACGCTCATCTTTGG; MBL-F, GAGAAAAGGAGGAACCAGGC (substituted nucleotides shown underlined). Transfection and MBL Expression—The MBL gene was PCR-amplified out of the pPCR-Script Amp vector using the following primers: 5′-primer, GTCTCTTCC↓ATGTCCCTGTTTCCATCAC; 3′-primer, TGCTCTTCC↓AAGTCAGATAGGGAACTCACAGA (Eam1104I recognition sequence shown underlined, and cut site indicated with an arrow). The PCR product was digested with Eam1104I and cloned into the pDual vector (Stratagene). Attempts were made to achieve expression in Escherichia coli BL21 as well as transient expression in the human HUH-7 hepatoma cells (JCRB Cell Bank) and COS-7 (ATCC) but failed or gave low expression levels. The MBL gene was moved from the pCR-Script Amp vector to pBK-CMV (Stratagene) using NotI and XhoI and from pBK-CMV to the dicistronic vector pED using SmaI and PstI. The pEDdC vector was a kind gift from the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA) (45Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 46Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1992; 3: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This vector carries a cloning sequence for insertion of the target gene followed by the selectable and amplifiable marker gene dehydroxyfolate reductase (dhfr). The cell line used for recombinant expression of human MBL was Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG 44. This CHO clone is a double deletion mutant that contains no copies of the hamster dhfr gene and was a kind gift from professor Lawrence Chasin (Columbia University, New York) (47Urlaub G.

Untransfected cells were cultivated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented by 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm hypoxanthine, and 1.6 mm thymidine (designated hereafter as complete Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium) in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were passaged using 0.05% trypsin in PBS. Stable transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent kit from Invitrogen. Transfection was done by seeding 8 × 105 cells in 6-cm Petri dishes on day 0. On day 1, cell medium was replaced and transfected according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that 24 μl of LipofectAMINE, 0.2 μg of pSV2NEO (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and 20 μg of the pED-MBL vector were used. On day 3, cells were moved to a T25 flask, and on day 5, cells were moved to complete Iscove's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and omitting hypoxanthine and thymidine. Cells were moved to larger bottles when dense. When a G418-resistant pool of clones was obtained (after 10-14 days), selection and gene amplification with MTX was initiated by cultivating cells in complete Iscove's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 nm MTX and omitting hypoxanthine and thymidine. After cells had regained normal growth rate and morphology, the concentration of MTX was increased to 200 nm, 4 μm, 20 μm, and finally 80 μm. No significant amplification of MBL secretion into medium was seen at levels of MTX above 200 nm. Western Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed using 3-8% NuPAGE Tris acetate gels and Tris acetate running buffer both from Novex (San Diego, CA). Western blotting was done using the XCell II Mini-Cell blot apparatus and NuPAGE transfer buffer, both from Novex, and Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes from Amersham Biosciences (Hørsholm, Denmark). SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) was used for development of immunoblots utilizing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies or horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. As an Mr standard, the Precision prestained protein standard (Bio-Rad) was used. Quantization of MBL by ELISA—To determine expression levels of MBL in cell growth medium, in elutes from gel filtration experiments, and in fractions from SDG centrifugation, ELISA was performed as previously described (28Garred P. Madsen H.O. Kurtzhals J.A. Lamm L.U. Thiel S. Hey A.S. Svejgaard A. Eur. J. Immunogenet. 1992; 19: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In brief, microtiter wells were coated overnight with a capture antibody at 4 °C (1 mg/liter anti-human MBL mouse monoclonal antibody HYB 131-01 or HYB 131-11; State Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) in PBS and washed five times with a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4. All subsequent washes were performed with this buffer. Cell growth supernatant, eluates from gel filtration, or fractions from SDG centrifugation and, as a reference, different dilutions of a serum pool diluted in the above buffer containing 10 mm EDTA were incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Wells were washed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mouse monoclonal biotin-labeled anti human MBL antibody (biotinylated HYB 131-01, 0.1 ng/ml, State Serum Institute). Wells were rinsed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a 1:2,000 dilution of a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (RPN 1231; Amersham Biosciences) in the above buffer, developed using OPD tablets from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the absorbance was read at 490 nm. MBL-mediated Complement Activation—Assay for complement activation was performed by coating microtiter plates (MaxiSorp; Nalge Nunc) overnight at 4 °C with mannan (0.1 g/liter) in a buffer of 15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6. Wells were washed five times in a buffer of 0.4 mm sodium barbital, 0.15 m NaCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 2.12 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4. All subsequent incubations and washings were done with this buffer. Wells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with cell growth medium containing recombinant MBL. In control experiments, MBL binding to mannan was inhibited by the addition of 10 mm mannose, 10 mm N-acetylglucosamine, or 10 mm EDTA. Wells were incubated 1 h at 37 °C with serum from an MBL-deficient person diluted 1:400 (as a source of complement components, MBL genotype HYPD/HYPD (i.e. functionally defective MBL-D variant) (48Garred P. Larsen F. Madsen H.O. Koch C. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar)), rinsed, and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with a rabbit anti-human C4 antibody (0.3 ng/ml) (Dako). Wells were rinsed three times and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with a 1:2,000 dilution of a donkey anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragment, rinsed, and developed as described above. Quantization of MBL-mediated Complement Deposition Versus MBL Binding—Microtiter plates (MaxiSorp; Nalge Nunc) were coated with an MBL binding antibody (NImoAb001, 1.2 μg/ml, a kind gift from NatImmune, in PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times in TBS-T plus calcium (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 10 mm CaCl2) and blocked for 2 h in TBS-T plus calcium containing 1 mg/ml human serum albumin (TBS-T plus calcium and HSA; HSA was from the State Serum Institute). Culture supernatants were diluted 1 + 3, 1 + 7, 1 + 15, 1 + 31, 1 + 63, and 1 + 119 in the above buffer and added to microtiter wells in triplicates. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. and washed three times in TBS-T plus calcium. Human purified recombinant MASP-2 (activated during purification) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml (a kind gift from NatImmune) in TBS-T plus calcium and HSA and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed and divided into two. One set of plates (A) was developed by measuring MBL binding, and the other set of plates (B) was developed by measuring deposition of C4. In plate A, MBL binding was measured by incubating wells with a mouse monoclonal biotin-labeled anti-human MBL antibody (diluted 1:3000 in TBS-T plus calcium, biotinylated HYB 131-01; State Serum Institute) for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed, and europium-labeled streptavidin (Wallac, Turku, Finland) was added at a concentration of 0.1 mg/liter in the above washing buffer except that calcium was omitted, and 50 μm EDTA was included. Wells were incubated 1 h at room temperature, washed, and developed by adding 100 μl of Delfia Enhancement Solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated on an orbital shaker for 5 min. at room temperature. Then wells were counted in a Wallac Victor 2d multicounter 1420 (Wallac, Turku, Finland). In plate B, deposition of C4 was measured by incubation 1.5 h at 37 °C with purified human complement component C4 (∼1.5-2 ng/ml) in a buffer of sodium barbital (5 mm), NaCl (181 mm), CaCl2 (2.5 mm), MgCl2 (1.25 mm), pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml human albumin (State Serum Institute). Wells were washed three times, and 1 mg/liter biotinylated rabbit anti-human complement component C4c was added (Dako), biotinylated according to standard procedures. Wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed. Europium-labeled streptavidin was added, and development continued as described above. Purification of rMBL from Tissue Culture Supernatant—MBL was purified from tissue culture medium using both affinity and ion exchange chromatography. 200 ml of tissue culture medium was centrifuged (15,000 × g, 20 min) and filtered (0.2 μm) before incubation end-over-end at 4 °C with anti-MBL-Sepharose (HYB 131-11; State Serum Institute). The beads were packed into a chromatography column (Econo-Column (25 mm); Bio-Rad) and washed with 10-30 ml of PBS (1 ml/min on a BioLogic LP chromatography system; Bio-Rad) until the A280 base line was reached. Bound rMBL was eluted with 1 ml/min of 4.5 m MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and ELISA-positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Samples were concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 (regenerated cellulose, Mr cut-off 10,000; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The concentrated samples were loaded on an ion exchange column (Resource Q (1 ml), flow rate 1 ml/min; Amersham Biosciences) mounted in a BioLogic LP chromatography system (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted using a 10-ml linear gradient of 0-100% 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. ELISA-positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS, and purified recombinant MBL was stored at -20 °C. Gel Filtration—Purified MBL or tissue culture medium containing MBL was centrifuged (16,000 × g for 5 min) before being fractionated on a Superose 6 column (300 × 10 mm) equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, using the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) operated at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The void volume of the column was 8 ml. The column was equilibrated using a range of standards with known Stokes radii: human C1q (10.7 nm), human factor H (7.2 nm), human IgG (5.4 nm), chicken ovalbumin (2.9 nm). Standard protein Stokes radii were calculated as described in Ref. 49Ackers G.K.

The Stokes radii of the different MBL mutations were determined by their elution from the gel filtration column relative to the protein standards (49Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—Two aliquots of sucrose solution (20 and 10% sucrose in 20 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) were layered into centrifuge tubes, and the linear gradient was generated by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 17 h at 4 °C (Beckman SW40Ti rotor) to form a linear sucrose density gradient. Protein samples (500 μl) were loaded onto the gradient and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Gradients were fractionated into ∼20 fractions by peristaltic pumping from the base of the gradient. Individual fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by measuring A280. MBL was detected in fractions by ELISA as described above. Sedimentation coefficients (s20,w) were estimated by comparison of their mobilities with those of the following standard proteins: thyroglobulin (19.2 S), bovine liver catalase (11.2 S), bovine serum albumin (4.2 S), and equine skeletal muscle myoglobin (2.0 S).

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the principal inducer of acute phase response (APR) gene expression. In the present study, we demonstrate that chronic treatment with the PPARα agonist fenofibrate fully prevents the IL-6-induced APR gene expression in wild-type but not in PPARα-deficient mice. PPARα prevents the IL-6-induced expression of the positive APR genes fibrinogen-α, -β, -γ, haptoglobulin, and serum amyloid A and the IL-6-induced suppression of the negative APR gene, major urinary protein. Furthermore, the effect of PPARα on the APR gene expression does not simply consist in a delayed systemic response to IL-6 but occurs directly at the transcriptional level. This global suppression of acute phase gene transcription may be explained by two PPARα-dependent in vivo effects: 1) PPARα activation results in the down-regulation of the IL-6 receptor components gp80 and gp130 in the liver, thereby reducing the phosphorylation and activation of the downstream transcription factors STAT3 and c-Jun that transduce the IL-6 signal; and 2) PPARα reduces the basal expression of the transcription factors CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-α, -β, -δ, which are responsible for immediate and maintained transcription of APR genes. A similar global effect of fenofibrate on acute phase protein expression is observed in hyperlipidemic patients chronically treated with fenofibrate, which displayed decreased plasma concentrations of the positive APR proteins fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, plasminogen, and α2-macroglobulin and increased plasma concentrations of the negative APR albumin, underlining the clinical significance of our findings.

Ligand-induced oligomerization of receptor subunits leads to activation and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and of linker proteins, which propagate the signal to other pathways and cause activation of immediate early response genes, such as c-jun (9Kim H.

Fibrates are hypolipidemic drugs that efficiently normalize hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. In addition, fibrates may also lower fibrinogen and CRP plasma levels and affect other plasma APR proteins (18Jonkers I.J. Mohrschladt M.F. Westendorp R.G. van der Laarse A. Smelt A.H. Am. J.

Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Fibrates exert their action via activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). PPARα regulates transcription of target genes via binding of PPARα with its heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor to specific response elements. This pathway is mainly involved in the regulation of genes that play a role in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and may, in large part, explain the normolipidemic action of fibrates (21Gervois P. Torra I.P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2000; 38: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARα has been demonstrated to act as a negative regulator of genes involved in the inflammatory response by antagonizing the activity of transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP-1, partly by direct interaction with proteins such as p65 and c-Jun (20Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A.

In line with these findings, impaired expression of PPARα has been found to sustain the inflammatory response (23Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). We previously showed that PPARα agonists attenuate the IL-6-induced expression of human fibrinogen genes in vitro in hepatocytes pretreated for 4 h with PPARα activators (24Gervois P. Vu-Dac N. Kleemann R. Kockx M. Dubois G. Laine B. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Kooistra T. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33471-33477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate that chronic in vivo treatment with the PPARα activator fenofibrate results in the total suppression of the IL-6-induced APR response gene expression in a PPARα-dependent manner. The suppressive effect involves both negative and positive APR genes. The inhibitory effect of PPARα activation occurs at the level of transcription as shown by nuclear run-on experiments. An explanation for this global transcriptional effect is provided by the PPARα-dependent down-regulation of the IL-6 receptor components gp80 and gp130 and by the PPARα-dependent down-regulation of APR protein transcription factors controlling APR gene transcription. Finally, fenofibrate treatment of hyperlipidemic human subjects resulted in a similar global effect on positive and negative APR protein expression, thereby underlining the clinical significance of our findings. Animal Studies—Animal studies were performed in compliance with European Community specifications regarding the use of laboratory animals. Experimental conditions have been described previously (19Kockx M. Gervois P.P. Poulain P. Derudas B. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Princen H.M. Kooistra T. Staels B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2991-2998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, male Sv/129 homozygous PPARα wild-type (+/+) and PPARα-deficient (-/-) mice (10–12 weeks of age) (a kind gift of Dr. Frank Gonzalez) were fed for 17 days with either a standard mouse chow or mouse chow containing 0.2% (w/w) fenofibrate (three mice per treatment). Mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of IL-6 (0.5 μg/mice) or saline buffer 4 h before sacrifice. Animals were killed by exsanguination under ether anesthesia. Livers were removed immediately, weighed, rinsed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, and subjected to nucleus isolation. For RNA analysis, a similar second experiment with longer IL-6 treatment (24 h) was performed with four animals/group. For analysis of fenofibrate effect on gp130 protein at different time periods (1, 3, 7, 14 days), a time course experiment was performed with either a standard chow or mouse chow containing 0.2% (w/w) fenofibrate (three mice per treatment). For immunoblotting, livers were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline containing proteinase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics), centrifuged (5 min, 13,000 rpm) at 4 °C, and soluble proteins were boiled in Laemmli electrophoresis buffer for immunoblot analysis. Preparation of Nuclei and Run-on Assays—Nuclei were prepared from fresh mice livers as described by Gorski et al. (25Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Transcription run-on assays were performed as described by Nevins (26Nevins J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of labeled nuclear RNA were hybridized for 48 h at 42 °C to 1 μg of purified cDNA probes immobilized on Hybond C Extra filters (Amersham Biosciences). The following cDNAs were spotted: a mouse fibrinogen Aα-chain cDNA probe, a mouse fibrinogen Bβ-chain cDNA probe, a mouse fibrinogen γ-chain cDNA probe, a rat acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) cDNA probe, a mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate deshydrogenase cDNA probe, a mouse serum amyloid A cDNA probe, a mouse haptoglobulin cDNA probe, a major urinary protein cDNA probe, and a human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein 36B4 cDNA probe. After hybridization, filters were washed at room temperature for 10 min in 0.5× SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS and washed twice for 30 min at 65 °C and then subsequently exposed to an x-ray film (X-OMAT-AR, Eastman Kodak Co.). RNA Analysis—Total RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (27Staels B. Auwerx J. Development. 1992; 115: 1035-1043PubMed Google Scholar) using as cDNA probes: mouse fibrinogen Aα-chain, mouse fibrinogen Bβ-chain, mouse fibrinogen γ-chain, rat ACO, serum amyloid A, haptoglobulin, major urinary protein, and human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein 36B4. RNA expression of gp80, gp130, and 28S was analyzed by real time quantitative PCR using SYBR Green technology on a MX4000 apparatus (Stratagen). PCR was performed with the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-AAG CAG CAG GCA ATG TTA CC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAT AAA TAG TCC CCA GTG TCG-3′ for gp80; forward, 5′-AGG GGA AGA ATA TGC TGT GC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAG TGC CAT GCT TTG ACT GG-3′ for gp130; forward, 5′-AAA CTC TGG TGG AGG TCC GT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTT ACC AAA AGT GGC CCA CTA-3′ for 28S. Quantification of gp80 and gp130 mRNA expression was corrected using ribosomal protein 28S gene expression as a internal control. Western Blotting—For SDS-PAGE, samples were electrophoresed as described (24Gervois P. Vu-Dac N. Kleemann R. Kockx M. Dubois G. Laine B. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Kooistra T. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33471-33477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride transfer membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder (Merck) diluted in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 55 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Blots were incubated with the following primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heerhugowaard, The Netherlands): a goat anti-C/EBPα (sc-9315)antibody, a rabbit anti-C/EBPβ (sc-150) antibody, a rabbit anti-C/EBPδ (sc-636) antibody, a rabbit anti-c-Jun (sc-45), a rabbit anti-phosphoSer73 c-Jun (sc-7981) antibody, a rabbit anti-STAT3 (sc-7179) antibody, a goat antiphospho Tyr705 STAT3 (sc-7993) antibody, a rabbit anti-IL-6R (sc-660) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For detection of gp130, the Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody set gp130 (sc-656) in combination with the pre-adsorbed horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (sc-2305) was used. Goat anti-β-actin antibodies (sc-1615) were used for control. All antibodies were diluted in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 55 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% (w/w) bovine serum. The Super Signal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce) and the luminescent image work station (Roche Diagnostics) were used for visualization. Clinical Study—Mildly hyperlipidemic patients (n = 38) received 250 mg of fenofibrate (Knoll AG, Mannheim, Germany) per day for 4 weeks. After a 12-h overnight fast, venous blood samples were taken under standardized conditions before and after 4 weeks of treatment with fenofibrate. Fibrinogen was determined by the Clauss method (28Ernst E. Resch K.L. Saradeth T. Maier A. Matrai A. J. Clin. Pathol. 1992; 45: 534-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Plasminogen activity (in percentage) was measured by a chromogenic assay (Chromogenix, Milano, Italy). For α2-macroglobulin, albumin, and C-reactive protein, a nephelometric method was used (Beckman, Munich, Germany). Serum amyloid A was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Laboserv, Giessen, Germany). Data was analyzed using the standard univariate repeated measures model (20Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). A one-sided p value <0.05 was regarded as significant. PPARα Activation Prevents IL-6-induced APR Response at the mRNA Level in Vivo—To study the effect of chronic PPARα activation on IL-6-induced APR gene expression in vivo, we determined mRNA levels of APR genes in livers of wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice, untreated (control) or treated for 17 days with fenofibrate and subsequently stimulated or not by IL-6 for 4 h (Fig. 1) (three mice per treatment). The positive APR genes fibrinogen (Fbg), serum amyloid A (SAA), and haptoglobulin (HG) and the negative APR gene major urinary protein (MUP) were analyzed together with the established hepatic PPARα target gene ACO (29Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar) and 36B4, which served as internal control. As expected, ACO mRNA levels were induced in fibrate-treated wild-type but not in PPARα-deficient mice (Fig. 1). 36B4 mRNA levels remained constant under all conditions. Basal mRNA levels of the fibrinogen α, β, and γ genes coding for the three non-identical polypeptide chains, Aα, Bβ, and γ, were decreased by fenofibrate treatment in wild-type but not in PPARα-deficient mice (Fig. 1). Wild-type mice stimulated with IL-6 responded with a strong induction of the mRNA expression of the three fibrinogen genes. Interestingly, this IL-6 effect was fully suppressed by fenofibrate treatment in wild-type mice, whereas IL-6-stimulated mRNA levels of the three fibrinogen genes were unaffected by fenofibrate treatment in PPARα-deficient mice. To determine whether the suppressive effect of PPARα on IL-6-induced APR gene expression is global, the influence of fenofibrate on other positive as well as negative APR gene expression was also analyzed. In wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice, IL-6 treatment increased mRNA levels of the positive APR genes SAA and HG and decreased the negative APR gene MUP (Fig. 1). Fenofibrate treatment inhibited IL-6-stimulated mRNA expression of the SAA and HG genes in the livers of wild-type mice, whereas, as was similar for fibrinogen, no effect was observed in PPARα-deficient mice. Remarkably, the down-regulation of MUP by IL-6 was completely prevented by fenofibrate treatment in wild-type but not in PPARα-deficient mice (Fig. 1). Together, these results indicate that chronic PPARα activation has a global effect on the hepatic expression of both positive and negative acute phase genes in vivo. To determine whether PPARα activation also delays IL-6 modulation of APR genes at a later time point, the effect of chronic fenofibrate treatment was examined on mRNA levels of APR genes in livers of wild-type mice (four mice per treatment) stimulated or not with IL-6 for 24 h (Fig. 2). Control and fenofibrate groups without IL-6 stimulation exhibit a comparable effect as that reported for higher levels (Fig. 1). Activation of all three fibrinogen genes by IL-6 was almost totally abolished after 24 h IL-6 treatment, whereas activation of SAA and HG was still detectable at this time point and whereas MUP mRNA expression partially recovered after 24 h of IL-6 treatment (Fig. 2). Interestingly, fenofibrate treatment prevented the effects of IL-6 stimulation for 24 h in a similar manner as after 4 h of IL-6 stimulation. These results demonstrate that the systemic response to IL-6 treatment is not delayed but prevented upon PPARα activation in vivo. Suppressive Effect of PPARα on IL-6-induced APR Occurs at the Transcriptional Level in Vivo—To determine whether the effect of PPARα on APR gene expression occurs at the transcriptional level in vivo, nuclear run-on transcription assays were performed on nuclei prepared from livers of wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice, pretreated or not with fenofibrate and stimulated or not with IL-6 for 4 h (Fig. 3). As expected, the transcription rate of ACO was enhanced in fenofibrate-treated wild-type mice but not in PPARα-deficient mice, and IL-6 treatment slightly increased ACO transcription independent of the presence or absence of PPARα (Fig. 3A). As a negative control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcription levels remained constant under all conditions. Basal transcription of the fibrinogen α and γ genes and to a lesser extent of the fibrinogen β gene was decreased by fenofibrate treatment (Fig. 3A). In wild-type mice, the transcription rate of the three fibrinogen genes was strongly enhanced upon IL-6 stimulation, an effect that was fully abolished by fenofibrate treatment. As observed at the mRNA levels, the basal transcription rates of the three fibrinogen genes was elevated in PPARα-deficient mice when compared with wild-type mice. The absence of effect of fenofibrate treatment in PPARα-deficient mice demonstrated that PPARα is required for fenofibrate inhibition of IL-6-mediated fibrinogen gene transcription in vivo. The suppressive effect of PPARα on the IL-6-induced APR also occurs at the transcriptional level for both the positive APR genes (SAA and HG) and the negative APR gene (MUP) (Fig. 3B). Again, the involvement of PPARα in the action of fenofibrate was demonstrated using PPARα-deficient mice in which fenofibrate had no effect on the transcriptional regulation of both positive and negative APR genes (Fig. 3B). Together, these results indicate that PPARα exerts its global effect on the hepatic expression of both positive and negative APR genes at the level of transcription. PPARα Represses the Expression of IL-6 Receptor Complex Components in Vivo—The broad effect on positive and negative APR proteins prompted us to analyze whether PPARα acts at the level of upstream receptor proteins required for IL-6 signal transduction, i.e. gp80 and gp130. The levels of gp80 and gp130 mRNA were determined in livers of mice treated with fenofibrate for 17 days by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. A marked decrease of both gp80 and gp130 mRNA expression was observed in wild-type mice upon fenofibrate treatment (Fig. 4A). This effect occurred in a PPARα-dependent fashion since mRNA expression of both IL-6 receptor components were unaffected in livers of PPARα-deficient mice treated with fenofibrate (Fig. 4A). Next, the level of gp80 and gp130 proteins was analyzed by Western blot. Although the expression of gp80 was very weak and too low to be detectable by Western blot, the gp130 subunit was reduced in a PPARα-dependent fashion (Fig. 4B). Results from a time course experiment with fenofibrate indicated that the protein levels of gp130 already slightly decreased after 3 days of treatment and strongly decreased on further prolonged treatment (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Time-dependent effect of PPARα activation on hepatic gp130 protein levelsin vivo. Mice were treated with 0.2% (w/w) fenofibrate (FF) or not (Cont) for different time periods. Animals were sacrificed after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of diet treatment. Liver samples were prepared for Western blotting, and 30 μg of protein was electrophoresed per lane. β-actin was used for control to confirm equal loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, it was analyzed whether fenofibrate treatment also reduced gp130 protein levels in non-hepatic tissues, i.e. heart, kidney, muscle, and spleen of mice treated with fenofibrate for 2 weeks. Although gp130 protein was expressed in all tissues tested (Fig. 6), a down-regulation was observed only in liver but not in the other tissues tested. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that PPARα activation decreases the expression of hepatic IL-6 receptor system proteins required for IL-6 signal transduction, which, in part, explains the global suppressive effect of fenofibrate on IL-6-mediated APR gene expression. Also, we identify the IL-6 receptor subunits gp80 and gp130 as two novel PPARα-regulated genes. Activated PPARα Lowers Protein Concentrations of Transcription Factors Mediating the IL-6-induced APR in Vivo— The gp130 subunit transduces the IL-6 signal to downstream transcription factors and mediates Tyr-705 phosphorylation, which results in activation of STAT3 (7Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar) and subsequent transcription of STAT3-regulated APR genes (30Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun enhance IL-6-mediated activation of transcription (11Schuringa J.J. Timmer H. Luttickhuizen D. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Yoo J.Y. Wang W. Desiderio S. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26421-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed whether chronic PPARα activation by fenofibrate could affect the level of STAT3 and c-Jun protein and their activated forms phospho-STAT3 and phospho-c-Jun in the livers of wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice treated or not for 17 days with fenofibrate and subsequently stimulated for 4 h with IL-6. STAT3 protein levels were similar in wild-type and PPARα-deficient and unchanged upon IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 7A). However, phosphorylated STAT3 levels were decreased in wild-type mice treated with fenofibrate but not in PPARα-deficient mice, which is in accordance with the observed PPARα-dependent down-regulation of the gp130 receptor subunit. Fenofibrate treatment only slightly reduced basal c-Jun levels in wild-type mice. However, a strong reduction of phosphorylated c-Jun levels was observed in wild-type mice exposed to fenofibrate. By contrast, this reduction was not observed in PPARα-deficient mice (Fig. 7A). The protein concentration of C/EBP transcription factors determines the transcriptional regulation of many IL-6-responsive APR genes (14Baumann H. Morella K.K. Campos S.P. Cao Z. Jahreis G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPs are induced by IL-6 and act in concert with STAT3 and c-Jun to promote APR gene expression (13Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of the effect of fenofibrate on C/EBP expression levels in wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice revealed that the basal protein expression levels of the isoforms C/EBPα, -β, and -δ were markedly reduced in livers of wild-type mice treated for 17 days with fenofibrate (Fig. 7B) in the presence and absence of IL-6. This down-regulatory effect was not observed in PPARα-deficient mice and thus fully dependent on the presence of PPARα. Together, these data show that PPARα activation reduces both the phosphorylation status of transcription factors STAT3 and c-Jun that transduce the IL-6 signal and the basal expression levels of cooperatively acting C/EBP transcription factors in vivo. Reduced availability of native and activated forms of transcription factors required for IL-6-induced APR gene transcription may explain the global suppression of the acute phase gene transcription by fenofibrate. Treatment with Fenofibrate Regulates the Expression of Positive and Negative APR Proteins in Humans—To verify whether treatment with fenofibrate has a similar global quenching effect on positive and negative APR proteins in humans, plasma samples of patients with mild hyperlipidemia that had undergone a 4-week fenofibrate treatment were analyzed before and after the treatment. The influence of fenofibrate on plasma concentrations of marker proteins that are related to the APR is summarized in Table I. Significantly reduced plasma concentrations were observed for the positive APR proteins fibrinogen, CRP, SAA, α2-macroglobulin, and plasminogen, whereas the negative APR protein albumin was elevated by fenofibrate treatment. The data show that treatment with fenofibrate has a similar broad effect on the expression of positive and negative APR proteins in humans and underscore the clinical significance of our findings in mice.Table 1Changes in acute phase protein plasma concentrations of hyperlipidemic patients (n = 38) that were treated with fenofibrate (250 mg/day) for 4 weeks Blood samples were taken from patients before and after 4 weeks of fenofibrate treatment. Changes in the plasma concentrations were indicated with trend arrows and presented as differences of means together with their standard errors (S.E.) and P values. Open table in a new tab Although PPARα is predominantly expressed in the liver and activities of PPARα comprise an anti-inflammatory action (31Delerive P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), the effect of PPARα on the APR is unclear. IL-6 is considered to be one of the most important inducers of the global hepatic APR reaction (1Streetz K.L. Wustefeld T. Klein C. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2001; 47: 661-673PubMed Google Scholar). We previously investigated the direct effect of acute activation of PPARα on the APR in vitro in hepatocytes. We here demonstrate that chronic activation of PPARα with fenofibrate fully suppresses IL-6-induced APR gene expression in mice in vivo. Evidence is provided that PPARα acts at the transcriptional level because IL-6-stimulated APR gene transcription was not suppressed in fenofibrate-treated PPARα-deficient mice. We found that PPARα is a global suppressor of the APR influencing the expression of both positive (IL-6-up-regulated) and negative (IL-6-down-regulated) APR genes, which can be explained by two PPARα-dependent effects. First, chronic PPARα activation down-regulates the expression of the IL-6 receptor components gp80 and gp130, leading to reduced phosphorylation, i.e. reduced activation of downstream transcription factors by IL-6. The down-regulation of gp130 protein expression by PPARα activation time-dependent and selectively occurs in liver but not in the other tissues tested. Second, PPARα down-regulates protein levels of synergistically acting transcription factors C/EBPα, -β, and -δ of APR genes. Importantly, the global suppression of APR gene transcription by fenofibrate in mice in vivo corresponds with a similar global effect in fenofibrate-treated humans, which display reduced plasma levels of several positive APR proteins and an increased plasma level of the negative acute phase protein serum albumin. In wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice, IL-6 strongly induced the expression of positive APR genes fibrinogen-α, -β, and -γ, haptoglobulin, and SAA. The expression level of the negative APR protein MUP is reduced by IL-6, but its expression remained elevated in IL-6-stimulated, fenofibrate-treated wild-type animals. PPARα activation clearly interfered with this negative regulation of MUP as demonstrated in PPARα-deficient mice. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a gene whose cytokine-induced down-regulation is inhibited by PPARα. These IL-6 effects on APR gene expression, however, were fully suppressed in fenofibrate-treated wild-type mice but not in fenofibrate-treated PPARα-deficient mice, indicating that chronic PPARα activation in vivo can very potently counteract the modulation of IL-6-modulated APR gene expression in the liver. Moreover, we demonstrated that PPARα does not act by delaying the systemic response to IL-6 but that its effects occur at the transcriptional level for all genes studied. The broadness and strength of this chronic in vivo effect has been surprising, and haptoglobulin, SAA, and MUP represent novel PPARα-dependently regulated genes. The suppression of the IL-6-induced expression of fibrinogen genes α, β, and γ in vivo is in line with our previous in vitro observations (24Gervois P. Vu-Dac N. Kleemann R. Kockx M. Dubois G. Laine B. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Kooistra T. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33471-33477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and underscores the broad inhibition of APR gene expression by PPARα. The global suppression of APR gene expression in the liver by PPARα adds to its activities in the vascular wall (32Delerive P. Gervois P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36703-36707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 33Marx N. Sukhova G. Collins T. Libby P. Plutzky J.

Res. 2002; 90: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and to the findings that PPARα-deficient mice exhibit an exacerbated response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation (32Delerive P. Gervois P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36703-36707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and a prolonged inflammatory response (23Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Thus, PPARα may represent a major target of interest for the control of hepatic cardiovascular risk factors. However, it remains to be investigated which hepatic PPARα-expressing cells are most responsive to fibrate treatment in vivo and contribute most to the observed effect. The global effect of PPARα on the expression of positive and negative APR gene expression suggested an upstream suppression of the IL-6 pathway. IL-6-induced APR genes share a common receptor system, consisting of gp80 and gp130, which initiates a signaling cascade leading to STAT3 activation by phosphorylation. In fenofibrate-treated wild-type mice, PPARα down-regulates mRNA expression levels of the IL-6R (gp80) by 70% and of the signal transducer gp130 by 60%. In line with this observation, we found a PPARα-dependent reduced expression of gp130 protein and, accordingly, reduced levels of phosphorylated STAT3. All these effects were not observed in PPARα-deficient mice, indicating that the down-regulation is PPARα-dependent, thereby identifying gp80 and gp130 as two novel PPARα-regulated genes. Of note, propagation of the IL-6 signal to other pathways also requires a functional gp130 subunit (11Schuringa J.J. Timmer H. Luttickhuizen D. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Yoo J.Y. Wang W. Desiderio S. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26421-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the PPARα-dependent down-regulation of gp130 may cause the observed reduced phosphorylation, i.e. activation, of c-Jun. Our finding that PPARα can down-regulate gp130 expression may also be of relevance for other cytokines of the IL-6 family since IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin (CT)-1 all share the gp130 receptor for signal transduction (8Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 11Schuringa J.J. Timmer H. Luttickhuizen D. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Not unexpectedly for such a central receptor, the gp130 gene knockout is lethal, whereas mice deficient in one of the above cytokines display only relatively mild defects (35Yoshida K. Taga T. Saito M. Suematsu S. Kumanogoh A. Tanaka T. Fujiwara H. Hirata M. Yamagami T. Nakahata T. Hirabayashi T. Yoneda Y. Tanaka K. Wang W.Z. Mori C. Shiota K. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we found that PPARα-dependent repression of gp130 occurs in liver but not in heart, kidney, muscle, or spleen when PPARα is activated by fenofibrate. Depending on the tissue specificity of PPARα activation and properties of PPARα ligands, PPARα may influence processes triggered by the above cytokines such as hematopoiesis, leukocyte proliferation, blastocyst implantation, and osteoclast development (7Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of the gp80/gp130 receptor system may not fully explain the broad and potent activity of PPARα on APR gene regulation for two main reasons: first, since complete abolishment of gp130 protein expression only occurs after PPARα activation for at least 7 days, and second, since the promoter regions of APR genes display a high degree of divergence with respect to the types and number of response elements. C/EBPs are responsible for immediate and maintained activation of transcription of the IL-6-induced APR, and APR gene transcription is related to the concentrations of C/EBPs present in the cell (14Baumann H. Morella K.K. Campos S.P. Cao Z. Jahreis G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zauberman A. Lapter S. Zipori D. J. Biol.

It has been reported that genetic ablation of a single C/EBP isoform does not lead to the complete abolishment of the APR (36Fattori E. Sellitto C. Cappelletti M. Lazzaro D. Bellavia D. Screpanti I. Gulino A. Costantini F. Poli V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 762: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and it is suggested that lack of one particular C/EBP isoform is compensated by the other C/EBP isoforms. Our results show that the basal cellular protein concentrations of C/EBPα, -β, and -δ isoforms are PPARα-dependently decreased in wild-type mice by fenofibrate treatment. The observed reduction of all three C/EBP isoforms thus prevents any compensatory mechanism in these mice. In PPARα-deficient mice, the basal C/EBPα, -β, and -δ protein levels were comparable with the basal levels in wild-type mice and were, by contrast, not down-regulated by fenofibrate treatment. This PPARα-dependent down-regulation of C/EBPα and -δ is supported by data from Takata et al. (37Takata Y. Kitami Y. Yang Z.H. Nakamura M. Okura T. Hiwada K. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that PPARγ ligands suppress the expression and transcription of C/EBPδ protein through dephosphorylation of STAT3 in the vascular wall. It may be speculated that the reduced gp130 activity and thus reduced STAT3 activation in wild-type mice treated with fenofibrate may contribute to a down-regulation of C/EBPs in liver. In humans, we found that fenofibrate treatment reduced the plasma concentrations of the positive APR proteins fibrinogen and CRP, an effect that has also been observed for other PPARα-activators, i.e. bezafibrate (18Jonkers I.J. Mohrschladt M.F. Westendorp R.G. van der Laarse A. Smelt A.H. Am. J. Med. 2002; 112: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and ciprofibrate (38Rizos E. Kostoula A. Elisaf M. Mikhailidis D.P. Angiology. 2002; 53: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with fenofibrate has a much broader effect on plasma levels of APR proteins in humans and causes down-regulation of SAA, α2-macroglobulin, and plasminogen. We show for the first time that the plasma concentration of a negative APR protein, albumin, is increased in humans. This is in accordance with the transcriptional changes of the respective murine genes in fenofibrate-treated mice and suggests a comparable suppressive effect of PPARα on acute phase gene transcription in mice and humans. In conclusion, PPARα activation thus impairs the IL-6 signaling pathway in the liver at two levels, the level of membrane receptors and the level of transcription factors, together resulting in a potent suppression of the IL-6-stimulated APR gene expression. PPARα could be considered as a factor playing a determinant role in the control of hepatic inflammation at the molecular level and thus forms an attractive target to dampen deleterious effects of inflammation in liver."

Our data suggest that a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) binding motif at the N terminus of PTEN serves the dual role of localizing the enzyme to the membrane and regulating its activity. Mutations in this motif enhance catalytic activity but render the enzyme inactive in vivo by preventing membrane association. The key role of this motif may explain the heretofore puzzling tumor-suppressing mutations occurring within the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif. On the other hand, the localization of PTEN does not depend on its phosphatase activity, the actin cytoskeleton, or the intracellular level of PI(3,4,5)P3, suggesting that events controlling localization are upstream of phosphoinositide signaling.

Cells sense external chemical gradients and respond by moving toward the higher concentration of chemoattractant. Chemotaxis is important for a wide variety of physiological and pathological events such as axon guidance, immune response, wound healing, tissue morphogenesis, and carcinoma invasion. The molecular mechanisms of chemotaxis are highly conserved among eukaryotes including mammalian neutrophils and Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae.Chemotaxis plays an essential role in the developmental program of this social amoeba. Appropriately differentiated cells migrate toward aggregation centers in response to the chemoattractant, cAMP, and form multicellular structures. Several components involved in chemotaxis have been identified through genetic and biochemical studies. For example, cAR1, a seven-transmembrane cAMP receptor, binds cAMP and activates a heterotrimeric G-protein (1Klein P. Knox B. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 352-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Klein P. Theibert A. Devreotes P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The activation of the G-protein eventually leads to polymerization of F-actin toward higher concentrations of cAMP and drives extension of pseudopods at the leading edge of cells. Thus, intracellular signaling events involved chemotaxis are activated locally at the leading edge. However, neither the receptors nor the receptor-coupled G-proteins are concentrated in this region but are found uniformly distributed along the plasma membrane (3Xiao Z. Zhang N. Murphy D.B.

The PH domain of Crac binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2). Similar to Crac, in mammalian neutrophils and fibroblasts, several PH domain-containing proteins, such as PKB/AKT, are found to preferentially associate with the plasma membrane at the leading edge (4Servant G.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that these phosphoinositol lipids locally activate the signaling events that lead to actin polymerization at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. Consistent with this idea, the addition of a membrane-permeable form of PI(3,4,5)P3 to fibroblasts and neutrophils triggers the formation of membrane ruffles and increases their motility (8Derman M.P.

Recently, both PI3K and PTEN have been shown to be required for PI(3,4,5)P3 production and chemotaxis toward cAMP (11Funamoto S. Meili R. Lee S. Parry L. Firtel R.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 12Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In wild type Dictyostelium cells, the level of PI(3,4,5)P3 transiently increases within 5 s upon cAMP stimulation and returns to basal levels within 60 s. However, in mutants lacking two of three PI3K genes, the production of PI(3,4,5)P3 induced by cAMP is dramatically impaired, and the mutant cells are defective in chemotaxis and development (13Huang Y.E.

PTEN is a lipid and protein-tyrosine phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine as well as the D3 position of PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 (17Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). We have shown that a Dictyostelium homolog of PTEN is essential for efficient chemotaxis toward cAMP (12Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The chemotaxis defects are due to hyperactivation of the actin cytoskeleton. pten- cells extend numerous pseudopodia in every direction and fail to restrict extension of pseudopodia to the leading edge in a chemoattractant gradient. Furthermore, in pten- cells, the PH domain, a sensor of local PI(3,4,5)P3 levels, is strongly associated with the plasma membrane, and this localization is not restricted to the leading edge in a cAMP gradient. These observations indicate that the degradation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and/or PI(3,4)P2 is severely impaired in pten- cells. Supporting this idea, analysis of total cellular lipids directly demonstrated that excess PI(3,4,5)P3 accumulates upon cAMP stimulation in pten- cells (13Huang Y.E. Iijima M. Parent C.A. Funamoto S. Firtel R.A. Devreotes P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1913-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Luo H.R. Huang Y.E. Chen J.C. Saiardi A. Iijima M. Ye K. Huang Y. Nagata E. Devreotes P.

In resting cells a fraction of PTEN is uniformly associated with the plasma membrane. Upon uniform chemoattractant stimulation, PTEN transiently dissociates from the membrane and diffuses into the cytosol. When cells are exposed to a gradient of cAMP, PTEN accumulates at the rear of the chemotaxing cells. This distribution is opposite to that of PI3K, which localizes to the front of cells. The reciprocal localization of PI3K and PTEN have been proposed to spatially regulate the production of phosphoinositol lipids with synthesis occurring at the leading edge and degradation at the rear (11Funamoto S. Meili R. Lee S. Parry L. Firtel R.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 12Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar).Previously, we have shown that the membrane association of Dictyostelium PTEN requires its N-terminal PI(4,5)P2 binding domain (12Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In this paper, we extend this observation and show that even though only a very small fraction of the protein is bound to the plasma membrane, its function depends on this localization. Versions of PTEN with mutations in the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif have enhanced catalytic activity but are defective in membrane binding and fail to complement the phenotypes seen in pten- cells. Furthermore, PTEN localization is regulated independently of PI(3,4,5)P3-mediated signaling mechanisms and the actin cytoskeleton.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Growth and Development—The D. discoideum wild type strain AX2 and pten- cells were axenically cultured in HL5 medium at 22 °C. Transformants carrying protein expression constructs were grown in HL5 containing 20 μg/ml G418. To assess developmental phenotypes, exponentially growing cells were washed twice in development buffer (DB; 5 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.5), 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2) and plated on 1.5% non-nutrient DB agar at 1 × 106 cells/cm2.Plasmid Construction and Transformation of Cells—pPTEN-GFP, a plasmid expressing Dictyostelium full-length PTEN fused to GFP at the C terminus from the actin 15 promoter, was described previously (12Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). To construct plasmids expressing truncated versions of PTEN fused to GFP from the actin 15 promoter, different regions of PTEN were PCR-amplified from its cDNA using the following primers, digested with XhoI and BglII, and subcloned into XhoI/BglII sites in pMIG containing the actin 15 promoter and GFP. PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For PTEN0-445, primers P111 (5′-GGAGATCTGGAAACAAATAGAATGAG-3′) and P1462 (5′-CCCTCGAGGTAATATTATCGTGATGAGAG-3′) were used. For PTEN16-515, primers P172 (5′-GGAGATCTTATCAAAAAAATGGTTACGAT-3′) and P1664 (5′-CCCTCGAGTCTGCTTCAACCTTTGGAGC-3′) were used. For PTEN186-515, primers P682 (5′-GGAGATCTATCAAATATGTACCACGTAAT-3′) and P1664 were used. Point mutations in the phosphatase catalytic site and in the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif were created using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene).DNA encoding 600 amino acids from the N terminus of PI3K2 was PCR-amplified from the Dictyostelium genome using primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGAAAATGAGTGAAGGAATT-3′ and 5′-AGACGTCGACGCCATAGTTTGTCTCCAAAT-3′. PCR products were sequenced, digested with SalI and BamHI, and cloned into XhoI/BglII sites in pMIG.Exponentially growing cells were transformed with expression vectors (10 μg of DNA) by electroporation and selected on plates for 7-10 days in HL5 containing 10 μg/ml G418. When foci were visible, cells were harvested and observed for expression by fluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting.Chemotaxis Assay—Cells grown in HL5 were washed twice with DB and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were incubated for 1 h and then differentiated with 100 nm cAMP pulses at 6-min intervals for 4 h (41Devreotes P. Fontana D. Klein P. Sherring J. Theibert A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 299-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Differentiated cells were plated on a chambered coverglass (Lab-Tek, Nalge Nunc) and allowed to adhere to the surface. A micropipette filled with 1 μm cAMP was positioned near the cells, and images of moving cells were recorded using an inverted Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 135 TV).Radiolabeling and Detection of Phosphoinositol Lipid in Intact Cells—Cells were developed in phosphate-free MES-DB (20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2) for 5 h and labeled with 0.5 mCi of 32P radionucleotide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h. Labeled cells were treated with 20 mm caffeine for 20 min and washed twice with MES-DB. Cells were resuspended at 8 × 107 cells/ml in MES-DB and stimulated with 1 μm cAMP. 150-μl samples were collected into 1 ml of cold 1 n HCl to stop the reaction. Lipids were extracted as described previously (13Huang Y.E. Iijima M. Parent C.A. Funamoto S. Firtel R.A. Devreotes P. Mol. Biol.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml antipain, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysate was incubated with protein A beads coupled to anti-GFP antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer, twice in Tris buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl), and twice in reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm DTT). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting and silver staining.Phosphatase Assays—The phosphatase activity of PTEN against phosphoinositol lipids was measured in 50 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm DTT) containing water-soluble d(+)-sn-1,2-di-O-octanoylglyceryl, 3-O-phospho-linked-phosphatidylinositol phosphate (Echelon) and 1 μg of immunoprecipitated proteins. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C with gentle shaking. Amounts of phosphate released from substrates were determined by a malachite green assay using a PhosFree Phosphate Assay Biochem Kit (Cytoskeleton).The phosphatase activity against inositol phosphate was measured in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing 1 nm3H-labeled Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 50 μm Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (Echelon), and 1 μgof immunoprecipitated proteins for 2 h at room template. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 400 μl of stop solution (2 m perchloric acid, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml IP6 (d-myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis-phosphate)) and then neutralized with 400 μl of neutralization buffer (1 m K2CO3, 5 mm EDTA). Inositol phosphates were separated by HPLC using anion exchange chromatography (partisphere SAX column, 12.5 cm × 4.6 mm) (Whatman). HPLC was run at a speed of 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0-1.3 m (NH4)2PO4 (pH 3.8). Fractions were collected, and the radioactivity in each fraction was counted. Inositol phosphates were identified by their co-elution with radiolabeled standards of inositol phosphate.RESULTSPTEN Dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 in Vitro—To determine the lipid phosphatase activity of Dictyostelium PTEN, we expressed PTEN fused to GFP in pten- cells and purified the protein by immunoprecipitation with protein A beads coupled to anti-GFP antibody. Immunopurified PTEN and a GFP control were incubated with PI(3,4,5)P3 or PI(3,4)P2 for 30 min. After incubation, released phosphate was measured using a malachite green assay (19Lee J.O. Yang H.

PTEN released phosphate from both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 at a rate of 144.5 nmol/mg/min for PI(3,4,5)P3 and 44.1 nmol/mg/min for PI(3,4)P2 (Fig. 1B). These phosphatase activities of Dictyostelium PTEN are comparable with those of human PTEN, which exhibited phosphatase activity of 150.1 nmol/mg/min for PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, GFP showed no phosphatase activity.Human and Dictyostelium PTEN sequences are co-linear with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains in their N-terminal regions (Fig. 1A). We deleted N-terminal 185 amino acid residues, which removes PTP domains. This mutant, PTEN186-515, did not show phosphatase activity toward PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 (Fig. 1B). In the middle of the PTP domain of mammalian PTEN, there are seven amino acids forming a catalytic site that binds directly to substrate. Dictyostelium PTEN contains the putative catalytic domain identical to mammalian PTEN. To confirm that this catalytic site is required for the lipid phosphatase activity of Dictyostelium PTEN, we introduced three point mutations in this region (C124S, K128M, G129E). Mutations in human PTEN equivalent to C124S and G129E have been shown to completely inhibit their lipid phosphatase activity against both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 (18Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Van der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar), whereas the K128M mutation reduced the activity only against PI(3,4,5)P3 but not PI(3,4)P2 (19Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M.

We found that PTENC124S and PTENG129E were defective in phosphatase activity against both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2. In contrast, PTENK128M was partially defective in phosphatase activity against only PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1B). The results demonstrated that the catalytic site in the PTP domain of human and Dictyostelium PTENs are orthologous.Like human PTEN, Dictyostelium PTEN contains a putative PI(4,5)P2 binding motif at its N-terminal end (Fig. 1A). We previously have shown that this sequence is essential for PTEN to associate with the plasma membrane. To determine whether the PI(4,5)P2 binding domain is important for the phosphatase activity of PTEN, we truncated 15 amino acid residues from the N terminus (PTEN16-515) and examined the phosphatase activity toward PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2. PTEN16-515 failed to dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 (Fig. 1B). We also determined whether this PI(4,5)P2 binding motif is important for phosphatase activity of human PTEN. The human PTENΔ16 lacking the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif had no phosphatase activity against PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif is essential for PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2-directed phosphatase activity of both Dictyostelium and human PTEN.PTEN16-515 Preferentially Dephosphorylates Ins(1,3,4,5)P4—The observations that PTEN16-515 is unable to dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 suggest that the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif regulates the specificity of the phosphatase activity of PTEN. We reasoned that the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif is important for interaction with phosphatidylinositol lipids such as PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2. If this is correct, PTEN16-515 should dephosphorylate water-soluble substrates such as inositol phosphates. To verify our hypothesis, we examined the phosphatase activity of wild type PTEN and PTEN16-515 toward inositol phosphate, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (Fig. 2). Immunopurified wild type PTEN and PTEN16-515 were incubated with [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. After incubation, inositol phosphates were separated using HPLC chromatography. We found that wild type PTEN, PTEN16-515, and the GFP control converted 2.2, 34.6, and 0% of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2). Thus, the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif is not required for phosphatase activity against the soluble inositol phosphate head group of PI(3,4,5)P3. The significantly enhanced activity of PTEN16-515 toward Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 indicates that the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif actually inhibits catalytic activity. Taken together with the reduced activity toward PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2, this result suggests that the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif serves the dual role of associating the enzyme with a lipid substrate and regulating catalysis.Fig. 2Inositol phosphate phosphatase activity of PTENs. Wild type and mutant forms of PTEN-GFP were immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibody. The phosphatase activity against inositol phosphate was measured in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 1 μg of immunoprecipitated protein, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 10 mm DTT, 50 μm Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and 1 nm [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 for 2 h at room temperature. Inositol phosphates were extracted and resolved by HPLC using a Partisphere SAX column (Whatman). GFP was used as a control. Four independent experiments were performed; representative elution patterns are shown for wild type PTEN (A), PTEN16-515 mutant (B), and GFP control (C). Radioactivity in each fraction is shown. The identity of each peak was determined by using standards of [3H]Ins(1,4)P2,[3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, and [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. D, total amounts of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3. Total radioactivity of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 from each reaction was obtained by subtracting background radioactivity. Values represent the mean ± S.D. from four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PI(3,4,5)P3 Accumulates upon cAMP Stimulation in PTEN Mutants—To investigate the function of the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN in vivo, we expressed mutant versions of PTEN in pten- cells and examined the production of PI(3,4,5)P3 induced by chemoattractants (Fig. 3). Developed cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. After cAMP stimulation, total cellular lipids were extracted and resolved by TLC. In pten- cells expressing wild type PTEN, the level of PI(3,4,5)P3 transiently increased ∼3-fold at 10 s after cAMP stimulation, started to decline within 30 s, and returned to basal level in 60 s. In contrast, in the pten- cells expressing GFP, PI(3,4,5)P3 level increased more than 5-fold and remained elevated even at 60 s after cAMP stimulation (12Iijima M. Devreotes P.

The pten- cells expressing wild type and mutant forms of PTEN-GFP were starved for 5 h in MES-DB to induce development and then labeled with 32P for 1 h. These cells were stimulated with 1 μm cAMP. Total cellular lipids were extracted at the indicated time points. Lipids were separated on TLC plates, and the intensity of bands corresponding to PI(3,4,5)P3 was quantified using a phosphorimaging device. The levels of PI(3,4,5)P3 were normalized relative to that seen in pten- cells expressing wild type PTEN at time 0 min. Values represent the mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The pten- cells expressing PTEN16-515 and PTEN186-515 showed a pattern of PI(3,4,5)P3 production similar to that observed in pten- cells expressing GFP. Cells expressing PTENC124S, PTENK128M, and PTENG129E showed a partial restoration of PI(3,4,5)P3 to wild type level. Stimulation with cAMP induced a 4-5-fold increase of PI(3,4,5)P3 at peak, and then the lipids were reduced more rapidly. To quantify these data, we defined the “degradation index” by calculating the percentage of PI(3,4,5)P3 remaining at 60 s relative to the amount of PI(3,4,5)P3 at 10 s. For example, the degradation indices in pten- cells expressing wild type PTEN, GFP, PTEN16-515, and PTEN186-515 were -9.4, 86.4, 82.9, and 91.2%, respectively. In pten- cells expressing PTENC124S, PTENK128M, and PTENG129E, degradation indices were 55.1, 26.8, and 61.9%, respectively. These profiles of lipids production and degradation strongly suggest that PTEN is controlling lipid metabolism in vivo.Mutations in the Catalytic Domain of PTEN Block Normal Development and Chemotaxis—We previously have shown that pten- cells have strong defects in development and chemotaxis (12Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). These developmental phenotypes are not simply because of defects in expression of early developmental genes such as the cAMP receptor and adenylyl cyclase (12Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). During the developmental stage, Dictyostelium amoeba chemotax toward higher concentrations of extracellular cAMP and aggregate to become multicellular organisms. Within 24 h they develop into a terminal structure called fruiting bodies consisting of spore and stalk cells (Fig. 4A). The expression of wild type PTEN completely reversed the developmental defects in the pten- cells. Interestingly, expression of PTEN16-515, which lacks the PI(4,5)P2 binding motif, did not alter the phenotype of the pten- cells. Cells expressing PTEN16-515 remained as a smooth monolayer identical to control cells expressing GFP. The expression of PTEN186-515 also did not rescue pten- cells. pten- cells expressing PTEN mutants with point mutations in the catalytic domain, PTENC124S and PTENG129E, showed severe defects in development. Whereas wild type cells and pten- cells expressing PTEN aggregated within 6 h on the non-nutrient agar, the cells expressing PTENC124S and PTENG129E did not form a typical aggregation pattern.

https://openalex.org/W2084112246,Theory on the evolution of virulence generally predicts selection for an optimal level of virulence determined by trade-offs with transmission and/or recovery. Here we consider the evolution of pathogen virulence in hosts who acquire long-lived immunity and live in a spatially structured population. We show theoretically that large shifts in virulence may occur in pathogen populations as a result of a bistability in evolutionary dynamics caused by the local contact or social population structure of the host. This model provides an explanation for the rapid emergence of the highly virulent strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus.

Laccases (benzenediol oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.2) belong to the multi-copper oxidase family of enzymes that includes ascorbate oxidase (l-ascorbate oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.3) and ceruloplasmin (Fe(II) oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.16.3.1); for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Messerschmidt A.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2001: 763-811Google Scholar). X-ray structural studies over the past decade have enabled the elucidation of a significant number of structural and functional aspects of these enzymes, but many key questions still remain. Two of these involve the mechanism of electron transfer from substrates and the mechanism of dioxygen reduction (2Lindley P.F. Bertini I. Sigel A. Sigel H. Handbook on Metalloproteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2001: 763-811Google Scholar, 3Cole A.P. Root D.E. Mukherjee P. Solomon E.I. Stack T.D. Science. 1996; 273: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Laccases are the simplest representatives of the family and are therefore used as model systems for investigating structure-function relationships in the multi-copper oxidases. Such fundamental studies are aimed at clarifying the molecular basis for the enzyme redox potential and the specificity toward different substrates.Most of the known laccases have fungal (e.g. white-rot fungi) or plant origins, although a few laccases have recently been identified and isolated in bacteria (4Gianfreda L. Xu F. Bollag J.-M. Bioremediation J. 1999; 3: 1-25Crossref Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 5Martins L.M. Soares C.M. Pereira M.M. Teixeira M. Costa T. Jones G.H. Henriques A.O. J. Biol.

These enzymes have been implicated in many diverse physiological functions such as morphogenesis, pathogenesis, lignin synthesis, and lignolysis (4Gianfreda L. Xu F. Bollag J.-M. Bioremediation J. 1999; 3: 1-25Crossref Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 7Mayer A.M. Staples R.C. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Chemically, all these functions are related to the oxidation of a range of aromatic substrates such as polyphenols, methoxy-substituted phenols, diamines, and even some inorganic compounds. The one-electron oxidation of these reducing substrates occurs concomitantly with a four-electron reduction of molecular dioxygen to water. The catalytic centers consist of three structurally and functionally distinct copper centers. T1 copper (“blue copper”) is a mononuclear center involved in substrate oxidation, whereas T2 and T3 form a trinuclear center involved in dioxygen reduction to water; for a definition of the copper types, see Ref. 8Malmström B.G. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 21-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar. The initial substrate reaction products are dioxygen-centered radicals or cation radicals, which usually react further through non-enzymatic routes for the oxidative coupling of monomers or the degradation of polymers.Because of their high relative nonspecific oxidation capacity, laccases have been found to be useful biocatalysts for diverse biotechnological applications (9Xu F. Flickinger M.-C. Drew S.W. The Encyclopedia of Bioprocess Technology: Fermentation, Biocatalysis, and Bioseparation. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 1545-1554Google Scholar). Their biotechnological importance showed a marked increased after the discovery that the oxidizing reaction substrate range could be further extended in the presence of the so-called mediators, small readily oxidizable molecules (10Bourbonnais R. Paice M.G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), by a mechanism that remains, as yet, quite unclear. The most extensively investigated laccase mediator is 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), 1The abbreviations used are: ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate; Wat, water molecule.1The abbreviations used are: ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate; Wat, water molecule. which allows the oxidation of non-phenolic lignin model compounds and pulp delignification by laccase (10Bourbonnais R.

Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several other effective redox mediators have also been reported extensively, and the applications of laccase/mediator systems that target lignocellulosics and other insoluble materials have been described (12Xu F.

The CotA enzyme is thermoactive and thermostable and, thus, an interesting enzyme for industrial applications.X-ray studies of crystals of the enzyme CotA laccase from B. subtilis soaked with the mediator molecule ABTS are described herein. The nature of the binding of ABTS to CotA is described, and the role of ABTS as an oxidative mediator in conjunction with laccases is discussed. In addition, a dioxygen molecule has also been identified in a water channel leading toward the trinuclear copper center, but not bound to it. The implications of this observation with regard to dioxygen reduction at the trinuclear center are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Crystallization and Substrate Reaction—Recombinant CotA protein was crystallized as described previously (18Enguita F.J. Matias P.M. Martins L.O. Plácido D. Henriques A.O. Carrondo M.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2002; 58: 1490-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown over a period of 3 to 5 days and then soaked in a crystallization solution containing 0.5 mm of ABTS. These soaking experiments have shown modifications in the color of the resulting mixture that evolved with time, and this was interpreted as an indication of a reaction between ABTS and the enzyme. This enzymatic reaction inside the CotA crystals was followed by observation under a light microscope. The color changed from light blue to dark magenta in a time range of 20 h. No significant changes in crystal color were observed after 20 h of reaction.Data collection, Model Building, and Refinement—Crystals reacting with the substrates were harvested from the mother liquor at different incubation times, cryo-protected, and frozen for x-ray data collection as described previously (18Enguita F.J.

One clear solution was evident, giving R-factor and correlation coefficients of 29.9% and 0.801, respectively. An electron density synthesis enabled the location of the four copper atoms in the molecule and showed clear density for the substrate. Refinement was performed using the maximum likelihood functions implemented in REFMAC5 (23Murshudov G.N. Lebedev A. Vagin A.A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Rounds of conjugate gradient and sparse matrix refinement with bulk solvent modeling according to the Babinet principle (24Tronrud D. Dodson E. Moore M. Ralph A. Bailey S.

After the first round of refinement, solvent molecules were added to the model based on standard geometrical and chemical restraints; two molecules of glycol were also located. The occupancies of the copper atoms in the trinuclear cluster were adjusted so that their isotropic thermal parameters were refined to ∼50.0 Å2; the assignment of full occupancies led to thermal coefficients significantly higher than the local average. The ABTS molecule in the substrate binding pocket was modeled with alternate conformations for the solvent-exposed region. Details of the refinement are shown in Table I.The atomic coordinates of the CotA-ABTS adduct model and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank and assigned the accession code 1UVW. All figures were prepared using PyMol (27DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual.

Crystal structures have been determined after soaking periods of 1, 6, 8, and 20 h, and in all cases the overall structure appears to be essentially that of the native enzyme (17Enguita F.J. Martins L.M. Henriques A.O. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19416-19425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). After soaking periods of 6 h or longer, there is significant copper depletion at the trinuclear site and, in particular, of the T2 copper, Cu4. At the 20-h stage this copper appears to be completely depleted. In this paper, special features observed in the crystal structure of the 1-h soak will be described; the remaining structures will be described elsewhere. The crystal structure of the 1-h soak shows only a relatively low depletion of copper, so that Cu4 appears to be most depleted by ∼35%, whereas one of the T3 copper atoms, Cu3, is depleted by only 20%.The Dioxygen Binding Site—In all of the multi-copper oxidases studied to date, there are water channels that link the trinuclear copper center with the external environment. Dioxygen approaches the trinuclear copper center through these channels, but the precise nature of its subsequent interaction with the center is the subject of debate. Hakulinen et al. (16Hakulinen N. Kiiskinen L.-L. Kruus K. Saloheimo M. Paananen A. Koivula A. Rouvinen J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 601-605PubMed Google Scholar) report the presence of a dioxygen moiety amid the three copper atoms of the trinuclear cluster in the crystal structure of the laccase from M. albomyces. In this structure, the distance between the O1 atom of the dioxygen moiety and the T2 copper atom is 2.5 Å, and all the distances between the O1 and O2 atoms of the dioxygen moiety and the T3 copper atoms lie in the range 2.4-2.6 Å. There is no bridging hydroxyl group as observed in the fully oxidized structure of ascorbate oxidase (28Messerschmidt A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Avigliano L. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and the two T3 copper atoms are separated by 4.8 Å. This value is far closer to the value of 5.1 Å observed in the dithionite-reduced structure of ascorbate oxidize (29Messerschmidt A. Luecke H. Huber R. J. Mol.

Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19416-19425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), CotA has a clearly defined channel directed toward the trinuclear copper cluster. Aspartate and glutamate residues act as channel markers as the channel penetrates the protein structure (Fig. 2); Asp-501 lies at the surface, followed by Asp-499 and Glu-498 as the channel progresses toward the trinuclear center. In the CotA structure reported herein, three water molecules occupy the first section of this channel (Fig. 2). Wat235 is hydrogen bonded to Asp-501 near the surface (OD1... Ow = 3.20 Å) and to the carboxyl group of Glu-498 (O... Ow = 2.65 Å) and is also in close proximity to Wat234 with an Ow... Ow separation of 3.42 Å. Wat234 is, in turn, hydrogen bonded to Asp-499 (OD1... Ow = 2.86), the amino group of Ala-158 (N... Ow = 2.83 Å), and Wat233 (Ow... Ow = 2.70 Å). Wat233 forms hydrogen bonds with Glu-498 (OE2... Ow = 2.84 Å), Ser-160 (OG1... Ow = 2.99 Å), and His-155 (ND1... Ow = 3.31 Å), one of the ligands to Cu3. The channel then proceeds downwards to the site of the dioxygen molecule, which is ∼5.15 Å from Wat233 and directly above a T3 copper atom, Cu2 (Fig. 3). One atom of the dioxygen molecule, O1, appears to be held by Glu-498 in a bifurcated manner (OE1... O1 = 2.70 Å; OE2... O1 = 2.92 Å), whereas the second oxygen atom, O2, is 3.25 and 3.30 Å from the T3 copper atoms Cu2 and Cu3, respectively, and therefore not directly bound to them. It is probable that this dioxygen molecule has been trapped in a holding position prior to binding to one or more of the copper atoms in the trinuclear center. Under the soaking conditions used, the enzyme has probably been placed in a dormant state awaiting further substrate oxidation activity. The reception of further electrons will then cause the dioxygen to bind to its active site at the trinuclear copper center. In an omit electron density synthesis whereby the copper atoms and their ligands and all the channel moieties are omitted from the phase calculations, there is continuous electron density at the 7 root mean square level between the dioxygen molecule and Cu2, but not between it and Cu3. The implication is that the dioxygen molecule will most probably bind to Cu2 in a manner almost identical to the binding of azide and peroxide to the T3 copper, Cu3 (equivalent to Cu2 in CotA), in the ascorbate oxidase structure and that this is the first stage of binding of dioxygen to the trinuclear center.Fig. 2Water channel. A stereo view of a fragment of the water channel by which the dioxygen molecule approaches the trinuclear copper center is shown, together with the side chain residues of Glu-498, Asp-499, and Asp-501 involved in hydrogen bonds with the solvent molecules in the channel.

The Glu-498 side chain, which binds to one of the oxygen atoms of the refined dioxygen molecule, is also represented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Copper Sites—The T2-T3 copper distances, 4.07 Å for Cu2-Cu4 and 3.83 Å for Cu3-Cu4 in the CotA adduct, are significantly less than those recorded in the native enzyme, 4.64 Å and 4.67 Å, respectively, and lie intermediate between the oxidized and reduced forms of ascorbate oxidase. The copper ligand distances for the T1, T2, and T3 copper types are comparable with those observed in the native CotA structure, except in the case of the His-155 ligand to Cu3, which moves in such a way as to accommodate the dioxygen molecule (see Fig. 3) from a standard distance of 2.05 Å in native CotA to 2.48 Å in the adduct structure. The trinuclear center in the CotA adduct structure loses the bridging hydroxide moiety, and the distance between the two T3 copper atoms shows a small increase from 4.28 Å in the native structure (17Enguita F.J. Martins L.M. Henriques A.O. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19416-19425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) to 4.56 Å in the adduct structure (Fig. 3).The Adduct Binding Site—The crystal structure of the 1-h soak of the CotA laccase with ABTS clearly shows that the ABTS binds in a large pocket mainly formed by apolar residues (Fig. 4) and previously identified in the structure of the native protein (17Enguita F.J. Martins L.M. Henriques A.O. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19416-19425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The ABTS can be readily built into the electron density as a shallow U-shaped molecule with the bottom of the U in close proximity to His-497. This contrasts with the almost linear structure of ABTS found in the crystalline form (30Mousty C. Therias S. Aboab B. Molinie P. Queignec M. Leone P. Rossignol C. Palvadeau P. New J. Chem. 1997; 21: 1321-1330Google Scholar) and is consistent with the ABTS being bound in a radical and/or cationic state. At a resolution of 2.4 Å it is difficult to precisely define the details of the adduct binding, but a plausible model involves one in which one-half of the adduct is partially buried in the CotA structure and the other half is relatively exposed to the external environment. In the partially buried half, the sulfonate moiety approaches the disulfide bridge between cysteines Cys-229 and Cys-322, (Cys-322 SG - O14 = 3.22 Å), and one of the oxygen sulfonate atoms forms a hydrogen bond with the Gly-323 (O13 - Gly-323 n = 3.06 Å). With respect to the exposed half, there appears to be some evidence of disorder, and two conformations have been modeled. In one conformation, the thiazoline ring is trans to the other half of the molecule as reported in the crystal structure (30Mousty C. Therias S. Aboab B. Molinie P. Queignec M. Leone P. Rossignol C. Palvadeau P. New J. Chem. 1997; 21: 1321-1330Google Scholar), and in the other a rotation about the central N-N bond of the bis-azino moiety places it in a cis conformation. In either case, the sulfonate group is ∼5-6 Å distant from Arg-416. In this model, the thiazoline ring of the partially buried half of the ABTS molecule is roughly perpendicular to the aromatic ring of His-497, one of the T1 copper ligands, with a closest approach between C2 and the NE2 atom of His-497 of 3.32 Å. This geometry would favor the transfer of an electron from the adduct to the T1 copper center through His-497; subsequently the electron would be transferred to the trinuclear cluster through Cys-492, the copper ligand that confers the blue color to CotA.Fig. 4ABTS mediator in the binding site. A stereo view of the region of the CotA molecule close to the mononuclear copper center shows the position of the ABTS molecule. The electron density in an omit map contoured at the 4 σ level in the region around the substrate is also represented. Residues in close proximity to the substrate are represented as blue stick models. The half of the substrate exposed to the solvent, close to Arg-416, has been modeled with two alternative configurations as described in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThere are two key features observed in the present structure: (i) the presence of an dioxygen molecule in the solvent channel pointing toward the T3 copper atom with the highest occupancy, Cu2; and (ii) the adduct itself bound at the site of substrate oxidation. These structural differences, when compared with the enzyme native structure, reflect the enzymatic activity of CotA in the crystal toward ABTS (5Martins L.M. Soares C.M. Pereira M.M. Teixeira M. Costa T. Jones G.H. Henriques A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18849-18859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Neither of these features has been observed in previous structural studies on the multi-copper oxidases or in the other crystals of CotA with longer ABTS soaking periods.In the crystal structure of the M. albomyces enzyme, the C terminus residues block access to the channel through which it is believed the dioxygen molecule approaches the trinuclear site. This may account for the stability of the dioxygen adduct, but it also raises the question of whether this structure represents the active state of the enzyme. The authors have even suggested that a conformational change has to occur to allow the entry of the dioxygen molecule. They also noted that the absorption spectra of the enzyme in the range 300-700 nm are similar to those obtained from the laccase from Rhus vernicifera (31Huang H.-W. Zoppellaro G. Sakurai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32718-32724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Lee S.-K. George S.D. Antholine W.E. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 1997; 119: 12525-12540Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and state that this supports the structure of a dioxygen moiety bound to all three copper atoms in the trinuclear center. These studies contrast with those undertaken on ascorbate oxidase (29Messerschmidt A. Luecke H. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 997-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), whereby peroxide (an dioxygen substitute) and azide (an inhibitor) were found to bind only to one of the T3 copper atoms with a concomitant loss of the bridging hydroxide moiety and an increase in the separation of the two T3 copper atoms from 3.7 to 4.8 and 5.1 Å for peroxide and azide, respectively. In the case of azide, two azide moieties were found to bind to the same T3 copper atom in the trinuclear cluster in ascorbate oxidase. The addition of azide to ceruloplasmin produced only one binding position under the soaking conditions used, but, again, this involved only one T3 copper atom, equivalent to that used by ascorbate oxidase (34Zaitsev I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Thus, the precise nature of dioxygen binding to the trinuclear center in the multi-copper oxidases appears to remain undefined and, indeed, may be different for different members of this enzyme family. It is possible that, after the binding of the dioxygen molecule to one of the T3 copper atoms in CotA, a subsequent stage involves binding to the trinuclear center as observed in the laccase from M. albomyces.As yet, the precise nature of substrate binding to the multi-copper oxidases is not well defined, and many of the binding pockets appear to be broad and able to accommodate a number of different substrates. For ceruloplasmin it has been found that the major binding site for metal cations and biogenic amines is close to the T1 copper in domain 6, the closest T1 copper atom to the trinuclear center. On the other hand, aromatic diamines, including p-phenylenediamine, which is often used in assays for oxidase activity, bind in an entirely different place at the base of domain 4 (34Zaitsev I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These binding studies with ceruloplasmin were restricted to a resolution of 3 Å, or worse, and precise details of substrate binding are therefore not available. In the case of the laccases, only the arylamine complex of the laccase from T. versicolor has, to date, been reported (14Bertrand T. Jolivalt C. Briozzo P. Caminade E. Joly N. Madzak C. Mougin C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7325-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The arylamine, 2,5-xylidine, is used as a laccase inducer in the fungus culture. The binding of ABTS in CotA differs from that of 2,5-xylidine, presumably because of its quite different overall size and shape. In the most abundant isozyme present in the crystal structure of the laccase from T. versicolor, the aromatic ring system of the 2,5-xylidine is again almost perpendicular to His-458 (equivalent to His-497 in CotA). However, it is also almost perpendicular to the thiazoline ring of the ABTS and is pointing in the opposite direction. The amino group of the 2,5-xylidine is 2.61 Å from the NE2 atom of His-458 and 3.20 Å from the OD2 atom of Asp-206 (equivalent to Thr-260 in CotA). It should also be noted in the laccase from T. versicolor that Phe-463 replaces the weak ligand Met-502 in CotA.Bourbonnais and Pace (10Bourbonnais R. Paice M.G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar) have shown that the laccase substrate range can be extended to include non-phenolic lignin subunits in the presence of a non-catalytic mediator such as ABTS. The involvement of a laccase-generated ABTS radical cation was suggested, although this radical cation in the absence of laccase was ineffective for non-phenolic oxidations (10Bourbonnais R. Paice M.G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). The ABTS has two oxidation states, namely the cation radical, ABTS.+, and the dication, ABTS2+, and these t"

To define the signaling pathways activated by smoke and to identify molecules responsible for emphysema-associated MMP-1 expression, we performed several in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Interestingly, in the human studies, MMP-1 was detected in pneumocytes from patients with emphysema and not from smokers without disease (9Imai K. Dalal S. Chen E. Downey R. Schulman L. Ginsburg M.

Together, the above studies suggest that MMP-1 is active in the airways and lung tissue of persons with emphysema and that continued MMP-1 expression contributes to tissue breakdown. The current study was performed to elucidate signaling pathways activated by cigarette smoke that mediate the MMP-1 expression associated with emphysema. Cell Culture and Human Lung Tissue—Human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) were cultured according to supplier instructions (Clonetics, San Diego, California). Human lung tissue was obtained at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (New York, NY) (Institutional Review Board protocol no. 9956). These samples were used in a previous study by our laboratory (9Imai K. Dalal S. Chen E. Downey R. Schulman L. Ginsburg M. D'Armiento J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Emphysematous lung tissues (n = 6) were from recipient lungs obtained at transplant or lung volume reduction procedures. Patients had stopped smoking for at least three months. Normal tissues (n = 7) were from accidental death victims or donor lungs harvested for transplant but not used because of recipient complications. All samples were examined for the presence of emphysema, fibrosis, and infection. All emphysema lungs were from persons with a history of smoking. Normal sample N1 was from an active smoker. Assays were performed by operators blinded to the disease status of the samples, which was revealed by the principle investigator only after the experimental data had been collected. Reagents—Unless specified, all reagents were from Calbiochem. Stock solutions of IL-1α and IL-1β were diluted in small airway growth medium to 10 ng/ml. Kinase inhibitors were diluted in small airway growth medium (0.1 μm calphostin C, 1 μm herbimycin A, 40 μm PD98059, 20 μm SB230580, and 20 μm UO126) and added to cells 1 h before treatment with interleukins and CSE. Preparation of Cigarette Smoke Extract—Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared using a modified protocol (18Laurent P. Janoff A. Kagan H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1983; 127: 189-192PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a Barnant vacuum pump operating at constant airflow was used to draw the smoke of one unfiltered 2R1 reference cigarette (University of Kentucky) through 25 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. This solution (100% CSE) was adjusted to pH 7.4, filtered, added to small airway growth medium to a final concentration of 2% or 5%, and added to cells immediately. Northern Blotting—Ten micrograms of total SAEC RNA were separated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences). Human MMP-1, MMP-13, TIMP-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-to-Go DNA Labeling Beads (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, membranes were hybridized with a 28S oligonucleotide probe labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to control for loading. Immunoblot Analyses—SAEC monolayers were scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl of protein lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), centrifuged, and 20 μg of supernatant were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against nonphosphorylated ERK and the Thr-202 and Tyr-204 phosphorylated form of ERK-1/2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). MMP-1 Protein and Activity Assays—MMP-1 expression was determined in SAEC culture media using the Biotrak Human MMP-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay System (Amersham Biosciences), which detects pro-MMP-1 and MMP-1 complexed with TIMP-1 in a range of 6.25–100 ng/ml. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were read in a TECAN Sunrise plate reader at 450 nm. Optical densities were normalized to total protein and converted to ng/ml using a standard curve of recombinant human MMP-1. For MMP-1 activity analyses, SAEC culture media was activated with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate and incubated overnight in the Biotrak MMP-1 Activity Assay System (Amersham Biosciences), which measures active MMP-1 in the range of 3.13–50 ng/ml with a sensitivity of 2.2 ng/ml. In addition, media was used in a Chemicon Interstitial Collagenase Activity Assay System, which measures MMP-1-mediated cleavage of fluorescently labeled collagen type I (19Brenneisen P. Wlaschek M.

Multiple comparisons were made using analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparison post tests using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All other statistics were performed using two-tailed Student's t test in Excel. p < 0.05 was considered significant. ERK Activity Assays—SAECs were lysed in mitogen activated protein kinase lysis buffer (10 mm Tris pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Human lung was homogenized in mitogen activated protein kinase assay lysis buffer using a Polytron tissue homogenizer, centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min, and ERK activity in supernatants was determined using the Biotrak p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase enzyme assay system (Amersham Biosciences). Specific p-ERK activity is expressed in picomoles of γ-32P transferred per minute from ATP to a specific p-ERK-1/2 substrate. Nonspecific kinase activity was measured in the absence of substrate. This assay measures a range of 0.9 to 27 pmol of Pi/min. All data are means 32 ± S.D. and are from at least three independent experiments. SDS-PAGE Gelatin Zymography—Equal amounts of protein from SAEC or A549 media (50 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin. The gels were treated for 1 h with 2.5% Triton X-100, followed by overnight incubation with activating buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 1% Triton X-100). Gels were stained with Coomassie blue and destained in 20% methanol and 7% acetic acid. The presence of MMPs was confirmed by incubating gels in activation buffer containing the MMP inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. Animal Experiments—To determine the in vivo effects of smoke exposure, 8-week-old C57BL/CBA mice were exposed to cigarette smoke in a specially designed smoking chamber (Teague Enterprises, Davis, CA). Mice were exposed daily to 6 h of mainstream (active) and side-stream (passive) smoke from 2R4F research cigarettes for 5 days/week for various times. Levels of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood did not exceed 10% (data not shown). Control mice were exposed to room air. Animals were provided food and water ad libitum. Mice were sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane. The right lung was homogenized in protein lysis buffer and 100 μg of protein was analyzed by immunoblotting. The left lung was pressure-perfused at 25 cm2 H2O with 10% buffered formalin for 20 min, dissected, and stored in formalin for 24 h before paraffin embedding. Experiments were approved by the Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee of Columbia University. Immunohistochemistry of Murine Lung—Four-micrometer sections of paraffin-embedded lungs from control and smoke-exposed mice were analyzed for ERK activity. Sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving slides for 12 min in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% H2O2, and sections were blocked for 1 h in 10% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 rabbit ERK and p-ERK, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce). Sections were then incubated for 30 min with Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate precipitation was performed (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, California). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Controls included lung sections incubated with normal goat serum instead of antibody, which demonstrated no reactivity (data not shown). Immunofluorescence Staining of Human Lung—Human lung tissues fixed in formalin were processed in a Leica TP1020 tissue processor and embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm sections were cut onto glass slides. After removal of paraffin by xylene, sections were rehydrated, and nonspecific protein binding was blocked with 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. A primary p-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling) was used at 1:800 overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclear chromatin was detected with Hoechst dye. Slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, coverslipped using FluorSave aqueous mounting media (Calbiochem), and viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope. Images of p-ERK staining were merged onto the Hoechst images using Adobe Photoshop. CSE Increases MMP-1 in Airway Epithelial Cells—Previous studies by our laboratory (9Imai K. Dalal S. Chen E. Downey R. Schulman L. Ginsburg M. D'Armiento J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and others (8Segura-Valdez L. Pardo A. Gaxiola M. Uhal B. Becerril C. Selman M. Chest. 2000; 117: 684-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) have demonstrated MMP-1 expression in lung epithelial cells of patients with emphysema. Therefore, human SAECs were treated with CSE to determine whether cigarette smoke can directly induce MMP-1 expression in these cells. SAECs were treated with IL-1α or IL-1β, because IL-1 has been shown to induce MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts and synovial cells (20Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Mecham R.P. Parks W.C. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 299-356Crossref Google Scholar). Northern analysis revealed that 24-h exposure to CSE alone induced a significant dose-dependent increase in MMP-1 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, treatment with 5% CSE in combination with either IL-1α or IL-1β resulted in MMP-1 expression greater than treatment with CSE alone, even though treatment with either interleukin alone had no effect. The MMP inhibitor TIMP-1 did not change with any treatment (Fig. 1A). Thus, CSE increases the MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio in SAECs. We next assessed MMP-1 protein in SAEC culture media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1B, solid bars). Before treatment, SAECs demonstrated MMP-1 protein expression (5.9 ± 1.6 ng/ml), which increased after 24-h CSE exposure (8.4 ± 1.9 ng/ml for 2% CSE, p > 0.05 and 15.6 ± 5.0 ng/ml for 5% CSE, p < 0.05). Treatment with the inflammatory cytokine IL-1α did not increase MMP-1 protein (11.1 ± 4.9 ng/ml, p > 0.05). CSE in combination with IL-1α induced MMP-1 expression (14.8 ± 5.5 ng/ml, p < 0.05). Treatment with IL-1β did not change MMP-1 expression (7.1 ± 3.3 ng/ml, p > 0.05). Exposure to IL-1β plus 5% CSE significantly induced MMP-1 protein levels (16.0 ± 7.6 ng/ml, p < 0.05). This induction, however, was not greater than that with CSE alone (p = 0.79). CSE Increases Collagenolytic but Not Gelatinolytic Activity of SAECs—The SAEC culture media was analyzed for MMP-1 (collagenase) activity (Fig. 1B, striped bars). SAECs demonstrated baseline collagenase activity (4.09 ± 0.73 milliunits/ml). Treatment with 2% CSE had no effect (4.49 ± 0.68 milliunits/ml, p > 0.05), but increased activity was observed with 5% CSE (8.21 ± 1.22 milliunits/ml, p < 0.05). IL-1α alone did not induce collagenase activity (3.83 ± 0.57 milliunits/ml, p < 0.05), but IL-1α with 5% CSE significantly amplified MMP-1 activity (19.51 ± 3.21 milliunits/ml, p < 0.01). Treatment with IL-1β alone did not increase collagenase activity (6.77 ± 1.12 milliunits/ml, p > 0.05), but IL-1β in combination with 5% CSE significantly increased collagenase activity (13.69 ± 2.73 milliunits/ml, p < 0.05). We next analyzed gelatinolytic activity in SAEC culture media using zymography (Fig. 1C). SAECs demonstrate baseline MMP-2 (72 kDa) and MMP-9 (92 kDa) activity, which did not increase after 24-h exposure to any treatments. No other gelatinolytic activities were seen in the gel. ERK Inhibitors Reduce MMP-1 Induction in SAECs—To define the intracellular signaling mechanisms mediating airway MMP-1 induction by cigarette smoke and interleukins, SAECs were pretreated with specific protein kinase inhibitors before exposure to CSE or IL-1α. We chose to inhibit ERK, c-src tyrosine kinase, and protein kinase C pathways because of their involvement in MMP expression (21Hellermann G. Nagy S. Kong X. Lockey R. Mohapatra S. Respir. Res. 2002; 3: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Kashyap R. Floreani A. Heires A. Sanderson S. Wyatt T. J. Investig. Med. 2002; 50: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Vincenti M. White L. Schroen D. U B. Brinckerhoff C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 391-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that 24-h treatment with 5% CSE alone increased MMP-1 mRNA in SAECs (Fig. 2A). SAECs pre-incubated for 1 h with 40 μm PD98059 (a selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1/2, the kinase upstream of ERK-1/2) showed reduced baseline MMP-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 5). In addition, PD98059 reduced CSE-mediated increases in MMP-1 (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 6) and IL-1α-mediated increases in MMP-1 (compare lanes 3 and 7). PD98059 also reduced MMP-1 induction by CSE and IL-1α in combination (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 8). The src inhibitor herbimycin A (1 μm) and protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C (0.1 μm) had no effect on MMP-1 induction CSE or IL-1α (Fig. 2A). The inhibitors had no effect on TIMP-1. These data show that c-src and protein kinase C are not involved in MMP-1 induction by cigarette smoke or IL-1α in human airway epithelial cells in vitro. It is note-worthy that these data support a specific role for ERK in the SAEC response to cigarette smoke. To rule out the possibility that the inhibition of MMP-1 was caused by nonspecific action of PD98059 at the high dose used (24Davies S. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), we performed dose response studies. In addition, we extended our studies to include SB203580, which selectively blocks the p38 pathway (Fig. 2B). Increasing doses of SB203580 did not inhibit MMP-1 induction by cigarette smoke. In contrast, low doses of PD98059 reduced the ability of CSE to induce MMP-1 mRNA (Fig. 2B, compare lane 2 with lanes 7-10). The effect of PD98059 was dose dependent. Herbimycin A and calphostin C did not prevent induction of MMP-1 by CSE. Next, MMP-1 protein levels were examined after inhibition of ERK with PD98059 (Fig. 2C). No significant reduction in baseline MMP-1 protein (Control, open bar) was observed in culture media from SAECs treated for 1 h with 40 μm PD98059 (Control, solid bar). Treatment for 24 h with 5% CSE induced MMP-1 protein levels (5% CSE open bar, 142.7% ± 3.3% of control, p < 0.01). This increase was completely blocked by PD98059 (5% CSE, solid bar; p < 0.05, PD98059 + 5% CSE significantly lower than 5% CSE alone). Because MMP-1 protein levels measured in the media from SAECs treated with PD98059 in combination 5% CSE were the same as that of untreated control, this result suggests that there is a requirement for ERK in MMP-1 induction by cigarette smoke. In addition, 1-h pretreatment of SAECs with a structurally distinct ERK inhibitor (UO126; 20 μm) completely blocked induction of MMP-1 activity by 5% CSE (Fig. 2D, 48.7 ± 3.1% of 5% CSE alone, p = 0.02). Hydrogen Peroxide Activates MMP-1 in SAECs—Northern blot analysis revealed that 24-h treatment with 200 μm H2O2 increased MMP-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A). This induction did not occur through p38 or ERK cascades because pretreatment with 20 μm SB203580 or 40 μm PD98059 did not prevent MMP-1 induction. H2O2 did not increase MMP-13, another interstitial collagenase (Fig. 3A), nor did it increase ERK phosphorylation, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). Thus, although CSE and H2O2 each increases MMP-1 expression in SAECs, CSE requires ERK signaling, whereas H2O2 does not. In particular, these data show that the intracellular signals mediating MMP-1 expression during CSE exposure are specific to cigarette smoke and are not a reaction to an increased oxidant burden. H2O2 did not increase MMP-2 or MMP-9 activity, and pretreatment with SB203580 or PD98059 had no effect on these activities (Fig. 3C). These H2O2 studies demonstrate that cultured human small airway epithelial cells respond to CSE and H2O2 by increasing expression of MMP-1 but not MMP-2 nor MMP-9. CSE Activates ERK in SAECs—We examined the ability of CSE to activate ERK directly. CSE progressively increased p-ERK activity (Fig. 3D). SAECs expressed low p-ERK activity at baseline (0.4 ± 0.05 pmol of phosphate/min). After addition of fresh media, there was a rapid increase in p-ERK activity for both control and CSE-treated cells at 15 min. At 30 min, SAECs treated with 5% CSE demonstrated p-ERK activity that was significantly higher than control (2.1 ± 0.3 pmol/min, p = 0.02) and continued to rise during the 60-min treatment period (2.5 ± 0.08 pmol/min, p = 0.001). In addition, increased expression of p-ERK was detected by Western blot at 30 min after 5% CSE treatment and was still present at 60 min (Fig. 3E). Increased p-ERK was also observed in A549 alveolar epithelial cells treated with CSE (data not shown). CSE did not induce phosphorylation of p38 or stress activated protein kinase/Jun terminal kinase (data not shown). A study of the longer-term effects of smoke on ERK signaling revealed significantly increased ERK activity after 24-h treatment with 5% CSE, compared with untreated SAECs (Fig. 3F, 1.9 ± 0.3-fold above control, p = 0.016). These results demonstrate that ERK is directly activated by CSE in human airway cells in vitro. Activation of ERK in Murine Lung by Cigarette Smoke— Because smoke exposure in vivo affects a variety of cell types in the lung, and because cell culture studies cannot mimic the complexity of animal physiology, we performed in vivo studies to examine the signaling pathways activated in murine lung after exposure to cigarette smoke. Western blotting of normal mouse lung homogenates showed increased p-ERK at 10 days of smoke exposure compared with lungs from control (unexposed) mice (Fig. 4A). Immunohistochemistry of lung tissue sections revealed nominal p-ERK staining in airway lining cells and red blood cells in control mice, with no staining in alveolar cells (Figs. 4, B and C). Robust expression of p-ERK is observed in airway lining cells, as well as in macrophages in the alveolar spaces at 10 days of smoke exposure (Figs. 4, D and E). Strong airway and alveolar p-ERK staining was still present at 6 months of exposure (Fig. 4, F and G). No staining was detected in slides incubated with pre-immune serum instead of antibody (data not shown). These data demonstrate that cigarette smoke activates p-ERK in resident airway epithelial cells, alveolar cells, and alveolar macrophages in vivo. Emphysematous Human Lungs Express p-ERK Activity— Because our in vitro and animal studies revealed directly increased p-ERK activity with smoke exposure, we obtained human lung samples from patients with emphysema to examine whether changes in p-ERK were associated with disease. A previous study by our laboratory (9Imai K. Dalal S. Chen E. Downey R. Schulman L. Ginsburg M. D'Armiento J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) showed that emphysematous lungs express MMP-1 whereas normal adult lungs do not. To determine whether this MMP-1 expression correlated with elevated mitogen-activated protein kinase, we analyzed these same human samples for p-ERK activity. Initial experiments were performed in the absence of the specific p42/p44 (ERK) substrate to determine endogenous protein phosphorylation in normal and emphysematous lungs. No difference was detected (Fig. 5A, left). However, when specific p-ERK activity was examined, significantly higher levels were detected in lung homogenates from patients with emphysema, compared with healthy control subjects (Fig. 5A, right: 1.9 ± 0.2-fold increase above normal lung, p = 0.02). We next assessed levels of ERK in eight human lung samples. Western blot analysis revealed that emphysematous lungs expressed higher p-ERK levels than normal lungs (Fig. 5B). No differences in p38 were detected (data not shown). These results reveal a potential role for p-ERK in emphysema pathogenesis. Interestingly, p-ERK expression in normal lung was lower than emphysematous lung, regardless of smoking status. For example, lung tissue from an active smoker without emphysema (sample N1) showed very low levels of p-ERK activity, compared with patients with emphysema. Thus, it seems that p-ERK activity is specific to the presence of emphysema in human tissue, not a marker of smoking status. As a result of elevated p-ERK in lung homogenates, we performed fluorescence immunohistochemistry on human lung sections to identify the site of p-ERK expression. We prepared lung tissue sections from a patient with advanced emphysema and from a person without emphysema. Modest staining is observed in the normal sample (Fig. 5C). However, increased p-ERK is detected in the cytoplasm of cells lining the airways as well as in alveolar cells in the emphysema sample (Fig. 5D). Additional studies should clarify the specific cell types involved. The data in this study provide evidence for activation of ERK and MMP-1 in the lungs of patients with emphysema. Several reports have documented MMP expression in the airways of tobacco smokers (3Hautamaki R. Kobayashi D. Senior R. Shapiro S.

In the present study, the large increase in collagenase activity after treatment with CSE in combination with either IL-1α or IL-1β may result from induction of MMP activators. We know that cigarette smoke and interleukins increase protease production and reduce antiprotease activity in inflammatory lung cells (25Blue M.L. Janoff A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1978; 117: 317-325PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gadek J. Fells G. Crystal R.G. Science. 1979; PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rodriguez R.J. White R.R. Senior R.M. Levine E.A.

The demonstration that SAECs produce proteases is significant because studies have shown that pathological changes in the small airways are linked to changes in airway resistance in emphysema (29Hogg J.C. Macklem P.T. Thurlbeck W.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1968; 278: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 30Shaw R.J. Djukanovic R. Tashkin D.P. Millar A.B. du Bois R.M. Orr P.A. Respir. Med. 2002; 96: 67-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Three major consequences of cigarette smoke-induced lung injury are chronic mucus hypersecretion, airway inflammation and narrowing, and destruction of alveolar septi (31Carter A. Monick M. Hunninghake G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 32Cosio M. Guerassimov A. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

It has been shown that mitogen-activated protein kinase activation alters mucin production and inflammation in the lung (36Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Jeong Shim J. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I. Nadel J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The present study links this same kinase pathway to increased MMP-1 expression seen in emphysema and alveolar destruction (10D'Armiento J. Dalal S. Okada Y. Berg R. Chada K. Cell. 1992; 71: 955-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase pathway is also implicated in apoptosis (37Kling D. Lorenzo H. Trbovich A. Kinane T. Donahoe P.

Together, these studies suggest a central role for ERK in cigarette smoke-induced MMP-1 activity in lung epithelia and in multiple emphysema-associated pathologies. Thousands of chemicals exist in tobacco and tobacco smoke (42US Department of Health, Education and Welfare Smoking and Health. A Report of the US Surgeon General. US Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.1979Google Scholar). Because most particulate matter is filtered out by the airways, volatile components of the gas phase of smoke are believed to be responsible for changes in enzymatic activity, such as oxidative inhibition of α1-antitrypsin (43Ogushi F. Hubbard R. Vogelmeier C. Fells G. Crystal R. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 1060-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Of these, nicotine, acrolein, and acetaldehyde seem to be key short-acting pharmacological agents (44Finkelstein E. Nardini M. Van der Vliet A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L732-L739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, acrolein stimulates release of inflammatory cytokines and can alter cellular repair processes by impairing fibroblast function (45Carnevali S. Nakamura Y. Mio T. Liu X. Takigawa K. Romberger D. Spurzem J. Rennard S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L591-L598PubMed Google Scholar). Previous evidence of a role for ERK in matrix remodeling has also been shown using human fibroblasts, in which ERK was associated with inhibition of collagen type I expression (46Reunanen N. Foschi M. Han J. Kähäri V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34634-34639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additional studies will identify transcription factors involved in the airway response to cigarette smoke. The present study shows that MMP-1 induction by cigarette smoke in epithelial cells of the human airway is ERK-dependent, revealing a novel mechanism for matrix remodeling in human emphysema. Our previous studies identified a causal relationship between MMP-1 production and emphysema (9Imai K. Dalal S. Chen E. Downey R. Schulman L. Ginsburg M. D'Armiento J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10D'Armiento J. Dalal S. Okada Y. Berg R. Chada K. Cell. 1992; 71: 955-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The present findings suggest that emphysema patients may represent a subset of persons predisposed to long-term ERK signaling in the lung, which may render them susceptible to increased collagen destruction by MMP-1. Our human data suggest that a switch in ERK activity from transient to constitutive may be critical in emphysema progression. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that even though the persons with emphysema have abstained from smoking for months, their pulmonary p-ERK activity is significantly higher than that of active smokers without the disease. In addition, these data demonstrate that cigarette smoke activates MMP-1 in the absence of a complete inflammatory program, as shown by our epithelial culture system, providing further support for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease research efforts targeted at not only proteolytic enzymes, but also the internal signaling pathways of cells of the lung (47Choudhury B.

https://openalex.org/W1971171842,"The model for export of fatty acids from plastids proposes that the acyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) product of de novo fatty acid synthesis is hydrolyzed in the stroma by acyl-ACP thioesterases and the free fatty acid (FFA) released is then transferred to the outer envelope of the plastid where it is reactivated to acyl-CoA for utilization in cytosolic glycerolipid synthesis. Experiments were performed to assess whether the delivery of nascent FFA from the stroma for long chain acyl-CoA synthesis (LACS) occurs via simple diffusion or a more complex mechanism. The flux through the in vivo FFA pool was estimated using kinetic labeling experiments with spinach and pea leaves. The maximum half-life for FFA in the export pool was ≤1 s. Isolated pea chloroplasts incubated in the light with [14C]acetate gave a linear accumulation of FFA. When CoASH and ATP were present there was also a linear accumulation of acyl-CoA thioesters (plus derived polar lipids), with no measurable lag phase (<30 s), indicating that the FFA pool supplying LACS rapidly reached steady state. The LACS reaction was also measured independently in the dark after in situ generated FFA had accumulated yielding estimates of LACS substrate-velocity relationships. Based on these experiments the LACS reaction with in situ generated FFA as substrate is only about 3% of the LACS activity required in vivo at the very low concentrations of the FFA export pool calculated from the in vivo experiment. Furthermore, bovine serum albumin rapidly removed in situ generated FFA from chloroplasts, but could not compete effectively for “nascent” FFA substrates of LACS. Together the data suggest a locally channeled pool of exported FFA that is closely linked to LACS. The model for export of fatty acids from plastids proposes that the acyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) product of de novo fatty acid synthesis is hydrolyzed in the stroma by acyl-ACP thioesterases and the free fatty acid (FFA) released is then transferred to the outer envelope of the plastid where it is reactivated to acyl-CoA for utilization in cytosolic glycerolipid synthesis.

Based on these experiments the LACS reaction with in situ generated FFA as substrate is only about 3% of the LACS activity required in vivo at the very low concentrations of the FFA export pool calculated from the in vivo experiment. Furthermore, bovine serum albumin rapidly removed in situ generated FFA from chloroplasts, but could not compete effectively for “nascent” FFA substrates of LACS. Together the data suggest a locally channeled pool of exported FFA that is closely linked to LACS. De novo fatty acid biosynthesis in plants occurs mainly in the plastid (1Ohlrogge J.B. Kuhn D.N. Stumpf P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The immediate product, acyl-ACP 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; FFA, free fatty acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; acyl-CoA, acyl coenzyme A; LACS, long chain acyl-CoA synthesis; MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PL, polar lipids; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; FFA, free fatty acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; acyl-CoA, acyl coenzyme A; LACS, long chain acyl-CoA synthesis; MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PL, polar lipids; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (acyl carrier protein) thioester, may be used directly by plastid-localized acyltransferases for the synthesis of “prokaryotic” lipids that are assembled within the chloroplast. Alternatively the acyl moiety of the acyl-ACP can be exported to the cytoplasm where it is primarily incorporated into glycerolipids at the endoplasmic reticulum (eukaryotic pathway) (2Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1982; 33: 97-132Crossref Google Scholar, 3Somerville C. Browse J. Science. 1991; 252: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In leaves of plants such as Arabidopsis and spinach (16:3 plants) both pathways contribute about equally to the synthesis of leaf glycerolipids (3Somerville C. Browse J. Science. 1991; 252: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), whereas in non-photosynthetic tissue of all plants and in leaves of 18:3 plants such as pea the eukaryotic pathway is the major pathway for glycerolipid synthesis (4Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). The current model for export of fatty acids produced by de novo synthesis within the plastid proposes that acyl-ACP hydrolysis occurs in the plastid stroma by the action of acyl-ACP thioesterases, possibly at the inner leaflet of the inner envelope, and that the free fatty acid (FFA) released is transferred to the outer envelope of the plastid where it is reactivated to acyl-CoA for utilization in cytosolic glycerolipid synthesis (Fig. 1). The chemical principle of this model was first proposed by Shine et al. (5Shine W.E. Mancha M. Stumpf P.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As subsequent experiments showed that ACP-dependent fatty acid synthesis was almost entirely a chloroplast function (1Ohlrogge J.B. Kuhn D.N. Stumpf P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) this implied that the soluble acyl-ACP thioesterase was a stromal enzyme activity. Long-chain acyl-CoA synthesis (LACS) activity is associated with the chloroplast envelope (6Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Joyard J. Stumpf P.K. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 250-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and more specifically with the outer envelope (8Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 735-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Block M.A. Dorne A.-J. Joyard J. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 377-381Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, the major product of fatty acid synthesis in isolated chloroplasts is FFA, unless ATP and CoASH are both present, when acyl-CoA becomes a major end product (10Roughan P.G. Holland R. Slack C.R. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. FEBS Lett. 1981; 135: 182-186Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In vivo confirmation that FFA is indeed an intermediate in fatty acid export from the plastid was accomplished by the use of 18O labeling experiments (12Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There are several unknowns when considering the details of a fatty acid export process. First, it is unclear if the acyl-ACP thioesterases associate with the inner leaflet of the inner membrane of the envelope, thus releasing the acyl group to the inner leaflet (as shown in Fig. 1). Second, the vectorial nature of the long chain acyl-CoA synthesis (LACS) reaction is unknown. The outer envelope contains pores which can accommodate molecules of up to 8-10 kDa (13Flugge U.I. Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 85-89Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus metabolites such as ATP, CoASH, and acyl-CoAs may diffuse into the intermembrane space between the inner and outer envelope. It is uncertain whether soluble acyl-CoA-binding proteins, which have a mass of 10-11 kDa (14Engeseth N.J. Pacovsky R. Newman T. Ohlrogge J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), will be able to move as freely. We do not know whether the plastid long chain acyl-CoA synthetase can bind FFA at the inner leaflet of the outer envelope, then transfer FFA to the outer leaflet for activation to acyl-CoA, or whether the transfer of FFA across the outer envelope is accomplished by other means, or if the active site of the long chain acyl-CoA synthetase is at the inner leaflet of the outer envelope. We note by way of analogy that pairs of proteins, one of which is always an acyl-CoA synthetase, have been implicated in the vectorial import of fatty acids in Escherichia coli (15DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Weimar J.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), in yeast (16Zou Z. Tong F. Faergeman N.J. Borsting C. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16414-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and in animal cells (17Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 18Coe N.R. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I. Watkins P.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Third, there appears to be no direct connections between the inner and the outer envelope of the plastid, although there may be some “contact points” (19Douce R. Joyard J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 173-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus at the minimum we would expect that FFA will have to flip-flop across the inner envelope membrane, and then possibly disassociate into the periplasmic space to reach the long chain acyl-CoA synthetase at the outer envelope (Fig. 1, lower route). Given these unknowns a major question is whether the movement of FFA out of chloroplasts is a transporter-facilitated process or involves free diffusion of the FFA intermediates. This is a debate that has parallels in other systems where FFA transport is required (20Abumrad N. Harmon C. Ibrahimi A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hamilton J.A. J.

We report a variety of experiments designed to examine the question of FFA export from the plastid, using assays with intact leaves and chloroplasts. Materials-Pea seeds (Pisum sativum L. cv Little marvel) were germinated on moist vermiculite. For chloroplast preparations the peas were grown for 8-10 days in the growth chamber at 25 °C and an 8 h photoperiod with occasional watering. For the in vivo experiments the peas were grown for 12 days in the growth chamber watering with nutrient solution. Young pea leaves were removed that had yet to open. These were cut in half laterally, immediately placed in assay medium and preincubated as described below. [1-14C]Acetic acid (57.2 Ci/mol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). In Vivo Incubations-Leaf assays with halved pea leaves were run in 5.0 ml of medium containing 25 mm NaMES buffer, pH 5.7, with 0.3-0.4 g of fresh weight of tissue, at 28 °C and under strong illumination (180 μmol of photons/m2/s). Tween 20 was added as a wetting agent to a concentration of 0.01% w/v. The reaction was initiated with sodium [1-14C]acetate solution. Time course assays were run with 0.03-0.06 mCi of labeled acetate (0.105-0.21 mm). These assays were terminated by partial removal of the medium and quenching with hot isopropyl alcohol while the tissue was under illumination. Chloroplast Preparation and Assays-Intact chloroplasts were isolated on a continuous Percoll gradient (24Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoot R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, London1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar). All procedures were conducted at 0-4 °C. About 10-20 g of 8-day-old pea seedlings were homogenized in 100 ml of semi-frozen homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 330 mm sorbitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EDTA) using a polytron (PT 10/35) and filtered through 2 layers of miracloth (Calbiochem). Crude chloroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 1200 × g max for 5 min. These were purified by centrifugation through pre-made gradients of Percoll generated by centrifugation of 30 ml of 50% Percoll in homogenization buffer for 30 min at 40,000 × g. Crude chloroplasts (2-3 ml) were centrifuged through the pre-made gradients at 13,000 × g max for 5 min in an HB-4 rotor without brake. The intact chloroplast band formed near the bottom of the gradient was recovered and washed with resuspension buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0 and 330 mm sorbitol. The resulting isolated chloroplasts can incorporate acetate into fatty acids at rates corresponding to in vivo rates of fatty acid synthesis, import and process in vitro translated protein precursors, sustain high rates of photosynthesis (25Keegstra K. Yousif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and give about 90% intactness as determined by phase contrast light microscopy and the reduction of ferricyanide before and after an osmotic shock (26Lilley R.McC. Fitzgerald M.P. Rienits K.G. Walker D.A. New Phytol. 1975; 75: 1-10Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 27Douce R. Joyard J. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical, New York1982: 239-256Google Scholar). Quantification of chlorophyll was performed as described by Arnon (28Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chloroplast incubations to synthesize fatty acids were performed largely according to the methods described by Roughan (29Roughan P.G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 327-337Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts (40-50 μg of chlorophyll) were incubated under illumination (180 μmol of photons/m2/s) with shaking at 25 °C in a medium (200 μl) containing 0.33 m sorbitol, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm KHCO3, 2 mm Na3EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm K2HPO4, and 2 mm acetate containing 2 μCi of [14C]acetate. Where noted in the text assays also contained 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CoA, and/or 0.5 mg/ml BSA added at specific times. An aliquot was removed before the illumination and used to measure the actual radioactivity added. Reactions were terminated by placing the incubation mixture into liquid nitrogen and were kept in -80 °C freezer until lipid analysis. In the BSA/FFA binding assays, chloroplasts were separated from the BSA in the medium by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (Sorvall Biofuge pico) for 15 s. The supernatant was aspirated from the chloroplast pellet and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fatty acids were extracted from the supernatant and the chloroplast pellet separately. Lipid Analysis-After quenching the tissue by heating in isopropyl alcohol at 80-90 °C for 5 min lipid extraction from the [14C]acetate fed leaf strips was carried out using hexane-isopropyl alcohol (30Hara A. Radin N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the lipid extract was suspended in 4:1 acetone/water and the OD at 652 nm measured to determine chlorophyll (28Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); another aliquot was assayed by liquid scintillation counting to determine radioactivity incorporated. Suspension of the lipid residue in organic solvent and re-evaporation in the presence of a few drops of glacial acetic acid was crucial to drive off residual acetate substrate contamination to give accurate radioactivity determinations. Lipid classes and fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and isolated by preparative TLC. TLC plates were scanned for radioactivity using a Packard Instant Imager (Canberra Instruments), both to quantify radioactivity and to locate the appropriate bands for recovery from preparative TLC plates. For pea leaf extracts a non-saponifable band (4-6% of total label) co-migrated very close to FFA on TLC, so the samples were first treated with ethereal diazomethane and then fatty acid methyl esters determined to measure the free fatty acid pool. Neutral lipids were analyzed on silica plates developed half way with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid 70:30:1 (v/v/v) and then fully with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid 180:20:1 (v/v/v). For analysis of individual labeled fatty acids the methyl ester fraction was isolated by preparative TLC and separated using either C18-reversed phase TLC, developing half way and then fully with acetonitrile/methanol/water 130:70:1 (v/v/v), or by argentation-TLC using plates impregnated with a 5% silver nitrate in acetonitrile solution, dried and activated, and developed with hexane-diethyl ether mixtures. The method for analysis of radiolabeled products from chloroplast assays was adapted from Roughan (29Roughan P.G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 327-337Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Samples were saponified by heating in 80-90 °C for 60 min in 0.8 ml of 10% KOH (w/v) in methanol per 0.2 ml reaction mixture. After cooling, acidification and extraction with hexane and then evaporation of the hexane under nitrogen the total radioactivity recovered was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Since there are negligible non-saponifiable products this radioactivity is a measure of the incorporation of [14C]acetate into total fatty acids. Lipid class analysis was performed by mixing 0.2 ml of reaction mixture with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) and 0.72 ml of 0.2 m H3PO4 in 2 m KCl. The lower organic phase was collected, and the upper aqueous methanol phase was back-extracted with hexane (4 ml). The combined organic extracts were evaporated to dryness and an aliquot assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Neutral and polar lipids were separated by TLC using K6 silica plates (Whatman, Clifton, PA) developed in hexane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid 80/20/1 (v/v/v). To determine the polar lipid composition, the polar lipid band was recovered and analyzed on K6 silica TLC plates impregnated with 0.15 m ammonium sulfate and activated at 120 °C for 3 h, and developed in acetone/toluene/water 91/30/8 (v/v/v) (31Kahn M.U. Williams J.P. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 140: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The aqueous methanol phase contains acyl-CoA as the major saponifiable lipid. Over 80% of the label was shown to co-migrate with long chain acyl-CoA standard when extracted by butan-1-ol and analyzed by TLC (K6 plate developed in butan-1-ol/acetic acid/water 50:20:25 (v/v/v)). Routinely the aqueous phase was saponified, acidified, extracted with hexane and the extractable lipids (i.e. free fatty acids) assayed for radioactivity (11Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. FEBS Lett. 1981; 135: 182-186Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 32Johnson P.E. Rawsthorne S. Hills M.J. Planta. 2002; 215: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Control extractions with chloroplasts spiked with known amounts of radiolabeled oleic acid or oleoyl-CoA yielded essentially complete recovery of oleic acid and >85% recovery of oleoyl-CoA either in the presence or absence of BSA. The Total in Vivo Pool of FFA in Leaves Is Very Small and Implies a Very Short Half-life for the FFA Pool Involved in Export from the Chloroplast-Although it is generally known that labeled FFA are minor products when leaf tissue is incubated with acetate, the amount of FFA has not previously been quantified. We have shown that FFA are intermediates in fatty acyl group export from the chloroplast (12Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and to better understand this export process it was important to quantify this FFA pool. Fig. 2 presents a time course for acetate incorporation into total fatty acids and into FFA by pea leaves over a 20 min period. With expanding pea leaves a linear rate of lipid synthesis was established within 2 min (Fig. 2A). At all time points the labeled total lipid extract from pea leaves contains 80-85% labeled fatty acids, mainly as phosphatidylcholine. Presumably the short lag phase indicates the time to reach the steady state balance between transport processes and pool filling in the biosynthetic utilization of acetate. To measure the FFA pool the leaf assays were quenched while still in the presence of substrate in the light (Fig. 2B). Control extractions spiking unlabeled tissue with [14C]oleic acid gave >90% recovery of label. In the experiment in Fig. 2 the labeled FFA pool at 2 min was 4.3% of total labeled lipids and contained essentially only palmitic and oleic acids. In pea most of the fatty acids synthesized in the chloroplast are exported (∼90%). The turnover time of FFA during plastid export for pea can be estimated as follows. Let the steady state rate of lipid synthesis be 100 units per min, of which ∼85 units are fatty acids. Therefore 76.5 units (90% of 85%) must pass through the FFA transfer pool for export to the eukaryotic pathway. At the 2 min time point the steady state level of labeled FFA in the transfer pool has been reached, and because the steady state rate extrapolates back to the x-axis at 1 min (Fig. 2A) the total amount of lipids synthesized is equivalent to about 100 units. Thus 100 units × 4.3% of labeled FFA are present (4.3 units). At 2 min we have a flux of 76.5 units per min through a transfer pool of 4.3 units. This gives a turnover time of 60 × 4.3/76.5 = 3.4 s and a t½ value of 2.35 s (t½= turnover time × 0.693). A repeat of the time course with pea leaves gave the onset of steady state labeling within 1 min, while the labeled FFA pool at 2 min was 2.05 ± 0.26% (4 determinations), giving a t½ value of 1.7 s. A similar time course and FFA pool analysis experiment was performed with spinach leaf strips (data not shown). A turnover time 0.96 s and a t½ value of 0.66 s were determined. These calculations for pea and spinach leaves represent estimated values for the FFA transfer pool turnover times that are an upper limit. The observed FFA pool may include the transient pool of FFA being exported from the plastid, FFA released from labeled acyl thioester pools during the heat quench step, plus FFA derived from other sources. The kinetics of labeled FFA appearance in the time course for pea leaves (Fig. 2B) give us an indication that much of the labeled FFA pool is not a transfer pool. If the observed FFA pool were all the transfer pool then this pool would saturate by 2 min. Instead the pool continues to grow substantially. We speculate that some of the FFA pool actually derives from fatty acid synthesis at the damaged margins of the leaf strips in the assay. Given the approximations in the calculations it seems reasonable to state that the t½ for FFA in any chloroplast export pool is about 1 s, or less, and possibly much less. Having established this limiting in vivo pool size we then examined the detailed relationship between products of fatty acid synthesis in isolated, intact pea chloroplasts. In pea, compared with spinach, much more of the fatty acid produced is exported from the chloroplast. Time Course for Acetate Incorporation into Fatty Acyl Products by Isolated Pea Chloroplasts-The synthesis of fatty acids from acetate by intact, illuminated chloroplasts can produce a variety of acyl products (34Heinz E. Roughan P.G. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 273-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gardiner S.E. Heinz E. Roughan P.G. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 890-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), depending on the plant species from which the chloroplasts are isolated and on the cofactors in the chloroplast incubation medium. In a minimal chloroplast incubation medium (no CoASH, glycerol-3-phosphate, nor UDP-galactose) the major product is free fatty acid (FFA). Smaller amounts of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) (∼5-20%) and polar lipids (PL) (∼10-20%) have also been observed. When CoASH and ATP are added, up to 60% of the label may be found as acyl-CoA (11Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. FEBS Lett. 1981; 135: 182-186Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The incorporation of acetate into acyl lipids by pea chloroplasts is shown in Fig. 3. In minimal chloroplast incubation medium the [14C]acetate incorporation into total fatty acids was 15.5 pmol of fatty acid/s/mg chlorophyll (Fig. 3A), but when CoASH and ATP were present this rate increased 1.4-fold to 21.5 pmol of fatty acid/s/mg chlorophyll (Fig. 3B). In the minimal medium the major product was FFA (about 90% of total label). When CoASH and ATP were present up to 80% of the label was found as acyl-CoA plus polar lipids (PL). Fig. 3B shows that over a 35 min period in the light with ATP and CoASH total fatty acid synthesis was linear, and that the appearance of the individual products, namely FFA (∼25%), acyl-CoA (∼40%), and total PL (∼40%) were also linear, with negligible lag phase detected. The labeled PL fraction was composed of about 60% phosphatidylcholine and 10% phosphatidylglycerol. To confirm the lack of a lag phase earlier time points were taken (Fig. 3C). Any lag phase required for the establishment of the steady state condition of product accumulation in the presence of CoASH plus ATP was less than 30 s. In Fig. 3, B or C if the bulk FFA pool were a precursor of acyl-CoA, which is subsequently used for PL synthesis, a measurable lag would occur in acyl-CoA plus PL accumulation. Thus there was no observable precursor-product kinetic relationship between labeled FFA and acyl-CoA. This implies that the FFA concentration to run the LACS reaction at steady state rate has been reached rapidly (<30 s) and that the bulk-labeled FFA pool accumulating in Fig. 3, B or C is not a precursor for the LACS reaction. The linear rates in Fig. 3, B or C further imply that neither the bulk FFA nor acyl-CoA are acting as feedback inhibitors for fatty acid synthesis by isolated chloroplasts. Our lag phase estimates are currently limited to >10 s by the gentle mixing required for delicate organelles like chloroplasts, for pool filling from acetate through to end products of fatty acid synthesis, and quench times. The Long Chain Acyl-CoA Synthesis (LACS) Reaction in the Dark Utilizing in Situ Generated FFA-When FFA is exported from the plastid it is converted to acyl-CoA for utilization in cytosolic reactions of lipid biosynthesis. The LACS reaction has previously been studied after preparation of chloroplast envelope vesicles and addition of FFA substrate (7Joyard J. Stumpf P.K. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 250-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the LACS reaction in intact pea chloroplasts with in situ generated FFA. Fig. 4 presents the effect of switching off the light after 15 min of incubation of chloroplasts in media containing no CoASH during the light period but added at the onset of the dark period, or in media containing CoASH during both light and dark periods. As observed by many researchers (33Browse J. Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. Biochem. J. 1981; 196: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 36Roughan P.G. Kagawa T. Beevers H. Plant Sci. Lett. 1980; 18: 221-228Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) total fatty acid synthesis was completely halted in the dark. What is noteworthy is the very different behavior of the individual acyl pools during the dark period. In the absence of CoASH the major fatty acid product in the light was FFA (Fig. 4A). When CoASH (0.5 mm) was added at the transition to darkness there was a very rapid conversion of FFA to acyl-CoA and its metabolites (PL). The initial rate of FFA depletion (from 15 to 20 min) was at least twice the rate of total fatty acid synthesis in the light. By contrast, in Fig. 4B the initial rate of FFA depletion on transition to darkness was less than 30% that of the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the light. The combined acyl-CoA and PL accumulation had essentially stopped in the dark period. Because the LACS reaction with in situ generated FFA was very fast in Fig. 4A this experiment was repeated with additional measurements immediately after the light to dark transition (Fig. 4C). There were variations between five independent experiments but upon the dark transition with coincident addition of CoASH, about 25-50%, and sometimes >50% of the FFA label was removed by the LACS reaction in the first 30 s. Thus the LACS reaction in chloroplasts has the capacity to run at a rate over 10 times that of fatty acid synthesis. However, the LACS reaction did not rapidly go to completion. Inspection of Fig. 4C shows that disappearance of FFA does not follow simple first order kinetics. There are at least two components to the disappearance of FFA; a rapid rate of depletion accounting for at least 60-70% of the labeled FFA but sometimes up to 80-85% depending on experiment, and a slow decay for the remainder. Evidence for Distinct Kinetic Pools of FFA in Chloroplast Assays-Based on Fig. 4A we know the LACS reaction is highly active in the dark and therefore the slow rate of LACS in Fig. 4B appears somewhat paradoxical, especially since in Fig. 4A the amount of labeled FFA at the dark transition is 4.7 nmol/mg chlorophyll while in Fig. 4B it is still 3."
https://openalex.org/W1973407849,"The Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is the dimeric partner of hypoxia-inducible factors and thus plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen environments. ARNT is also a dimeric partner for the Ah receptor (AHR), and this complex is essential in regulating the adaptive metabolic response to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Because of the essential role of ARNT in hypoxia-driven developmental events, it has been difficult to study the physiological significance of AHR·ARNT heterodimers in vivo. To address this issue, we developed a hypomorphic Arnt allele that displayed normal development and allowed the examination of the role of ARNT in AHR biology. In this regard, the AHR is also known to mediate two additional biological processes: the toxicological response to compounds such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin) and the developmental closure of a fetal vascular structure known as the ductus venosus. Although the mechanism of the adaptive pathway has been well described, the mechanism of AHR-mediated signal transduction in the toxic and developmental pathways is not well understood. Liver perfusion studies demonstrated that ARNT hypomorphs have a patent ductus venosus, identical to that observed in the Ahr null mice. Parallel dioxin toxicity studies demonstrated that the ARNT hypomorphs exhibited resistance to the end points of dioxin exposure. Moreover, we observed that toxicity could be segregated from the classical adaptive responses such as P4501A induction. Taken in sum, these experiments demonstrate that ARNT is an essential component of AHR developmental signaling and shed light on the mechanism of dioxin toxicity. The Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is the dimeric partner of hypoxia-inducible factors and thus plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen environments. ARNT is also a dimeric partner for the Ah receptor (AHR), and this complex is essential in regulating the adaptive metabolic response to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Because of the essential role of ARNT in hypoxia-driven developmental events, it has been difficult to study the physiological significance of AHR·ARNT heterodimers in vivo. To address this issue, we developed a hypomorphic Arnt allele that displayed normal development and allowed the examination of the role of ARNT in AHR biology. In this regard, the AHR is also known to mediate two additional biological processes: the toxicological response to compounds such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin) and the developmental closure of a fetal vascular structure known as the ductus venosus. Although the mechanism of the adaptive pathway has been well described, the mechanism of AHR-mediated signal transduction in the toxic and developmental pathways is not well understood. Liver perfusion studies demonstrated that ARNT hypomorphs have a patent ductus venosus, identical to that observed in the Ahr null mice. Parallel dioxin toxicity studies demonstrated that the ARNT hypomorphs exhibited resistance to the end points of dioxin exposure. Moreover, we observed that toxicity could be segregated from the classical adaptive responses such as P4501A induction. Taken in sum, these experiments demonstrate that ARNT is an essential component of AHR developmental signaling and shed light on the mechanism of dioxin toxicity. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; Arntfxneo, hypomorphic Arnt allele; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; DV, ductus venosus; EROD, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; Neo, neomycin resistance cassette; PAH, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; PAS, Period-ARNT-Singleminded. and the Ah receptor (AHR) are founding members of the PAS superfamily of transcriptional regulators (1Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J. Bradfield C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). These proteins were originally identified as the result of their involvement in the regulation of an adaptive metabolic response to certain xenobiotics, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (2Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 3Whitlock Jr., J.P. Chichester C.H. Bedgood R.M. Okino S.T. Ko H.P. Ma Q. Dong L. Li H. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Drug Metab. Rev. 1997; 29: 1107-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this pathway, PAH molecules bind to the AHR, which then translocates to the nucleus and heterodimerizes with its transcriptional partner, ARNT. The AHR·ARNT complex then interacts with specific response elements to up-regulate a battery of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes that include the cytochrome p450 enzymes, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1 as well as the phase II enzymes Gst-a1 and Ugt1–06 (2Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 4Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Given that each of the up-regulated enzymes metabolize PAHs, we refer to this process as the “adaptive pathway” of AHR. In addition to its role in the adaptive metabolism of xenobiotics, the AHR also mediates two other biological pathways that we refer to as “toxic” and “developmental.” In the toxic pathway, exposure to potent agonists such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin) results in a response that includes end points such as hepatotoxicity, thymic involution, epithelial hyperplasia, and cleft palate (5Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). A compelling body of genetic and pharmacological evidence has demonstrated that the AHR mediates most, if not all, of these toxic responses (5Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar, 6Bradfield C.A. Kende A.S. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar, 7Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 86-94PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to the developmental pathway, a highly reproducible phenotype arising in Ahr null mouse models is a reduced liver size. We have proposed that the smaller liver size is the result of a persistent fetal vascular shunt known as the ductus venosus (DV), and furthermore, that the failure of the DV to close at parturition decreases the portal blood supply to the liver (8Lahvis G.P. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). As a consequence, nutrient supply is limited, and the liver size is decreased. We view AHR signal transduction as encompassing three physiological processes: 1) the adaptive pathway ensuring metabolism of PAHs, 2) the toxic pathway mediating the deleterious effects of dioxin exposure, and 3) the developmental pathway guiding the resolution of fetal liver vascular architecture. We hypothesize that the fundamental mechanisms behind these three distinct biological processes are dependent upon AHR·ARNT heterodimerization, interaction with cognate responsive elements, and up-regulation of transcriptional targets. The ability to produce three distinct biological events from one signal transduction mechanism may lie in either the transcriptional up-regulation of the same battery of genes with some temporal and/or spatial specificity or the up-regulation of gene sets unique to each biological event. Although ARNT has a well defined role in adaptive metabolism, its role in mediating the developmental signaling and dioxin-induced toxicity of AHR has not been fully addressed. Although it may be assumed that all features of AHR signal transduction are dependent upon ARNT heterodimerization, a formal demonstration of this hypothesis is lacking. In this regard, it is important to note that at least three putative homologs of ARNT have been identified in the human genome, ARNT2, MOP3, and MOP9, (9Hirose K. Morita M. Ema M. Mimura J. Hamada H.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ARNT2 protein has been shown to form transcriptionally active partnerships with the AHR in transient transfection experiments (9Hirose K. Morita M. Ema M. Mimura J. Hamada H. Fujii H. Saijo Y. Gotoh O. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1706-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In an effort to examine the possibility that the toxic and developmental aspects of AHR biology are dependent upon ARNT heterodimerization, we used gene targeting to generate a hypomorphic or low-expressing Arnt allele, designated Arntfxneo. This novel allele allowed us to bypass the known embryonic lethality of the Arnt null mutation, and therefore, to assess the effect of limiting ARNT on AHR-dependent toxicity and development (13Maltepe E. Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 14Kozak K.R. Abbott B. Hankinson O. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Through this examination, we provide evidence to support the idea that heterodimerization is an essential feature of adaptive, toxic, and developmental AHR signaling. Generation of Arntfxneo Mice—A bacteriophage (P1) clone containing the murine Arnt locus was obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) (13Maltepe E. Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The strategy for creation of the targeting construct (PL910) involved insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette (Neo), flanked by loxp recombination sequences, into the EcoRI site 3′ of exon 6 (Fig. 1B). A third loxp site was inserted into the intron 5′ of exon 6, replacing the internal BglII site. Our homologous recombination protocols using GS1 embryonic stem cells (Genome Systems) have been described previously (15Bunger M.K. Moran S.M. Glover E. Thomae T.L. Lahvis G.P. Lin B.C. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17767-17774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Clones were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot of BglII-digested genomic DNA using a 600-bp probe 5′ to the end of the targeting construct (PL1220). Targeted clones were injected into 3.5-day postcoital C57BL/6J blastocysts, and resulting chimeras were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice to determine germ line transmission of the targeted allele. Prior to experimental analysis, transmitting animals were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for at least five generations. Genotyping was performed by PCR on DNA isolated from tail biopsies using the forward primer, OL2300 (5′-GCAACTTTGACAAGGCAGCATTTA-3′), and the reverse primer, OL2301 (5′-GGCAGGGGGAATCTCTGAGTTCT-3′). These primers amplified a 140-bp band from the wild-type allele and a 174-bp band from the targeted allele due to the insertion of the loxp site. The PCR was carried out for 30 cycles (92 °C/30 s; 58 °C/30 s; 72 °C/30 s) in a reaction mixture containing 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25 °C), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton® X-100, 200 μm dNTPs, and 0.2 μm of each primer. Animals—Mice were housed in a selective pathogen-free facility on corncob bedding with food and water ad libitum according to the rules and guidelines set by the University of Wisconsin. ARNT expression was evaluated in untreated adult wild-type and Arntfxneo/fxneo mice by Western blot analysis of cytosolic fractions prepared from various tissues including the liver, spleen, heart, lung, thymus, and uterus (15Bunger M.K. Moran S.M. Glover E. Thomae T.L. Lahvis G.P. Lin B.C. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17767-17774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22203-22209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In toxicology studies, 6-week-old mice were dosed once by oral gavage with 64 μg/kg of dioxin in corn oil or with corn oil alone. After 16 days, animals were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (Sigma, 200 μg/g of body weight). Whole blood was obtained by retro-orbital puncture for serum analysis of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). After liver perfusion to determine DV status (see below), organs were dissected and weighed. Liver sections were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for sectioning and histological staining. Western blots and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) assays were performed on cytosolic and microsomal liver fractions, respectively (15Bunger M.K. Moran S.M. Glover E. Thomae T.L. Lahvis G.P. Lin B.C. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17767-17774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22203-22209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In situations where multiple comparisons could be made, an analysis of variance was performed, and Tukey's test was used to determine differences with a p ≤ 0.05. Ductus Venosus Status—The status of the DV was assessed by perfusion of the liver with trypan blue (8Lahvis G.P. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were cannulated via the portal vein, and the inferior vena cava was incised to permit outflow. After flushing the liver with phosphate-buffered saline, ∼0.5 ml of trypan blue was injected into the liver. Lack of blue coloration in the liver following perfusion indicated a patent (open) DV. To confirm this analysis, time-lapsed angiography was performed to visualize the flow of Omnipaque 300 (Nycomed Inc., Princeton, NJ) after injection into the portal vein. To visualize liver vascular architecture, continuous x-ray images were obtained over 10 s (8Lahvis G.P. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Generation of Arntfxneo Mice—Given that a targeted disruption of the Arnt locus results in developmental lethality at embryonic day 10, we examined the idea that the generation of a hypomorphic allele would provide sufficient ARNT to bypass the developmental block and produce animals that were limited in the amount of ARNT available for various signal transduction pathways (13Maltepe E. Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 14Kozak K.R. Abbott B. Hankinson O. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Previous targeting events in our laboratory demonstrated that insertion of the Neo gene proximal to the exon encoding the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain often resulted in the generation of a hypomorphic allele (15Bunger M.K. Moran S.M. Glover E. Thomae T.L. Lahvis G.P. Lin B.C. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17767-17774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore, we inserted a Neo cassette flanked by loxp sites (“floxed”) adjacent to exon 6, which encodes the bHLH of Arnt (Fig. 1B). A third loxp site was inserted upstream of exon 6 for later creation of the conditional null. A map of the Arnt allele, which we designate as Arntfxneo, is shown in Fig. 1B. Also shown is a map of the Arnt structural gene as well as the construct used for embryonic stem cell targeting. Following homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells and both positive and negative selection, surviving clones were screened by Southern blot (Fig. 1C). Correctly targeted clones were used to generate chimeras, and these mice provided germ line transmission of the Arntfxneo allele. A PCR-based protocol was developed to genotype pups based on detection of the loxp sequence upstream of the exon encoding the bHLH (Fig. 1D). The Arntfxneo Allele Is Globally Hypomorphic in Expression— The influence of this mutation on ARNT protein expression was examined by Western blot of protein extracts derived from various tissues prepared from wild-type mice and mice homozygous for the Arntfxneo allele (i.e. Arntfxneo/fxneo). This analysis revealed that ARNT expression was significantly diminished in all tissue samples analyzed, including liver, spleen, heart, lung, thymus, and uterus (Fig. 2, A and B). We estimate that expression from Arntfxneo/fxneo in mouse liver was reduced to ∼10% of wild-type levels, based on comparison with liver protein extracts obtained from wild-type animals. The expression from Arntfxneo/fxneo in other tissues was estimated to be between 5 and 15%. This experiment establishes that the Arntfxneo allele is globally hypomorphic for ARNT protein expression. To examine the relationship between ARNT expression and the copy number of Arnt alleles, we also examined protein extracts from wild-type, Arntfxneo/+, and Arntfxneo/fxneo mouse livers (Fig. 2A). When a single hypomorphic allele is combined with a wild-type allele (i.e. Arntfxneo/+), expression is decreased when compared with the wild-type allele. As noted above, homozygosity results in a further, but not complete, reduction of protein expression. This observation is consistent with the idea that protein expression is a linear sum of expression from all alleles present and is an indication that locus compensation is not occurring. Embryonic Development of Arntfxneo Hypomorphs—Due to the embryonic block described previously for the Arnt null alleles, we examined the influence of our hypomorphic Arntfxneo allele (also referred to as the “ARNT hypomorph”) on fetal development. When dams heterozygous for Arntfxneo allele (i.e. Arntfxneo/+) were crossed with homozygous Arntfxneo/fxneo males, the resulting progeny were 63% (84/143) Arntfxneo/+ heterozygotes and 35% (50/134) Arntfxneo/fxneo homozygotes. The lack of conformation to the expected Mendelian ratio (50:50) indicated partial embryonic lethality arising from the homozygous allele. The fact that a portion of homozygous Arntfxneo/fxneo pups survive indicates that expression of Arnt from the hypomorphic allele is above the threshold to bypass the developmental block. Male and female homozygote survival rates were approximately equal. The outcome of our ARNT hypomorph breeding program also demonstrated that the hypomorphic Arntfxneo allele appeared to have a significant effect on the ability of the dam to maintain a pregnancy since homozygous Arntfxneo/fxneo dams failed to produce live litters even when crossed to wild-type males. The fact that homozygous pups are born to heterozygous Arntfxneo/+ dams when the sire is homogyzous Arntfxneo/fxneo provides evidence that the embryonic lethality in hypomorphic Arntfxneo/fxneo dams is maternal in origin. Although considered preliminary, the gestational failure in Arntfxneo/fxneo dams appears to occur around the time of implantation (data not shown). For the purpose of the following studies, the salient point is that hypomorphic animals can be generated by crosses of the heterozygous Arntfxneo/+ dams with homozygous Arntfxneo/fxneo males. All ARNT hypomorphs surviving from these crosses are outwardly normal, and the male hypomorphs are fertile. ARNT Is Required for Resolution of the Ductus Venosus— Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the Ahr null animals are viable but display a rare vascular phenotype where the fetal DV fails to close. Because AHR signaling is important in vascular resolution and because ARNT is the heterodimeric partner of the AHR, we asked whether our ARNT hypomorphs would display a similar vascular phenotype to that seen in the Ahr-/- mice. Time-lapse radiographs of the liver vascular system illustrate the distinct vascular phenotypes of wild-type and Arntfxneo/fxneo mice. Upon injection of contrast agent in wild-type mice, both primary and secondary portal branches of the liver vascular network fill quickly and completely (Fig. 3, A–C). When the vascular pattern of the Arntfxneo/fxneo mice was evaluated, we found that the contrast agent entered the liver via the portal vein and immediately flowed through the DV into the inferior vena cava (Fig. 3, IVC), where it exited the liver (Fig. 3, D–F). As a direct comparison, we also examined the vascular structure of the Ahr null mouse. As observed previously, contrast agent also flowed through the DV in Ahr null mice, thus demonstrating that the ARNT hypomorphs and the Ahr null mice have an identical liver vascular phenotype (Fig. 3, G–I) (8Lahvis G.P. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Liver perfusion studies using a colored dye to visualize filling of the hepatic vascular system also documented the DV phenotype and revealed that the DV persists in ∼70% (17/24) of the Arntfxneo/fxneo mice. Moreover, this phenotype is independent of sex of the animal (data not shown). The Arntfxneo Allele Maintains the Adaptive AHR Signaling Pathway—In an effort to understand the implications of the hypomorphic Arntfxneo allele on the adaptive and toxic signaling pathways of AHR, we examined the response of Arnt+/+, Arntfxneo/+, and Arntfxneo/fxneo mice to a single dose of 64 μg/kg of dioxin. Sixteen days after dioxin treatment, liver microsomes were prepared, and the P450 arm of the adaptive metabolic response was measured. For liver, EROD activity is a composite measure of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 enzymes, which are classic AHR-induced adaptive responses to dioxin exposure. Microsomes from all groups showed negligible EROD activity in the absence of the AHR ligand, dioxin. In response to dioxin, microsomes from wild-type, Arntfxneo/+, and Arntfxneo/fxneo mice are similarly induced, demonstrating that the adaptive AHR signal transduction pathway is functional in ARNT hypomorphs at this dose (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the idea that increased liver weight following dioxin exposure is at least partially the result of proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, liver weight in dioxin-treated wild-type and Arntfxneo/+ mice was increased to approximately the same extent when compared with their vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 4B). Liver weights were also increased proportionally in the Arntfxneo/fxneo mice treated with dioxin when compared with their vehicle-treated controls. Although the presence of the DV correlates with a smaller liver, the proportional increase in liver weight in ARNT hypomorphs is independent of the presence of the DV (Fig. 4B, inset) (8Lahvis G.P. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The Arntfxneo Allele Confers Resistance to Dioxin Toxicity—In an effort to better understand the role of ARNT in the toxic pathway of AHR signaling, we employed the ARNT hypomorph to examine two classical end points of dioxin toxicity. Following exposure of Arnt+/+, Arntfxneo/+, and Arntfxneo/fxneo mice to 64 μg/kg of dioxin for 16 days, tissues were harvested, weighed, and prepared for histological and clinical examination. One of the classical end points of dioxin toxicity is thymic involution (5Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar, 17Holsapple M.P. Morris D.L. Wood S.C. Snyder N.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 73-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thymus weight in both wild-type and Arntfxneo/+ mice was reduced by ∼80% in response to dioxin exposure (Fig. 5A). In contrast, thymic involution in Arntfxneo/fxneo hypomorphs was about half that observed in the wild-type and Arntfxneo/+ mice. The attenuated dioxin toxicity in the thymus of Arntfxneo/fxneo mice demonstrated that the hypomorphic allele is resistant to this end point. The resistance of the Arntfxneo/fxneo hypomorphs to dioxin-induced thymic involution concurs with the findings of a recent publication describing the absence of thymic involution in mice where Arnt was specifically inactivated in thymic T-cells (18Tomita S. Jiang H. Ueno T. Takagi S. Tohi K. Maekawa S. Miyatake A. Furukawa A. Gonzalez F.J. Takeda J. Ichikawa Y. Takahama Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To assess the influence of the Arntfxneo allele on dioxin-induced hepatotoxicity, we examined two classic pathological measures. As our first measure of hepatotoxicity, we examined the levels of serum ALT in animals exposed to 64 μg/kg of dioxin. Sixteen days after dosing, wild-type animals treated with dioxin displayed ALT values that were 10-fold higher than in controls (Fig. 5B). This elevation in ALT was significantly reduced in mice carrying two hypomorphic alleles (Arntfxneo/fxneo), indicating a resistance to dioxin-induced hepatotoxicity. In dioxin-exposed animals, we observed a trend toward a graded response as a function of the number of hypomorphic alleles present. However, these serum ALT values from dioxin-treated Arntfxneo/+ or Arntfxneo/fxneo animals are not significantly different from untreated controls. As our second measure of hepatotoxicity, a histological examination was performed. This analysis also indicated a reduction in the extent of hepatotoxicity in ARNT hypomorphs. When compared with their vehicle-treated controls, wild-type mice treated with dioxin displayed extensive hydropic vacuolation and degeneration throughout all zones of the liver as well as massive granulocyte infiltration associated with areas of mild congestion (Fig. 5C). In contrast, liver sections from Arntfxneo/fxneo mice treated with dioxin displayed minimal hydropic degeneration and limited granuloma formation in the parenchyma (Fig. 5C). It is difficult to assess the role of ARNT in whole animal models because the null allele at this locus results in embryonic lethality at embryonic day 10 (13Maltepe E. Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 14Kozak K.R. Abbott B. Hankinson O. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This developmental block is believed to be due to the role of ARNT as the transcriptional partner to the various HIFs (19Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar, 20Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M. Yu A.Y. Semenza G.L.

Moran S.M. Hogenesch J.B. Wartman L. Bradfield C.A. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 205-213PubMed Google Scholar). Based on current technology, there are two approaches to overcome the essential nature of ARNT in development. The first is to generate a tissue-specific excision model, and the second is to develop a hypomorphic allele that has globally reduced ARNT expression. Based upon previous work in the laboratory, we devised a strategy that had the potential to yield both such models from a single targeting event in embryonic stem cells. The application of tissue-specific Arnt alleles will be addressed in later work. In this report, we describe the utility of the ARNT hypomorph in understanding the role of this protein in AHR-mediated toxicity and development. The Role of ARNT in AHR-mediated Toxicity—There is little evidence to demonstrate that ARNT is directly involved in the classical end points of dioxin toxicity. Demonstrating a role for ARNT is an extremely important issue because a number of models have been proposed that do not necessarily require the ARNT protein. Such models include the signaling of AHR through cellular factors such as c-Src kinase, the retinoblastoma protein, ceramide, steroid receptors, and NF-κB (23Puga A. Barnes S.J. Dalton T.P. Chang C.

In this regard, we postulated that if the toxic pathway mechanistically resembles the adaptive pathway, then toxic events would be diminished in ARNT hypomorphic animals. That is, we are testing a model where toxicity is the direct result of AHR·ARNT-dependent transcriptional events. Additionally, we are also testing a “cross-talk” model of toxicity. In that model, it is proposed that toxicity may result from the depletion of free ARNT upon dioxin-induced activation of the AHR (1Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J. Bradfield C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this depletion, other ARNT-dependent pathways could be compromised (i.e. HIF1α) (30Chan W.K. Yao G. Gu Y.Z.

Finally, we are testing the idea that ARNT is directly involved in the AHR pathway and not its potential homologues, ARNT2, MOP3, or MOP9 (9Hirose K. Morita M. Ema M. Mimura J. Hamada H. Fujii H.

Examination of the response of the ARNT hypomorph to dioxin exposure now permits us to more clearly define the mechanism of the toxic pathway signaling of AHR. In response to dioxin, our composite data show that the ARNT hypomorphs maintain their inductive metabolic capacity while demonstrating a resistance to two classic toxic end points, thymic involution and hepatotoxicity. Based on these observations, we can make a number of conclusions regarding the role of ARNT in toxicity. The first is that ARNT homologs are not a factor in hepatotoxicity and thymic atrophy. If ARNT homologs had played a role, we would have expected the manifestation of the toxicological end points to be unaltered by the presence of the hypomorphic Arntfxneo allele. The second conclusion is that the AHR is dependent on ARNT for both the toxic and the developmental pathways. If the AHR were acting independently of ARNT, then the hypomorphic Arntfxneo allele should not diminish the outcome of dioxin exposure. The final conclusion is that the cross-talk mechanism of toxicity is not at play. Our prediction was that if cross-talk was operational, ARNT hypomorphs should be more sensitive to toxic end points. Our observations clearly show attenuation in the extent of toxicity in the ARNT hypomorphs treated with dioxin, and therefore, render the cross-talk model unlikely for these end points. The above analysis of dioxin toxicity suggests that the mechanisms by which the AHR mediates adaptive metabolic and toxic responses both require the ARNT protein. These data are consistent with a model where hepatotoxicity and thymic involution are dependent on AHR·ARNT dimerization. Although not formally addressed in this study, the most obvious possibility is that toxicity is dependent upon AHR·ARNT-mediated transcription. This idea is supported by our previous observation that mice with a mutation in the DNA binding domain of AHR are resistant to these same toxic end points (15Bunger M.K. Moran S.M. Glover E.

Another important observation that must be considered in the development of any model of toxicity is the observation that EROD activity was similar in ARNT hypomorphs when compared with wild-type mice. This result suggests that the induced P450 activity of these tissues is independent of the toxic end points measured in this study. This conclusion can be supported or refuted by direct examination of the corresponding Cyp null models developed by other laboratories (33Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Matlib R.S. Childs N.L. Shertzer H.G.

The Role of ARNT in AHR-mediated Development—Examination of the ARNT hypomorph also provides insight into the mechanism by which the AHR regulates liver development and vascular maturation. Given that ARNT is the common heterodimeric partner to the AHR, we set out to test the idea that the AHR·ARNT partnership is important in development. Based upon their highly reproducible nature, we focused on DV closure and regulation of adult liver size as relevant developmental end points. Similar to the toxicity models described above, a number models exist that could explain the mechanism by which the AHR might act during development in an ARNT-independent manner. It is our working hypothesis that the AHR·ARNT heterodimer functions in a manner that is mechanistically similar to its role in adaptive metabolism and toxicity. Based on this model, we predict that ARNT hypomorphs would display liver phenotypes that mirror those seen in the Ahr null mice. Upon investigation of the vascularity of livers from ARNT hypomorphs, we observed a 70% incidence of patent DV, as well as a reduced liver size in the corresponding animals (Figs. 3 and 4). A patent DV is a rare occurrence in both humans and rodents. Until now, the only previous documentation of a patent DV in adult mice was reported for the Ahr nulls (8Lahvis G.P. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E. Bentz M. Southard J. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10442-10447Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The observation that the ARNT hypomorph phenotypically mimics the Ahr null is a strong indication of genetic cooperativity between these two loci. That is, mutations in either partner of this heterodimeric transcription factor result in an identical vascular phenotype. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that AHR and ARNT are acting cooperatively in the resolution of the DV and that ARNT is an essential component of the developmental pathway of AHR signal transduction. Given that ARNT is a partner to multiple PAS proteins, coupled with our evidence that ARNT is involved in all aspects of AHR biology, it is interesting to consider the relative requirements of ARNT for each pathway. In this regard, generation of the ARNT hypomorph has revealed pathway-dependent thresholds of this protein for different signaling outcomes. Under the conditions of reduced ARNT protein generated by this hypomorph, the HIF-dependent embryonic lethality is bypassed, and the adaptive up-regulation of P450s is preserved. In contrast, under these limiting conditions, there is significant failure in DV closure, and dioxin-induced thymic involution and hepatotoxicity is attenuated. Taken in sum, these observations suggest a different quantitative requirement for the ARNT protein partnership by different biological pathways. In conclusion, we have provided evidence to demonstrate that a hypomorphic Arntfxneo allele can be generated by insertion of the neomycin gene adjacent to exon 6 of the Arnt locus. The observation that ARNT expression in this mouse model is globally down-regulated allowed us to investigate the role of this protein in those aspects of its biology requiring AHR. In future experiments, this animal model should have equal power to elucidate hypoxia signal transduction. Using this model, we have provided evidence that both the toxic and the developmental pathways of AHR signal transduction depend on cooperation with ARNT and imply a direct role for dimerization in these processes. This AHR·ARNT cooperativity appears to be an essential factor for both the toxic end points of dioxin exposure as well as the AHR-dependent closure of the DV.

To provide a basis for the rational design of novel antiviral agents, the main replication enzyme in Norwalk virus, the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), has been expressed in an enzymatically active form, and its structure has been crystallographically determined both in the presence and absence of divalent metal cations. Although the overall fold of the enzyme is similar to that seen previously in the RdRP from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, the carboxyl terminus, surprisingly, is located in the active site cleft in five independent copies of the protein in three distinct crystal forms. The location of this carboxyl-terminal segment appears to interfere with the binding of double-stranded RNA in the active site cleft and may play a role in the initiation of RNA synthesis or mediate interactions with accessory replication proteins.

Recent studies have shown that members of the Norovirus genus within the Caliciviridae family are now considered one of the most common causes of outbreaks and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in individuals of all ages worldwide (1Koopmans M. Duizer E. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2004; 90: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). These pathogens have a positive-strand RNA genome and life cycle that are similar in many respects to a group of evolutionarily related viruses responsible for important human diseases such as polio, hepatitis C, dengue, yellow fever, viral encephalitis (West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus), and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Many of these viruses are threats to public health, because they are highly infectious and can cause serious illnesses, in some cases leading to death. The limitations of vaccination and lack of effective antiviral chemotherapeutics for many of these diseases underline the urgency of understanding positive-stranded RNA viruses at a deeper, molecular level to allow for the development of novel treatments. Replication of the genome in all positive-strand RNA viruses is critically dependent on the activity of a virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 1The abbreviations used are: RdRP, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; HCV, hepatitis C virus; PV, polio virus; RHDV, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus; NV, Norwalk virus; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: RdRP, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; HCV, hepatitis C virus; PV, polio virus; RHDV, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus; NV, Norwalk virus; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Here, we report the novel structure of an RdRP from a genogroup II Norwalk virus (NV) isolate, Ast6139/01/Sp, in a metal-free form at 2.17 Å resolution, as well as in a metal-bound form at 2.95 Å resolution. Although the arrangement of secondary structural elements and key catalytic motifs is similar to those seen in the RHDV enzyme as well as other RdRPs from positive-strand RNA viruses, dramatic structural differences, especially in the carboxyl-terminal region, suggest novel functional adaptations important for viral replication. A small metal-dependent conformational change can also be seen when comparing the structure of the metal-free NV RdRP in two crystal forms with the structure of the metal-bound enzyme in a third crystal form. These structures represent the first three-dimensional structures of a Norovirus enzyme and provide the basis for the structure-based design of antiviral therapeutics against an important group of human pathogens. Construction of the RdRP Expression Vector—The NV RdRP coding region was amplified by PCR using a cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number AJ583672) from the Spanish NV isolate Ast6139/01/Sp and the specific primers NVpol5B ggatccgacagtaagggaacatactg and NVpol3E gaattctcattcgacgccatcttcattc, which also added BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme recognition sequences (underlined residues) at both ends of the amplified region. The resulting fragment was first ligated to pGEM-T vector (Promega), and then, after digestion with the restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI, the 1.5-kb fragment containing the RdRP gene was purified and inserted into BamHI-EcoRI-digested, alkaline phosphatase-treated pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) to generate the recombinant expression vector pGEX-NV-3D. This recombinant plasmid was designed to produce the NV RdRP as a fusion protein with Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase at the amino terminus. Protein Expression and Purification—Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue transformed with pGEX-NV-3D were diluted 1:250 in 500 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (50 μg ml-1). The cultures were incubated at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5, and isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added up to 200 μm. After 2 h of growth at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was suspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA (Buffer 1). The suspension was sonicated, and the supernatant, recovered after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor, was loaded onto a 5-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer 1. The eluate was retained and reapplied to the column. Following the absorption step, the column was washed five times with 5 ml of Buffer 1. After the final wash, the gel slurry was suspended in 400 μl of Buffer 1 containing 480 ng of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. NV RdRP was recovered from the eluate and further purified by ion exchange chromatography using a Vivapure Q Maxi H spin column (Vivascience). The purified protein was eluted with a step gradient of Buffer 1 containing 200, 250, and 300 mm NaCl. The salt and buffer concentration were lowered to 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, by dilution, and the protein was concentrated to 7 mg/ml using an Ultrafree-15 BioMax 10-kDa centrifugal spin filter (Millipore). Approximately 3-4 mg of purified protein was obtained from 1 liter of bacterial cell culture. Preparation of Synthetic NV Heteropolymeric RNA—A cDNA clone containing the NV Ast6139/01/Sp 3′ sequence was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide primers NV5 (taatacgactcactatagtagctcacactggcccg) and NVdT3 (tttttttttttttttttaaagacactaaag). The 1013-bp PCR product containing a minimal T7 RNA polymerase promoter (underlined residues) was phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water prior to its in vitro transcription using the large scale RNA production system Ribomax (Promega). Enzymatic Assays—RdRP activity was assayed in 50-μl samples containing 4 μg of the purified enzyme, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 μm ATP, 10 μm GTP, 10 μm CTP, 5 μm UTP, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 50 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), 25 μmol (10 μCi) of [α32-P]UTP, 60 nm synthetic NV heteropolymeric RNA, and 0.1-5 mm magnesium acetate. After incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, the reaction mixture was phenol-chloroform-extracted and then ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and 20 μg of carrier tRNA. The sediments were dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer, loaded onto 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and electrophoresed at 60-70 V. The gels were then dried and the in vitro32P-labeled RNA products detected by autoradiography. Crystallization—Crystals were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 2 μl of NV polymerase (7 mg/ml) and 2 μl of 24% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100-200 mm ammonium sulfate, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 15% (w/v) glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS, and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. At least two different crystal forms (space groups C2221 and P1) with similar morphologies grew to a maximum size of ∼0.2 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm after 2-3 weeks. Another crystal form (space group P212121) could be grown to a size of 0.15 × 0.075 × 0.05 mm under similar conditions, with the following modifications: 100 mm ammonium sulfate and 20 mm magnesium sulfate. Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Data were measured on flash-frozen crystals at 105 K by transferring crystals directly from the mother liquor into a nitrogen gas stream. Data were measured from a MAR 345 detector using radiation from a rotating anode generator (Rigaku RU-H3R and Osmic confocal optics). Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (9Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Intensities were converted to amplitudes using TRUNCATE (10Collaborative Computing Project No 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The solvent content of the centered orthorhombic crystals was calculated to be 53% (Vm = 2.66) if one copy of NV polymerase was present in the asymmetric unit. The structure of RHDV polymerase (Protein Data Bank code 1KHV), with all side chains and temperature factors retained, was used as the search model for molecular replacement calculations. Molecular replacement calculations were carried out using BEAST (11Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The cross-rotation and translation functions both gave a single prominent solution (log-likelihood scores of 15.8 and 25.6, respectively). The crystal packing seemed reasonable, but the R-factor following rigid-body refinement was poor (r = 0.53, resolution = 20-2.8 Å). Nevertheless, several rounds of simulated annealing refinement using the program CNS (12Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and manual model building using Xfit (14McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) allowed for the construction of a model with improved statistics (r = 0.38, Rfree = 0.43, resolution = 20-2.3 Å). At this point, the triclinic crystal form with two copies in the asymmetric unit was discovered. This crystal yielded a stronger and more isotropic diffraction pattern. Molecular replacement calculations were carried out using the model that had been partially refined in the centered orthorhombic crystal form. Two clear solutions appeared in both the rotation and translation functions, and the initial electron density map was significantly clearer than for the centered orthorhombic crystal form. Averaging and density modification using RESOLVE further improved electron density maps, and the structures of both copies in the asymmetric unit were built using Xfit and refined using REFMAC (15Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) (translation-libration-screw rotation parameters for rigid bodies, atomic positions, and temperature factors). Following the completion of refinement, the model of the protein was superimposed onto the partially refined model in the centered orthorhombic crystal form, and refinement was completed on this crystal form as well. Molecular replacement calculations using the fully refined model from the triclinic crystal form also gave two very clear solutions for the primitive orthorhombic crystal form grown in the presence of 20 mm magnesium sulfate. This structure was rebuilt and refined as described above. Because of the lower resolution limit of these data, however, loose restraints to maintain noncrystallographic symmetry were applied. The final models in all three crystal forms include residues 6-507, with the five amino-terminal residues and three carboxyl-terminal residues apparently disordered in all five independent copies. 91.8% of the residues lie in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues are in disallowed regions (regions defined by PROCHECK (16Morris A.L.

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity associated with the purified recombinant protein was assayed using a synthetic RNA template derived from a cDNA of the 3′ region of the genome of the Ast6139/01/Sp isolate including a poly(A) tail of 17 residues. The major product was about 2 kb in size, roughly twice the size of the RNA template used. The doubling in size relative to the template suggests a fold-back synthesis reaction similar to that seen previously in RHDV (26López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PV (27Young D.C. Tuschall D.M. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 256-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hey T.D. Richards O.C.

Overall Structure of NV RdRP—The crystal structure of NV RdRP has been determined in three different crystal forms using the molecular replacement method starting with RHDV RdRP (7Ng K.K.

Although all three crystal forms were grown under similar conditions with polyethylene glycol 8000 as the precipitant, the molecular packing and space group symmetry differ significantly in the three crystal forms (Table I). Two crystal forms were grown in the absence of divalent metal ions, and the third crystal form was grown in the presence of 20 mm magnesium sulfate. The overall structure of NV RdRP can be described using an analogy to a right hand, which is commonly done for a wide range of nucleic acid polymerases (Fig. 1). In addition to the fingers, palm, and thumb domains common to all polymerases, NV RdRP has an additional amino-terminal domain bridging the fingers and thumb domains, as seen in all other RdRPs of known three-dimensional structure (8Bruenn J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). All residues are defined by electron density with the exception of residues 1-5 at the amino terminus and residues 508-510 at the carboxyl terminus. The carboxyl-terminal region is of particular importance, as discussed below, and it is significant to note that the last three residues are disordered in all three crystal forms. The availability of three crystal forms of NV RdRP reveals five independent copies in distinct crystal packing environments. The largest crystal contact interface in each of the three crystal forms is formed between the “top” faces (when viewed in the standard orientation facing the active site cleft, as in Fig. 1A) of molecules related by a crystallographic (C2221 and P212121 crystal forms) or noncrystallographic (P1 crystal form) 2-fold rotation axis. The buried surface areas of these interfaces are 1525, 1863, and 2187 Å2 for the P1, C2221, and P212121 crystal forms, respectively, indicating an extensive contact surface similar in size to functionally important oligomerization surfaces (32Ponstingl H. Henrick K. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 2000; 41: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A common feature of all three interfaces is a patch of hydrophobic residues consisting of Trp-29, Pro-421, Met-430, and Ile-431, residues fairly well conserved in the noroviruses but not well conserved in other caliciviruses. It is important to note that this hydrophobic patch and interface is not found in the RHDV RdRP crystal structure, and this interface differs from the oligomerization interfaces proposed to be of functional importance in HCV (33Qin W.

Although the functional importance of the resulting NV RdRP dimers is not clear from the structure, the location of this hydrophobic patch near the top of the active site cleft suggests that protein-protein interactions important for RNA binding or RNA synthesis may be mediated by this contact surface. Structural Comparisons with RHDV RdRP and Conformational Variability—The overall fold of the RdRP enzymes from RHDV and NV is quite similar, although there are many regions of local structural variation. 393 Cα atoms can be superimposed (3.8 Å cutoff) with a root mean squared difference of 1.7 Å (Fig. 1D). A structure-based sequence alignment identifies 118 amino acid residue identities or an overall sequence identity of 24% between the two proteins. The key motifs identified by a combination of sequence and structural analysis in RdRPs are well conserved in both the RHDV and NV structures, which is consistent with the importance of these regions in the structural stability and function of RdRPs (8Bruenn J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Three copies of metal-free NV RdRP have been modeled and refined to 2.17 and 2.3 Å resolution in two different crystal forms. The root mean squared difference of 502 Cα pairs between any two of these structures lies between 0.46 and 0.64 Å. In comparison, the two copies of the magnesium-bound form of the enzyme refined to 2.95 Å resolution yield root mean squared differences of between 0.64 and 0.90 Å when compared with the structures of the metal-free enzyme. The central core of the enzyme, consisting of the central portion of the palm domain and adjacent regions of the fingers and thumb domains, displays the smallest degree of conformational variability. Peripheral regions including the amino-terminal region, several loops in the fingers and palm domains, and portions of the thumb domain show the largest amount of conformational variability. Particularly notable is the conformational variability seen in residues 371-378 of the loop adjacent to the divalent metal cation binding sites. This loop likely lies along the path taken by NTPs and pyrophosphate ions entering and leaving the active site, and conformational variability in this region may be of functional importance. Conformational flexibility appears to be a common feature of many polymerases, and a large body of evidence supports the presence of multiple conformational states in RHDV (7Ng K.K. Cherney M.M.

In both copies of magnesium-bound NV RdRP found in the asymmetric unit, a single magnesium ion is coordinated to one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp-344 and is near but not coordinated to the carboxylate group of Asp-242. This weak coordination scheme appears similar to that seen in the “open” metal-bound form of RHDV RdRP (7Ng K.K. Cherney M.M. Vazquez A.L. Machin A. Alonso J.M. Parra F. James M.N. J. Biol.

It should be noted that this form is more similar to metal-free NV RdRP than the “closed” metal-bound form of RHDV RdRP, which adopts the conformation likely appropriate for facilitating the phosphoryl transfer reaction during RNA synthesis (7Ng K.K.

Activation of the ERK MAPK pathway is also required for positive selection. Previous work has shown that Vav1 transduces T cell receptor (TCR) signals leading to an intracellular calcium flux. We now show that in double positive thymocytes Vav1 is required for TCR-induced activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 kinases via a pathway involving the Ras GTPase, and B-Raf, MEK1, and MEK2 kinases. Furthermore, we show that Vav1 transduces TCR signals to Ras by controlling the membrane recruitment of two guanine nucleotide exchange factors. First, Vav1 transduces signals via phospholipase Cγ1 leading to the membrane recruitment of RasGRP1. Second, Vav1 is required for recruitment of Sos1 and -2 to the transmembrane adapter protein LAT. Finally, we show that Vav1 is required for TCR-induced LAT phosphorylation, a key event for the activation of both phospholipase Cγ1 and Sos1/2. We propose that reduced LAT phosphorylation is the key reason for defective TCR-induced calcium flux and ERK activation in Vav1-deficient cells.

The precise outcome of these selection events is determined by signals generated following interactions between the TCR on DP thymocytes and peptides presented by MHC class I and class II molecules on thymic stromal cells (1Starr T.K. Jameson S.C. Hogquist K.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 139-176Google Scholar). Cells whose TCR binds with no or low avidity to peptide-MHC complexes undergo apoptosis in a process termed death by neglect. Cells bearing a TCR with moderate avidity for a peptide-MHC complex undergo positive selection and differentiate into mature CD4+CD8– or CD4–CD8+ single positive thymocytes, and eventually emigrate to the periphery as mature CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Finally, DP thymocytes whose TCR binds with high avidity to peptide/MHC undergo negative selection and are eliminated by apoptosis. Much interest has focused on elucidating the signal transduction pathways that regulate positive and negative selection, respectively. Vav1 is a 95-kDa cytoplasmic protein that is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated following TCR stimulation (2Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M. Nature. 1992; 356: 68-71Google Scholar, 3Margolis B. Hu P. Katzav S. Li W. Oliver J.M. Ullrich A. Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that Vav1 contained a number of domains typical of signal transducing proteins (4Boguski M.S. Bairoch A. Attwood T.K. Michaels G.S. Nature. 1992; 358: 113Google Scholar, 5Turner M. Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 476-486Google Scholar). In particular, Vav1 has a Dbl homology domain that is characteristic of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho family GTPases. Vav1 has been shown to function as a GEF for Rac1, Rac2, and RhoG and to be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (6Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R.

The importance of Vav1 in TCR signaling was demonstrated by defective TCR-induced interleukin-2 secretion and proliferation in Vav1-deficient T cells (9Tarakhovsky A. Turner M. Schaal S. Mee P.J.

Zmuidzinas A. Gardner S. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Guidos C. Nature. 1995; 374: 474-477Google Scholar). Furthermore, Vav1 was shown to be required for both positive and negative selection in DP thymocytes (12Turner M. Mee P.J. Walters A. Quinn M.E. Mellor A.L. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 451-460Google Scholar, 13Kong Y.Y. Fischer K.D. Bachmann M.F. Mariathasan S. Kozieradzki I. Nghiem M.P. Bouchard D. Bernstein A. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2099-2111Google Scholar). Analysis of signaling pathways showed that in CD4+ T cells, Vav1 transduced TCR signals to the induction of an intracellular calcium flux and to the activation of NF-κB and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade (14Costello P.S. Walters A.E. Mee P.J. Turner M. Reynolds L.F. Prisco A. Sarner N. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3035-3040Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that in DP thymocytes Vav1 transduces TCR signals to an intracellular calcium flux by regulating the activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent and -independent pathways (15Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Google Scholar). In particular we showed that Vav1 controls the activation of Tec family kinases such as Itk that may directly phosphorylate and activate PLCγ1. In contrast, the mechanism by which Vav1 transduces TCR signals to the ERK MAPK pathway remains unclear. The activation of ERK MAPK in many cell types, including T cells, is believed to be under the control of the Ras GTPase. Activation of Ras leads in turn to the activation of a cascade consisting of the Raf, MEK, and ERK kinases. A number of studies have postulated that the ERK MAPK cascade is important in positive selection of DP thymocytes. Expression of dominant negative forms of H-Ras, Raf-1, or MEK1 or gene targeting of ERK1 leads to defective positive but not negative selection (16Aberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Google Scholar, 17Swan K.A. Aberola-Ila J. Gross J.A. Appleby M.W. Forbush K.A. Thomas J.F. Perlmutter R.M.

Science. 1999; 286: 1374-1377Google Scholar). However, this has been disputed by a more recent study (21Bommhardt U. Scheuring Y. Bickel C. Zamoyska R. Hunig T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2326-2337Google Scholar) reporting defective negative selection in thymocytes treated with a MEK inhibitor. Nonetheless, an understanding of how TCR signaling in DP thymocytes results in ERK activation would be an important contribution to elucidating how TCR signals lead to positive and negative selection. In this study, we examine how Vav1 transduces TCR signals in DP thymocytes to the activation of the ERK MAPK cascade, and we show that Vav1 is required for the activation of the Ras GTPase and its downstream ERK MAPK pathway. Vav1 function is shown to be required for TCR regulation of two distinct GEFs for Ras. We demonstrate first that Vav1 transduces signals via PLCγ1 to the activation of RasGRP1, and second that it controls recruitment of Sos1 and Sos2 to the membrane-associated adapter protein LAT. Finally, we show that Vav1 is required for TCR-induced phosphorylation of LAT on tyrosine residues that play important roles in the activation of both PLCγ1 and Sos1 and -2.

For TCR stimulation, cells were preincubated with the hamster anti-mouse CD3ϵ monoclonal antibody (2C11; 10 μg/ml; Pharmingen) on ice for 30 min, washed, and then incubated in air-buffered IMDM for 5 min at 37 °C prior to cross-linking of the antibodies with goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG antiserum (75 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch). For stimulations with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (10 ng/ml) or ionomycin (1 μg/ml), cells were not pretreated with anti-CD3ϵ. For studies with inhibitors, thymocytes were preincubated with the inhibitors at 37 °C for 30 min prior to standing on ice for 10 min. Preincubation with anti-CD3ϵ on ice then proceeded as above, still in the presence of inhibitor. Subsequent cross-linking of anti-CD3ϵ also occurred in the presence of inhibitor. For control samples where no inhibitor was used, an equivalent volume of Me2SO carrier was added. The following inhibitors were used: U73122 (1 μm) and BAPTA-AM (15 μm) (both from Calbiochem). Immunoblotting of Total Cell Lysates—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Cells were typically stimulated at 1–2 × 108 cells/ml in air-buffered IMDM for the specified times, and stimulation was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× RIPA lysis buffer (2% Igepal CA-630, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1:50 (v/v) mammalian cell protease inhibitor mixture (P8340; Sigma)). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,340 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. An equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated at 95 °C for 3 min. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out by standard procedures. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-phospho-ERK (E4), anti-RasGRP1, anti-B-Raf, anti-Pak1, anti-Grb2, anti-Sos1, and anti-Sos2 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-MEK1/2, anti-MEK1/2, anti-phosphoserine 144-Pak1, anti-phosphoserine199/204-Pak1, anti-phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-phosphothreonine 538-PKCθ, and anti-phosphotyrosine 171-human LAT (equivalent to pY175 murine LAT; all from Cell Signaling Technology); anti-Ras (Ras10), anti-phosphotyrosine 191-human LAT (equivalent to pY195 murine LAT), and anti-phosphotyrosine 226-human LAT (equivalent to pY235 murine LAT; all from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-PKCθ-horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Laboratories), anti-ERK2 (gift from C. Marshall, London), anti-LAT (gift from M. Turner, Babraham Institute), anti-phospho-PKD, and anti-PKD (gifts from D. Cantrell, Dundee, Scotland, UK). Antibody binding was revealed with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for mouse monoclonal antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology) or protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) for rabbit polyclonal antibody. B-Raf Kinase Assay—Stimulated cell suspensions were lysed in an equal volume of 2× B-Raf Buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1:50 (v/v) mammalian cell protease inhibitor mixture) for 15 min at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation at 15,340 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were incubated with anti-B-Raf antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubation for an additional hour at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1× B-Raf Buffer, once with Kinase Buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), resuspended in 20 μl of Kinase Buffer containing 50 μm ATP, 4 μg/ml GST-MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The beads were centrifuged briefly, and 15 μl of supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube, to which a further 5 μl of Kinase Buffer was added, containing 20 μg/ml GST-ERK (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, 10 μl of Kinase Buffer containing 400 μg/ml GST-Elk1 (NEB) was added, and the reactions were incubated for a further 20 min at 30 °C and terminated by adding 35 μl of 2× Laemmli Buffer and heating the samples for 5 min at 95 °C. To control for immunoprecipitation, beads containing B-Raf immune complexes were retained, and bound protein was eluted by incubating in 2× Laemmli Buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. The kinase assay samples and B-Raf immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting for p-Elk1 and B-Raf, respectively. The quantity of p-Elk1 served as a readout of B-Raf kinase activity. Inhibition of Pak1—Plasmid pTAT-PID was constructed by inserting residues 83–149 of Pak1 into KpnI/EcoRI sites of the vector pTAT-HA (23Vocero-Akbani A. Lissy N.A. Dowdy S.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 508-521Google Scholar). Clones were verified by restriction analyses and confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)/pLysS and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside by standard methods. The His-tagged protein was purified under denaturing conditions using a His Trap kit (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer with 8.0 m urea as the denaturant. The adsorbed protein was refolded directly on the column by washing the column with wash buffer lacking urea. The protein was eluted with wash buffer containing 500 mm imidazole, and the eluate was then passed over a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol. Small aliquots of the PD-10 eluate were flash-frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C. To inhibit Pak1, thymocytes were incubated with Tat-PID fusion protein (20 μg/ml) for 2.5 h at 37 °C. The cells were then coated with anti-CD3ϵ at 4 °C and stimulated by cross-linking with goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG as described earlier. The cells were maintained in the presence of Tat-PID throughout the stimulation. Ras Activation Assay—Stimulated cells were lysed in 2% Triton X-100, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1:50 (v/v) mammalian cell protease inhibitor mixture, and cleared by centrifugation at 15,340 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of lysates were set aside to allow quantitation of total Ras by immunoblotting. The remainder of the lysates was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with beads coated with a fusion protein (GST-Raf1-RBD) consisting of GST fused to the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Beads were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and bound protein was eluted for 15 min with 2× Laemmli sample buffer that had been preheated to 95 °C and analyzed by immunoblotting for Ras. Cell Fractionation—Stimulated thymocytes were centrifuged at 15,340 × g for 10 s at 4 °C, resuspended in Hypotonic Buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1:100 (v/v) mammalian cell protease inhibitor mixture), and incubated 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed using 20 strokes of an Eppendorf micropestle, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was adjusted to a final concentration of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet (P100 fraction) was gently washed in Hypotonic Buffer and resuspended in 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1:100 (v/v) mammalian cell protease inhibitor mixture. After 2 h on ice, residual insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,340 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated at 95 °C for 3 min. Immunoprecipitation of Grb2—Stimulated thymocytes were lysed in 2× BOG Buffer (2% β-d-octyl glucopyranoside, 2% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1:50 (v/v) mammalian cell protease inhibitor mixture), incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and cleared by centrifugation at 15,340 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Anti-Grb2 antibody was added, and the lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by protein A-Sepharose and incubation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1× BOG buffer, and bound proteins were eluted using 2× Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by immunoblotting. Vav1 Is Required for TCR-induced Activation of Ras, B-Raf, MEK, and ERK—To investigate the mechanism by which Vav1 might transduce signals to the Ras/ERK pathway in DP thymocytes, we made use of our previously described genetic system which allows access to a uniform population of DP thymocytes (15Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Google Scholar, 22Smyth L.A. Williams O. Huby R.D. Norton T. Acuto O. Ley S.C. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8193-8198Google Scholar). The system consists of the F5 TCR transgene that expresses a class I-restricted TCR specific for a peptide from influenza nuclear protein presented by H-2Db on a background deficient in Rag-1 (Rag-1–/–) and MHC class I (β2m–/–). In the resultant F5Rag-1–/–β2m–/– mice, the absence of class I molecules causes a complete block in positive selection and thus all the F5 TCR-expressing thymocytes are blocked at the DP stage, just prior to positive (or negative) selection. Thymocytes from these mice were compared directly to thymocytes from Vav1–/–F5Rag-1–/–β2m–/– mice, which were also developmentally arrested at the DP stage (15Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Google Scholar). In both strains of mice, >90% of the thymocytes were DP cells. Thymocytes from the two strains are referred to hereafter as Vav1+/+ and Vav1–/–, respectively. Initially, we asked whether Vav1 was required for TCR-induced ERK activation in DP thymocytes, as we had previously found in Vav1–/– CD4+ T cells (14Costello P.S. Walters A.E. Mee P.J. Turner M. Reynolds L.F. Prisco A. Sarner N. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3035-3040Google Scholar). TCR stimulation leads to a clear increase in an activating phosphorylation on ERK1 and ERK2 in Vav1+/+ thymocytes, which was substantially reduced in Vav1–/– cells (Fig. 1A). Control blots demonstrated equivalent ERK2 expression in Vav1+/+ and Vav1–/– cell lysates. Because ERK1 and -2 are phosphorylated and activated by the MEK kinases, we investigated the phosphorylation of MEK1 and MEK2 on regulatory serines in their activation loops (24Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Google Scholar). Once again, Vav1+/+ thymocytes showed a clear induction of MEK1 and MEK2 phosphorylation following TCR stimulation, which was greatly reduced in Vav1–/– cells, although total levels of MEK1 and -2 remained unchanged (Fig. 1B). It is therefore likely that this defective MEK phosphorylation (and hence activation) is the cause of the failure of ERK phosphorylation in Vav1–/– cells. Consistent with this, treatment of wild-type DP thymocytes with PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK activation, blocked TCR-induced ERK phosphorylation (not shown). MEK1 and -2 are in turn activated by phosphorylation catalyzed by Raf family kinases (24Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Google Scholar). Initially we examined the Raf-1 kinase but were unable to detect any TCR-induced increase in Raf-1 kinase activity in wild-type thymocytes (not shown). In contrast, using a linked MEK/ERK assay we readily detected TCR-induced activation of the B-Raf kinase in Vav1+/+ DP thymocytes, which was almost absent in Vav1–/– cells (Fig. 1C). Finally, we examined the activation of Ras by measuring levels of Ras-GTP (25Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Google Scholar). Whereas TCR stimulation resulted in an increase in Ras activation in Vav1+/+ DP thymocytes, this was greatly reduced in Vav1–/– cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together our results show that Vav1 is required for normal TCR-induced activation of Ras, B-Raf, MEK, and ERK in DP thymocytes. TCR-induced Activation of Pak1 Is Not Required for ERK Activation—Although it seems likely that the defective activation of ERK in Vav1–/– cells is because of a failure to activate Ras, we considered whether Vav1 may transduce signals to the ERK pathway via B-Raf or MEK, independently of Ras activation. One such possibility could be through the Pak kinases, because Pak1 had been shown to phosphorylate MEK1 and hence enhance its association with either Raf-1 (26Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Google Scholar) or ERK2 (27Eblen S.T. Slack J.K. Weber M.J. Catling A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6023-6033Google Scholar), whereas Pak2 has been reported to phosphorylate and thus enhance the activation of Raf-1 (28King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Google Scholar). Because Vav1 is a GEF for Rac1 and Rac2 GTPases, which in turn activate Pak kinases, we hypothesized that Vav1 may transduce signals to the ERK pathway via Rac and Pak. We had shown previously (15Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Google Scholar) that TCR-induced Rac1 activation is impaired in Vav1–/– DP thymocytes. Consistent with this, TCR-induced phosphorylation of Pak1 on its autophosphorylation sites (serines 144, 199, and 204) (29Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Google Scholar) was greatly reduced in Vav1–/– cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that its activation is also defective. Similar studies showed no detectable TCR-induced phosphorylation of Pak2 in wild-type or mutant cells (not shown). To evaluate directly the contribution of Pak kinases to TCR-induced ERK activation, we made use of a fusion protein Tat-PID, consisting of the Pak inhibitory domain (PID) of Pak1 fused to a peptide from the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein that can direct the transduction of proteins across plasma membranes (30Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2003; 4: 97-104Google Scholar). Incubation of Vav1+/+ DP thymocytes with Tat-PID, resulted in an inhibition of TCR-induced Pak1 phosphorylation and, by inference, its activation (Fig. 2B). In contrast, treatment of cells with Tat-PID had no effect on TCR-induced ERK activation (Fig. 2B). We conclude that in DP thymocytes Pak1 does not transduce TCR signals to the ERK pathway. Because Pak kinases have also been implicated in the regulation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 MAP kinase pathways (31Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Google Scholar, 32Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Google Scholar, 33Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Google Scholar), we examined whether these might be defective in Vav1-deficient DP thymocytes. Although we were unable to detect TCR-induced activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in Vav1+/+ DP thymocytes (not shown), we detected a small increase in p38 activation, as measured by phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, Vav1–/– thymocytes showed hyperactivation of TCR-induced p38 phosphorylation. The reasons for this hyperactivation are unknown, but our results suggest that in DP thymocytes, Pak1 is not a positive regulator of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Vav1 Transduces TCR Signals to Ras and ERK via PLC and DAG—TCR-induced activation of Ras within T cells is thought to be catalyzed by the GEFs RasGRP1 and Sos1 and -2. RasGRP1 is a Ras GEF whose translocation to the plasma membrane, and hence activation, is regulated by DAG, a second messenger produced by the PLC-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (34Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Google Scholar, 35Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Google Scholar). Thymocytes from RasGRP1-deficient mice are defective in TCR-induced ERK phosphorylation, suggesting that RasGRP1 is an important Ras activator downstream of the TCR and PLC (36Dower N.A. Stang S.L. Bottorff D.A. Ebinu J.O. Dickie P. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 317-321Google Scholar). Sos1 and Sos2 are Ras GEFs that are recruited to the plasma membrane of T cells through the adapter protein Grb2, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues on LAT, a transmembrane adapter protein that is rapidly phosphorylated following TCR stimulation (37Buday L. Egan S.E. Rodriguez Viciana P. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Google Scholar, 38Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell.

Berg S.F. Ryan J.C. Tasken K. Imboden J.B. Vaage J.T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1157-1161Google Scholar). In view of the defective TCR-induced activation of PLCγ1 in Vav1-deficient thymocytes (15Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Google Scholar), it was reasonable to hypothesize that the defective Ras and ERK activation might be caused by a failure to activate RasGRP1. To evaluate this, we initially asked whether in DP thymocytes PLC is required to transduce TCR signals to the Ras/ERK pathway by examining the effects on ERK and Ras activation of U73122, a PLC inhibitor. Consistent with previous reports in the human Jurkat T cell line (41Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L. Teixeira C. Bottorff D.A. Hooton J. Blumberg P.M. Barry M. Bleakley R.C. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 3199-3203Google Scholar), both the phosphorylation of ERK and the activation of Ras were reduced by treatment with U73122 to a level similar to that observed in Vav1–/– cells (Fig. 3, A and B). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in turn causes the intracellular calcium flux. We performed a number of experiments to distinguish which of these second messengers transduces TCR signals to the Ras/ERK pathway in DP thymocytes. In contrast to the effects of U73122, treatment of wild-type DP thymocytes with BAPTA, which blocks the intracellular calcium flux by chelating Ca2+, had no effect on TCR-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, ionomycin, which induces a calcium flux, was unable to restore ERK phosphorylation in Vav1–/– cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast, treatment of Vav1–/– cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, a DAG analog, resulted in phosphorylation of ERK, presumably by activating RasGRP1 and hence Ras, B-Raf, and MEK (Fig. 3D). Taken together these experiments show that in DP thymocytes TCR signals are transduced to the Ras/ERK pathway via PLC and DAG and that Vav1 may contribute to this pathway by controlling PLC activation and DAG production. Defective TCR-induced DAG Production in Vav1-deficient Cells—To verify that Vav1 was required for TCR-induced DAG production, we examined the activation of protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), an enzyme that is activated by DAG (42Mellor H.

The canonical model for GRK-dependent receptor desensitization involves GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation to promote the binding of arrestin proteins that sterically block receptor coupling to G proteins. However, GRK-mediated desensitization, in the absence of phosphorylation and arrestin binding, has been reported for metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) and γ-aminobutyric acid B receptors. Here we show that GRK2 mutants impaired in Gαq/11 binding (R106A, D110A, and M114A), bind effectively to mGluR1a, but do not mediate mGluR1a adaptation. Gαq/11 is immunoprecipitated as a complex with mGluR1a in the absence of agonist, and either agonist treatment or GRK2 overexpression promotes the dissociation of the receptor/Gαq/11 complex. However, these mGluR1a/Gαq/11 interactions are not antagonized by the overexpression of either GRK2 mutants defective in Gαq/11 binding or RGS4. We have also identified a GRK2-D527A mutant that binds Gαq/11 in an AlF4--dependent manner but is unable to either bind mGluR1a or attenuate mGluR1a signaling. We conclude that the mechanism underlying GRK2 phosphorylation-independent attenuation of mGluR1a signaling is RH domain-dependent, requiring the binding of GRK2 to both Gαq/11 and mGluR1a. This serves to coordinate GRK2 interactions with Gαq/11 and to disrupt receptor/Gαq/11 complexes.

The GRK2 crystal structure confirms that GRK2 is composed of three functional domains: a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) homology (RH) domain, a protein kinase domain, and a carboxyl-terminal Gβγ-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (8Siderovski D.P.

The GRK2 RH domain consists of two discontinuous segments, the first of which forms the α-helical bundles characteristic of RGS proteins (8Siderovski D.P. Hessel A. Chung S. Mak T.W. Tyers M. Curr.

The GRK2 and GRK3 RH domains specifically interact with Gαq/11 family proteins in an AlF4--dependent manner and may function as weak GTPase activating proteins for Gαq/11 (10Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.F. Benovic J.F. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, GRK2 and GRK3 may function as bifunctional regulators of GPCR signaling by modulating both receptor and G protein activity, but the precise mechanism by which this is achieved is not known.Phosphorylation-independent GRK-mediated desensitization has been reported for both the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) and the γ-aminobutyric acid, type B (GABA)B receptor; for these receptors, it involves an atypical arrestin-independent mechanism (11Dale L.B.

Mutation of several amino acid residues: Arg-106, Asn-110, and Met-114 to alanine residues (R106A, D110A, and M114A), within the α5 helix of the GRK2 RH domain prevents GRK2 binding to Gαq/11 (15Sterne-Marr R.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that GRK2 mutants impaired in Gαq/11 binding are unable to antagonize both basal and agonist-stimulated mGluR1a signaling. We find that Gαq/11 is immunoprecipitated as a complex with mGluR1a in the absence of agonist, and both agonist treatment and GRK2 overexpression promote the dissociation of this receptor/Gαq/11 complex. However, receptor/Gαq/11 complex formation is not altered by GRK2 mutants impaired in Gαq/11 binding, but these mutants are impaired in their ability to block mGluR1a signaling. Furthermore, a GRK2-D527A mutant that fails to bind mGluR1a does not attenuate mGluR1a signaling, even though the mutant binds Gαq/11. Taken together, our observations suggest that phosphorylation-independent blockade of mGluR1a signaling requires the concomitant binding of the GRK2 RH domain to both Gαq/11 and mGluR1a.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, trypsin, and gentamicin were obtained from Invitrogen. The rabbit polyclonal GRK2 antibody was raised against the peptide sequence, DREARKKAKNKQLGH, corresponding to rat GRK2. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, ECL Western blotting detection reagents, and the protein G-Sepharose beads were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Quisqualate was purchased from Tocris Cookson Inc. The anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. [3H]Myo-inositol was acquired from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The Dowex 1-X8 (formate form) resin with 200-400 mesh was purchased from Bio-Rad. All other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, Fisher, and VWR Scientific.Plasmid Construction—The FLAG-mGluR1a and GRK2 RH domain mutant constructs were described previously (12Dhami G.K.

Amino-terminal myc-tagged wild-type GRK2, GRK2-R106A, GRK2-D110, GRK2-M114A, GRK2-D527A, GRK2-T528A, GRK2-A531E, and GRK2-E532A mutants were constructed by PCR amplification and mutagenesis of bovine GRK2 mutant cDNA and inserted into the BamHI/PmlI site of pcDNA3-GRK2. The sequence integrity of each of the mutants was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °Cin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/μl gentamicin. Cells were transfected with plasmid cDNAs using a modified calcium phosphate method (12Dhami G.K. Anborgh P.H. Dale L.B. Sterne-Marr R. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After transfection (18 h), the cells were incubated with fresh medium, allowed to recover for 6-8 h, and reseeded into either 6- or 24-well dishes, and then grown an additional 18 h prior to experimentation.Inositol Phosphate Formation—Inositol lipids were radiolabeled by incubating the cells overnight with 1 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Un-incorporated [3H]myo-inositol was removed by washing the cells with HBSS (116 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The cells were pre-incubated for 1 h in HBSS at 37 °C and then pre-incubated in 500 μl of the same buffer containing 10 mm LiCl for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated in either the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations (0-30 μm) of quisqualate for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped on ice by adding 400 μl of perchloric acid and then it was neutralized with 500 μl of 0.72 m KOH and 0.6 m KHCO3. The total [3H]inositol incorporated into the cells was determined by counting the radioactivity present in 50 μl of the cell lysate. Total inositol phosphate was purified from the cell extracts by anion exchange chromatography using Dowex 1-X8 (formate form) 200-400 mesh anion exchange resin. [3H]Inositol phosphate formation was determined by liquid scintillation using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation system.Co-immunoprecipitation—The cells from 100-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed in 400 μl of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in either the absence or presence of 100 μm GDP, 2 mm MgSO4, 30 μm aluminum chloride, and 5 mm sodium fluoride. The particulate fraction was removed by centrifugation, and 500 μg of supernatant protein was incubated with 5 μl of either anti-FLAG or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and 100 μl of 20% protein G-Sepharose beads or 40 μl of FLAG-affinity gel for 12-16 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry electroblotting. The membranes were blocked with 10% milk in TBS-T wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with rabbit GRK2, Gαq/11-(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mGluR1a-specific antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) diluted 1:1000 in wash buffer containing 3% skim milk. The membranes were rinsed three times with wash buffer and then incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:2500 in wash buffer containing 3% skimmed milk. Membranes were rinsed twice with TBS-T, twice with TBS, and were incubated with ECL Western blotting detection reagents.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBecause expression of the GRK2 RH domain alone effectively attenuates mGluR1a signaling (12Dhami G.K.

GRK2 mutants defective in Gαq/11 binding (D110A, R106A, and M114A) exhibit a diminished capacity to reduce the Vmax for quisqualate-stimulated IP formation when compared with wild-type GRK2 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, GRK2 mutants (E84A and K90A) with substitutions of amino acid residues within the GRK2 RH domain α4 helix, a helix not essential for Gαq/11 interactions (15Sterne-Marr R. Tesmer J.J.

Residual mGluR1a signaling observed in cells expressing GRK2-D110A is not attributable to GRK2 kinase activity, because the ability of a kinase-deficient GRK2-D110A/K220R double-point mutant to attenuate mGluR1a signaling is indistinguishable from GRK2-D110A (compare Fig. 1A with B). mGluR1a exhibits substantial agonist-independent basal activity (12Dhami G.K.

However, GRK2 Gαq/11 binding mutant overexpression has no effect on basal mGluR1a activity (Fig. 1C). Thus, GRK2 interactions with Gαq/11 are essential for regulating both spontaneous and agonist-stimulated mGluR1a activity.GRK2 is abundantly expressed in brain (17Arriza J.L. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J. Caron M.G. Snyder S.H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GRK2 expression in mGluR1a-expressing brain regions (18Baude A. Nusser Z. Roberts J.D. Mulvihill E. McIlhinney R.A. Somogyi P. Neuron. 1993; 11: 771-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) is substantially higher than GRK2 expression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). However, it is suggested that GRK2 RH domain-dependent mGluR1a desensitization occurs merely as the consequence of GRK2 overexpression (19Pao C.S. Benovic J.L. Science STKE. 2002; 153: pe42Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of transfecting HEK293 cells with increasing amounts of GRK2 plasmid cDNA on the Vmax for mGluR1a-mediated IP formation (Fig. 2B). As illustrated in Fig. 2C, the Vmax for quisqualate-stimulated IP formation is progressively attenuated as GRK2 expression is increased (Fig. 2C). GRK2-dependent attenuation of mGluR1a signaling is observed at GRK2 expression levels (0.1-1 μg of transfected cDNA) that are similar to endogenous GRK2 levels in mGluR1a-expressing regions of rat brain, when compared with endogenous HEK293 cell GRK2 expression levels on the same blot (compare Fig 2A with B). In contrast, the Vmax for quisqualate-stimulated IP formation is inhibited only after transfection of HEK293 cells with 3 and 10 μg of GRK2-D110A (Fig. 2, D and E). When GRK2 expression is plotted versus the Vmax for agonist-stimulated mGluR1a IP formation, an expression (dose)-dependent reduction in the Vmax for mGluR1a-stimulated IP formation is observed (Fig. 2E). GRK2-D110A, GRK2-R106A, and GRK2-M114A also reduce mGluR1a-stimulated IP formation in an expression-dependent manner but to a far lesser extent than what is observed for wild-type GRK2 (Fig. 2E). Basal mGluR1a IP formation is also attenuated by GRK2 but is unaffected by the expression of GRK2 mutants defective in Gαq/11 binding (Fig. 2F). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for GRK2 expression-dependent attenuation of agonist-stimulated and basal mGluR1a signaling are identical (EC50 = 0.9 μg cDNA). Thus, GRK2 interactions with Gαq/11 account for GRK2 phosphorylation-independent adaptation of mGluR1a signaling at expression levels that are physiologically relevant to mGluR1a signaling in vivo.Fig. 2Wild-type and GRK2 mutant expression level-dependent effects upon agonist-stimulated and basal mGluR1 signaling.A, relative GRK2 expression in 100 μg of lysates from HEK293 cells, rat brain cerebellum (Cb) and rat brain cortex (Cx).

However, the capacity of each of the GRK2 Gαq/11 binding mutants to associate with mGluR1a is indistinguishable from wild-type GRK2 (Fig 3, B and C). Gαq/11 is also co-immunoprecipitated as a complex with mGluR1a (Fig. 4A), and mGluR1a/Gαq/11 complex formation is reduced 64 ± 12% by the treatment of cell lysates with AlF4- (Fig. 4B). GRK2 overexpression reduces the co-immunoprecipitation of Gαq/11 with mGluR1a in the absence of AlF4- treatment, and mGluR1a/Gαq/11 interactions are no longer regulated by AlF4- treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, either GRK2-D110A, GRK2-R106A, or GRK2-M114A expression does not prevent the formation of mGluR1a/Gαq/11 complexes, and these complexes retain the capacity to be regulated by AlF4- treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar to AlF4- treatment, agonist promotes the dissociation of mGluR1a/Gαq/11 complexes, and GRK2 but not GRK2-D110A expression prevents the co-immunoprecipitation of Gαq/11 with mGluR1a in the absence of agonist (Fig. 4, C and D). Because it is possible that GRK2-mediated disruption of mGluR1a/Gαq/11 complexes is simply the consequence of the nonspecific sequestration of Gαq/11 after GRK2 overexpression, we have examined whether RGS4 overexpression would also disrupt the association of Gαq/11 with mGluR1a. The overexpression of RGS4, an RGS protein previously shown to regulate mGluR1a/Gαq/11 signaling (20Saugstad J.A. Marino M.J. Folk J.A. Hepler J.R. Conn P.J. J.

Consequently, we created a series of mutations (D527A, T528A, A531E, and E532A) within the α11 helix domain of the GRK2 RH domain and tested their capacity to attenuate basal and agonist-stimulated mGluR1a signaling. When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, GRK2-T528A, GRK2-A531E, and GRK2-E532A were indistinguishable from wild-type GRK2 in their capacity to attenuate either agonist-stimulated (Fig. 5A) or basal (Fig. 5B) mGluR1a IP formation. In contrast, GRK2-D527A overexpression, at levels comparable with wild-type GRK2, GRK2-T528A, GRK2-A531E, and GRK2-E532A (Fig. 5C), did not attenuate quisqualate-stimulated or basal IP formation when compared with control mGluR1a-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Identical to what was observed for wild-type GRK2, GRK2-D527A and each of the other α10 and α11 helix RH domain mutants bind to Gαq/11 in an AlF4--dependent manner (Fig. 5D). However, on"
https://openalex.org/W2171358391,"Human CA125, encoded by the MUC16 gene, is an ovarian cancer antigen widely used for a serum assay. Its extracellular region consists of tandem repeats of SEA domains. In this study we determined the three-dimensional structure of the SEA domain from the murine MUC16 homologue using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The domain forms a unique α/β sandwich fold composed of two α helices and four antiparallel β strands and has a characteristic turn named the TY-turn between α1 and α2. The internal mobility of the main chain is low throughout the domain. The residues that form the hydrophobic core and the TY-turn are fully conserved in all SEA domain sequences, indicating that the fold is common in the family. Interestingly, no other residues are conserved throughout the family. Thus, the sequence alignment of the SEA domain family was refined on the basis of the three-dimensional structure, which allowed us to classify the SEA domains into several subfamilies. The residues on the surface differ between these subfamilies, suggesting that each subfamily has a different function. In the MUC16 SEA domains, the conserved surface residues, Asn-10, Thr-12, Arg-63, Asp-75, Asp-112, Ser-115, and Phe-117, are clustered on the β sheet surface, which may be functionally important. The putative epitope (residues 58-77) for anti-MUC16 antibodies is located around the β2 and β3 strands. On the other hand the tissue tumor marker MUC1 has a SEA domain belonging to another subfamily, and its GSVVV motif for proteolytic cleavage is located in the short loop connecting β2 and β3.

CA125 is a serum marker that is widely used to monitor ovarian cancer because it is overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and secreted into the blood. An elevated serum CA125 level is a useful indicator of ovarian cancer, but it is also observed in a number of benign conditions (1Bast Jr., R.C Feeney M. Lazarus H. Nadler L.M. Colvin R.B. Knapp R.C.

The splicing variants have the same intracellular and transmembrane regions. The extracellular domain consists of the SEA 1The abbreviations used are: SEA, a module first identified in sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; COSY, correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; MUC, mucin; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. domains, which are repeated 7, 12, or 60 times, according to the variant. The gene was named MUC16, after the mucin-like nature of CA125. The elucidation of the amino acid sequence has made it possible to specify the approximate position of the epitope. A previous study showed that the peptide epitope position of CA125 is located between two conserved cysteines in the SEA domain (7O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Dennis R.A. Santin A.D. York L. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A cDNA of the murine MUC16 homologue, cloned in the RIKEN FANTOM project (9The RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group Phase II Team and the FANTOM Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), has a total of 258 amino acids and a transmembrane domain. It is 66% identical to the C terminus of human MUC16 and has only one SEA domain in its extracellular region. However, our investigation of the mouse and human genomic sequences showed that they share the same characteristic repeat structure of MUC16. Thus, the murine MUC16 appears to have splicing variants, as in the case of the human form. The SEA domain of the clone by the RIKEN FANTOM project (9The RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group Phase II Team and the FANTOM Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) corresponds to that most membrane-proximal of the repeated SEA domains. The SEA domain, or SEA module, was first identified as a module commonly found in sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin (10Bork P. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Most of the proteins with SEA domains are membrane proteins and usually have only one SEA domain, unlike MUC16. The SEA domains always exist in the extracellular region and often are accompanied by an O-linked glycochain at the N-terminal side. SEA domains consist of about 120 residues, of which about 80 residues are highly conserved. Previous studies have speculated about the properties of SEA domains. Perlecan is a type of proteoglycan that has both the SEA domain and glycosaminoglycan (11Sasaki T. Costell M. Mann K. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The deletion of the SEA domain of perlecan affects heparan sulfate synthesis (11Sasaki T. Costell M. Mann K. Timpl R.

Recently it was reported that the membrane protein mucin 1 (MUC1), a tumor tissue marker, undergoes posttranslational proteolytic cleavage in the ER in a specific site of the SEA domain within its membrane proximal region (13Baruch A. Hartmann M. Yoeli M. Adereth Y. Greenstein S. Stadler Y. Skornik Y. Zaretsky J. Smorodinsky N.I. Keydar I. Wreschner D.H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1552-1561PubMed Google Scholar, 14Parry S.

The site-specific cleavage of SEA domains has also been reported for Ig-hepta, seven-transmembrane proteins, and mucin 3 (MUC3) (16Abe J. Fukuzawa T. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23391-23398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Wang R. Khatri I.A. Forstner J.F. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All of these cleavages occur between glycine and serine in the GSVVV motif, located in the middle of the SEA domains (14Parry S. Silverman H.S. McDermott K. Willis A. Hollingsworth M.A. Harris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Abe J. Fukuzawa T. Hirose S. J.

MUC1 and its relatives have the GSVVV motif, but neither human nor murine MUC16 has the GSVVV motif. In this study we determined the three-dimensional structure of the SEA domain from the murine MUC16 homologue using multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The structure determination revealed a novel fold of the SEA domain. This three-dimensional structure, the first determined for a SEA domain, allowed us to identify the conserved residues clustered on the surface, which are probably important for the function. We have classified the SEA domains into several subfamilies on the basis of a tertiary structure-based sequence analysis. This research provides a basis for future studies not only on CA125 but also on other SEA domains. Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA encoding the murine MUC16 SEA domain, which corresponds to the most membrane proximal one of the repeated SEA domains in human MUC16, was subcloned by PCR from the mouse full-length cDNA clone with the ID RIKEN cDNA 1110008I14 (9The RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group Phase II Team and the FANTOM Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). This clone encodes a total of 258 amino acid residues. The SEA domain (residues 67-185: total 119 amino acids) was cloned into the expression vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) as a fusion with an N-terminal His6 affinity tag and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. The fusion protein was synthesized by a cell-free protein expression system (18Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Yoshida Y. Tsutsui M. Ito Y. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To label the protein 13C/15N-labeled amino acids were used. The protein was first adsorbed to a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column that was washed by a concentration gradient of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.3 m sodium chloride and 10 mm imidazole) and buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.3 m sodium chloride and 20 mm imidazole). The protein was eluted by a concentration gradient of buffer A and buffer C (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.3 m sodium chloride and 500 mm imidazole). The His tag was then removed by an incubation at 30 °C for 1 h with the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. The imidazole and sodium phosphate were removed by an overnight dialysis at 4 °C against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Finally, the protein was purified on a HiTrap SP cation exchange column by elution with a concentration gradient of 0-1 m sodium chloride. The purified protein was concentrated to ∼1.5 mm in 1H2O/2H2O (9/1) or 2H2O 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmd-dithiothreitol and 0.02% NaN3. NMR Spectroscopy—All spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers at 298 K. Spectra were processed using the program NMRPipe (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar), and analyses of the processed data were performed with the program NMRView (20Johnson B. Blevins R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Sequential assignments of the 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances were achieved by means of the through-bond heteronuclear scalar correlations along the protein backbone and side chains (21Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W. Palmer A. Skelton N. Protein NMR Spectroscopy Principle and Practice. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 478-517Google Scholar). Backbone resonances were assigned from three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO spectra (all spectra were measured on a 600-MHz NMR spectrometer, unless otherwise noted), whereas aliphatic side chain resonances were assigned from three-dimensional H(CCO)NH, C(CCO)NH, and HC(C)H TOCSY (21Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W. Palmer A. Skelton N. Protein NMR Spectroscopy Principle and Practice. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 478-517Google Scholar). Aromatic side chain resonances were assigned from two-dimensional HC(C)H-TOCSY, DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY (22Markley J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 176: 12-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (the latter three spectra were measured with a non-labeled protein sample in 2H2O buffer on an 800-MHz NMR spectrometer). Interproton distance restraints were obtained from three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY recorded with a mixing time of 100 ms. Hydrogen bond information was obtained from transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy HNCO (23Cordier F. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1601-1602Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 24Cornilescu G. Hu J. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2949-2950Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and three-dimensional NOESY spectra. We used the 15N-labeled protein sample to measure the spectra for a backbone mobility analysis. The pulse sequences used to measure 15N-{1H} NOE, and T1/T2 were those described by Farrow et al. (25Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 868-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. A total of 10 data sets were collected to measure T1, with delay values of 4.02, 44.22, 124.62, 245.22, 406.02, 607.02, 808.02, 1009.02, 1441.02, and 1813.02 ms. A total of 8 data sets were collected to measure T2, with delay values of 3.34, 23.38, 50.1, 83.5, 123.58, 163.66, 217.1, and 270.54 ms. The 15N-{1H} NOE value was determined from the ratio of the intensity of two spectra recorded with and without saturation of protons. Constraint Generation and Structure Calculation—Interproton distant constraints were assigned from the three-dimensional NOESY spectra using the program ARIA1.0 (26Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The constraints on the backbone dihedral angles were obtained by using TALOS (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) and analyzing NOESY spectra. These initial constraints and the hydrogen bond information were used to calculate the initial structure on the program CNS1.0 (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Grosse P. Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), in which the structure calculation was performed with molecular dynamics and energy minimization by simulated annealing. On the basis of the 10 lowest energy structures of the 200 calculated structures, the side chain dihedral angle constraints were obtained by an analysis of the NOESY spectra. These steps were repeated several times, whereas the interproton distance constraints were modified. The final structure was calculated from these sets of constraints on CNS1.0. The 20 lowest energy structures out of the 200 calculated structures were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1IVZ) as a final structure. The program PROCHECK-NMR (29Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the structures. All three-dimensional structures were depicted by the program MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). ClustalX 1.81 (31Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar) was used for the sequence alignment, the dendrogram calculation, and their illustrations. A structure-based sequence alignment was performed by modifying the gap penalties for the secondary structure regions (four times larger penalties within the secondary structures and two times larger penalties at the boundaries). The dendrogram of all SEA family members was obtained from the structure-based sequence alignment. Structure Determination—The boundary of the SEA domain was determined by the sequence comparison. The well dispersed signals in the 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra showed that the SEA domain is a well folded structural domain. The protein sample used for the structure determination has linker sequences GSSGSSG and PSSG, both derived from the vector, at the N and the C termini, respectively. These linker peptides were completely unstructured. The SEA domain structure was determined from 2270 NOE-derived interproton distance restraints, 178 dihedral angle restraints, and 78 hydrogen bond restraints. Residues 1-4, after the N-terminal linker, and residues 66-69 were not well defined due to a lack of NOEs. Except for these residues the structure is well defined (see Fig. 1A). The root mean square deviations of residues 5-65 and 72-119 are 0.42 Å for the backbone heavy atoms and 0.92 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms.

The α/β sandwich fold can be divided into two layers (Fig. 1A). One layer consists of four-stranded antiparallel β sheets (β1, 6-12; β2, 54-63; β3, 73-80; β6, 117-119) and a short α helix (α1, 19-24), whereas the other layer consists of two long α helices (α2, 27-48; α3, 88-100) and two-stranded short β sheets (β4, 105-106; β5, 109-110). There is a bulge in the β2 strand. The sequence patterns of the hydrophobic residues around the β2 strand can be aligned without gaps in all SEA domains, and thus, the bulge is probably conserved throughout the family, as seen in SH3 domains (32Larson S.M. Davidson A.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Two cysteine residues (Cys-57 and Cys-78) are located next to each other on the β2 and β3 strands, respectively, and are close enough to form a disulfide bond. However, the mass spectroscopy analysis of the trypsin-digested peptide showed that no disulfide bond is formed (data not shown). The two long α helices, α2 and α3, fit into the four-stranded β sheets to form a hydrophobic core. The α2 helix is so long that its N terminus protrudes from the β sheets. Between α1 and α2 there is a characteristic tight turn, which we named the TY-turn, because it contains well conserved threonine and tyrosine residues. We will discuss this region in more detail below. The overall structure is a βαββαβ fold, except for the insertions of small secondary structures. The residues that participate in core formation are Phe-7, Leu-9, Phe-11, Ile-13, Leu-16, Tyr-18, Ile-22, Pro-25, Tyr-30, Thr-33, Ile-37, Leu-41, Leu-44, Phe-45, Ile-50, Phe-54, Cys-57, Val-59, Phe-62, Thr-72, Val-74, Ser-76, Cys-78, Phe-80, Val-87, Ile-92, Tyr-93, Phe-96, Leu-98, Met-99, Leu-106, Leu-107, Phe-109, Leu-111, Val-116, and Val-118. Many of these are hydrophobic residues conserved throughout the family. In particular, Tyr-18, Tyr-30, Phe-45, and Phe-54 are the most conserved. The conservation of hydrophobic residues will be discussed in detail below (see “Discussion”). The SEA domain has two short loops (L1, residues 64-72; L2, residues 81-87) but no unstructured region except for residues 66-69. In the hydrophobic core the side chains are well packed, suggesting the rigidity of the SEA domain. The measured {1H}-15N NOE and T1/T2 values revealed the low mobility of the main chain, as presented in Fig. 1C. The main chain of the SEA domain exhibits low mobility throughout the entire domain, except for the N- and C-terminal peptides, which are mostly derived from the expression vector. The mobile region is very short; even some loop regions show low mobility. The aromatic residues that contribute to core packing, such as Tyr-18, Tyr-30, Phe-45, and Phe-54, are well conserved among all SEA domains. Phe-54, located on the N terminus of β2, and Phe-45 stack upon each other to bridge distinct elements. In addition the charged residues at the N and C termini of the α helices probably stabilize the helix electric dipole. These residues appear to contribute to the rigidity of the structure. Structure Comparison and Binding Assays—We searched for structural homologues in the Protein Data Bank with the program DALI (33Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar). The six most similar structures are the anticodon binding domain of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase (PDB code 1pys-B; Z score, 6.3; r.m.s.d., 2.9), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase fragment (PDB code 1qax-A; Z score, 6.0; r.m.s.d., 4.1), pseudouridine synthase (PDB code 1dj0-A; Z score, 5.7; r.m.s.d., 3.1), elongation factor 1β(PDB code 1b64; Z score, 5.7; r.m.s.d., 3.3), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase fragment (PDB code, 1dqa-A; Z score, 5.5; r.m.s.d., 3.1), and ribosomal protein S6 (PDB code 1qax-A; Z score, 5.5; r.m.s.d., 4.1). Interestingly, many RNA binding domains shared similarities with the SEA domain. The four most similar structures are illustrated in ribbon diagrams in Fig. 2A. We also compared the surface electrostatic potential of the SEA domain with those of the RNA binding domains (see Fig. 2B). The SEA domain is a highly positively charged protein, which suggests that it can bind negatively charged molecules such as nucleic acids or acidic sugars. However, their surface charge patterns differ, and the functional residues of the RNA-binding proteins are not conserved in the SEA domain. The SEA domain is an extracellular domain, and thus, it probably does not share the same function with the RNA-binding proteins. It was proposed that the SEA domain might have sugar chain binding activity (10Bork P. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are chemical and structural similarities between acidic sugar chains and nucleic acids. Thus, we tested the SEA domain for the ability to bind sugar chains by using model sugars. We measured the chemical shift perturbations of the 15N-labeled SEA domain mixed with candidate compounds by heteronuclear single quantum coherence. The compounds we tested were ATP, sucrose, porcine stomach mucin (O-glycosylated glycoprotein; Sigma), and chondroitin sulfate (a type of glycosaminoglycan; EXTRASYNTHESE S.A.). However, no significant chemical shift perturbation was observed with any of the compounds. We also tried to observe the binding between the SEA domain and sucrose, mucin, and chondroitin sulfate using surface plasmon resonance (34Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J. Biosens. Bioelectronics. 1993; 8: 347-354Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar), but no interaction was detected (data not shown). Our SEA domain does not associate with the glycochains presented by mucin and chondroitin sulfate under our conditions. Of course, the possibility still exists that it may associate with any of the other compounds under different conditions. Structure-based Sequence Analysis and Clustering of SEA Domain Family Members—We performed a multiple alignment of 40 SEA domain sequences from various proteins using ClustalX (see Fig. 3) with higher gap penalties in the secondary structure regions to make a dendrogram reflecting the three-dimensional structural information. The dendrogram based on the alignment shows that the SEA domain is clustered into several subfamilies, each with common features. Subfamily I consists of the SEA domains of the murine MUC16 homologue, human MUC16, and agrin. Subfamilies II, III, and IV consist of proteins with the GSVVV motif, which undergoes proteolytic cleavage. Subfamily IV contains Caenorhabditis elegans proteins that have no GSVVV motif. Subfamily V consists of only two proteins, mouse airway trypsin-like protease and DESC1, which are both serine proteases. Subfamily VI has no significant common features. The SEA Domain Family—The residues conserved in all SEA domains are illustrated in Fig. 3. The SEA domain of the murine MUC16 homologue has 36 residues that participate in core formation. They are well conserved in all SEA domains, indicating that all of the proteins in the family share the same topology. In general, the first half (1∼75) of the SEA domain sequence is well conserved, but the second half (76∼119) is less conserved, although the tertiary structure is indivisible at the border. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the second half vary between subfamilies, and each subfamily is characterized by the sequence of the second half. Besides the core residues, no residues are conserved throughout the SEA domains. The conserved residues on the surface differ between the subfamilies, as discussed below. These facts suggest that each subfamily functions in a different manner; that is, all of these domains may share a common fundamental function such as sugar binding or protein recognition, but the target molecules or binding mechanisms should be different depending on the subfamily. TY-turn—As described above a characteristic tight turn exists between α1 and α2 (see Fig. 4). Because the two conserved residues Thr-27 and Tyr-30 play important roles in maintaining this structure, we named it the TY-turn. The linker region of this turn contains four amino acids in a βααβ conformation. Thr-27 is located in the TY-turn (Fig. 4) and is conserved as serine or threonine residues throughout the family. The OH group of Thr-27 protrudes toward the N terminus of α2, which contains the backbone HN group of Tyr-30. These two groups probably form a hydrogen bond for “capping” the helix (35Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). A hydrogen bond network seems to stabilize the characteristic structure (Fig. 4). Tyr-30 on α2 and Pro-25 on the turn are stacked upon each other, and they seem to support the structure. Tyr-30 is conserved as aromatic residues throughout the family, and Pro-25 is conserved among subfamily I and some SEA domains. Therefore, this characteristic structure is likely to be conserved in the family. Conserved Residues on the Murine MUC16 SEA Domain Surface—As previously described the extracellular region of human MUC16 consists of SEA domain repeats (6Yin B.W. Lloyd K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27371-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Thus, the question naturally arises as to whether the repeated SEA domains are equivalent. According to the dendrogram in Fig. 3, the SEA domains in MUC16 are apparently more similar to each other than to other SEA domains. This suggests that the multiplication of the SEA domains occurred after MUC16 appeared. Interestingly, the second SEA domain from the C terminus of human MUC16 is now classified into subfamily II, with the GSVVV motif, and correspondingly has a DSVLV sequence. Therefore, this SEA domain might undergo proteolytic cleavage. In the dendrogram of all SEA domains from human MUC16 (Fig. 3), the fifth and further SEA domains from the C terminus are very similar to each other, whereas the four C-terminal, membrane-proximal SEA domains are more diverse. This suggests that the N-terminal SEA domains may have duplicated after the C-terminal SEA domains duplicated. We suppose that MUC16 used to be a rather short protein, with a small number of SEA domains, which became long recently. We then performed a detailed analysis of the amino acid sequences of the MUC16 SEA domains (Fig. 5A). The murine MUC16 SEA domains and that of the human long splicing variant were included in the comparison, whereas the second SEA domain from the C terminus was excluded because of its peculiarity. The conserved residues presented on the surface are illustrated in Fig. 5B. Most of the conserved residues are concentrated on the β sheet surface. The Asn-10, Thr-12, Arg-63, Asp-75, Asp-112, Ser-115, and Phe-117 residues are completely conserved in the MUC16 SEA domains. There is a pocket on the conserved β sheet surface that may be suitable for ligand binding. We further examined the conservation within the subfamily I SEA domains, including agrin. The alignment is illustrated in Fig. 5C, and the surface plot is in Fig. 5D. The surface residue conservation significantly diminished as the comparison range was expanded to the entire subfamily, but several conserved residues still exist on the β sheet surface. This may be a key to discriminate the functionally important residues from the unimportant residues. On the other hand, the surface residues around the TY-turn of the SEA domain are not conserved. The Epitope Site of CA125—Anti-CA125 antibodies are divided into three groups, OC125-like, M11-like, and Ov197-like, which recognize domains of nonoverlapping epitopes (36Nap M. Vitali A. Nustad K. Bast Jr., R.C. O'Brien T.J. Nilsson O. Seguin P. Suresh M.R. Bormer O.P. Saga T. de Bruijn H.W. Nozawa S. Kreutz F.T. Jette D. Sakahara H. Gadnell M. Endo K. Barlow E.H. Warren D. Paus E. Hammarstrom S. Kenemans P. Hilgers J. Tumour Biol. 1996; 17: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All three types of antibodies can recognize the recombinant CA125 in an immunoblot analysis (7O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Dennis R.A. Santin A.D. York L. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), indicating that the epitope sites are on the peptide portion of CA125, which is a heavily O-glycosylated protein. The antibodies can recognize either native or denatured CA125. The epitope site of the M11 antibody was further investigated with digested peptide fragments, which revealed that the peptide between two conserved cysteine residues in the SEA domain is sufficient for antibody recognition (7O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Dennis R.A. Santin A.D. York L. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These cysteines correspond to Cys-57 and Cys-78 of murine MUC16, which are on β2 and β3. This fact suggests that the epitope site is located on the β sheet surface. The GSVVV Motif as the Proteolytic Cleavage Site—The SEA domains of MUC1, MUC3, and Ig-hepta undergo proteolytic cleavage between the glycine and serine residues of the GSVVV motif, as a posttranslational modification in the ER (14Parry S.

Price M.R. Segal-Eiras A. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2001; 7: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Only MUC1/REP is proteolytically cleaved (13Baruch A. Hartmann M. Yoeli M. Adereth Y.

Hollingsworth M.A. Harris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MUC1/REP is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of one SEA domain and 20 repeated short sequences (13Baruch A. Hartmann M. Yoeli M. Adereth Y. Greenstein S. Stadler Y.

The two resulting cleavage products of MUC1/REP still form a heterodimer (13Baruch A. Hartmann M. Yoeli M. Adereth Y. Greenstein S. Stadler Y. Skornik Y. Zaretsky J. Smorodinsky N.I. Keydar I. Wreschner D.H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1552-1561PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the SEA domain serves not only as a cleavage site but also as a site for reassociation (15Wreschner D.H. McGuckin M.A. Williams S.J. Baruch A. Yoeli M. Ziv R. Okun L. Zaretsky J. Smorodinsky N. Keydar I. Neophytou P. Stacey M. Lin H.H. Gordon S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). MUC1/SEC is a secreted form and lacks the transmembrane region (39Smorodinsky N. Weiss M. Hartmann M.L. Baruch A. Harness E. Yaakobovitz M. Keydar I. Wreschner D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MUC1/Y has a short extracellular region that lacks repeated sequences (13Baruch A. Hartmann M. Yoeli M. Adereth Y. Greenstein S.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19957-19964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), undergoes a proteolytic cleavage at the same GSVVV sequence (16Abe J. Fukuzawa T. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23391-23398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). MUC3 is cleaved in the same manner and forms a heterodimer even after cleavage (17Wang R. Khatri I.A. Forstner J.F. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The GSVVV motif must be exposed to the solvent to be properly cleaved. To examine the position of the motif on the three-dimensional structure, we performed multiple alignments of the SEA domains with the GSVVV motif, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Besides the GSVVV motif, most of the conserved residues appear to be involved in core formation. The GSVVV motif is located in the loop region between β2 and β3, which protrude from the entire domain. The GSVVV motif approximately corresponds to amino acid residues 65-72 (see Fig. 3). The solvent accessibility values of these residues (calculated by MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar); the average of 20 structures) are 14, 44, 54, 33, 39, 28, 17, and 0.1%, respectively. This region appears to be sufficiently solvent-exposed for proteolytic cleavage. For MUC1/REP the resulting cleavage products form a heterodimer in vivo, and the resulting secreted and membrane-bound fragments may dissociate and then reassociate through the SEA domain to work as a ligand and receptor (13Baruch A. Hartmann M. Yoeli M. Adereth Y. Greenstein S. Stadler Y. Skornik Y. Zaretsky J. Smorodinsky N.I. Keydar I. Wreschner D.H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1552-1561PubMed Google Scholar).

Chronic exposure to nicotine causes a strong addiction, which is mediated by the interaction of nicotine with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ECD, extracellular domain; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; nH, Hill number; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a class of pentameric allosteric ligand-gated ion channels engaged in cholinergic nicotinic transmission in the brain (3Changeux J.P.

In addition to the increased number of sites, modulation of the magnitude of the nicotine-elicited electrophysiological response is also observed upon chronic nicotine incubation of cell lines expressing recombinant nAChRs. This functional potentiation of the response is observed with nAChR oligomers α4β2 and α3β2 reconstituted in mammalian cell lines (12Wang F. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28721-28732Google Scholar, 20Buisson B. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1819-1829Google Scholar).

Neuron. 1996; 16: 905-908Google Scholar, 25Buisson B. Bertrand D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 130-136Google Scholar). Yet the molecular mechanisms underlying these plasticity phenomena remain to be elucidated. Transcriptional processes (15Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530Google Scholar) have so far been disregarded in favor of post-translational recruitment of preexisting subunits (12Wang F. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28721-28732Google Scholar) or stabilization of already assembled pentamers and protection against turnover (15Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530Google Scholar) or both. Equilibrium binding and electrophysiological recordings reveal that upon stable expression in HEK 293 cell lines, α3β2 receptors are both strongly up-regulated and potentiated by chronic nicotine exposure. In contrast, α3β4 receptors were unaffected by chronic nicotine treatment (12Wang F. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28721-28732Google Scholar). This observation offers a rationale to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying up-regulation by identifying the protein regions controlling this process. In the present study, we focus our analysis on up-regulation of the number of binding sites for nicotine. By constructing β2/β4 chimeras, we identified key amino acids that form a compact microdomain, contributing to the differences in up-regulation between α3β2 and α3β4. This microdomain also accounts for the up-regulation differences between α4β2 and α4β4 at nicotine concentrations compatible with those found in the blood of tobacco smokers. We propose a molecular mechanism of up-regulation where nicotine, binding to immature receptor precursors, causes a conformational reorganization of this microdomain. Construction of Chimeras between β2 and β4 Subunits—cDNAs encoding the β2 and the β4 rat subunits were excised as a NotI/XhoI fragment from the clones kindly supplied by J. Boulter and introduced into the pMT3 vector for expression (26Corringer P.J. Bertrand S. Bohler S. Edelstein S.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 648-657Google Scholar). Synthetic genes coding for the extracellular domain (ECD) of β2 and β4 were constructed by PCR amplification (pwo-polymerase, Roche Applied Science) using 60-mer oligonucleotides with an overlap of 20 base pairs, containing the minimum set of mutations allowing adequately distributed common restriction sites. We then fused those synthetic genes to the C-terminal SpeI/XhoI-amplified β4 (pwo-polymerase, Roche Applied Science). Chimeras were then constructed by simple subcloning between the two synthetic constructs. Single amino acid mutations were performed by subcloning hybridized pairs of oligonucleotides containing the appropriate mutation into the β4 synthetic gene. Synthetic genes and restriction sites are shown on Fig. 2. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection of Human HEK 293 Cells— Human HEK 293 cells, an embryonic kidney cell line, were maintained in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in a CO2 (5%) incubator at 37 °C. Cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and transfected using the calcium phosphate method (27Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Google Scholar). The transfectant was rinsed 24 h after transfection and replaced by fresh medium to allow expression for an additional 24 h. [3H]Epibatidine Binding, Nicotine Up-regulation—Up-regulation of α3β2 and α3β4 receptors transiently transfected in the HEK 293 cell line was examined by allowing expression of the receptors to reach a near steady-state level for 1 day and then incubating the cells with culture medium supplemented with (up-regulation conditions) or without (control conditions) the concentrations of nicotine given in the corresponding sections of the text (0.01–1000 μm) for 24 h. Nicotine was then eliminated from the culture medium for 30 min 2 times at 37 °C. Cells were then rinsed 3 times with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) and harvested using 5 mm EDTA in PBS. After 5 min of centrifugation at 1500 rpm, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. [3H]Epibatidine binding was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C at a concentration of 5 nm in 250 μl of the cell suspension. This mixture was then filtered 2 times on GF/C filters (Whatman) with ice-cold PBS. The filters were then counted using biodegradable counting scintillant (BCS, Amersham) in a 1209 Rackbeta counter (LKB Wallak). Nonspecific binding was assessed using 5 mm nicotine. For α3β4, a significant up-regulation took place at 1 mm nicotine and reached more than 2-fold at 10 mm nicotine but sometimes resulted in a large decrease in binding sites due to the toxicity of nicotine at this concentration. Membrane Preparation—The cells were pelleted at 1500 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell disruption was performed through sonication (3 times for 10 s) as previously described (17Whiteaker P. Sharples C.G. Wonnacott S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 950-962Google Scholar), and binding was performed in the usual conditions. Molecular Modeling—Molecular models were constructed with Modeler (28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

Up-regulation Properties of α3β2 and α3β4 Receptors Transiently Transfected in HEK 293 Cells—The identification of the amino acids responsible for the differences in up-regulation between β2 and β4 subunits by a chimeric approach required the generation and screening of numerous chimeras. To do so, we designed an up-regulation procedure after transient transfection in HEK 293 cells. Cells expressing α3 along with β2, β4, or a β2/β4 chimera were cultured for 24 h without (control condition) or with nicotine at a given concentration. After 1 h of washing to remove the nicotine bound to the receptor, the number of nicotinic binding sites was measured by equilibrium binding with [3H]epibatidine, a high affinity agonist. In all experiments, subunits from rat, previously designed to dissect the molecular determinant of desensitization (33Bohler S. Gay S. Bertrand S. Corringer P.J. Edelstein S.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2066-2074Google Scholar), were used. Fig 1A shows the average [3H]epibatidine binding site expression of the wild-type α3β2 and α3β4 receptors in control condition and upon up-regulation by 1 mm nicotine. Data are taken from a series of eight independent experiments. Each experiment consisted of expressing both receptors in control and up-regulated conditions the same day on the same batch of cells. Fig. 1A indicates that the high affinity binding site expression is variable, with S.D. around 50% in the four conditions. However, we found that this variability was mainly dependent on the state of the cells at the time of the transfection. Indeed, within each experiment the relative expression level between both receptors is stable. For instance, the ratio of the expression of up-regulated α3β4 to up-regulated α3β2 is 1.00 ± 0.17. Furthermore, we found that up-regulation was independent of the absolute expression level. Indeed, for each independent experiment the up-regulation ratio (r) was calculated by dividing the number of binding sites in the up-regulated condition by the number of binding sites in the control condition. This ratio remained stable (r = 1.73 ± 0.29 and 6.15 ± 1.19 for α3β4 and α3β2, respectively; Fig 1A, right panel), independent of the absolute expression level inherent to the state of the cells. Thus, in our system, α3β2 up-regulates strongly, whereas α3β4 displays relatively weak but significant up-regulation. Because α3β2 expression is much lower than α3β4 in the absence of nicotine up-regulation and since both receptors display nearly identical expression in up-regulated conditions, the difference in up-regulation is the consequence of different levels of expression in control conditions. Further pharmacological analysis in our system shows the following. (i) Performing a saturation analysis of [3H]epibatidine binding for each combination of subunits did not reveal differences in the affinity for [3H]epibatidine between control and up-regulated receptors. Fitting the data points according to the empirical Hill equation yielded Kd values of 0.4 ± 0.1 nm (nH = 1.5 ± 0.2) and 0.35 ± 0.1 nm (nH = 1.6 ± 0.1) for α3β2 and Kd values of 0.25 ± 0.15 nm (nH = 1.7 ± 0.1) and 0.25 ± 0.2 nm (nH = 1.6 ± 0.1) for α3β4, respectively, after exposure to control medium or to nicotine-supplemented medium. A concentration of 5 nm [3H]epibatidine was, thus, selected to measure the total amount of ACh binding sites in the subsequent study. (ii) The up-regulation of α3β2 was concentration-dependent, with a half-maximal effect obtained around 30 μm nicotine and a maximal effect around 1 mm nicotine (Fig. 1B). For α3β4 the EC50 was more difficult to evaluate due to the lower up-regulation level and to the observation that nicotine starts to be toxic for the cells at 10 mm concentration, preventing a reliable evaluation of up-regulation at this concentration. Still, high concentrations of nicotine were required, apparently with an EC50 in the range of 100 μm. (iii) None of the antagonists tested (mecamylamine (1 mm), d-tubocurarine (1 mm), dihydro-β-erythroidine (0.1 mm)) was found to cause significant up-regulation for both α3β2 and α3β4, and none of them significantly inhibited up-regulation elicited by 1 mm nicotine (data not shown). Altogether, these data are consistent with those previously reported (12Wang F. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28721-28732Google Scholar) but with a lower up-regulation ratio for α3β2 (6-fold as compared with 24-fold) and a higher EC50 of up-regulation (30 μm as compared 3 μm). Furthermore, we found that α3β4 exhibited a weak but significant up-regulation. These differences possibly reflect different phenotypes between the rat and human α3-containing nAChRs or, alternatively, differences in the expression systems; that is, transient transfection in HEK 293 cells versus stable expression in tsA210 cells. Up-regulation Involves an Increase in Intracellular Binding Sites—Nicotine and epibatidine are small organic tertiary amines that cross cell membranes in their uncharged form. To distinguish between binding to surface or to intracellular nAChRs, we investigated the ability of carbamylcholine, an impermeant quaternary amine, to compete with [3H]epibatidine binding. For both the α3β2 and α3β4 receptors, we found that a high concentration (5 mm) of carbamylcholine did not significantly inhibit [3H]epibatidine binding (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, after disruption of the cells by sonication, the same concentration of carbamylcholine was found to displace a large fraction of bound [3H]epibatidine. Thus, in the intact cell, [3H]epibatidine primarily binds to intracellular α3β2 or α3β4 nAChR, as previously reported for the α4β2 receptor expressed in M10 cells (17Whiteaker P. Sharples C.G. Wonnacott S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 950-962Google Scholar). The residual carbamylcholine insensitive [3H]epibatidine binding observed after sonication (30–40% of total [3H]epibatidine binding) could correspond to sites that are still inaccessible to carbamylcholine after homogenization. The ECD of the β-Subunit Controls Nicotine Up-regulation—In the subsequent study, mutant receptors were compared both on the basis of their up-regulation ratio (after treatment by 1 mm nicotine) and of their absolute expression level. Although the up-regulation ratios displayed good reproducibility, we have seen that the absolute expression levels were much more variable. To reduce this variability, we systematically included in each experiment the wild-type α3β4 receptor. Absolute expression levels of the various constructs were then normalized to the expression of α3β4 in up-regulated conditions. Heteromeric neuronal α3(α4)β2(β4) nAChRs are pentameric transmembrane channel receptors. All subunits possess a similar transmembrane organization; that is, a large extracellular N-terminal domain followed by three transmembrane segments, a cytoplasmic domain, a fourth transmembrane segment, and an extracellular C terminus. To investigate which domain(s) of the β subunit is responsible for the differences in up-regulation between β2- and β4-containing receptors, we constructed chimeras β2-(1–212) consisting of the ECD of β2 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of β4 (all chimeras are named according to the β2 primary sequence they contain, the balance of the primary sequence belonging to β4) and β2-(212–407), possessing the complementary organization. The up-regulation ratio of β2-(1–212) indicates a β2-like phenotype (r = 7.26), and that of β2-(212–407) indicates a β4-like phenotype (r = 1.43) (Fig. 3), showing that the ECD confers up-regulation when inserted from β2 into β4 and conversely inhibits up-regulation when transferred from β4 into β2. In addition, chimeras β2-(1–212) and β2-(212–407) displayed expression levels nearly 2-fold higher than that of β2 and β4, respectively. This suggests that specific interactions between the ECD of β2 (respectively, β4) and the transmembrane domain of β4 (respectively, β2) increase absolute high affinity protein expression. A Compact Microdomain of Two β2 Segments, β2-(74–89) and β2-(106–115), Confers Up-regulation to β4 —Further dissection of the contribution of the ECD to the up-regulation process was achieved by taking α3β4 as a reference and introducing progressively larger portions of the β2 subunit at both the N- and C-terminal ends of the β4 ECD. To achieve this goal we constructed synthetic genes encoding the β2 and β4 subunits, with common restriction sites within their ECD (Fig. 2). We verified that the gene encoding synthetic and wild-type β4 displayed comparable expression and electrophysiological functional properties (data not shown). This approach showed that segment 38–115 of β2 contains the critical elements conferring up-regulation to β4. Indeed, β2-(1–37) and β2-(116–212) exhibited a β4-like phenotype (r = 1.83 and 1.76, respectively), whereas β2-(1–89) and β2-(90–212) displayed an up-regulation ratio higher than the one of α3β4 (r = 2.86 and 5.26, respectively) (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that chimeras β2-(1–37), β2-(1–89), and β2-(90–212) displayed absolute expression levels much lower that the wild-type receptors, indicating that these macrochimeras may experience destabilizing interactions within their structure or during their maturation. In a second step segment 38–115 was dissected in three cassettes that were tested individually (Fig. 4). First, β2-(38–64) had a β4-like phenotype both for the up-regulation ratio and the expression level. Second, β2-(65–89) was directly split into four cassettes; β2-(65–73) displayed a β4-like phenotype (r = 1.63), β2-(74–79) up-regulated strongly (r = 4.94), and β2-(81) and β2-(82–89) exhibited a weak but significantly increased up-regulation compared with β4 (r = 2.27 and 2.60, respectively). Furthermore, these four chimeras displayed expression levels similar to that of β4. Third, β2-(90–115) presented a very weak expression, preventing an accurate measurement of the number of binding sites in control conditions. Still, the evaluated up-regulation ratio (3.48 ± 1.11, data not shown) suggested that this cassette may confer strong up-regulation to β4. We split this cassette into β2-(90–105) and β2-(106–115) with r = 1.82 and 4.43, respectively. The segment β2-(106–115) was finally separated into 2 microchimeras, β2-(106–110) and β2-(111–115), with respective up-regulation ratios of 3.34 and 2.87 and expression levels similar to that of β4. Altogether, the critical residues of β2 conferring up-regulation to α3β4 belong to two separate segments, β2-(74–89) and β2-(106–115). Within β2-(74–89), β2-(74–79) played a major role in up-regulation, whereas β2-(81) and β2-(82–89) produced weaker effects. Within β2-(106–115), the two half-cassettes, β2-(106–110) and β2-(111–115) nearly equally contributed to the up-regulation. We also performed single amino acid mutants β2-(74), β2-(75), β2-(76), β2-(77), β2-(78), β2-(79), β2-(107), β2-(109), β2-(110), β2-(112), β2-(113), and β2-(114). All of them exhibited up-regulation ratios and absolute expression levels similar to that of β4 (data not shown), indicating that within the sub-domains β2-(74–79), β2-(106–110), and β2-(111–115) a combination of amino acids generates the phenotypes. Visualization of the β2 residues conferring up-regulation to β4 on an atomic model of the α3β2 receptor extracellular domain derived from AChBP (30Le Novère N. Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3210-3215Google Scholar, 34Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Google Scholar) (Fig. 5) revealed that these amino acids form a compact microdomain. This “up-regulation domain” is located in the upper part of each subunit and is composed of 1) two β strands (β3 and β5) interacting together from the main β-sheet of the structure (β3: Val-78 and Leu-80; β5: Ser-107, Ala-109, and Val-110) and 2) loops flanking these β strands (loop 1 (Asp-73, Asn-74, Met-75, Lys-76, Lys-77, Val-78), loop 2 (Ser-82, His-84, and Ile-85), and loop 3 (Ser-112, Tyr-113, and Asp-114)). The up-regulation domain, thus, encompasses a large part of the interface between β and α. Moreover, its lower part is adjacent to the agonist binding site. The Up-regulation Microdomain of β4 Abolishes β2-Like Up-regulation—After demonstrating that the insertion of the β2 up-regulation microdomain into β4 confers to β4 a β2-like up-regulation, we tested the converse process by inserting the β4 74–89 and 106–115 segments into the β2-(1–212) chimera. Insertion of each segment independently resulted in a large decrease in the absolute expression level but no significant changes in the up-regulation ratios (Fig. 6). Insertion of both segments strongly decreased the up-regulation of the β2-(1–212) chimera to the β4 level, still with a large decrease in absolute expression level. Thus, the up-regulation microdomain confers up-regulation when inserted from β2 into β4 and, conversely, inhibits up-regulation when inserted from β4 into β2. The Microdomain Contributes to the Different Up-regulations of α4β2 and α4β4 —In the rat brain, up-regulation of nicotine binding sites is primarily attributed to α4β2 receptors (35Nguyen H.N. Rasmussen B.A. Perry D.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 1090-1097Google Scholar). To investigate the possible contribution of the microdomain to the up-regulation of α4 containing receptors, we investigated the up-regulation pattern of α4 in combination with β2, β4, and with selected critical β2/β4 chimeras. Fig. 7 shows that similar results are obtained with α4β2 and α4β4 as compared with α3β2 and α3β4 but with much lower concentrations of nicotine required for up-regulation. (i) On α4β2 receptors, up-regulation reaches 4.02- and 6.85-fold at 1 μm and 100 μm nicotine concentration, respectively, indicating an EC50 in the micromolar range; in contrast, α4β4 receptors up-regulated to a much lower degree, with a maximal up-regulation of 1.14- and 2.09-fold at 1 and 100 μm nicotine concentration. (ii) Analysis of β2-(1–212) and β2-(212–407) chimeras demonstrate that the extracellular domain controls the different up-regulations of α4β2 and α4β4. (iii) Introduction of either the β2 segments 1–37 or 90–115 within β4 did not alter the up-regulation significantly, pointing to a critical role of the 38–114 segment. (iv) Within this segment introduction of the critical β2 cassettes 74–79 and 106–115 produced strong phenotypes, characterized by a large decrease in expression level as compared with β4, no significant change in the up-regulation at 1 μm nicotine, but a large increase in up-regulation by 100 μm nicotine. Therefore, we show here that the critical segments of the microdomain confer up-regulation to α4β4 but with an apparent lower sensitivity as compared with α4β2. Correlation between Up-regulation Ratios and Absolute Expression Levels—The data presented in Fig. 1A concerning wild-type nAChRs show that the different up-regulation ratios between α3β2 and α3β4 apparently correspond to a difference in binding site expression in the absence of nicotine, with no significant change in the number of binding sites in up-regulation conditions. This observation might have important implications regarding the actual mechanism of up-regulation but is difficult to interpret since β4 and β2 may intrinsically produce different expression levels due to their large difference in primary sequence. Our study produced numerous chimeras, some of them displaying higher and lower expression levels as compared with β4, probably as a consequence of structural interactions between the β2 and β4 portions.

https://openalex.org/W2029225014,"Abstract Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a potent cellular survival factor contributing to tumorigenesis in a broad range of cancers. The functional transcription factor exists as a heterodimeric complex consisting of HIF-1α and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). Association of HIF-1 with ARNT is required for its activity; however, no other role has been ascribed to this interaction. We demonstrated previously that pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 by geldanamycin (GA) impairs HIF transcription and promotes VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau)-independent degradation of the protein, thus implicating Hsp90 as an essential interacting partner for HIF. In this study, we further explore the physiological role for Hsp90 in HIF function. We establish that the PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) domain of HIF is required both to promote association with Hsp90 and confer sensitivity to GA. Coincidentally, this domain also associates with ARNT. Overexpression of ARNT in a VHL-deficient background resulted in substantially increased HIF-1 protein concomitant with increased protein stability. Conversely, down-regulation of endogenous ARNT protein by RNA interference decreased the steady-state HIF protein. ARNT-mediated stabilization of HIF is specific for the Hsp90-dependent pathway, as ARNT was unable to protect HIF from VHL-mediated degradation. We establish that the ability of ARNT to up-regulate HIF and diminish HIF sensitivity to GA is due to its ability to compete for the Hsp90 binding site on HIF. These data elucidate novel functions for ARNT and Hsp90 in regulating HIF function and further illustrate that cofactor association may significantly impact upon the sensitivity of Hsp90 clients to chaperone inhibitors."

Interestingly, cytoplasmic FANCC interacts with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) to protect cells from interferon-γ/TNF-α-induced apoptosis, yet FANCC-HSP70 interaction is dispensable for protection against genotoxic stress (28Pang Q.

Participation of FANCC in redox metabolism has been proposed previously and is supported by functional interactions with cytochrome P-450 reductase (CPR) (31Kruyt F. Hoshino T. Liu J. Joseph P. Jaiswal A. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 92: 3050-3056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) (32Cumming R.C. Lightfoot J. Beard K. Youssoufian H. O'Brien P.J. Buchwald M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Evidence of oxygen sensitivity was first provided by Joenje et al. (34Joenje H. Youssoufian H. Kruyt F. dos Santos C. Wevrick R. Buchwald M. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1995; 21: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the chromosomal instability of primary FA cells could be reduced if grown at lowered oxygen tension (33Joenje H. Arwert F. Eriksson A. de Koning H. Oostra A. Nature. 1981; 290: 142-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Several conflicting studies have been reported since this original description, although most analyses were conducted in immortalized cell lines or in cells with unidentified FA complementation type and/or mutation (34Joenje H.

Now with the availability of murine models, the issue of whether FA cells have altered redox regulation is being readdressed in primary cells. Using mice deficient in the murine FANCC homologue (Fancc), Hadjur et al. (37Hadjur S. Ung K. Wadsworth L. Dimmick J. Rajcan-Separovic E. Scott R.W. Buchwald M. Jirik F.R. Blood. 2001; 98: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that mice mutant at both the Fancc and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) loci exhibit severe defects in hematopoiesis, including histological evidence of BM hypoplasia, an observation not detected in singly mutant mice. Although these data provide strong genetic evidence that Fancc -/- cells are hypersensitive to endogenously generated oxidants, it is unknown whether the molecular mechanism responsible for this hyper-sensitive response is due to altered redox signaling. Redox signaling has a critical role in controlling multiple complex cellular processes including apoptosis, proliferation, senescence, and differentiation (38Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z.

Cellular oxidative stress results in the oxidation of key cysteine residues on redox-sensitive proteins, a post-translational modification that affects intracellular signaling pathways in a fashion similar to phosphorylation. A notable example of redox apoptotic signaling involves the serine-threonine kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). In the normal reducing environment of a cell, ASK1 activity is inhibited via binding to thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and glutathione S-transferases (45Cho S.G. Lee Y.H. Park H.S. Ryoo K. Kang K.W.

After direct or indirect oxidant stress (i.e. H2O2, TNF-α, glucose/serum deprivation, and heat shock), these proteins are oxidized forming intramolecular disulfide bonds, which result in a conformational change and dissociation from ASK1. Unbound ASK1 is then available to autophosphorylate and subsequently phosphorylate downstream kinases, initiating an apoptotic program. To extend our understanding of oxidant hypersensitivity in FA, we investigated whether primary Fancc -/- cells exhibit alterations in the redox-dependent ASK1 apoptotic pathway. Our data demonstrate that Fancc -/- cells exhibit ASK1 hyperactivation after H2O2 treatment. In addition, we show that enhanced H2O2-induced apoptosis in Fancc -/- cells is ASK1-dependent and that pretreatment with antioxidants preferentially protects Fancc -/- cells from apoptosis induced by H2O2 as compared with controls. Collectively, these data argue that the predisposition of primary Fancc -/- cells to oxidant-induced apoptosis is mediated through hyperactivation of a redox-dependent apoptotic signaling pathway. Mice—Fancc +/- mice in a C57Bl/6J genetic background were bred to generate Fancc -/- and wild type (WT) mice for hematopoietic progenitor assays and timed embryos for murine embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell lines as previously described (52Haneline L.S.

Cells from WT and Fancc -/- mice were resus-pended in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and then exposed to H2O2 (Sigma) for 1 h. After oxidant treatment, the cells were washed and plated in clonogenic assays as described previously (55Haneline L.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Cooper S. Hangoc G. Carreau M. Buchwald M. Clapp D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For hyperoxia exposure, low density mononuclear cells were placed in an airtight chamber before infusing with a gas mixture containing 50% O2, 5% CO2, and 45% N2 (Praxair, Indianapolis, IN). The chamber was then incubated for 4 or 16 h at 37 °C before the cells were harvested for clonogenic assays. An O2 analyzer was used to measure the O2 concentration before and after each incubation period (50 + 3%) to ensure an airtight culture system. Control cultures were incubated at 21% O2 for 4 or 16 h. MEF Survival Assays—MEFs were maintained as previously described (53Freie B. Li X. Ciccone S.L.M. Nawa K. Cooper S. Vogelweid C. Schantz L.

All of the studies were conducted in at least two or three different MEF cell lines/genotype, and only MEFs that were less than passage 5 were utilized. To assess H2O2 sensitivity, WT and Fancc -/- MEFs were cultured with H2O2 for 24 h before assessing viability by trypan blue exclusion. In some experiments, MEFs were pretreated with 20 μm selenomethionine (SeMet; Sigma) overnight or 4 mmN-acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma) for 1 h prior to culturing with H2O2. To evaluate apoptosis, MEFs were treated with 100 μm H2O2 for 4-6 h and analyzed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay as previously described (55Haneline L.S.

Early passage MEFs (P0-P1) were transduced with retroviral supernatants four times over 2 consecutive days in the presence of polybrene as previously described (52Haneline L.S. Li X. Ciccone S.L.M.

ASK1 in Vitro Kinase Assay—ASK1 kinase activity was determined by depriving MEFs of serum for 4 h followed by treatment with 100 μm H2O2 for 5 min. MEFs were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and lysed in nonionic lysis buffer. The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). The ASK1 immunoprecipitations were conducted using protein A Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-ASK1 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Immunobeads were subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction using either myelin basic protein (Sigma) or MKK4 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) as substrates for ASK1. The kinase mixtures contained 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m sodium orthovanadate, 1 m dithiothreitol, 30 mm β glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm MOPS, 1 μm ATP, and 10 μg of substrate/sample before adding 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample. The kinase reaction buffer was added to each sample and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of sample buffer. The protein samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to autoradiography. Western Blotting—Equivalent amounts of protein (200-500 μg) were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. For immunodetection of FANCC mutants, a primary rabbit anti-FANCC antibody, previously generated by our laboratory (52Haneline L.S. Li X. Ciccone S.L.M. Hong P. Yang Y. Broxmeyer H.E. Lee S.-H.

To document equal protein loading, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with β-actin (Sigma). For immunodetection of ASK1, rabbit anti-ASK1 antibody (Cell Signaling) was used at a 1:200 dilution before incubating with the secondary antibody anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:2000 dilution). Small Interfering RNA Transfection Protocol—Table I lists the RNA sequences used for these studies. The ASK1 siRNA sequence targeted nucleotides 570-590 of the ASK1 mRNA and was designed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Dharmicon, Lafayette, CO). Either sense or scrambled oligonucleotides were used as a control for every transfection experiment. WT and Fancc -/- MEFs were cultured in a 6-well tissue culture dish to 30-50% confluency. The RNA oligonucleotides were diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) to obtain a 250 nm solution per Dharmicon's recommendations. Oligofectamine transfections were conducted exactly per the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Following the transfection, 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 30% fetal calf serum was added without removing the transfection mixture. The cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C before harvesting for H2O2 cytotoxicity assays and ASK1 Western blotting.

Fancc -/- Hematopoietic Progenitors and MEFs Are Hyper-sensitive to Oxidants—Because FA patients have severe defects in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell function, we initially tested whether Fancc -/- progenitors were hypersensitive to oxidant stress. To accomplish this aim, WT and Fancc -/- BM low density mononuclear cells were cultured either with H2O2 or in hyperoxic conditions (50% O2) before plating in clonogenic progenitor assays. For studies utilizing H2O2, Fancc -/- progenitors were significantly more sensitive to multiple H2O2 doses as compared with controls (Fig. 1A). In addition, Fancc -/- progenitors exposed to 50% O2 for 4 or 16 h exhibited a marked reduction in colony formation as compared with WT control cultures (Fig. 1B). BM low density mononuclear cells are a heterogeneous cell population that includes a significant proportion of differentiated cells compared with the relatively low frequency of clonogenic progenitor cells (0.01-0.5%). Given our previous observations that Fancc -/- progenitors are exquisitely sensitive to multiple inhibitory cytokines such as interferon-γ and TNF-α (55Haneline L.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Cooper S. Hangoc G. Carreau M. Buchwald M. Clapp D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), together with the knowledge that inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes and granulocytes are major sources of secreted inhibitory cytokines, it was crucial to eliminate these differentiated cells from our culture system. To test whether the observed oxidant hypersensitivity was due to an intrinsic abnormality in Fancc -/- progenitor cells and not secondary to accessory cells present in BM low density mononuclear cell populations, WT and Fancc -/- ckit+lin- cells were purified by fluorescence cytometry, treated with 100 μm H2O2, and plated in colony assays. This phenotypically defined cell population enriches for immature hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and excludes differentiated progeny cells. Similar to prior studies with low density mononuclear cells, Fancc -/- ckit+lin- cells were hypersensitive to H2O2 (Fig. 1C), supporting an intrinsic hematopoietic progenitor cell defect. Because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers of primary hematopoietic progenitor cells, we established WT and Fancc -/- MEFs to utilize as a cellular model system for evaluation of alterations in oxidant responsiveness in Fancc -/- cells. Initial studies determined that Fancc -/- MEFs exh"

SOCS2 binds to the GH receptor and inhibits GH signaling, including attenuation of STAT5 activation. Here we describe a new function and mechanism of action for SOCS2. Overexpression of SOCS2 in central nervous system neurons promoted neurite outgrowth, and in PC12 cells, neurite outgrowth was induced under nondifferentiating conditions, leading to inhibition of the neurite-inhibitory GTPase Rho and activation of the neurite-promoting GTPase Rac1. Addition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors PP3 or AG490 or the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked the SOCS2-induced neurite outgrowth. The overexpressed SOCS2 bound to the EGFR, which was constitutively phosphorylated at Tyr845, the Src binding site. Overexpression of the phosphatase SHP-2 reduced the constitutive EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent neurite outgrowth. SOCS2 expression also resulted in a modest 30% decrease in phosphorylation of STAT5b at Tyr699, which is the primary site on STAT5 phosphorylated by GH; however, total tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was decreased by 75-80% under basal and epidermal growth factor-stimulated conditions.

Our findings suggest that SOCS2 regulates EGFR phosphorylation, leading to regulation of neurite outgrowth through a novel pathway that is distinct from GH. Neurite outgrowth is regulated by a variety of signaling mechanisms, including growth factors and soluble or membrane-bound guidance cues. Some signals mediate initiation of neurite outgrowth at the cell soma, whereas others direct the growing neurite along a particular pathway by signaling at the growth cone (1da Silva J.S. Dotti C.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Many of these signals ultimately converge upon the GTPases Rac1, RhoA, and cdc42 that signal to effector molecules to mediate cytoskeletal rearrangement (2Nikolic M. Int. J. Biochem.

SOCS proteins are primarily known as negative regulators of the Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway.

There are eight known members of the SOCS gene family (SOCS1-7 and CIS), which are expressed in different tissues, induced by different groups of cytokines, and regulate different Janus-activated kinase/STAT pathways (8Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, various members of the SOCS family have also been shown to interact with signal transduction pathways not associated with the Janus-activated kinase/STAT pathway, such as the receptor tyrosine kinases insulin-like growth factor receptor (9Dey B.R.

They have also been reported to interact with the GTPase-activating protein p120 RasGAP to enhance Ras activation (12Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that SOCS molecules may also regulate other GTPases to modulate cytoskeletal rearrangement and neurite outgrowth. SOCS2 is expressed in the nervous system during development from embryonic day 14 (E14) to postnatal day 8 (P8) in the mouse (14Polizzotto M.N. Bartlett P.F. Turnley A.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 423: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization analysis of SOCS2 expression in the developing forebrain showed that SOCS2 was expressed at moderate levels in cortical neuroepithelium and at higher levels in the newly postmitotic neurons of the cortical plate at E14 (14Polizzotto M.N. Bartlett P.F. Turnley A.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 423: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Expression of SOCS2 in the neural progenitor cells blocked the inhibitory effects of growth hormone (GH) signaling on differentiation of the progenitors into neurons, and as such, SOCS2 is a potent regulator of neuronal differentiation (15Turnley A.M. Faux C.H. Rietze R.L. Coonan J.R. Bartlett P.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The role of the higher level of SOCS2 expression in new neurons was unclear but suggested that SOCS2 may also contribute to neuronal function. We show here that SOCS2 is a potent inducer of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, a commonly used model of neuronal differentiation (16Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar), as well as in SOCS2-overexpressing central nervous system-derived neurons, increasing both primary neurite number and neurite length. Furthermore, we show that SOCS2 binds to and results in phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at Tyr845, the Src kinase binding site, and that over-expression of the SHP2 phosphatase blocks the SOCS2-induced EGFR activation and consequent neurite outgrowth. PC12 Culture and Transfection—PC12-Tet-On cells (Clontech) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, and 100 μg of G418 (Invitrogen) and differentiated by removal of serum and addition of 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF; Calbiochem) for 72 h. For stable transfections, the Tet-On tetracycline inducible system (Clontech) was used, and SOCS2 cDNA was subcloned into the vector pBi-EGFP (Clontech) to generate pBi-SOCS2-GFP, which results in expression of SOCS2 and GFP proteins when induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (DOX). All transfections were performed using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and vector pEGFP-c (Clontech) was used as a control. SHP1 and SHP2 expression plasmids and catalytically inactive mutants were a kind gift from Dr. Gen-Sheng Feng (Indiana University School of Medicine) and Dr. Stuart Frank (University of Alabama at Birmingham) (17Kim S.O. Jiang J. Yi W. Feng G.S. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2344-2354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PC12-Tet-On cells were plated on polyornithine (Sigma)-coated chamber slides (Falcon) at 1 × 104 cells/well in the presence or absence of serum, with the addition of 50 ng/ml NGF, 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; BD Biosciences), or various signal transduction pathway-modifying reagents such as 50 μm mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem), 1 μm Src inhibitor PP2 (Sigma), 3 μm EGFR kinase inhibitor PP3 (Sigma), or 100 nm EGFR kinase inhibitor AG490 (Calbiochem). At 72 h, cells were lysed for immunoprecipitation or Western analysis or fixed and immunostained using mouse anti-βIII-tubulin (1:2000; Promega) and anti-mouse Cy3 (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch) for analysis of neurite outgrowth. The percentage of total cells extending neurites was determined and expressed as mean ± S.E. of 10 fields/well in triplicate wells in at least n = 3 independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using the t test. Western Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were exposed to the indicated stimuli and then lysed essentially as described previously (15Turnley A.M. Faux C.H. Rietze R.L. Coonan J.R. Bartlett P.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For Western analysis, gel sample reducing buffer was added to cell lysates and boiled. For other experiments, an aliquot of lysates was taken for Western analysis, and the remainder of the lysate was used for immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling) or mouse anti-FLAG antibody (clone M2; 1:500; Sigma) using standard protocols. After electrophoresis and Western transfer, membranes were blocked for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 6% skim milk powder and then incubated with primary antibodies (mouse anti-GAP43 (1:2000; Sigma), mouse anti-β-actin (1:10,000; Sigma), rabbit anti-MAPK and rabbit anti-phospho-MAPK (each diluted 1:1000; Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-STAT5 (1:1000; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-EGFR (1:200; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-phospho-EGFR Tyr845 (1:1000; Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-EGFR Tyr1068 (1:1000; Cell Signaling)) followed by anti-mouse (1:40,000) or anti-rabbit (1:20,000) secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling). Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Autoradiographs were digitally scanned; the brightness/contrast was enhanced, and composite images were made using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 and Macromedia Freehand 10.0 software. Comparison of relative densities of individual bands compared with loading controls was determined using NIH Image software. Rac1/Rho Activation Assay—Cells were exposed to the indicated stimuli, and after treatment, cells were lysed in lysis buffer as described above. Endogenous Rho-GTP or Rac1-GTP was precipitated from cell lysates at 4 °C for 1 h using a glutathione S-transferase-tagged fusion protein corresponding to residues 7-89 of mouse Rhotekin Rho binding domain or a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the p21-binding domain (PBD) of human Pak1, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed with lysis buffer, and resuspended in sample buffer. The eluted protein samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Rho was detected using mouse anti-Rho antibody (1:500; Pierce), and Rac1 was detected using mouse anti-Rac1 antibody (1:1000; Pierce) overnight, followed by anti-mouse secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (1:40,000; Cell Signaling). Immunoreactive bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence as described above. Overexpression of SOCS2 Induces Differentiation and Neurite Outgrowth in PC12 Cells—PC12-Tet-On cells were stably transfected with tetracycline inducible SOCS2-GFP or GFP expression vectors (pBi-SOCS2-GFP and pBi-GFP). Induction of SOCS2 by the addition of DOX (Fig. 1A) resulted in variable induction of SOCS2-GFP in individual cells, ranging from undetectable to high levels of GFP expression. All results shown are from counts of total cell numbers, so that results were not biased to an arbitrary level of GFP expression and to allow direct comparison with the control GFP-transfected cells. Unlike control cells, under nondifferentiating conditions (high serum, no NGF) neurite formation was observed in ∼20% of all cells in the SOCS2-GFP-transfected cell lines (Fig. 1, B, C, and F); however, ∼100% of cells observed to express high levels of SOCS2-GFP showed neurite outgrowth (data not shown). Under these nondifferentiating conditions, there was no detectable neurite extension observed in the absence of the inducer DOX, and the pBi-SOCS2-GFP cells were indistinguishable from control cells transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 1F). When the PC12 cells were induced to differentiate by treatment with NGF in the absence of DOX, the pBi-SOCS2-GFP- and pBi-GFP-transfected cells behaved similarly, with ∼25-30% extending neurites (Fig. 1F). If DOX was added in the presence of NGF, however, ∼70% of SOCS2-overexpressing cells produced neurites, whereas the neurite outgrowth of the control cells remained at 25% (Fig. 1, D-F). Not only did over-expression of SOCS2 in the presence of NGF show a synergistic induction in the percentage of cells exhibiting neurite outgrowth, the neurites were longer and more numerous (Fig. 1, E and F). The mean neurite length at 72 h of SOCS2-expressing cells under basal conditions was 30 ± 1.02 μm, that of GFP-expressing cells with NGF was 53 ± 3.55 μm, and that of SOCS2-expressing cells in NGF was 64.4 ± 2.9 μm (mean ± S.E.; p = 0.01 for SOCS2 + NGF compared with NGF alone; p < 0.001 for SOCS2 + NGF compared with SOCS2 alone). SOCS2-expressing cells in NGF also had significantly more primary neurites per cell (3.94 ± 0.09; p < 0.001) than SOCS2-expressing cells under basal conditions (2.61 ± 0.09) or GFP-expressing cells in NGF (2.56 ± 0.11). Furthermore, SOCS2 overexpression also induced and up-regulated expression of GAP43, a neuronal marker associated with neurite outgrowth (Fig. 1G). Overexpression of SOCS2 therefore appeared to directly promote neurite outgrowth of a neural cell line by itself, as well as markedly potentiating the effects of the NGF differentiation stimulus. Overexpression of SOCS1 or SOCS3 in PC12 cells had no effect on neurite outgrowth (data not shown). SOCS2 Enhances Neurite Outgrowth in Central Nervous System Neurons—To confirm that the enhanced neurite outgrowth observed above was not only a property of PC12 cells, neurite outgrowth in SOCS2-overexpressing central nervous system neurons was measured. These neurons were differentiated from neural stem cells derived from the central nervous system of transgenic mice that overexpress SOCS2 driven off the human ubiquitin C promoter (SOCS2Tg), such that SOCS2 is expressed in most cell types (18Greenhalgh C.J. Metcalf D. Thaus A.L. Corbin J.E. Uren R. Morgan P.O. Fabri L.J. Zhang J.G. Martin H.M. Willson T.A. Billestrup N. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40181-40184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). SOCS2Tg and wild-type neurons were immunostained for the neuronal marker βIII-tubulin (Fig. 2, A and B), and the number of primary neurites, the longest neurite length, and total neurite length were measured. Although the length of the longest neurite on SOCS2Tg neurons was slightly but significantly increased (Fig. 2C), the mean total neurite length was markedly increased (Fig. 2D), and this was reflected in an increased number of primary neurites (Fig. 2E). Wild-type neurons had an average of 2.29 ± 0.08 neurites/cell, whereas SOCS2Tg neurons had an average of 4.32 ± 0.39 neurites/cell (mean ± S.E.; combined results of n = 3 experiments; p < 0.01). Therefore, SOCS2 is a potent inducer of neurite outgrowth, which is predominantly exhibited as an increased number of neurites, although SOCS2 also enhanced the length of these neurites. SOCS2 Requires EGFR and Src Kinase but not MAPK Activity to Induce Neurite Outgrowth—Neurite outgrowth is mediated by changes in cytoskeletal dynamics, regulated by activation of small GTPases such as Rho and Rac1. Accordingly, we analyzed lysates of control and SOCS2-PC12 cells for levels of total and activated Rho and Rac1. In SOCS2-overexpressing cells, Rho activation was inhibited, whereas Rac1 was activated (Fig. 3A). To determine the mechanism by which SOCS2 promoted neurite outgrowth, we examined activation of various signal transduction pathways thought to be involved in neurite outgrowth. Addition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002, the protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6976, or the phospholipase C γ inhibitors tyrphostin, AG879, or U73122 did not have any effect on the induction of neurite outgrowth by SOCS2 (data not shown). Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells is partly through sustained activation of p42/44 MAPK (19Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar); however, in this case, there was no difference in the level of p42/44 MAPK activation between control and SOCS2-PC12 cells. In cells exposed to DOX alone, the level of MAPK activation was low, and in the presence of NGF, p42/44 MAPK was phosphorylated at similar levels in both control and SOCS2-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Addition of PD98059, an inhibitor of the p42/44 MAPK pathway, did not significantly (p = 0.58) reduce the neurite outgrowth observed due to SOCS2 expression (Fig. 3C), although it inhibited NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in both control and SOCS2-expressing cells. Therefore, SOCS2 can induce primary neurite outgrowth in the absence of MAPK activation, although activation of the MAPK pathway by NGF appears to be required for full differentiation of the PC12 cells as shown above. Because several major signal transduction pathways did not appear to be involved in the SOCS2-induced neurite outgrowth, but Rac and Rho activation were altered, we examined factors upstream of Rac and Rho activation. Src kinase was a likely candidate because it has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth (20Yang L.T. Alexandropoulos K. Sap J. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and addition of the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked SOCS2-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3D). Interestingly PP3, which we initially used as a control for PP2, also blocked the SOCS2-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3D); however, PP3 is an ATP analogue that is also an EGFR inhibitor (25Traxler P. Bold G. Frei J. Lang M. Lydon N. Mett H. Buchdunger E. Meyer T. Mueller M. Furet P. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3601-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Addition of the EGFR inhibitor AG490 also blocked SOCS2-induced neurite outgrowth (data not shown). EGF induces neurite outgrowth through c-Src activation (20Yang L.T. Alexandropoulos K. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17406-17414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); however, in PC12 cells, EGF normally promotes proliferation, not differentiation and neurite outgrowth like NGF. EGF and NGF use many of the same signal transduction pathways; in PC12 cells, EGF elicits a short activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, whereas NGF induces sustained activation of this pathway (26Vaudry D. Stork P.J. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). However, in SOCS2-PC12 cells, EGF did not promote proliferation and instead further promoted SOCS2-induced neurite outgrowth, which was blocked by the addition of PP2 or PP3 (Fig. 3D). Activated STAT5 Levels Are Decreased in SOCS2-PC12 Cells—SOCS2 is primarily thought to inhibit STAT5 phosphorylation in response to GH signaling. In hepatocytes from SOCS2-/- mice, STAT5b phosphorylation in response to GH was moderately prolonged, and the overgrowth phenotype of the SOCS2-/- mice was abrogated in the absence of STAT5b (27Greenhalgh C.J. Bertolino P. Asa S.L. Metcalf D. Corbin J.E. Adams T.E. Davey H.W. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). STAT5b has also recently been shown to be activated downstream of EGFR signaling in a c-Src-dependent manner in fibroblasts and breast tumor cell lines (28Kloth M.T. Laughlin K.K. Biscardi J.S. Boerner J.L. Parsons S.J. Silva C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1671-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and in hepatocytes (29Guren T.K. Odegard J. Abrahamsen H. Thoresen G.H. Susa M. Andersson Y. Ostby E. Christoffersen T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, STAT5 phosphorylation and activation by EGF are quantitatively and qualitatively different from that induced by GH, which phosphorylates STAT5b at Tyr699. Analysis of STAT5 using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies has shown that EGF induces higher maximal levels of total STAT5 phosphorylation than GH, but that if an antibody to STAT5b phosphorylated on Tyr699 was used, then the EGF-induced phosphorylation was lower than GH-induced phosphorylation in hepatocytes (29Guren T.K. Odegard J. Abrahamsen H. Thoresen G.H. Susa M. Andersson Y. Ostby E. Christoffersen T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), indicating that sites other than Tyr699 were phosphorylated in response to EGF, such as Tyr725, Tyr740, and Tyr743, as shown previously in 293 cells (30Kloth M.T. Catling A.D. Silva C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8693-8701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether EGF induced phosphorylation of STAT5 in PC12 cells, whether it was primarily at sites other than Tyr699 as described above, and whether SOCS2 played any role in regulating such phosphorylation, we examined total and Tyr699 phosphorylation of STAT5 in control and SOCS2-PC12 cells. Under basal conditions, densitometric analysis revealed that total phosphorylated STAT5 levels in the SOCS2-PC12 cells were 20% that of GFP-expressing control PC12 cells (Fig. 4, top panel), as assessed by immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and then probing for total STAT5 by Western analysis. Re-probing the filters using a Tyr699-specific anti-phopho-STAT5b antibody showed a smaller difference (30% decrease) between SOCS2-overexpressing and control cells (Fig. 4, middle panel). GH did not induce phosphorylation of STAT5 in the PC12 cell lines (data not shown). Addition of EGF for 10 min enhanced total STAT5 phosphorylation, particularly in the control cells compared with SOCS2-expressing cells, but had little effect on Tyr699 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). As reported previously (28Kloth M.T. Laughlin K.K. Biscardi J.S. Boerner J.L. Parsons S.J. Silva C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1671-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Guren T.K. Odegard J. Abrahamsen H. Thoresen G.H. Susa M. Andersson Y. Ostby E. Christoffersen T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), this effect of EGF on STAT5 activation was at least partly due to Src signaling. Addition of PP2 inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation in control cells, although it did not further decrease STAT5 phosphorylation in SOCS2-PC12 cells (Fig. 4). Interestingly, inhibition of Src also inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation at Tyr699, and this effect was observed in both control and SOCS2-PC12 cells. There was no difference in the activation of STAT1 or STAT3 in either the control or SOCS2-PC12 cells under the conditions tested (data not shown). Therefore, EGF phosphorylates STAT5 in PC12 cells in a partially Src-dependent manner, primarily on sites other than the canonical Tyr699, and SOCS2 is more potent at inhibiting the phosphorylation at these other sites than at Tyr699. EGFR Phosphorylation Is Constitutive in SOCS2-overexpressing Cells—Given the decreased phosphorylation of STAT5 in SOCS2-PC12 cells, we expected that activation of the EGFR would be decreased. Surprisingly, analysis of EGFR phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, followed by blotting with anti-EGFR antibodies, showed that the EGFR was phosphorylated in SOCS2-PC12 cells under basal conditions, unlike control cells (Fig. 5A). Addition of EGF for 10 min increased the levels of EGFR phosphorylation in control cells but had little effect in SOCS2-PC12 cells (Fig. 5A). At least part of this phosphorylation, under basal conditions or with EGF, was likely to be due to Src activity (28Kloth M.T. Laughlin K.K. Biscardi J.S. Boerner J.L. Parsons S.J. Silva C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1671-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Guren T.K. Odegard J. Abrahamsen H. Thoresen G.H. Susa M. Andersson Y. Ostby E. Christoffersen T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Src phosphorylates the EGFR at Tyr845, and Western analysis of total cell lysates using an anti-phospho-EGFR Tyr845 antibody showed that the EGFR was phosphorylated at this site in SOCS2-PC12 cells (Fig. 5, A and B), but not in the presence of the Src inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 5B) or the EGFR inhibitor PP3 (data not shown). Other tyrosines on the EGFR (such as Tyr1068, which activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/MAPK pathway) were not significantly phosphorylated in the absence of EGF and showed no differential phosphorylation between control and SOCS2-PC12 cells (Fig. 5A). Total levels of EGFR were not significantly different between control and SOCS2-PC12 cells under the conditions examined. The NGF receptor (TrkA), which is another receptor tyrosine kinase involved in neurite outgrowth, was not constitutively phosphorylated by SOCS2. TrkA was phosphorylated at low levels in the absence of exogenous NGF and up-regulated by the addition of NGF; however, there was no differential phosphorylation between control and SOCS2-PC12 cells (Fig. 5C). Overexpression of SHP2 Phosphatase Blocks SOCS2-induced Neurite Outgrowth—One possible mechanism by which SOCS2 overexpression could result in constitutive EGFR phosphorylation was by binding to a phosphatase site on the EGFR and blocking phosphatase activity, as has been shown for SOCS2 and the GH receptor (18Greenhalgh C.J.

https://openalex.org/W1604721396,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-Smad signaling pathway inhibits the growth of human epithelial cells and plays a role in tumor suppression. The Smad4 gene is mutated or deleted in 50% of pancreatic cancers. In this study, the Smad4-null pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 was transfected with either the Smad4 expression vector or the empty vector and incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-beta. The cells were analysed using a cDNA microarray, which included 2280 named genes to screen for target genes regulated by TGF-beta in either a Smad4-dependent or -independent manner. The microarray and subsequent quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the Smad4-independent and -dependent signaling pathways driven by TGF-beta upregulated only one of the 2280 genes, respectively, suggesting that Smad4-independent signaling downstream of TGF-beta might be as widespread as Smad4-dependent signaling. In this study, we demonstrated that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1, which has been considered the major effector of the Smad-dependent growth inhibitory signal of TGF-beta, is upregulated in a Smad4-independent manner. The upregulation occurs through Smad2/3-dependent transcriptional activation of the p21/WAF1 promoter region. These results suggest a novel mechanism of gene regulation, that is, a novel signal mediator other than Smad4."
https://openalex.org/W2020659516,"The vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) gene locus contains eight exons that span 14 kb. Alternative splicing generates multiple, different mRNAs that in turn translate into at least five protein isoforms. While the canonical AUG start codon is located at position 1039 in exon 1, there also exists an upstream, in-frame CUG initiation codon that drives expression of L-VEGF, containing an additional 180 amino acids. Two separate internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) regulate the activity of each initiation codon. Thus the 5′-UTR of VEGF, which comprises the majority of exon 1, consists of IRES B, the CUG, IRES A, and the AUG, from 5′ to 3′. Previously, it has been shown that IRES B regulates initiation at the CUG and IRES A regulates AUG usage. In this study, we have found evidence that the exon content of the VEGF mRNA, determined through alternative splicing, controls IRES A activity. While the CUG is most efficient at initiating translation, transcripts that lack both exons 6 and 7 and therefore contain an exon 5/8 junction lack AUG-initiated translation. The process of splicing is not responsible for this start codon selection since transfection of genomic and cDNA VEGF sequences give the same expression pattern. We hypothesize that long range tertiary interactions in the VEGF mRNA regulate IRES activity and thus control start codon selection. This is the first report describing the influence of alternatively spliced coding sequences on codon selection by modulating IRES activity. The vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) gene locus contains eight exons that span 14 kb. Alternative splicing generates multiple, different mRNAs that in turn translate into at least five protein isoforms. While the canonical AUG start codon is located at position 1039 in exon 1, there also exists an upstream, in-frame CUG initiation codon that drives expression of L-VEGF, containing an additional 180 amino acids. Two separate internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) regulate the activity of each initiation codon. Thus the 5′-UTR of VEGF, which comprises the majority of exon 1, consists of IRES B, the CUG, IRES A, and the AUG, from 5′ to 3′. Previously, it has been shown that IRES B regulates initiation at the CUG and IRES A regulates AUG usage. In this study, we have found evidence that the exon content of the VEGF mRNA, determined through alternative splicing, controls IRES A activity. While the CUG is most efficient at initiating translation, transcripts that lack both exons 6 and 7 and therefore contain an exon 5/8 junction lack AUG-initiated translation. The process of splicing is not responsible for this start codon selection since transfection of genomic and cDNA VEGF sequences give the same expression pattern. We hypothesize that long range tertiary interactions in the VEGF mRNA regulate IRES activity and thus control start codon selection. This is the first report describing the influence of alternatively spliced coding sequences on codon selection by modulating IRES activity. Diverse roles have been found for VEGF 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; pRb, retinoblastoma; UTR, untranslated region; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; HA, hemagglutinin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; nt, nucleotide. 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; pRb, retinoblastoma; UTR, untranslated region; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; HA, hemagglutinin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; nt, nucleotide. in both physiological and pathological processes. These include roles in embryonic development, differentiation of the vascular system, wound healing, and reproductive functions. VEGF is a potent mitogen for endothelial cells and controls the initiation of blood vessel formation. In addition, VEGF has been shown to be involved in pathological angiogenic processes such as proliferative retinopathies, tumor growth, arthritis, psoriasis, and ischemia (for review, see Refs. 1Ferrara N. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 10-14Google Scholar, 2Ferrara N. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Google Scholar, 3Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Google Scholar). Expression of VEGF is subjected to regulatory mechanisms involving transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls. Alternative splicing of human VEGF generates six polypeptides with 121, 145, 165, 183, 189, and 206 amino acids (4Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A.

Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Google Scholar). The precise functions of all the different VEGF isoforms have not been defined. Most VEGF producing cells preferentially express VEGF121, 165, or 189 (120, 164, or 188 in mouse), which are considered the three major isoforms and exist as glycosylated dimers (9Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Leung D.W. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 18-32Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of VEGF145 and 206 is restricted to cells of placental origin (10Anthony F.W. Wheeler T. Elcock C.L. Pickett M. Thomas E.J. Placenta. 1994; 15: 557-561Google Scholar). The three major isoforms of VEGF show different properties with respect to receptor binding and extra-cellular localization. While VEGF121 is fully diffusible, VEGF165 and 189 are anchored to the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (ECM) through interactions with heparan sulfate containing molecules (11Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Google Scholar). While VEGF isoforms are functionally redundant in the processes leading to the initial formation of arch arteries (12Stalmans I. Lambrechts D. De Smet F. Jansen S. Wang J. Maity S.

Scambler P. Morrow B. Driscol D.A. Moons L. Esguerra C.V. Carmeliet G. Behn-Krappa A. Devriendt K. Collen D. Conway S.J. Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 173-182Google Scholar), they are expressed in distinct spatio-temporal patterns during embryonic development and in adult tissues (13Ng Y.S. Rohan R. Sunday M.E. Demello D.E. D'Amore P.A. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 112-121Google Scholar). Each isoform of VEGF contributes differentially to the process of tumor neo-vascularization, with the more soluble isoforms acting at more distal sites to promote vascular recruitment, and the more extracellular membrane-associated isoforms acting to promote local expansion of capillary beds (14Grunstein J. Masbad J.J. Hickey R. Giordano F. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7282-7291Google Scholar). The fact that the same VEGF isoform can have distinct activities at different anatomical sites suggests that the microenvironment of different tissues can dictate VEGF function (15Guo P. Xu L. Pan S. Brekken R.A. Yang S.T. Whitaker G.B. Nagane M. Thorpe P.E. Rosenbaum J.S. Su Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Cheng S.Y. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8569-8577Google Scholar). Different transgenic mice have been generated to express a single VEGF isoform. Mouse embryos expressing only VEGF120 (120/120) develop to term but die shortly after birth. 120/120 mice display vascular defects, including impaired post-natal cardiac angiogenesis, resulting in severe myocardial ischemia and early postnatal lethality. These mice also have impaired vascular development in their lungs (16Mattot V. Moons L. Lupu F. Chernavvsky D. Gomez R.A. Collen D. Carmeliet P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1548-1560Google Scholar). These studies show an essential role for the heparin sulfate binding VEGF isoforms in lung vascular development (17Galambos C. Ng Y.S. Ali A. Noguchi A. Lovejoy S. D'Amore P.A. DeMello D.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 194-203Google Scholar). Half of the 120/120 embryos die in the perinatal period due to congenital birth defects and the other half succumb within 2 weeks after birth, in part due to myocardial ischemia (18Carmeliet P. Ng Y.S. Nuyens D. Theilmeier G. Brusselmans K. Cornelissen I. Ehler E. Kakkar V.V. Stalmans I. Mattot V. Perriard J.C. Dewerchin M. Flameng W. Nagy A. Lupu F. Moons L. Collen D. D'Amore P.A. Shima D.T. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 495-502Google Scholar). While mice expressing only VEGF164 are normal (19Stalmans I. Ng Y.S. Rohan R. Fruttiger M. Bouche A. Yuce A. Fujisawa H. Hermans B. Shani M. Jansen S. Hicklin D. Anderson D.J. Gardiner T. Hammes H.P. Moons L. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Carmeliet P. D'Amore P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 327-336Google Scholar), half of the 188/188 mice die between E9.5 and E13.5. Taken together, these data suggest a requirement for the expression of multiple different VEGF isoforms for normal development. In addition to the AUG 1039 initiated isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, we and other laboratories demonstrated the existence both in vitro and in vivo, of the L-VEGF isoform initiated at the CUG 499, located 539 nucleotides upstream of the canonical AUG codon (20Tee M.K. Jaffe R.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 219-226Google Scholar, 21Meiron M. Anunu R. Scheinman E.J. Hashmueli S. Levi B.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1053-1060Google Scholar, 22Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Creancier L. Prats H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Google Scholar). Start codons selection is controlled by two independent internal ribosome entry sites (23Huez I. Creancier L. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Prats A.C. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6178-6190Google Scholar). The first identified IRES (IRES A) is located within the 300 nucleotides upstream of the AUG. IRES B located at the 5′-end of the mRNA controls translation initiation of L-VEGF at the CUG (22Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Creancier L. Prats H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Google Scholar, 23Huez I. Creancier L. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Prats A.C. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6178-6190Google Scholar). The 180 additional amino acids present in L-VEGF are highly conserved between mammals. L-VEGF is detectable in different mouse tissues and in COS-7 cells transfected with a full-length cDNA. L-VEGF is proteolytically processed leading to a 23-kDa N-terminal fragment of 206 amino acids, named N-VEGF, and a protein with a similar size to that of the canonical AUG-initiated VEGF (22Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Creancier L. Prats H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Google Scholar). While the C-terminal cleavage product of L-VEGF and the AUG-initiated VEGF are secreted, both the N-terminal fragment and intact L-VEGF, which contain a hydrophobic sequence, are retained in the Golgi apparatus (22Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Creancier L. Prats H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Google Scholar). In this study, we reveal a new level in the regulation of VEGF expression. VEGF can be synthesized by translation initiation at the AUG or through translation initiation at the CUG and proteolytic processing of the L-VEGF precursor. We report that the initiation of translation at both AUG and CUG codons is dependent on the exon content of the coding region. While translation initiation at the CUG is always efficient regardless of which splice variant is expressed, usage of the AUG depends on which exons are present in the mRNA. These data suggest for the first time that the structure of the VEGF mRNA, generated through alternative splicing, controls the selection of the translation initiation codon by modulating the activity of IRES A. Plasmid Constructions—The human VEGF189 coding sequence and the DNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-UTR of the messenger were kindly provided by J. Abraham (4Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Google Scholar). The constructs p5′ 121, p5′ 165, p5′ 189, and pVCmSP have already been described (22Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Creancier L. Prats H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Google Scholar). The mutation of the signal peptide was performed using the hybridizing PCR method previously described (22Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Creancier L. Prats H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added at the 3′-end of the VEGF cDNA by PCR of plasmids p5′ 121, p5′ 165, and p5′ 189 with primers VEGF5′ forward and EX8HA reverse (Table I). Each product was digested with DraIII and BamHI and cloned into DraIII- and BglII-digested pVCmSP creating the plasmids p121mSPHA, p165mSPHA, and p189mSPHA (Fig. 1, plasmids 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Each of these plasmids were digested with XbaI and NgoMIV, blunted by Klenow treatment and religated, generating plasmids that do not contain the VEGF 5′-UTR sequence, pAUG121mSPHA, pAUG165mSPHA, and pAUG189mSPHA (Fig. 1, plasmids 4, 5, and 6, respectively). The HA tag was added into exon 2 of each VEGF cDNA by PCR amplification of the p189mSPHA plasmid with the primers Sma forward and EX2HA reverse. This product was digested with SmaI and DraIII and cloned into SmaI- and DraIII-digested p5′ 121, p5′ 165 and p5′ 189 resulting in plasmids p121mSPHA2, p165mSPHA2, and p189mSPHA2 (Fig. 1, plasmids 7, 8, and 9, respectively).Table ISequence of oligonucleotides used for PCROligonucleotidesSequences (5′ → 3′)VEGF5′-forwardAAAATCTAGACCTCCGAAACCATGAACEX8HA reverseTTTGGATCCGGGCCCATCGATTATCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCACATSma forwardTGTGCGCAGACAGTGCTCEX2HA reverseGAAGATCTCACTTCGTGAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAATGATTCTGCCCTCCTCCTTVEGF3′-reverseTTTGAATTCTCACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCEX4 forwardCCAGATTATGCGGATCAAACCEX7 reverseCTCCGCTCTGAGCAAGGCCCACAGGGEX6 forwardGCGCAAGAAATCCCGGTATAAGTCCTGG3′-UTR forwardGACCCAGCACGGTCCCTC3′-UTR reverseGACAAGTTCTATTCGATCmATG1123 forwardGGCTGCACCCATTGCAGAAmATG1123 reverseTTCTGCAATGGGTGCAGCC Open table in a new tab The mutation of the initiation codons ATG1039 and ATG1123 into non-initiating codons in the chimeric VEGF-CAT sequence (pVCmSP-mAUG) has already been described (22Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Creancier L. Prats H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Google Scholar). We digested the plasmids p121mSPHA, p165mSPHA, and p189mSPHA with DraIII and XhoI for insertion into DraIII- and XhoI-digested pVCmSPmAUG to obtain p121mSPmAUGHA, p165mSPmAUGHA, and p189mSPmAUGHA, respectively (Fig. 2). The VEGF 3′-untranslated region was cloned from a human genomic DNA library with PCR using primers 3′UTR forward and reverse for insertion into vectors p5′ 121, p5′ 165, and p5′ 189 (ClaI and ApaI sites) to create p5′ 121 3′, p5′ 165 3′, and p5′ 189 3′. These plasmids were digested with ClaI and XhoI and cloned into ClaI- and XhoI-digested p121mSPHA, p165mSPHA and p189mSPHA creating plasmids p121mSPHA 3′, p165mSPHA 3′, and p189mSPHA 3′, respectively (Fig. 3). We substituted the CMV promoter in vectors p121mSPHA, p165mSPHA and p189mSPHA with the VEGF promoter to create pV121mSPHA, pV165mSPHA and pV189mSPHA. The vector pVEGF13 (pGL2-Basic vector containing the VEGF promoter sequence from -1176 to +54, kindly provided by G. Pages) was digested with Ecl136II and NheI. Plasmids p121mSPHA, p165mSPHA, and p189mSPHA were digested with AatII, blunted with Klenow, digested with BamHI and the 4-kb pair fragments were gel-purified. The vector p121mSPHA was digested with NheI/BamHI and the 740-bp fragment was also purified. Tri-molecular ligation of fragments Ecl136II/NheI (VEGF promoter corresponding fragment), NheI/BamHI (740 bp) and AatII-Klenow/BamHI (4 kbp) leads to the replacement of the CMV promoter by the VEGF promoter. The genomic sequence encompassing exon 4 to exon 8 was PCR-amplified in two fragments with primers EX4 forward/EX7rev and EX6 forward/EX8HA reverse, using genomic DNA from HeLa cells. The products named EX4–7 and EX6–8 were directly cloned in the TOPO cloning vector PCR2.1 (Invitrogen) leading to the pEX4–7 and pEX6–8 and sequenced. pEX4–7 was digested with BsmI and BamHI, pEX6–8 with BamHI and ClaI for insertion into BsmI and ClaI p121mSPHA vector to produce pminiVEGF (Fig. 4). The plasmids p121mSPHA, p165mSPHA and p189mSPHA were digested with NgoMI and XhoI and cloned into NgoMI- and XhoI-digested pCRVL2 (23Huez I. Creancier L. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Prats A.C. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6178-6190Google Scholar) to create pCRA121mSPHA, pCRA165mSPHA, and pCRA189mSPHA (Fig. 5, plasmids 1, 2, and 3). These plasmids were digested with XmaI and DraIII and ligated with the XmaI-DraIII-digested fragment of p189mSPmAUGHA (Fig. 2) containing the mutated AUG1039 and AUG1123 to create plasmids pCRA121mSPmAUGHA, pCRA1-65mSPmAUGHA and pCRA189mSPmAUGHA (Fig. 5, plasmids 1″, 2″, and 3″, respectively). The plasmids pCRA121mSPmAUG1123HA, pCRA165mSPmAUG1123HA, and pCRA189mSPmAUG1123HA containing mutated AUG1123 (1′, 2′, and 3′, respectively), were created using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) using plasmids pCRA121mSPHA, pCRA165mSPHA, and pCRA189mSPHA and primers mATG1123forward and mATG1123reverse.Fig. 5The IRES A activity is sensitive to alternatively spliced sequences. A, schematic representation of bicistronic constructs used for transfection experiments, pCRA121mSPHA, pCRA165mSPHA, and pCRA189mSPHA (numbered 1, 2, and 3). In these constructs the first cistron encodes the reporter gene Renilla luciferase and the second cistrons encode one of the three VEGF isoform (121, 165, and 189). The intercistronic region, responsible for translation of the second cistron, contains the VEGF IRES A sequence (23Huez I. Creancier L. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Prats A.C. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6178-6190Google Scholar) that does not contain any CUG initiating codon. Constructs 1′, 2′, and 3′ are identical to the constructs 1, 2, and 3 except that AUG1123 is mutated to a non-initiating AUU codon (named pCRA121mATG1123mSPHA, pCRA165mATG1123mSPHA, and pCRA189 mATG1123mSPHA). Constructs 1″, 2″, and 3″ contain the AUG1039 and 1123 mutated to non-initiating CCC and AUU codons (named pCRA121mATGsmSPHA, pCRA165mATGsmSPHA, and pCRA189mATGsmSPHA). For a more detailed description of all constructs, see “Materials and Methods.” B, expression of VEGF proteins from the downstream cistron. Cell extracts were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody (see “Materials and Methods”). The luciferase activity was measured to normalize sample loading on the 12.5% polyacrylamide gel to quantitate variations in VEGF isoform translation rather than differences in VEGF mRNA levels. Molecular weight markers are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). COS-7 (ATCC no. CRL 1654) is a monkey kidney cell line transformed by the simian virus 40 large T antigen. HeLa (ATCC no. CCL2) is a human uterus carcinoma cell line of epithelial origin. These cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with gentamicin, amphotericin, glutamine, and 5 or 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Each cell type was transfected with 5 μg of plasmid using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions, in 60-mm Petri dishes. Cells lysates were prepared for Western blot experiments 24 to 48 h after transfection. The 8 h cobalt chloride treatment (100 μm) (Sigma) and the cycloheximide treatment (100 μm) (Sigma) were initiated 24 h after transfection. Western Immunoblotting—Transfected cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol-containing sample buffer (1×) and subjected to sonication. Total proteins were quantified by the Bio-Rad assay (absorbance at 595 nm). The 30-μg protein samples were heated for 2 min at 95 °C and separated by 12.5% PAGE before being transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. HA-tagged VEGF proteins were detected using the HA antibody (monoclonal Ab HA.11, BabCO) (dilution 1:1000). HIF1α, Rb and β-actin proteins were each detected using specific antibodies (anti-HIF1α and anti-pRb from BD Biosciences and anti-β-actin from Sigma). Antibodies were detected using a chemiluminescence ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). UV Cross-linking Experiments—S10 cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells as already described (24Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Google Scholar). 1 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled in vitro transcribed RNA were incubated with 10 μg of S10 extract and UV-irradiated with an energy of 400,000 J/cm2 at 254 nm. The samples were then treated with 10 units of RNase One (Promega) at 37 °C for 30 min, before 12.5% PAGE analysis and autoradiography. In Silico Detection of Tertiary Interactions in VEGF mRNA Sequences— The eight exon sequences of human VEGF were used to construct FASTN formatted sequence files with programs developed with Gene-Huggers tools (25Iacovoni J.S. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2316-2318Google Scholar). In each sequence file, a 100 nucleotide fragment from exons 1 and 2 (beginning at the NheI site at position 745) are fused to either the exon 5/8 or 6/7 junction. The tag sequence XXXX was used to demarcate each fusion position. RNAmotif was then employed to find complementary subsequences with a descriptor that forced the tag sequence to exist in the loop region of a helix (26Macke T.J. Ecker D.J. Gutell R.R. Gautheret D. Case D.A. Sampath R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4724-4735Google Scholar). The best subsequences were extracted with GeneHuggers and subjected to a more complex descriptor that finds a helical region with at most three bulges on each side and calculates a combined free energy score for all helical regions. RNAmotif output was converted to the ct file format, and then naview and plt22ps were used to generate image files depicting each complementary region (27Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Google Scholar, 28Bruccoleri R.E. Heinrich G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 167-173Google Scholar). Differences in Protein Expression Pattern between the Three Major VEGF mRNA Splice Variants—Previously, we demonstrated that VEGF can be generated through both AUG initiated translation and cleavage of the L-VEGF precursor protein (22Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Creancier L. Prats H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Google Scholar), depicted in Fig 1A. In order to detect differences between translational initiation at the AUG and CUG codons for each VEGF mRNA splice variant, we constructed expression plasmids containing VEGF121, -165, or -189 with mutated signal peptide sequences (22Huez I. Bornes S. Bresson D. Creancier L. Prats H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2197-2210Google Scholar). This mutation abrogates the cleavage of CUG initiated L-VEGF into a 23-kDa N-terminal fragment (N-VEGF) and a peptide with a molecular weight indistinguishable from the AUG-initiated VEGF (Fig. 1A). Each mutant VEGF isoform is discernable from endogenous VEGF due to a C-terminal HA tag and is under the transcriptional control of a CMV promoter (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows that these three VEGF splice variants have distinct properties in terms of translation start site codon selection. In both HeLa and COS-7 cells, Western blots with the HA-antibody show that VEGF121 is exclusively expressed through initiation events utilizing the CUG start codon, which, due to the absent signal peptide, only generates the high molecular weight L-VEGF. In contrast, the VEGF189 splice variant leads to the production of more AUG-initiated protein and the VEGF165 splice variant produces equivalent amounts of each isoform. Another group has demonstrated that the large 47-kDa isoform of VEGF165 was predominantly produced after transient transfection in COS-1 cells as well as in an ovarian cancer cell line (20Tee M.K. Jaffe R.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 219-226Google Scholar). Two possibilities exist to explain the lack of the AUG-initiated VEGF121 isoform: inefficient protein synthesis and protein instability. To rule out these possibilities, the 1015 nucleotides upstream of the AUG were deleted from each plasmid, forcing the translation of the tagged protein in a cap-dependent manner. As shown in lanes 4, 5, and 6 of Fig. 1C, these three VEGF isoforms are capable of being synthesized and accumulate to equivalent amounts in COS-7 cells. In order to check if the position of the HA tag influences the choice of the initiation codon, we inserted the HA sequence in the exon 2 of the VEGF cDNAs (Fig. 1D). As seen previously, the plasmid p121-mSPHA2 leads to the exclusive expression of the 42 kDa CUG initiated isoform whereas the constructs p165mSPHA2 and p189mSPHA2 express both isoforms. The change of the HA tag position in the VEGF sequence does not lead to any modification of the protein expression pattern. Despite the mutation of the signal peptide sequence, it may in fact be possible that the low molecular weight isoforms detected by Western blotting are cleavage products and not actually AUG-initiated translation products. Therefore, we mutated both AUG start codons, at positions 1039 and 1123 and repeated the above described expression analyses. The constructs shown in Fig. 2A were transfected into COS-7 cells for Western blotting with HA antibody (Fig. 2B). The complete disappearance of low molecular weight VEGF protein demonstrates that the previously detected proteins of these sizes were AUG initiated translation products and not the results of L-VEGF proteolysis. To further investigate if the lack of the VEGF121 AUG-initiated form (Fig. 1C, lane 1) is not due to a higher instability of this isoform, cells were transfected with VEGF cDNAs that begin just upstream the AUG1039 codon. Then, cells were treated by cycloheximide for different times. To control the efficiency of the translational blockade, and provide evidence of the reliability of this experiment, we have analyzed pRB stability. Results shown in Fig. 2C are in good agreement with pRb half-life described in the literature (about 5 h in this cell type) (29Stubdal H. Zalvide J. Campbell K.S. Schweitzer C. Roberts T.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4979-4990Google Scholar, 30Helt A.M. Galloway D.A. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 159-169Google Scholar). In these conditions, the half-lives of the VEGF121, 165, and 189 AUG-initiated proteins are very similar (Fig. 2C), indicating that the difference in the VEGF expression pattern is not due to a differential stability of the three isoforms. Initiation Codon Selection Is Not Dictated by Hypoxia, the 3′-UTR, or the VEGF Promoter—VEGF is transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally up-regulated by hypoxia (31White F.C. Carroll S.M.

Therefore we were interested in whether or not selection between CUG and AUG translation initiation also is influenced by hypoxic conditions. By treating cells transfected with the constructs shown in Fig. 3A, with cobalt chloride for 8 h to mimic hypoxia, Western blotting revealed that such treatment has no effect on initiation codon selection (Fig. 3B). Since hypoxia increases the stability of VEGF mRNA through AU-rich sequences in its 3′-UTR, we investigated initiation codon choice using constructs containing the VEGF 3′-UTR sequence (Fig. 3A). Western blots of transfected COS-7 cells probed with the HA antibody revealed the same expression pattern as seen in experiments without the VEGF 3′-UTR sequence (Fig. 3C). Finally, we replaced the CMV promoter with the VEGF promoter and repeated these experiments. Again, as shown in Fig. 3D, constructs containing the VEGF promoter, did not respond differently to hypoxic stimuli. These data confirm that the selection of initiation codon is not influenced by hypoxia, by the presence of the 3′-untranslated region, or the VEGF promoter. Minigene Construct Transfection Gives Results Similar to cDNA Transfection—The coding region of the VEGF gene spans 14 kb and contains 8 exons (4Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Google Scholar). Through alternative mRNA splicing, the VEGF isoforms differ by the presence or absence of sequences encoded by exons 6 and 7. Previously, we have determined protein expression patterns using cDNA constructs that represent the end products of VEGF splicing pathways. By replacing the cDNA sequence between exons 4 and 8 with the genomic sequence, we were able to examine these protein expression patterns in a more natural context (Fig. 4A). While VEGF 189 was undetectable in both HeLa and COS-7 cells, results obtained with VEGF121 and -165 parallel those seen with the cDNA constructs. This result is in agreement with the literature which states that most cell types predominantly produce VEGF121 and -165 isoforms (35Yue X. Tomanek R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

https://openalex.org/W1990323281,"B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member whose physiological role remains unclear. BCMA has been implicated as a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B cell-activating factor (BAFF), tumor necrosis factor ligands that bind to multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor and have been reported to play a role in autoimmune disease and cancer. The results presented herein provide a dual perspective analysis of BCMA binding to both APRIL and BAFF. First, we characterized the binding affinity of monomeric BCMA for its ligands; BAFF binding affinity (IC50 = 8 ± 5 μm) is about 1000-fold reduced compared with the high affinity interaction of APRIL (IC50 = 11 ± 3 nm). Second, shotgun alanine scanning of BCMA was used to map critical residues for either APRIL or BAFF binding. In addition to a previously described “DXL” motif (Gordon, N. C., Pan, B., Hymowitz, S. G., Yin, J., Kelley, R. F., Cochran, A. G., Yan, M., Dixit, V. M., Fairbrother, W. J., and Starovasnik, M. A. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 5977-5983), the alanine scanning results predicted four amino acid positions in BCMA (Tyr13, Ile22, Gln25, and Arg27) that could impart ligand specificity. Substitution of Tyr13 was tolerated for BAFF binding but not APRIL binding. Arg27 was required for high affinity binding to APRIL, whereas substitutions of this residue had minimal effect on affinity for BAFF. Further phage display experiments suggested the single mutations of I22K, Q25D, and R27Y as providing the greatest difference in APRIL versus BAFF binding affinity. Incorporation of the Q25D and R27Y substitutions into BCMA produced a dual specificity variant, since it has comparable binding affinity for both APRIL and BAFF, IC50 = 350 and 700 nm, respectively. Binding of the I22K mutant of monomeric BCMA to BAFF was undetectable (IC50 > 100 μm), but affinity for binding to APRIL was similar to wild-type BCMA. Based on these results, a BCMA-Fc fusion with the single I22K mutation was produced that binds APRIL, IC50 = 12 nm, and has no measurable affinity for BAFF. These results suggest that APRIL is the preferred ligand for BCMA and show that specificity can be further modified through amino acid substitutions.

The tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; BCMA, B cell maturation antigen; TACI, transmembrane activator and CAML interactor; BAFF, B cell-activating factor; BR3, BLyS (BAFF) receptor 3; ECD, extracellular domain; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NNS, (A/C/GT) (A/C/G/T) (G/C) codon. 1The abbreviations used are: TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; BCMA, B cell maturation antigen; TACI, transmembrane activator and CAML interactor; BAFF, B cell-activating factor; BR3, BLyS (BAFF) receptor 3; ECD, extracellular domain; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NNS, (A/C/GT) (A/C/G/T) (G/C) codon. are a superfamily of transmembrane receptors involved in cell communication within the immune system. TNFR family members are structurally characterized by extracellular cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) that form ligand-binding motifs. Family members can be further classified based on intracellular domains that can either stimulate apoptosis through a death domain or cell proliferation through a TNF receptor-associated factor binding motif (1Bodmer J.L.

Downstream signaling for this subgroup of the TNFR superfamily activates the NF-κB intracellular pathway, often via TNF receptor-associated factors, ultimately resulting in cell proliferation (1Bodmer J.L.

The corresponding TNF ligands share a common structural motif called the TNF homology domain, in the form of a β sheet jelly roll, through which the ligands trimerize for receptor activation. TNF family members are expressed in a membrane-bound form but can undergo proteolysis to produce an active soluble trimer. Generally, members of the TNFR superfamily found on B or T cells are type I transmembrane proteins that have several CRDs (1Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). There are, however, receptors in a subgroup that are expressed by B cells, are type III transmembrane proteins, and contain a reduced number of CRDs: B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI), and BLyS (BAFF) receptor 3 (BR3, also called BAFF-R) (4Gross J.A.

The extracellular domain (ECD) of TACI contains two CRDs, the BCMA ECD comprises one CRD, and the ECD of BR3 contains only a partial CRD. Together with the receptor (Fn14) for the TWEAK ligand, BCMA and BR3 are the smallest members of the TNFR superfamily. Since TACI, BCMA, and BR3 lack an intracellular death domain, it is believed that these receptors are involved in cell survival, proliferation, and/or differentiation. Specifically, recent in vitro studies of BCMA presented evidence for the BCMA intracellular region interacting with TNF receptor-associated factors, leading toward downstream activation of NF-κB, ELK-1, c-Jun, and p38 pathways (3Hatzoglou A.

BCMA homozygous knockout mice, however, show no distinct phenotype, suggesting a redundant or nonessential role for this receptor (9Schiemann B. Gommerman J.L. Vora K. Cachero T.G. Shulga-Morskaya S.

In contrast, recent in vivo studies with TACI reveal its critical role in B cell homeostasis and mice harboring a knockout of the TACI gene develop a fatal, lupus-like autoimmune disease (11Seshasayee D.

A mouse strain expressing a BR3 receptor having intact extracellular and transmembrane domains but a disrupted intracellular domain, and thus defective for downstream signaling, has a significantly reduced number of mature peripheral B cells (7Thompson J.S.

Thus, BR3 appears to be essential for B cell survival, TACI is important for modulating the B cell population, and the physiological role of BCMA is unclear. The TNF family member BAFF is the only known ligand for BR3. BAFF-dependent B cell proliferation appears to require BR3; however, BAFF has also been reported to bind TACI and BCMA (6Shu H.B.

Based on their roles in B cell-mediated immunity, these ligands (BAFF and APRIL) and their corresponding three receptors (BR3, BCMA, and TACI) provide likely targets for disease therapy. For example, studies by Kayagaki et al. (21Kayagaki N. Yan M. Seshasayee D. Wang H. Lee W. French D.M. Grewal I.S. Cochran A.G. Gordon N.C. Yin J. Starovasnik M.A. Dixit V.M.

In light of the receptor cross-reactivity, an APRIL-specific receptor would be a useful laboratory diagnostic tool or even a therapeutic agent; however, an APRIL-specific receptor has not yet been characterized. Given that TNF ligands are trimeric and can bind three molecules of the corresponding receptor, there may be significant differences in apparent affinity between ligands binding to receptors in monovalent versus multivalent forms. Previous reports of binding affinities suggest that BAFF-BCMA has nanomolar affinity; however, these studies used a bivalent receptor-Fc fusion construct that could result in measured affinities that are enhanced by avidity (5Marsters S.A.

In this study, we characterized the APRIL and BAFF binding affinities of the extracellular domains of monomeric BCMA, BCMA-Fc, and BR3-Fc in order to determine the role that avidity could play in ligand-binding affinity. Furthermore, we have performed an alanine scan (22Sidhu S.S. Weiss G.A. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the BCMA ECD in order to identify the residues determining specificity for binding to APRIL or BAFF. Finally, based on the alanine scan results, we produced a BCMA-Fc fusion with a single point mutation in the BCMA ECD, I22K, that maintains high affinity for APRIL but has no measurable binding to BAFF. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), Streptavidin peroxidase (Roche Applied Science), IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), Protease Complete (Roche Applied Science), anti-M13-horse-radish peroxidase (Roche Applied Science), sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce).

APRIL Expression and Purification—A PCR product coding for amino acids Lys104-Leu241 of murine APRIL was subcloned into the XbaI/NotI sites of a modified pET-32a vector with a deleted S-Tag and enterokinase site to generate an N-terminal thioredoxin fusion protein. The pET-32a-APRIL(Lys104-Leu241) was transformed into Origami (DE3) competent cells (Novagen). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown at room temperature in LB medium with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin to an A600 of 0.8 with vigorous shaking. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm for induction, and cultures were grown overnight at 25 °C. One liter of frozen cell pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine) with 5 mm imidazole and placed on ice for 30 min. Cells were homogenized by passage through a microfluidizer and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 45 min. Supernatant was loaded onto a 3-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen), washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A with 10 mm imidazole, and eluted with 10 column volumes of Buffer A with 300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing thioredoxin-APRIL fusion protein were pooled, concentrated, and purified by Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography. Baculovirus Expression and Purification of BCMA ECD—DNA coding for residues 4-53 of the human BCMA ECD was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the vector pET15b (Novagen) using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites to introduce an N-terminal His tag and a thrombin cleavage sequence preceding the BCMA coding region. This His-tagged BCMA construct was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcGP67B (Pharmingen) using the BamHI and NotI restriction sites. The transfer vector was co-transfected with BaculoGold DNA into Sf9 cells, and recombinant virus was subsequently isolated and amplified to facilitate protein production. After 3 days of growth of virally infected Hi5 cells at 27 °C, His-tagged protein was purified from the culture medium by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as described previously (26Hymowitz S.G.

N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry were used to confirm the proper identity of the purified protein and the presence of both glycosylated and nonglycosylated species in the purified protein pool, respectively. BCMA-Fc Expression and Purification—DNA encoding the ECD (residues 5-51) of hBCMA was fused to hFc to form a fusion construct in the pRK vector and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as previously described (5Marsters S.A.

Site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange™ method) was used to introduce the single mutant I22K in the hBCMA-hFc fusion construct. Escherichia coli 294 cells were transformed with the pRK-hBCMA-hFc plasmid for large scale production of plasmid DNA. Transient transfections of the plasmid in HEK 293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) produced secreted BCMA-Fc protein. The BCMA-Fc was purified from the HEK 293 growth medium by affinity chromatography using Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) resin. Phage Display of BCMA—An initial vector for phage display of the BCMA extracellular domain was prepared by PCR subcloning of the fragment encoding residues 5-50 into the phagemid sTF-g3 (27Lee G.F.

The resulting construct (BCMA1-g3) contained residues 5-50 fused at the C terminus to a tripeptide (G-S-A) linker and an amber stop codon followed by the C-terminal half of the M13 p3 coat protein. The bacterial signal sequence stII was joined to the N terminus of BCMA with an inserted Ser residue comprising the P1′ cleavage site for the signal peptidase. Expression was driven by the alkaline phosphatase promoter. Phagemid BCMA2-g3 was prepared by using site-directed mutagenesis (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) to insert the peptide epitope (MADPNRFRGKDLGG) for an antibody (3C8:2F4; Genentech, Inc.) between the P1 and P1′ residues of the signal sequence cleavage site. BCMA2-g3 phagemid was used to prepare two “shotgun alanine” scanning libraries essentially as described previously (29Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A shotgun alanine codon will code for the wild-type residue, alanine, or one of two additional substitutions in certain cases, due to codon degeneracy, at a given position. Each of these libraries, prepared separately, contains shotgun codons at unique positions. Library 1 has shotgun codons at positions 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19; library 2 has shotgun codons at positions 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36. Each library contained at least 1 × 1011 phage/ml, allowing for complete representation of the theoretical diversity (>105-fold excess) (library 1 codes 1.1 × 106 unique sequences, and library 2 codes 5.2 × 105 unique sequences). Library Sorting and Analysis—Phage from each of the libraries described above were subjected to rounds of binding selection against either BAFF, APRIL, or anti-tag antibody (3C8:2F4; Genentech, Inc.) immobilized on 96-well Nunc Maxisorp immunoplates (30Sidhu S.S. Biomol Eng. 2001; 18: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin-coated wells were used to determine nonspecific background binding. Phage eluted from each target were propagated in E. coli XL1-Blue in the presence of M13K07 helper phage; amplified phage were used for selection against the same target in the previous round. Phage sorting was stopped, generally at round 2 or 3, when 100-fold enrichment was obtained. Enrichment was calculated from the ratio of the phage titer eluted from the target-coated wells to the phage titer eluted from the bovine serum albumin-coated wells. Individual clones from each library and selection target were then grown in a 96-well format in 400 μl of 2YT medium supplemented with carbenicillin and KO7 helper phage. Phage ELISA assays (29Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) were performed to detect phage-displayed variants of BCMA ECD capable of binding BAFF, APRIL, or anti-tag antibody. All clones tested that were found to be positive in their respective ELISAs were then sequenced as described previously (30Sidhu S.S. Biomol Eng. 2001; 18: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Sequences of acceptable quality were translated and aligned. For selection of binding to BAFF, 40 and 47 sequences were analyzed for libraries 1 and 2, respectively. For selection of binding to APRIL, 44 and 46 sequences were analyzed from libraries 1 and 2, respectively. For the display selection, binding to anti-tag antibody, a minimum of 40 sequences were analyzed for each library. To quantify the effect of each mutation on ligand binding, normalized frequency ratios (F) for each amino acid position were calculated from a ratio of ligand selection to display efficiency selection, as described previously (31Skelton N.J. Koehler M.F. Zobel K. Wong W.L. Yeh S. Pisabarro M.T. Yin J.P. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7645-7654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). NNS Library Construction and Sorting—The BCMA2-g3 phagemid was used to prepare a library having complete randomization (NNS degenerate codon as defined by IUB code (23Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) of residues Leu18, Ile22, Gln25, and Arg27. The library contained 1 × 1010 phage/ml, allowing complete representation of the library, theoretically 1 × 106 unique members. This library was sorted as described for the shotgun alanine libraries. Since each amino acid position selected for NNS codon introduction has the potential of all 20 amino acids from 31 triplet codons, the data are weighed according to codon degeneracy by calculating the ratio of percentage of occurrence to percentage of degeneracy of the amino acid at a given position as suggested previously (32LaBean T.H. Kauffman S.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The normalized F′ value is the percentage of occurrence to percentage of degeneracy ratio for ligand selection divided by the percentage of occurrence to percentage of degeneracy ratio for display efficiency. Expression and Purification of BCMA-Z Fusion Proteins—Plasmid BCMA-Z, designed to express a protein fusion of BCMA ECD (residues 5-50) and the Z domain of protein A (33Nilsson B. Moks T. Jansson B. Abrahmsen L. Elmblad A. Holmgren E. Henrichson C. Jones T.A. Uhlen M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) was constructed by using PCR to replace the amber stop and gene 3 portion of BCMA1-g3 with the Z domain fragment from plasmid pZCT (34Starovasnik M.A. O'Connell M.P. Fairbrother W.J. Kelley R.F. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as described (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) to generate point mutations and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. BCMA-Z fusion proteins were expressed by secretion from E. coli and purified by chromatography on IgG-Sepharose as described previously (35Starovasnik M.A. Skelton N.J. O'Connell M.P. Kelley R.F. Reilly D. Fairbrother W.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15558-15569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). BCMA-Z proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR column. BCMA-Z had an elution volume from the S-100 column between that of soluble human tissue factor (Mr 24,800) and E. coli thioredoxin (Mr 11,675). A molar mass of 12,000, consistent with the monomer MW of 13017 calculated from the amino acid sequence, was calculated from light scattering data collected on a mini-DAWN detector (Wyatt Technologies). Amino acid analysis was performed on the purified BCMA-Z to determine the extinction coefficient (ϵ280 = 9832 m-1 cm-1). Competitive Displacement ELISA—Receptors were tested for binding to either APRIL or BAFF in a competition ELISA assay. A 100-μl solution of carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) containing 2 μg/ml target ligand, either APRIL or BAFF, was coated on Nunc Maxisorp 96-well plates overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h with 200 μl of 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. In one set of experiments, 0.2 μg/ml of BCMA-Z was ad"

Our time-domain experiments enable direct experimental study of the electron dynamics at the classical limit of a two-electron atom. As an example, we look at the mechanism of autoionization for one two-electron configuration class and find that the doubly excited atom decays through a single violent electron-electron collision rather than a gradual exchange of energy between the electrons."

https://openalex.org/W2122751497,"In this study, we describe novel functions of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Bcl-xL and E1B-19K were found to inhibit p53-induced irreversible growth arrest and senescence, but not to inhibit transient growth arrest, implying that Bcl-xL and E1B-19K are specifically involved in senescence without participating in growth arrest. We provide several lines of evidences showing that the functions of Bcl-xL and E1B-19K to prevent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important to inhibit senescence induction. First, we found that that ROS are increased during p53-induced senescence. Moreover, Bcl-xL and E1B-19K inhibit this p53-induced ROS generation. Second, antioxidants prevent the induction of senescence and ROS by p53, but not the persistence of the senescence phenotype. Third, the anti-senescence functions of Bcl-xL and E1B-19K were suppressed by adding exogenous ROS. These results suggest that Bcl-xL and E1B-19K inhibit senescence induction by preventing ROS generation. Furthermore, p38 kinase was found to be activated during p53-induced senescence, but not in cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K, or in cells treated with anti-oxidants. Consistently, a chemical inhibitor of p38 kinase, SB203580, was found to inhibit p53-induced senescence, but only when treated before the cellular commitment to senescence, implying that p38 kinase is necessary for senescence induction. Therefore, Bcl-xL and E1B-19K inhibit p53-induced senescence by preventing ROS generation, which in turn leads to the activation of p38 kinase. These results also suggest that the oncogenic potential of Bcl-2 is due to its ability to inhibit senescence as well as apoptosis.

These results also suggest that the oncogenic potential of Bcl-2 is due to its ability to inhibit senescence as well as apoptosis. Bcl-2 was originally identified at the chromosomal break point of t(14;18)-bearing B-cell lymphoma (1Tsujimoto Y. Gorham J. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C.M. Science. 1985; 229: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 2Bakhshi A. Jensen J.P. Goldman P. Wright J.J. McBride O.W. Epstein A.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

A. 1985; 82: 7439-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 has been shown to contribute to neoplastic cell expansion by preventing normal cell turnover caused by physiological cell death mechanisms (4Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1331-1336PubMed Google Scholar, 5Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family includes both death antagonists such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and E1B-19K and death agonists such as Bax, Bak, Bid, and Bad (6Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). High levels of Bcl-2 expression are found in a wide variety of human cancers (7Reed J.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2941-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression levels of Bcl-2 proteins correlate with relative resistance to a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs (8Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Blood. 1993; 81: 151-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise biochemical function of Bcl-2 family proteins remains controversial, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL exert at least some of their anti-apoptotic effect by regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, such as regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential and maintenance of mitochondrial-cytosolic coupling of oxidative phosphorylation (9Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar, 10Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). There are also some indications that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL may function as anti-oxidants and in this way exert anti-apoptotic activity. Bcl-2 knockout mice are hypopigmented due to a defect in melanin synthesis, which itself is redox-regulated (11Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Moreover, enhanced oxidative stress and a higher susceptibility to pro-oxidants are evident in the brains of Bcl-2 knockout mice compared with control mice (12Hochman A. Sternin H. Gorodin S. Korsmeyer S. Ziv I. Melamed E. Offen D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 protects cells from hydrogen peroxide- or thiol depletion-induced death and suppresses lipid peroxidation (13Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Therefore, it is likely that Bcl-2 maintains cells in a more reduced state by scavenging ROS 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PDTC, 1-pyrrolydine dithiocarbamate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; t-BTH, tert-butyl-H2O2; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase. either directly or by up-regulating other ROS scavengers such as thiol compounds. Alternatively, or in addition, Bcl-2 functions to prevent the generation of ROS induced by various environmental stresses (13Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Biophys. 1997; 344: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The proliferative lifespan of normal mammalian cells is limited by replicative senescence (17Campisi J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 703-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 18Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5527) Google Scholar), a process that appears to be primarily mediated by gradual shortening of telomeres (19Shay J.W. J. Clin. Pathol. 1997; 50: 799-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Senescent cells withdraw irreversibly from the cell cycle but remain viable indefinitely and display characteristic phenotypic markers, such as enlarged and flattened morphology, irreversible growth arrest, and expression of the senescence-associated (SA)-β-galactosidase activity at pH 6.0 (20Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that expression of ras and raf onco-genes can induce a rapid onset of replicative senescence in normal fibroblast cells associated with induction of p53, p21, p16, and hypophosphorylation of Rb protein (21Zhu J.

Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar), implicating that replicative senescence, like apoptosis, is a programmed response of the organism to potentially oncogenic impact. Tumor cells are capable of extended proliferation as if the capability to become senescent has been somehow repressed or lost. Recently we and other groups have reported that certain tumor cells enter into senescence state by expression of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 (23Shin D.Y. Sugrue M.M. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A.

Although these studies suggest that tumor suppressor genes are essential for oncogene-induced senescence in normal HDF and their expression can induce senescence in human tumor cells, detailed mechanisms of senescence induction have not been understood. There is therefore a great deal of interest in identifying genes that are involved in tumor suppressor gene-induced senescence. In this study, we demonstrated that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins inhibit p53-induced senescence and addressed the potential mechanisms involved. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—EJ human bladder carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin (50 units/ml). To establish EJ cells expressing Bcl-xL and E1B-19K, we transfected cells with pPuro-Bcl-xL and pPuro-E1B-19K and selected individual clones of stable transfectants (designated EJBcl-xL and EJ-E1B-19K, respectively) for further analysis. SA-β-Galactosidase Staining—Cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS/2 mm MgCl2 for 20 min at room temperature. SA-β-galactosidase activity at pH 6.0 was detected as reported previously (20Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in EBC lysis buffer (50 μm Tris-Hcl, pH 8, 120 μm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm sodium fluoride) 2 μm sodium vanadate, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin) (24Jung M.S. Yun J. Chae H.D. Kim J.M. Kim S.C. Choi T.S. Shin D.Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5818-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Protein quantification was performed using the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Approximately 40 μg of total cell protein per sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filter was then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk/0.1% Tween/Tris-buffered saline followed by incubation with each antibody and immunodetection using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL). p53, p21, and actin proteins were detected by DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), WAF-1 (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA), C-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p-p38 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), p38 (sc-728, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and p-ATF-2 (Cell Signaling Technology), respectively. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—EJ cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding p53 (Ad-p53) or control virus (Ad-ΔE1) were seeded on coverslips at time 0. At 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days, cells on each cover glass were labeled for 1 h with 10 μm BrdUrd (cell proliferation kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and fixed with acetic acid/ethanol. BrdUrd-incorporated cells were counted after detection as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of ROS Levels—Cells were incubated with 10 μm dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) for 30 min, then washed with PBS, trypsinized, and collected in 1 ml of PBS. Fluorescence-stained cells were transferred to polystyrene tubes with cell-strainer caps (Falcon) and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS, BD Biosciences FACScan) using Cell Quest 3.2 (BD Biosciences) software for analysis. Bcl-2 Family Proteins Inhibit p53-induced Senescence—To examine whether Bcl-2 family proteins affect senescence, we employed EJ cells, in which p53 expression triggers a rapid onset of senescence (23Shin D.Y. Sugrue M.M. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Jung M.S. Yun J. Chae H.D. Kim J.M. Kim S.C. Choi T.S. Shin D.Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5818-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We first established human bladder cancer cells, EJ expressing Bcl-xL and E1B-19K and named them EJ-Bcl-xL and EJ-E1B-19K, respectively (Fig. 1A). These cells were resistant to apoptotic stimuli, such as staurosporine and tumor necrosis factor α treatments (data not shown). To examine whether Bcl-2 family proteins affect p53-induced senescence, we infected EJ cells expressing Bcl-2 family proteins as well as cells of EJ cell line itself with a recombinant adenovirus encoding p53, and then examined SA-β-galactosidase activity, a specific cytoplasmic marker for senescent cells (20Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Whereas a majority of EJ cells showed SA-β-galactosidase activity in a manner dependent on virus titers 6 days after infection with p53-adenovirus, cells expressing Bcl-2 family proteins had reduced levels of SA-β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1B). Consistent with SA-β-galactosidase activity, the morphological characteristics of senescent cells, large and flat morphology, were found in EJ cells infected with p53-adenovirus, but were rarely observed in EJ cells infected with the same virus but expressing Bcl-xL and E1B-19K (Fig. 1C). However, Bcl-xL and E1B-19K did not affect the expression of p53 and its target protein, p21 (Fig. 1D), indicating that Bcl-xL and E1B-19K do not inhibit p53-induced senescence by regulating the expression levels of p53 and p21. Bcl-xL and E1B-19K Proteins Inhibit Irreversible Growth Arrest by p53—To examine whether Bcl-2 family proteins affect the growth inhibition caused by p53, a BrdUrd incorporation assay was performed (Fig. 2A). Regardless of Bcl-xL and E1B-19K, BrdUrd incorporation was significantly reduced 2-4 days after infection with p53-adenovirus (Fig. 2A), implying that Bcl-2 family proteins do not affect the cell cycle arrest induced by p53. Moreover, p53 expression peaked 2 days after virus infection and then decreased presumably because of the replication deficiency of the viral genome in the cell (Fig. 2B). BrdUrd incorporation, however, did not recover in EJ cells even after p53 expression fell to an undetectable level (Fig. 2), implying that the cellular commitment to the senescence and the transition from reversible growth arrest to permanent one occurs within 4 days after virus infection. However, BrdUrd incorporation increased in cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K after the level of p53 proteins decreased (Fig. 2). These results suggest that Bcl-xL and E1B-19K proteins prevent the cellular commitment to the senescence. Bcl-xL and E1B-19K Proteins Inhibit an Increase in ROS Levels by p53—We next addressed the question of how Bcl-2 family proteins inhibit cellular senescence. It has been reported that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in senescence (28Packer L. Fuehr K. Nature. 1977; 267: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 29Lee A.C.

Effects of p53 and Bcl-2 family proteins on ROS generation have been suggested, whereas p53 increases ROS generation (34Johnson T.M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Acta. 1995; 1271: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we examined ROS generation during p53-induced senescence. The ROS levels were found to increase significantly and to reach a maximum 4 days after virus infection. In contrast, ROS levels in cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K did not change significantly after p53 expression, versus p53-expressing EJ cells (Fig. 3), implying that Bcl-xL and E1B-19K prevent ROS production by p53. To examine whether ROS induction by p53 is critical for senescence and Bcl-xL and E1B-19K inhibit p53-induced senescence by preventing ROS generation, we examined the effects of anti-oxidants, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and 1-pyrrolydine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Like Bcl-xL and E1B-19K, the antioxidants also blocked appearance of SA-β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4A) and senescence-specific morphological changes (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the two anti-oxidants, NAC and PDTC, showed a synergistic effect on senescence inhibition (Fig 4A). Consistently, increases in the intracellular levels of ROS were prevented in part when either NAC or PDTC was treated, but these increases were completely inhibited when the two antioxidants were added in combination (Fig. 4B). We next examined whether ROS is required to induce and to maintain senescence. The two anti-oxidants were added for 24 h at the indicated time points and then removed (Fig. 5). In combination, NAC and PDTC significantly prevented the appearance of SA-β-galactosidase activity only when they were treated 2 and 3 days after p53 virus infection (Fig. 5). These results suggest that ROS generation is necessary for the induction of senescence by p53 but not for the maintenance of the senescence phenotype. Therefore, the prevention of ROS induction by either these anti-oxidants or Bcl-2 family proteins is likely to inhibit the induction of senescence from the reversible growth arrest state. To support this notion, we next examined whether a pro-oxidant such as tert-butyl-H2O2 (t-BTH) can override the anti-senescence effects of Bcl-xL and E1B-19K. To this end, we treated the cells with t-BTH for 48 h from 2 to 4 days post virus infection, because anti-oxidants were known to exert their anti-senescence effects during this period (Fig. 5). SA-β-galactosidase activity was found to be dramatically increased in both EJ-Bcl-xL and EJ-E1B-19K when t-BTH was added after p53 expression (Fig. 6). As a control experiment, we treated normally growing EJ cells with t-BTH but found no SA-β-galactosidase activity. These results suggest that the addition of pro-oxidant overcomes the anti-senescence functions of Bcl-xL and E1B-19K but that pro-oxidants cannot promote senescence in the absence of p53 expression.Fig. 6t-BTH overrides the anti-senescence functions of Bcl-xL and E1B-19K. Cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K were treated with the pro-oxidants, 5 or 10 μm tert-butylyl-H2O2, for 2 days, i.e. from 2 to 4 days after virus infection. SA-β-galactosidase-stained cells were counted 6 days after virus infection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ROS Induction Is Essential for Activation of p38 Kinase by p53—Recent studies reported that p38 kinase is essential for oncogene-induced senescence in human diploid fibroblasts (37Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that ROS induction leads to activation of p38 kinase (38Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we examined whether p38 kinase is activated during p53-induced senescence. Fig. 7A shows that the phosphorylation of p38 is slightly increased at 2 days and most prominently increased at 4 days, and then is significantly reduced, although it remained detectable 6 days after p53 virus infection (Fig. 7A). However, p38 phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K was significantly inhibited (Fig. 7A). To further examine whether phosphorylation of p38 kinase is dependent on ROS induction, we treated cells expressing p53 with anti-oxidants, NAC and PDTC. The anti-oxidants inhibited phosphorylation of p38 kinase (Fig. 7A) as they did induction of senescence phenotypes (Fig. 4). In parallel with p38 phosphorylation, ATF2, which is a phosphorylation target of p38 kinase, was found to be phosphorylated after p53 expression, but its phosphorylation was significantly inhibited in cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K or in cells treated with the anti-oxidants (Fig. 7A). Because the cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K became senescent upon adding t-BTH (Fig. 6), we examined whether p38 phosphorylation is recovered in these cells in parallel with their ability to become senescent. Cells were treated with t-BTH as shown in Fig. 6. Although the control virus-infected cells did not phosphorylate p38 kinase, p38 phosphorylation was recovered in cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K after treating with t-BTH (Fig. 7B). We next examined whether activation of p38 kinase is required for p53-induced senescence. Like the anti-oxidants, a chemical inhibitor of p38 kinase, SB203850, inhibited the appearance of SA-β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 8A) and senescence-specific morphological changes. However, SB202474, an analogue that does not inhibit p38 kinase (39Yu R. Mandlekar S. Lei W. Fahl W.E. Tan T.H. Kong A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2322-2327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), had no effect on SA-β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, SB203850 did not affect ROS levels (Fig. 8C), implying that p38 kinase is not upstream regulator of ROS. To identify the time points at which SB203580 inhibits p53-induced senescence, SB203580 was added for 24 h at indicated times (Fig. 8B). SB203580 significantly prevented the appearance of SA-β-galactosidase activity only when they were treated 2 or 3 days after p53 virus infection. These results suggest that ROS-dependent p38 activation is necessary for senescence induction rather than cell cycle arrest or the persistence of the senescence phenotype. Since we reported that p53 could induce a rapid onset of senescence in human tumor cells lacking wild type p53 (23Shin D.Y. Sugrue M.M. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we have focused on a mediator involved in p53-induced senescence. Because cells enter the senescent state after cell cycle arrest, there is a great deal of interest in identifying regulators that are specifically involved in senescence without participating in cell cycle arrest. Here, we reported that Bcl-xL and E1B-19K inhibit p53-induced irreversible growth arrest and senescence but not cell cycle arrest (Figs. 1 and 2). These results suggest that Bcl-xL and E1B-19K abrogate the cellular commitment to senescence and the transition from reversible to permanent growth arrest. To elucidate molecular mechanisms by which Bcl-2 family proteins regulate p53-induced senescence, we focused on the functions of p53 and Bcl-2 family proteins to regulate ROS generation (13Hockenbery D.M.

The present study shows that ROS induction by p53 is essential for senescence induction (Fig. 4). Several lines of evidence suggest that ROS is involved in the cellular commitment to senescence induction. First, ROS levels reached a maximum 4 days after p53 virus infection (Fig. 3). Second, reversible growth arrest became irreversible within 4 days after p53 virus infection (Fig. 2). Third, anti-oxidants exerted their anti-senescence effects when they were treated 2-4 days after virus infection (Fig. 5). Although many previous studies have suggested that ROS is involved in the senescence of normal and immortal tumor cells (28Packer L. Fuehr K.

Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar), we suggest that ROS is involved in the cellular commitment to senescence induction and in the transition from reversible growth arrest to permanent one. Because Bcl-xL and E1B-19K appear to inhibit p53-induced ROS generation (Fig. 3), it is likely that Bcl-xL and E1B-19K inhibit senescence induction by preventing p53-induced ROS generation. This is further supported by the finding that the anti-senescence functions of Bcl-xL and E1B-19K were overridden by exogenous ROS (Fig. 6). Because normally growing cells did not respond to exogenous ROS (Fig. 6), senescence induction requires not only ROS generation, but also other functions of p53. Because growth of the cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K was arrested by p53, the growth arrest state may be a prerequisite of the pro-senescence functions of ROS. This notion is further supported by previous reports that ROS can trigger senescence when the growth of normal diploid fibroblasts is arrested by cell-contact inhibition (40Chen Q. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4130-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Recent studies have reported that p38 kinase is activated in responses to cellular and environmental stresses. Hyper-mitogenic signals by expression of oncogenic ras leads to induction of premature senescence through activation of negative cell cycle regulators such as p53, Rb, and p16 (22Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 41Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Lin A.W. Querido E. McCurrach M.E. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (37Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) reported that expression of oncogenic Ras results in activation of MEKK3/6-p38 pathway, which in turn leads to activation of negative regulators of the cell cycle, such as p53 and p16, eventually, premature senescence. Recently, it has been reported that p38 kinase directly phosphorylates N-terminal serine residues of p53, which in turn activate the p53 signaling pathway (42Bulavin D.V. Saito S. Hollander M.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that p38 kinase links mitogenic signals to tumor suppressor genes. In support of the role of p38, it was reported that constitutive activation of p38 kinase also induces cell cycle arrest, which becomes permanent and irreversible in association with bio-chemical features of senescence (45Haq R. Brenton J.D. Takahashi M. Finan D. Rottapel R. Zanke B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5076-5082PubMed Google Scholar, 46Xu H.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 369-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest that p38 has a role in senescence, it remains to be elucidated as to whether p38 is essential for senescence induction and/or negative growth regulation, which include the induction and the maintenance of growth arrest. We found that p38 kinase is activated during p53-induced senescence but that this activation is blocked in cells expressing Bcl-xL or E1B-19K or in cells treated with antioxidants (Fig. 7A), which implies that ROS, which are generated by p53, lead to p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of p38 kinase was paralleled by the induction of ROS, and this peaked 4 days after p53 virus infection (Fig. 7A). Consistently, a chemical inhibitor of p38 kinase, SB203580, was found to inhibit p53-induced senescence, but not ROS generation (Fig. 8). Moreover, the times at which SB203580 exerted its anti-senescence function were found to coincide with those at which anti-oxidants function (Figs. 5 and 8D). Thus, p38 kinase activation is likely to be due to ROS induction and to be required for the induction of senescence rather than cell cycle arrest or the persistence of the senescence phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2129349637,"Secretion of thyroglobulin (Tg, a large homodimeric glycoprotein) is essential to deliver Tg to its site of iodination for thyroxine biosynthesis. An L2263P missense mutation in Tg has been proposed as the molecular defect causing congenital goitrous hypothyroidism in cog/cog mice due to perturbed Tg homodimerization, resulting in its retention within the endoplasmic reticulum. The mutation falls within a carboxyl-terminal region of Tg with high structural similarity to the entirety of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a secretory protein that also forms homodimers. We provide new evidence that authentic AChE and the cholinesterase-like domain of Tg share a common tertiary structure. Moreover, we find that a Tg truncation, deleted of the cholinesterase-like region (but not a comparably sized deletion of internal Tg regions), blocks Tg export. Appending to this truncation a cDNA encoding authentic AChE results in translation of a chimeric protein in which AChE is present in a native, enzymatically active (albeit latent) conformation, and this fully rescues Tg secretion. Introduction of the cog mutation inhibits AChE enzyme activity, and established denaturing mutations of AChE block secretion of the Tg. Additional studies show that the native structure of the AChE region functions as a “dimerization domain,” facilitating intracellular transport of Tg to the site of thyroid hormonogenesis.

Additional studies show that the native structure of the AChE region functions as a “dimerization domain,” facilitating intracellular transport of Tg to the site of thyroid hormonogenesis. Thyroid hormones are essential for development, oxidative metabolism, and regulated gene expression in many tissues. Biosynthesis of thyroid hormones is critically dependent upon the native three-dimensional structure of the large homodimeric glycoprotein precursor, thyroglobulin (Tg) 1The abbreviations used are: Tg, thyroglobulin; bTg, bovine Tg; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; hAChE, human AChE. (1Maurizis J.-C. Marriq C. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 132: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Tg, the most highly expressed protein in the normal thyroid gland, is predominantly extracellular, secreted by thyrocytes into the lumen of thyroid follicles (2Van Herle A.J. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 301: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 3Van Herle A.J. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 301: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Once secreted, a number of tyrosine residues of Tg are iodinated to form monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine; this is associated with a coupling reaction between two diiodotyrosine residues to form thyroxine, the major form of thyroid hormone produced in the thyroid gland. The Tg protein is essential to this process in two ways. First, Tg contains within its encoded structure information for efficient coupling of iodotyrosyl residues involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis (4Lamas L. Taurog A. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Second, Tg must achieve a conformational state sufficient to escape quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in order to be exported through the secretory pathway to the site of iodination (5Kim P.S. Arvan P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 173-202PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the Tg monomer primary sequence (amounting to ∼2,750 amino acids) suggests that it is subdivided into regional structures (6Mercken L. Simons M.-J. Swillens S. Massaer M. Vassart G. Nature. 1985; 316: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The most heavily used site of iodination and thyroxine synthesis occurs within the first 130 residues of the Tg protein (7Marriq C. Lejeune P.J. Venot N. Vinet L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Dunn A.D. Corsi C.M. Myers H.E. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25223-25229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). While there are other hormonogenic sites on Tg, the foregoing information leaves open the question of the biological significance of much of the remaining 2,620 residues (9Dunn J.T. Dunn A.D. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10van de Graaf S.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Pauws E. Mendive F.M. Targovnik H.M. de Vijlder J.J. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 170: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal ∼60% of Tg contains the numerous cysteine-rich “Tg type 1 repeats” (11Pungercic G. Dolenc I. Dolinar M. Bevec T. Jenko S. Kolaric S. Turk V. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 12Galesa K. Pain R. Jongsma M.A. Turk V. Lenarcic B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); then a smaller region downstream exhibits a distinct series of cysteine-rich repeats that have little homology to other proteins in existing data bases. Finally the most carboxyl-terminal region of Tg exhibits 31% identity and 47% similarity to the entire length of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (13Swillens S. Ludgate M. Mercken L. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Mori N. Itoh N. Salvaterra P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Patients with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism and defective Tg, as well as animal models of the human disease, have been recognized for many years. The thyrocytes in such patients typically exhibit a dilated ER lumen (15Michel-Bechet M. Cotte G. Codaccioni J.-L. Athouel-Haon A.-M. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1969; 73: 389-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 16Medeiros-Neto G. Targovnik H. Knobel M. Propato F. Varela V. Alkmin M. Barbosa S. Wajchenberg B.L. J. Endocrinol.

Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in a variety of Tg regions can result in goitrous hypothyroidism as a result of deficiency of Tg folding (10van de Graaf S.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Pauws E. Mendive F.M. Targovnik H.M. de Vijlder J.J. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 170: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances, Tg makes a homodimer within the ER prior to its export through the secretory pathway (18Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12412-12418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kim P. Bole D. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y.

By contrast, in thyrocytes of cog/cog mice, there is activation of the unfolded protein response resulting in induced expression of multiple ER molecular chaperones, secondary to a temperature-sensitive defect in Tg folding and dimerization (20Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Tg from cog/cog mice fails to homodimerize and cannot be efficiently exported from the ER (22Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.-N. Lee I. Yoo S.-E. Arvan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9909-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), instead undergoing a slow process of ER-associated degradation (23Tokunaga F. Brostrom C. Koide T. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40757-40764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consequently, in cog/cog mice, there is greatly diminished iodination of Tg resulting in insufficient thyroid hormone synthesis (24Basche M. Beamer W.G. Schneider A.B.

The cog Tg secretion defect is associated with a single L2263P substitution that falls within the AChE homology domain (22Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.-N. Lee I. Yoo S.-E. Arvan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9909-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, authentic AChE also undergoes homodimerization (27Rotundo R.L. J. Biol.

Although there are no x-ray crystallographic data of any Tg regions, we believe that there is reason to suspect that Tg and AChE share certain common tertiary structural features (13Swillens S.

For example, the six cysteine residues involved in AChE intrachain disulfide bonding are conserved within Tg (32MacPhee-Quigley K. Vedvick T.S. Taylor P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13565-13570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AChE additionally possesses one unique carboxyl-terminal unpaired Cys residue, which it can use in creation of a covalent interchain cross-link between monomer subunits in the homodimer (35Velan B. Grosfeld H. Kronman C. Leitner M. Gozes Y. Lazar A. Flashner Y. Marcus D. Cohen S. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23977-23984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Tg homodimers are noncovalently associated at the time of secretion. Dimerization of both proteins occurs upon biosynthesis in the ER. In this report, we begin to explore the role of the AChE-like domain in Tg biosynthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that the AChE-like region of Tg functions as a dimerization domain, facilitating efficient intracellular transport of the much larger Tg molecule, via the secretory pathway. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 or 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Because of background contributed by serum Tg, for Western blotting experiments cells were cultured post-transfection in AIM-V medium (Invitrogen) in the absence of serum. Cells were grown to 80% confluency in 6-well plates, and all transfections used LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of plasmid DNA. All experiments were performed 48 h after transient transfection. For transfections of Tg and Tg chimera cDNAs, the pCB6 (cytomegalovirus promoter-driven) expression plasmid was employed. The pAChE expression plasmid (cytomegalovirus promoter-driven, kind gift of Drs. B. Velan and A. Shafferman, Israel Institute for Biological Research) was used for direct expression of hAChE and also as template for mutagenesis to create the chimera bTg·hAChE. Mutagenesis of Tg and hAChE—For single codon changes involving introduction of the cog mutation or mutation of individual Cys codons or Asp codons, standard PCR mutagenesis was employed using primers with flanking restriction sites that allowed subcloning of the mutagenized fragment back to a cassette containing wild-type bTg or hAChE sequence. The internal deletion mutant of Tg employed digestion at the (three) natural HindIII sites, releasing two internal fragments, followed by religation to link in-frame bTg residue 1231 directly to residue 1912. Deletion of the AChE-like region used PCR mutagenesis to create a stop codon immediately following the bTg cDNA encoding Ser2179. To make bTg conducive for chimeric fusion with hAChE, an XhoI restriction site was generated creating an S2193R substitution. Similarly, an XhoI site was generated in pAChE replacing the sequence encoding the first residue (Glu) of the mature hAChE protein but leaving intact the second (Gly2) residue. Thus, the fusion junction of the bTg·hAChE protein includes Pro2192-Arg-Gly2. All mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Enzymatic Activity of hAChE or bTg·hAChE—For measurement of recombinant AChE or bTg·hAChE catalytic activity, expression of intracellular rather than secreted activity was measured to eliminate background due to the presence of serum AChE enzyme activity in the media. Thus, each well of cells was lysed in 300 μl of 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and a mixture of protease inhibitors including 1.2 μm leupeptin, 1.1 μm pepstatin, 6.5 mm EDTA, 2 μm E64, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin (diisopropyl fluorophosphate was avoided as this inhibits hAChE enzymatic activity). One-third of each lysate was then used directly for colorimetric acetylthiocholinesterase activity (36Ellman G.L. Courtney D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar). For limited proteolysis with thermolysin, the cells were lysed in the same buffer but without protease inhibitors and then treated for 5 min with 1 μg/ml thermolysin at 37 °C, and then the antiprotease mixture was added. Each activity experiment was performed at least three times with mean and standard deviations calculated. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were metabolically pulse-labeled for 30 min with 35S-amino acids according to standard protocols and chased in complete growth medium containing serum for the times indicated. Regardless of whether intact bTg or bTg·hAChE cDNAs were used for transfection, cell lysates were precleared and then immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Tg antibodies using protein A-agarose as immunoprecipitant. SDS-4% PAGE was run under reducing or nonreducing conditions. For Western blotting of secreted Tg, one-half of the experimental medium was first precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed, and then dissolved in gel sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. A peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit was used as secondary antibody, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). There is considerable normal sequence variation between Tg of different species and among Tg from individuals of the same species (10van de Graaf S.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Pauws E. Mendive F.M. Targovnik H.M. de Vijlder J.J. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 170: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It seemed possible that the Tg mutation L2263P, reported as the molecular defect causing congenital goitrous hypothyroidism by blocking Tg secretion from thyrocytes of cog/cog mice (22Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.-N. Lee I. Yoo S.-E. Arvan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9909-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which falls in the AChE-like domain of Tg, might occur uniquely in the context of the murine Tg sequence. We began by introducing an L2266P missense mutation in the context of bovine Tg. Whereas in transiently transfected COS cells the empty (pCB6) vector produced no Tg and the wild-type bTg cDNA resulted in secreted Tg protein, the encoded proline substitution at the homologous site in bTg produced a protein that could not be secreted from cells (Fig. 1). Like that from cog/cog mice (20Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the mutant Tg protein was sensitive to endoglycosidase H (not shown), indicating failure of the protein to reach the medial Golgi. The data suggest that structural consequences of this mutation are not limited to murine Tg but might have similar denaturing effects within the other members of the AChE-like superfamily. Specifically, the seven-residue coding sequence surrounding the site of the cog mutation is 100% conserved between AChE and Tg (22Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.-N. Lee I. Yoo S.-E. Arvan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9909-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the conserved Leu residue at the site of the cog mutation has never been studied previously in the context of authentic AChE. We therefore introduced L99P into recombinant hAChE to examine the production of native protein as judged by enzymatic activity in transiently transfected 293 cells. With comparable transfection efficiency, cell lysates expressing recombinant hAChE showed a ∼9-fold increase in intracellular esterase activity over endogenous background activity recovered from control cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 2). After subtraction of background intracellular esterase activity, cells transfected with hAChE cDNA bearing the L99P mutation (homologous to the cog site) showed an ∼80% reduction in intracellular esterase activity compared with cells transfected with the wild-type AChE cDNA (Fig. 2). Because of difficulties with Western blotting of intracellular hAChE using commercial antibodies, these particular experiments did not examine the protein expression level of the hAChE-cog mutant; therefore, the diminished activity might reflect effects on protein expression/stability or intrinsic activity (addressed further below). The data indicate that the cog mutation significantly impairs production of active hAChE, raising the possibility that the mutation causes similar perturbation in both Tg and AChE structures.Fig. 2Introduction of an L99P mutation homologous to that found in Tg of cog/cog mice inhibits the enzymatic activity of AChE. 293 cells transiently transfected with an empty vector (293-con) or with expression plasmids containing the constructs indicated were lysed, and the lysates were measured directly for AChE enzyme activity. Co-transfections with a proinsulin cDNA and measurement by radioimmunoassay were used to demonstrate comparable transfection efficiency between samples. After substracting the background of endogenous esterase activity in control cells, introduction of the cog-like mutation caused a 77.5% reduction in intracellular AChE activity in 293-hAChE-cog cells compared with cells with the wild-type AChE cDNA (293-hAChE).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the three disulfide bonds of the AChE-like domain of bTg, conserved with AChE (13Swillens S.

It has been proposed that Pro replacing Leu at this site, which in AChE is located in a neighboring β-turn, might interfere with formation of that particular disulfide bond (22Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.-N. Lee I. Yoo S.-E. Arvan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9909-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To examine the structural significance of this disulfide in bTg export, Cys2246 and Cys2263 were mutated either individually or in tandem, each of which blocked bTg secretion (Fig. 3A). Another predicted disulfide pair (Cys2573-Cys2697) falls near α helices that form a four-helix bundle involved in homodimerization of AChE (29Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 30Morel N. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulie J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37379-37389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both of these individual Cys mutants also blocked bTg secretion (Fig. 3B). Moreover, two salt bridges employing Asp175 as well as Asp404 of hAChE are critically involved in structural stability of hAChE protein (37Shafferman A. Kronman C. Flashner Y. Leitner M. Grosfeld H. Ordentlich A. Gozes Y. Cohen S. Ariel N. Barak D. Harel M. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Velan B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17640-17648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we noted that homologous residues at both sites are present in Tg. Indeed, D2340N and D2568N missense mutations of Tg, respectively, both seriously impaired Tg secretion (Fig. 3C). A diminished recovery of the D2568N mutant at 3 h chase is consistent with a foreshortened intracellular half-life; however, a detailed examination of the disposal of the intracellularly entrapped Tg mutant awaits further investigation. The AChE-like domain of authentic Tg lacks both a critical Ser residue in the catalytic triad as well as conserved flanking residues (Table I); thus, Tg is not expected to encode an active cholinesterase. Nevertheless, multiple distinct point mutations known to adversely affect the native structure of AChE similarly impair Tg (Fig. 3), consistent with the idea that the AChE-like domain of Tg shares a common tertiary structural folding pattern to that of authentic AChE. We therefore wished to test the hypothesis that the AChE-like region provides essential structural information for formation of stable Tg homodimers.Table IAlignment of sequences surrounding the catalytic triad of AChE (boxed residues) with those surrounding the homologous sites in Tg Open table in a new tab We proceeded to make an internal deletion mutant encoding a Tg protein of ∼2,200 amino acids (“TgΔ1231–1912”) in order to contrast its secretion to that of a comparably sized Tg mutant truncated at the carboxyl terminus to remove the AChE-like region (“TgΔAChE-like”). The analysis by reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting yielded two interesting observations. For one, although the molecular mass of TgΔAChE-like is actually predicted to be slightly (∼100 residues) larger than that of the internal deletion mutant, removal of the AChE-like region produced a glycoprotein with a smaller apparent molecular mass (Fig. 4). As protein disulfides were fully reduced in the analysis and 10% of Tg molecular mass normally is comprised of carbohydrate, these observations suggest that loss of the AChE-like region might result in secondary deficiency in Tg post-translational modifications. In addition, the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant was not detectably secreted (Fig. 4). Thus, we find that deletion of the AChE-like region alone is sufficient to block Tg transport through the secretory pathway, strongly suggesting that presence of a native AChE-like region is important for the folding and maturation of Tg that leads to escape from ER quality control. As homodimerization may be important for Tg escape from ER quality control (20Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that TgΔAChE-like might be rescued in the secretory pathway by appending in-frame to this cDNA a sequence encoding an artificial dimerization domain. Although many potential dimerization domains could be considered, we elected to add back the authentic hAChE-coding sequence in place of the missing AChE-like region of Tg to create the bTg·hAChE chimera. To check whether hAChE achieved a native conformation within the chimera, lysates of transiently transfected 293 cells were examined for acetylcholinesterase activity. It was predicted that cells expressing bTg alone would exhibit no activity above the background observed in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 5A); however, little apparent activity was initially noted upon transfection of the cDNA encoding the bTg·hAChE chimera (Fig. 5A). We considered the possibility that hAChE in the chimera might be folded to the native state yet prevented from proceeding through its catalytic cycle within the context of the larger Tg structure. Limited proteolytic digestion of Tg with thermolysin has been shown to cleave upstream regions of Tg, initially releasing a fragment containing the intact AChE-like domain (38Gentile F. Salvatore G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 603-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When lysates of cells expressing recombinant hAChE were exposed to limited thermolysin digestion, enzymatic activity was not augmented (Fig. 5B). The same was true upon heating of cell lysates to 50 °C for 5 min (Fig. 5B). However, upon limited thermolysin digestion of lysates of cells expressing the bTg·hAChE chimera, significant unmasking of latent AChE activity was observed (Fig. 6A). Moreover, disinhibition of AChE was also observed in lysates of cells expressing the bTg·hAChE chimera upon heating to 50 °C (Fig. 6B). Under the same conditions, no latent activity could be uncovered for the bTg·hAChE chimera bearing the cog mutation (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that hAChE is indeed folded into its enzymatically active conformation within the larger Tg structure and that folding stability within this region is comparably perturbed by introducing the cog mutation in the bTg·hAChE chimera as in authentic Tg. It was important to know whether the structure of Tg allows sufficient exposure of the AChE contact zone to allow dimerization in this region. As noted above, both AChE and Tg homodimerize, but authentic AChE uniquely contains a short carboxyl-terminal extension with one extra unpaired cysteine that allows some homodimers to form an intersubunit disulfide bond (35Velan B. Grosfeld H. Kronman C. Leitner M. Gozes Y. Lazar A. Flashner Y. Marcus D. Cohen S. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23977-23984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), providing a convenient dimerization assay (30Morel N. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulie J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37379-37389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, the secretion from metabolically labeled 293 cells expressing bTg or bTg·hAChE was immunoprecipitated with anti-Tg and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 7A). As expected, the mobility of monomeric 330-kDa bTg or bTg·hAChE is faster under nonreducing conditions because of the presence of the many intrachain disulfide bonds (39Di Jeso B. Ulianich L. Pacifico F. Leonardi A. Vito P. Consiglio E. Formisano S. Arvan P. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 449-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, under nonreducing conditions, a disulfide-linked bTg·hAChE dimer band appeared (Fig. 7A, arrow). Furthermore, when compared with Tg lacking its own AChE-like region (Fig. 4), the addition of authentic hAChE clearly restored Tg secretion (Fig. 7B). Important to our earlier considerations, introduction of the cog mutation within the bTg·hAChE chimera did not diminish protein expression but did cause the protein to be retained intracellularly, recreating the biochemical phenotype for Tg in cog/cog thyrocytes. Taken together, the data indicate that normal conformational maturation of the AChE-like region facilitates homodimerization and intracellular transport of Tg to the site of its iodination for thyroid hormonogenesis. Because hAChE is folded in a catalytically active conformation, this domain provides a unique folding reporter at the carboxyl-terminal end of Tg. Thus, replacement of the AChE-like region with authentic hAChE creates interesting possibilities for future studies of upstream Tg regions. Specifically, there are additional mutations residing in these regions that may cause Tg export defects leading to congenital goitrous hypothyroidism in humans (17Medeiros-Neto G. Kim P.S. Yoo S.E. Vono J. Targovnik H. Camargo R. Hossain S.A. Arvan P. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of latent AChE enzyme activity at the carboxyl terminus of Tg should permit distinction of those upstream mutations that result in only local domain-specific or regional misfolding versus those that propagate misfolding down the polypeptide chain into the AChE region. Moreover, homodimerization of these mutants can be readily screened by virtue of the unique unpaired Cys residue that allows for interchain disulfide bonding. Tg·AChE chimeras thus provide powerful new molecular tools for the analysis of defects underlying congenital goitrous hypothyroidism with defective Tg. We thank members of the Arvan laboratory for helpful discussions during the course of this work."

In human SLE patients, as well as in mouse models of SLE, the development of disease is associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). However, IL-6 target genes contributing to the development of disease remain to be identified. Our previous studies of one mouse model of SLE identified an interferon-inducible gene, Ifi202, as a major contributor to the disease. We now report that IL-6 induces expression of the Ifi202 gene. We found that IL-6 treatment of mouse splenocytes increased levels of Ifi202 mRNA and p202 protein. Furthermore, IL-6 treatment of NIH 3T3 cells or expression of a constitutively active form of STAT3, a known mediator of IL-6 signaling, stimulated the activity of a 202-luc-reporter through a potential STAT3 DNA-binding site (the 202-SBS) present in the 5′-regulatory region of the Ifi202 gene. Moreover, treatment of cells with IL-6 stimulated binding of the transcription factor STAT3 to an oligonucleotide containing the 202-SBS in gel-mobility shift assays and to the 5′-regulatory region of the Ifi202 gene in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis of 202-SBS or expression of a dominant negative form of STAT3 significantly reduced constitutive as well as IL-6-stimulated activity of the 202-luc-reporter.

Consistent with this notion, increased levels of IL-6 enhance autoimmunity in well known mouse models of SLE, such as (NZB x NZW)F1 mice (10Alarcon-Riquelme M.E. Moller G. Fernandez C. Clin. Exp.

IL-6 was identified as a B-cell differentiation factor and also as a hybridoma-plasmacytoma growth factor (14Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M.

It is a member of a cytokine family, which also includes IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin-1, neurotrophin-1/B, cell stimulatory factor-3, and oncostatin M. The membrane receptor for these cytokines shares a common subunit, glycoprotein 130. IL-6 affects a variety of biological functions, such as immunoglobulin production, the acute phase inflammatory response, and plasmacytoma genesis by regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival (14Hirano T.

The transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is known to play a critical role in IL-6 signaling, resulting in transcriptional activation of a number of genes (14Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Binding of IL-6 to its receptor, which is coupled to two glycoprotein 130 subunits, results in phosphorylation of STAT3 and its activation (14Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 16Bromberg J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Activated STAT3 is known to form a homodimer or heterodimer with STAT1 and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to the target sequence (STAT-binding site or SBS) in the promoter of various genes. STAT3 target genes encode c-Myc, c-Myb, JunB, p21WAF1, interferon regulated factor-1, and STAT3 itself (14Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 15Akira S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Importantly, activated STAT3 is detected in PBMCs from patients with active SLE (17Li Z. Li Y. Huang L. Xu H. Yu X. Ye R. Chin. Med. J. 2002; 115: 846-850PubMed Google Scholar). The Ifi202 gene (encoding the protein p202) is the best characterized member of the interferon (IFN)-inducible 200-gene family (18Choubey D. J. Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents. 2000; 14: 187-192PubMed Google Scholar, 19Choubey D. Kotzin B.L. Front. Biosc. 2002; 7: e252-e262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The family in mice includes Ifi202a, Ifi202b, Ifi203, Ifi204, and D3 and in humans IFI16, MNDA, and AIM2 (20Johnstone R.W. Trapani J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5833-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Lengyel P. Choubey D. Li S.-J. Datta B. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 203-213Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Murine genes form a tight cluster on distal chromosome 1 (21Lengyel P. Choubey D. Li S.-J. Datta B. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 203-213Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which is syntenic with a region on human chromosome 1q (22Kingsmore S.F. Watson M.L. Howard T.A. Seldin M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4073-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to the genetic evidence for a role of Ifi202 in mouse lupus, studies in human lupus have mapped a susceptibility locus in this region of human chromosome 1 (3Wakeland E.K. Liu K. Graham R.R. Behrens T.W. Immunity. 2001; 15: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 7Tsao B.P. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2002; 4: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Proteins encoded by the 200-gene family share at least one repeat of a partially conserved 200-amino acid domain (20Johnstone R.W. Trapani J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5833-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Lengyel P. Choubey D. Li S.-J. Datta B. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 203-213Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, autoantibodies to the IFI16 protein were detected in sera of SLE patients (23Seelig H.P. Ehrfeld H. Renz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 672-1683Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and increased expression of myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen was detected in PBMCs of arthritis patients (24Gu J. Marker-Hermann E. Baeten D. Tsai W.C. Gladman D. Xiong M. Deister H. Kuipers J.G. Huang F. Song Y.W. Maksymowych W. Kalsi J. Bannai M. Seta N. Rihl M. Crofford L.J. Veys E. De Keyser F. Yu D.T. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2002; 41: 759-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that increased expression of the p200 family proteins contributes to the development of autoimmune diseases, including SLE. The protein p202 is a 52-kDa phosphoprotein, and its overexpression in a variety of transfected cell lines retards cell proliferation and increases cell survival (18Choubey D. J. Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents. 2000; 14: 187-192PubMed Google Scholar, 19Choubey D. Kotzin B.L. Front. Biosc. 2002; 7: e252-e262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, increased expression of p202 in splenic cells of the B6.Nba2 congenic strain of mice (congenic for the Nba2 locus derived from the NZB lupus-prone strain) is correlated with increased production of IgG antibodies, splenomegaly, and defects in apoptosis of B cells in vitro (8Rozzo S.J. Allard J.D. Choubey D. Vyse T.J. Izui S. Peltz G. Kotzin B.L. Immunity. 2001; 15: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, generation of NZB mice that are deficient for the IFN-α/β receptor did not result in a significant reduction in p202 levels in the spleens of old mice (25Santiago-Raber M.L. Baccala R. Haraldsson K.M. Choubey D. Stewart T.A. Kono D.H. Theofilopoulos A.N. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the possibility that expression of Ifi202 gene can be regulated independent of type I interferon signaling. Because IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, and treatment of a variety of cells with IL-6 results in cell growth arrest and increased cell survival (14Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 15Akira S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether IL-6 could regulate expression of the Ifi202 gene. Here we report that the Ifi202 gene is a transcriptional target of IL-6/STAT3 signaling in splenocytes. Our observations are consistent with the idea that increased levels of IL-6 in lupus-prone strains of mice contribute to up-regulation of p202 expression. Cells and Reagents-Mouse splenocytes were derived from the B6.Nba2 strain of mice, maintained in the animal facilities of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. AKR-2B embryonic fibroblasts have been described previously (26Choubey D. Lengyel P. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 and AKR-2B fibroblasts were maintained at low density in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics in an incubator with 5% CO2. Recombinant mouse IL-6 was from Roche Applied Science (specific activity, >1.0 × 108 units/mg). Antibodies to STAT3 (#9132), and phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) (#9130) were purchased from Cell Signaling Tech (Beverly, MA). Antiserum to p202 has been described previously (26Choubey D. Lengyel P. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Plasmids-Dr. J. Darnell (Rockefeller University, New York) generously provided mammalian expression vectors for wild type STAT3, constitutively active STAT3 (S3-C), and a dominant negative mutant of STAT3 (S3-DN). The 202-luc-reporter plasmid (202-luc), containing the 5′-regulatory sequence (∼0.8 kb) of the Ifi202 gene (derived from the EAT cells), has been described previously (27D'Souza S. Xin H. Walter S. Choubey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 298-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutations in the STAT3 DNA-binding site in the 202-luc were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as suggested by the supplier. The STAT3 DNA-binding site in the 202-luc-reporter plasmid was changed from TTACAGGAA to TTAGATACC. Reporter Assays-For reporter assays, sub-confluent NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with the reporter plasmids 202-luc (5 μg) and pRL-TK (0.5 μg), using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (from Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) as suggested by the supplier. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were harvested between 43 and 48 h after transfections. Cells were lysed, and the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined as described previously (27D'Souza S. Xin H. Walter S. Choubey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 298-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Isolation of RNA from Splenocytes and Real-time PCR-Total single cell splenocytes were obtained from male B6.Nba2 mice (9-15 weeks of age). After lysis of red blood cells, splenocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamate (Invitrogen), and 1× minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids/sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Splenocytes (5 × 106 cells) were plated in flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plates (Invitrogen). Splenocytes were stimulated for 6 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant mouse IL-6 (Roche Applied Science) reconstituted in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma). Unstimulated cells were cultured in the presence of an equal volume of 1x PBS and BSA. At harvest, supernatants were discarded, and cell pellets frozen at -70 °C. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy 96-kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The eluted samples in a 60-μl volume were treated with DNase I (Promega) in a final volume of 100 μl. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed in a one-step procedure combining cDNA synthesis (step 1) with PCR amplification (step 2) on a TaqMan 5700™ (Applied Biosystems). We used specific primers and FAM-labeled probes to Ifi202 (forward primer: 5′-ctaacaaaaagtcacacaccccaa-3′; reverse primer: 5′-tggttctgttgcagtgagtacca-3′; probe: 5′/56-FAM/aaaggtgctgttcttcaggagaaacccatga/3BHQ-1/3′) and Actin (forward primer: 5′-ttcgttgccggtccaca-3′; reverse primer: 5′-accagcgcagcgatatcg-3′; probe: 5′/56-FAM/cgccaccagttcgccatgga/3HBQ-1/3′) (all from Applied Biosystems). The ratio of Ifi202 to actin mRNA was calculated in units, with one unit being the ratio of Ifi202 mRNA to Actin mRNA in spleens of NZB female mice (age, 16 weeks). RT-PCR and Northern Blotting-Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), digested with DNase I (to remove any DNA in the preparation), and 0.5 μg of RNA was used for RT-PCR reaction using a pair of the Ifi202a-specific primers (forward primer: 5′-ggtcatctaccaactcagaat-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ctctaggatgccactgctgttg-3′). For RT-PCR, we used the Superscript one-step RT-PCR system from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). For Northern blotting, 25 μg of total RNA was used for agarose gel electrophoresis (in 1.5% gel) as described previously (27D'Souza S. Xin H. Walter S. Choubey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 298-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After transfer of RNA to a nylon membrane, the membrane was hybridized to a labeled Ifi202-specific cDNA probe as described previously (27D'Souza S. Xin H. Walter S. Choubey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 298-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay-NIH 3T3 cells, grown to 60-80% confluence, were serum-starved for 1 day to decrease basal DNA-binding activity of STAT3 as described previously (28Barre B. Avril S. Coqueret O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2990-2996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After stimulation (6h, IL-6 20 ng/ml), cells were washed and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed sequentially two times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, centrifuged, resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and sonicated one time for 30 s at the maximum setting. Supernatants were then recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, diluted two times in dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h with no antibodies added (a negative control) or specific antibodies (sc-482x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to STAT3, and then 2 μg of sheared salmon-sperm DNA and 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (of 50% slurry) were further added for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially for 10 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Bead precipitates were then washed three times with TE buffer and eluted three times with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C overnight (to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking). Supernatants were then incubated for 1 h at 45 °C with proteinase K (80 μg each), and DNA was precipitated. For PCR, 3 μl from a 20-μl DNA preparation was used for 40 cycles of amplifications. The following primers were used: region 383-402 forward primer (5′-gtgtctagtggccagtgtac-3′) and region 804-784 reverse primer (5′-tctgcagtgatgtacagatcc-3′) (see Fig. 7 in Ref. 29Choubey D. Snoddy J. Chaturvedi V. Toniato E. Opdenakker G. Thakur A. Samanta H. Engel D.A. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17182-17189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting-Splenocytes or NIH 3T3 cells were collected in PBS and resuspended in a modified radioimmune precipitation assaylysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), supplemented with protease inhibitors (leupeptin, 50 μg/ml; pepstatin A, 50 μg/ml; and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell lysates were sonicated briefly before centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were processed for immunoblotting as described previously (26Choubey D. Lengyel P. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Gel-mobility Shift Assay-Nuclear extracts were prepared from NIH 3T3 cells as described previously (30Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagents. An oligonucleotide (25 nucleotides long) containing the potential STAT3 DNA-binding site present in the 5′-regulatory region of the Ifi202 gene binding site, or containing a STAT-binding site consensus sequence (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Gel-purified labeled oligonucleotide (probe, 1 ng/assay) was incubated with nuclear extracts containing equal amounts of protein in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg of BSA) for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC). In the competition assays, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with excess unlabeled oligonucleotides at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were analyzed on a 5% native gel in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer. Gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C. IL-6 Induces Expression of p202-To determine whether IL-6 could regulate expression of p202, we incubated total splenocytes, derived from the B6.Nba2 congenic strain of mice (age 9-15 weeks), with increasing concentrations of IL-6 for 6 h and analyzed levels of Ifi202 mRNA by real-time quantitative PCR. Initial time-course analyses revealed maximum induction of Ifi202 mRNA at 6 h (data not shown). The treatment of splenocytes with IL-6 increased already constitutively expressed (8Rozzo S.J. Allard J.D. Choubey D. Vyse T.J. Izui S. Peltz G. Kotzin B.L. Immunity. 2001; 15: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) levels of Ifi202 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), and the maximum increase in Ifi202 mRNA levels varied between 2.5- and 2.7-fold in three independent experiments. Furthermore, the increase in Ifi202 mRNA levels correlated with increases in p202 levels, phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705, indicating the activation of STAT3 by IL-6. Consistent with previous studies (31Ichiba M. Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Kiuchi N. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6132-6138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), levels of STAT3 also increased after IL-6 treatment of splenocytes (Fig. 1B). Together, these observations indicated that IL-6 can up-regulate Ifi202 mRNA and protein levels in mouse splenocytes, and the increase was correlated with the activation of STAT3. Next, to study the molecular mechanisms by which IL-6 up-regulates expression of p202, we sought to determine whether IL-6 treatment of cells of NIH 3T3 cell line, an immortalized IL-6-responsive mouse fibroblast cell line (32Langdon C. Kerr C. Tong L. Richards C.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Saito H. Morita Y. Fujimoto M. Narazaki M. Naka T. Kishimoto T. J.

Hematol. 2001; 29: 146-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), increases expression of p202. Our initial reporter assays, utilizing transfection of a 202-luc-reporter plasmid, followed by treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of IL-6 (from 5-50 ng/ml) for 6 h or a fixed concentration of IL-6 (20 ng/ml) for increasing length of time (from 1 to 6 h) revealed that treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with 20 ng/ml IL-6 for 6 h was sufficient to induce the activity of the 202-luc-reporter above the constitutive basal levels (data not shown). Therefore, we treated NIH 3T3 cells with IL-6 (20 ng/ml for 6 h) and compared the levels of Ifi202 mRNA and protein with untreated cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, IL-6 treatment significantly increased the steady-sate levels of Ifi202 mRNA (probably both Ifi202a and Ifi202b). Because it is not possible to distinguish between Ifi202a and Ifi202b mRNAs by Northern blotting (35Wang H. Chatterjee G. Meyer J.J. Liu C.J. Manjunath N.A. Bray-Ward P. Lengyel P. Genomics. 1999; 60: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we performed a semi-quantitative RT-PCR to determine whether levels of Ifi202a mRNA (detected in abundance as compared with Ifi202b mRNA; see Ref. 35Wang H. Chatterjee G. Meyer J.J. Liu C.J. Manjunath N.A. Bray-Ward P. Lengyel P. Genomics. 1999; 60: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were increased by IL-6 treatment. As shown in Fig. 2B, IL-6 treatment of NIH 3T3 cells resulted in increased levels of Ifi202a-specific mRNA. Importantly, the increase in Ifi202a mRNA levels correlated with increases in p202 levels (Fig. 2C). Consistent with our observation in Fig. 1 and previous studies (31Ichiba M. Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Kiuchi N. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6132-6138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), levels of STAT3 were also increased after IL-6 treatment of NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2C). Similarly, IL-6 treatment of AKR-2B fibroblasts also resulted in up-regulation of p202 and STAT3, albeit to a lesser extent (data not shown). Next, to test whether the IL-6-induced Ifi202 mRNA expression in NIH 3T3 cells was due to transcriptional activation of the Ifi202 gene, we performed promoter-reporter assays. Our several initial experiments revealed that treatment of cells with IL-6 in medium supplemented with 10% serum resulted in only moderate (35-55%) increases in the activity of 202-luc-reporter above the basal activity (data not shown). Therefore, we chose to treat cells with IL-6 in under reduced (1% serum) serum conditions to decrease the basal activity of the reporter. As shown in Fig. 2D, treatment of cells with IL-6 under reduced serum conditions resulted in significant (∼2.5- to 3-fold) stimulation of the activity of 202-luc-reporter. These observations indicate that IL-6 treatment of NIH 3T3 cells stimulates transcription of the reporter gene, expression of which is driven by the 5′-regulatory region of the Ifi202 gene. IL-6-activated STAT3 Binds to a Potential DNA Binding Site Present in the 5′-Regulatory Region of the Ifi202 Gene-It is well known that IL-6 exerts its effects, in part, through the activation of the transcription factor STAT3 (14Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the 5′-regulatory sequence of the Ifi202 gene for the presence of STAT3 DNA-binding sites using the Matinspector 2.0 software program. The analysis revealed a potential STAT-binding site (SBS) of the N3 type (5′-TTACAGGAA), which is bound by most STAT proteins, except STAT6 (36Ehret G.B. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Horvath C.M. Fritz S. Nabholz M. Bucher P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6675-6688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A comparison of the SBS in the Ifi202-promoter (indicated as 202-SBS) with other known SBSs is shown in Table I.Table IA comparison of the STAT3 DNA-binding site in the Ifi202 gene with known STAT3 DNA-binding sites in other genes Underlining of the nucleotide indicates a variation from the STAT3 DNA-binding consensus sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2017000463,"Neuronal differentiation is regulated by many basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family transcriptional activators and repressors, and the balance of activity between these factors is important for the differentiation process. Here, we report the identification of a novel transcriptional repressor, designated Helt. Helt encoded a Hey-related bHLH protein containing the bHLH and Orange domains. Helt could homodimerize, and heterodimerize with Hes5 or Hey2. Both the bHLH and Orange domains were involved in the homodimerization. In contrast, only the bHLH domain was required for the heterodimerization with Hey2, whereas only the Orange domain mediated the interaction between Helt and Hes5. Thus, Helt has two dimerization domains, and these domains independently select a partner. Identification of preferred recognition sequences by CASTing experiments revealed that Helt bound to the E box, which was distinct from the Hes1 optimal sequence around the E box core. Not only the core sequence but also sequences flanking the E box were essential for the recognition by Helt and Hes1. Furthermore, Helt repressed transcription from an artificial promoter through binding to the optimal E box elements, as well as transcription from its own promoter. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, Helt expression in embryos was investigated. Helt was mainly expressed in undifferentiated neural progenitors in some of the developing brain regions, including the mesencephalon and diencephalon, at the neurogenesis stage.

In the central nervous system, many bHLH factors, which are conserved from flies to vertebrates, have been identified and shown to regulate neurogenesis (1Fisher A. Caudy M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 2Kageyama R. Ishibashi M. Takebayashi K. Tomita K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Some of these bHLH factors, such as Mash1, regulate neurogenesis positively by activating downstream target gene expression, whereas others, such as Hes1, inhibit neuronal differentiation by acting as transcriptional repressors (3Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Tomita K. Mol. Cells. 2000; 10: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4Lee J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The balance of activity between activators and repressors is thought to determine the differentiation status. The bHLH repressors were originally identified in Drosophila as Hairy and E(spl). Subsequently, many vertebrate homologues and additional related proteins were identified (5Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 6Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.M. Lee M.E. J. Biol.

These transcription factors share a common structure, the Orange domain, located just C-terminal to the bHLH domain, and are referred to as the bHLH-Orange (bHLH-O) proteins (10Davis R.L. Turner D.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The members of the bHLH-O family are grouped into four distinct subfamilies, Hairy, E(spl), Hey, and Stra13, based on their primary structures (10Davis R.L. Turner D.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Most of the known members of these subfamilies act as transcriptional repressors. As a general feature among bHLH and bHLH-O proteins, the basic region has been shown to mediate DNA binding, whereas the HLH domain is necessary for dimerization (10Davis R.L. Turner D.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the role of the Orange domain is not well understood. Domain swapping experiments of Hairy and E(spl) in Drosophila revealed that the Orange domain functions in subfamily specificity (11Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6923-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, roles for the Orange domain in transcriptional repression and dimerization have been reported (12Castella P. Sawai S. Nakao K. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6170-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Leimeister C. Dale K. Fischer A. Klamt B. Hrabe de Angelis M. Radtke F. McGrew M.J. Pourquie O. Gessler M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis of these observations has not been clarified. An additional characteristic structure, the WRPW motif, in the C terminus is conserved among the Hairy and E(spl) subfamilies in vertebrates and flies (10Davis R.L. Turner D.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This motif is involved in the recruitment of the TLE/Groucho corepressor and required for the transcriptional repression activity (14Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 15Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Related sequences are present near the C terminus of the Hey subfamily members. However, this region is not required for the repression activity (7Iso T. Sartorelli V. Poizat C. Iezzi S. Wu H.Y. Chung G. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), although a zebrafish Hey2 mutant lacking this region could not rescue the gridlock mutant phenotype (16Zhong T.P. Rosenberg M. Mohideen M.A. Weinstein B. Fishman M.C. Science. 2000; 287: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Rather, the bHLH domain of the Hey family mediates recruitment of other corepressors, N-CoR and mSin3A, to repress the transcription (7Iso T. Sartorelli V. Poizat C. Iezzi S. Wu H.Y. Chung G. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the case of the Stra13 subfamily, histone deacetylase-dependent and -independent transcriptional repression through their C terminus regions has been reported (17Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, which corepressor mediates this repression has not been determined. Hes1 and Hes5 have been shown to act as downstream effectors for Notch signaling (18Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 19Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). When the neural progenitors exit the cell cycle in the ventricular zone of the neural tube, these cells express Notch ligands, Dll1 or Jagged, to activate the Notch receptors expressed on their neighboring progenitor cells. In the Notch-activated cells, Hes1 and Hes5 are induced and repress both the expression and activity of Mash1, and then neuronal differentiation is inhibited. This signaling process, so-called “lateral inhibition,” maintains the number and status of undifferentiated neural progenitors and neural stem cells in the developing central nervous system (21Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In this process, Hes6 can antagonize the activity of Hes1 or Hairy 1/2 to promote neurogenesis (22Bae S. Bessho Y. Hojo M. Kageyama R. Development. 2000; 127: 2933-2943PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gratton M.O. Torban E. Jasmin S.B. Theriault F.M. German M.S. Stifani S. Mol. Cell.

Thus, a balance between the bHLH-O transcriptional repressors is essential for the proper development of the central nervous system. Expression of the Hey family members is also known to be activated by Notch signaling in cultured cells (25Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Iso T. Chung G. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 275: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although it has recently been reported that Hey1 and Hey2 regulate the maintenance of neural progenitors in the developing brain (28Sakamoto M. Hirata H. Ohtsuka T. Bessho Y. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar), the significance of the Hey family downstream of Notch signaling is not evident. Other members of the bHLH-O family, such as Hes3, Hes6, Stra13, and SHARP1, do not respond to Notch activation but are up-regulated by many other signals (24Koyano-Nakagawa N. Kim J. Anderson D. Kintner C. Development. 2000; 127: 4203-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P.

Thus, it is not a general feature that bHLH-O proteins are downstream targets for Notch signaling Here, we report the identification of a novel transcriptional repressor, designated Helt. Helt encodes a Hey-related bHLH protein, which can homodimerize, as well as heterodimerize with Hes5 or Hey2. Helt homodimers can bind to E box elements and repress transcription through binding to these elements. Identification of the preferred recognition sequences by CASTing experiments revealed that Helt binds to the E box, which is distinct from the Hes1 optimal sequence. Furthermore, sequences flanking the E box are essential for the recognition by Helt and Hes1. Helt is mainly expressed in undifferentiated neural progenitors in the developing central nervous system, suggesting that it functions in the regulation of neuronal differentiation. Isolation of Helt—Brain regions including the mesencephalon and metencephalon were dissected from E10.5 mouse embryos and divided into two portions, the ventral and dorsal regions. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Subtractive PCR was performed as described (33Ono Y. Fukuhara N. Yoshie O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6939-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After four rounds of subtractive hybridization, the amplified cDNA fragments were cloned and sequenced. Differential expression of the obtained clones was confirmed by PCR using cDNA amplicons as templates. Full-length cDNAs were screened from an E12.5 mouse brain cDNA library. Four independent clones were obtained and sequenced. Construction of Plasmids—pcDNA-FLAG-NII was constructed by ligating the oligonucleotides 5′-GAT CGG CCA CCA TGG ATT ACA AGG ATG ACG ACG ATA AGG TCG ACC TCG AGG GAT CCG AAT TCG CGG CCG CG-3′ and 5′-TCG ACG CGG CCG CGA ATT CGG ATC CCT CGA GGT CGA CCT TAT CGT CGT CAT CCT TGT AAT CCA TGG TGG CC-3′ into the BamHI/XhoI site of pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). pcDNA-HA-NII was constructed by ligating the oligonucleotides 5′-GAT CGG CCA CCA TGG ACT ACC CAT ACG ACG TCC CAG ACT ACG CTG TCG ACC TCG AGG GAT CCG AAT TCG CGG CCG CG-3′ and 5′-TCG ACG CGG CCG CGA ATT CGG ATC CCT CGA GGT CGA CAG CGT AGT CTG GGA CGT CGT ATG GGT AGT CCA TGG TGG CC-3′ into the BamHI/XhoI site of pcDNA3.1+. pMXIII was constructed by ligating the oligonucleotides 5′-GAT CGA AGC TTA CGC GTG TCG ACC TCG AGG GAT CCG AAT TCG CGG CCG CG-3′ and 5′-TCG ACG CGG CCG CGA ATT CGG ATC CCT CGA GGT CGA CAC GCG TAA GCT TC-3′ into the BamHI-XhoI site of pMXII (34Ono Y.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). pMX-GAL4 was constructed by ligating the cDNA encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain amplified using primers 5′-GAG AAG CTT GCC ACC ATG AAG CTA CTG TCT TCT ATC GAA CA-3′ and 5′-GAG ACG CGT CGG CGA TAC AGT CAA CTG TCT TTG AC-3′ into the HindIII/MluI sites of pMXIII. The cDNAs of Helt, Hes1, Hey2, and Hes5 were amplified by PCR using the following primer sets: Helt, 5′-GAG GTC GAC ATG TCT GAC AGG CTC AAG GAA CGC AA-3′ and 5′-GAG GCG GCC GCT CAG AGC ACC GGA GGG TGC TGG GGC G-3′; Hes1, 5′-GAG CTC GAG ATG CCA GCT GAT ATA ATG GAG AAA AA-3′ and 5′-GAG GCG GCC GCT CAG TTC CGC CAC GGT CTC CAC ATG G-3′; Hey2,5′-GAG CTC GAG ATG AAG CGC CCT TGT GAG GAA ACG AC-3′ and 5′-GAG GCG GCC GCT TAA AAG GCT CCA ACT TCT GTC CCC C-3′; and Hes5, 5′-GAG GTC GAC ATG GCC CCA AGT ACC GTG GCG GTG GA-3′ and 5′-GAG GGA TCC TCA CCA GGG CCG CCA GAG GCC GCA GG-3′. The Helt fragment was digested with SalI/NotI and cloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pcDNA-FLAG-NII, pcDNA-HA-NII, pMXIII, and pMX-GAL4. Hes1 and Hey2 fragments were digested with XhoI/NotI and cloned into the same sites of pcDNA-FLAG-NII and pcDNA-HA-NII and pMXIII. The Hes5 fragment was digested with SalI/BamHI and cloned into the XhoI/BamHI sites of pcDNA-FLAG-NII and pcDNA-HA-NII. Various mutant Helt constructs containing the following amino acid (aa) residues were made: Helt-WT, aa 1–240 (full-length); HeltΔH, aa 76–240; HeltΔO, aa 1–83 + 127–240; HeltΔC, aa 1–140; HeltΔC2, aa 1–207; Helt-H, aa 1–75; Helt-O, aa 76–140; and Helt-C, aa 141–240. A Helt-BM mutant substituting Lys-Arg-Arg (20Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol.

Multiple responsive elements containing reporters were constructed by ligating the following oligonucleotides into the KpnI/SacI sites of the pGL2-promoter (Promega): E box class A-luc, 5′-CGG CAG GTG CCG GCA GGT GCC GGC AGG TGC CGG CAG GTG CCG GCA GGT GCC GAG CT-3′ and 5′-CGG CAC CTG CCG GCA CCT GCC GGC ACC TGC CGG CAC CTG CCG GCA CCT GCC GGT AC-3′; E box class B-luc, 5′-CGG CAC GTG CCG GCA CGT GCC GGC ACG TGC CGG CAC GTG CCG GCA CGT GCC GAG CT-3′ and 5′-CGG CAC GTG CCG GCA CGT GCC GGC ACG TGC CGG CAC GTG CCG GCA CGT GCC GGT AC-3′; E box class C1-luc, 5′-CGG CAC GCG ACG GCA CGC GAC GGC ACG CGA CGG CAC GCG ACG GCA CGC GAC GAG CT-3′ and 5′-CGT CGC GTG CCG TCG CGT GCC GTC GCG TGC CGT CGC GTG CCG TCG CGT GCC GGT AC-3′; E box class C1-1-luc, 5′-CCG CAC GCG ACC GCA CGC GAC CGC ACG CGA CCG CAC GCG ACC GCA CGC GAC GAG CT-3′ and 5′-CGT CGC GTG CGG TCG CGT GCG GTC GCG TGC GGT CGC GTG CGG TCG CGT GCG GGT AC-3′; E box class C1-2-luc, 5′-CGG CAC GCG ACG GCA CGC GAC GGC ACG CGA CGG CAC GCG ACG GCA CGC GAC GAG CT-3′ and 5′-CGT CGC GTG CCG TCG CGT GCC GTC GCG TGC CGT CGC GTG CCG TCG CGT GCC GGT AC-3′; E box class C1-5-luc, 5′-CGG CAC GCG CCG GCA CGC GCC GGC ACG CGC CGG CAC GCG CCG GCA CGC GCC GAG CT-3′ and 5′-CGG CGC GTG CCG GCG CGT GCC GGC GCG TGC CGG CGC GTG CCG GCG CGT GCC GGT AC-3′; E box class C1-6-luc, 5′-CAA CAC GCG TTA ACA CGC GTT AAC ACG CGT TAA CAC GCG TTA ACA CGC GTT GAG CT-3′ and 5′-CAA CGC GTG TTA ACG CGT GTT AAC GCG TGT TAA CGC GTG TTA ACG CGT GTT GGT AC-3′; and UAS-SV40-luc, 5′-CCG GAG TAC TGT CCT CCG AGC GGA GTA CTG TCC TCC GAG CGG AGT ACT GTC CTC CGA GCG GAG TAC TGT CCT CCG AGG AGC T-3′ and 5′-CCT CGG AGG ACA GTA CTC CGC TCG GAG GAC AGT ACT CCG CTC GGA GGA CAG TAC TCC GCT CGG AGG ACA GTA CTC CGG GTA C-3′. Helt promoter reporter constructs were constructed by ligating the genomic fragments amplified using the following primers into the KpnI/SacI sites of pGL2-basic (Promega): -934-luc, 5′-GAG GGT ACC ATA GGC TAC AAA TTG AGC CTC TTC CC-3′ and 5′-GAG GAG CTC CGT TCC ACC TCG TGT GCC TCT TCA AG-3′; -780-luc, 5′-GAG GGT ACC TGC CAG CCG CAG CCC CAC ACC TGC CG-3′ and 5′-GAG GAG CTC CGT TCC ACC TCG TGT GCC TCT TCA AG-3′; and -934Δ27-luc, 5′-GAG GGT ACC ATA GGC TAC AAA TTG AGC CTC TTC CC-3′ and 5′-GAG GAG CTC TTC CAG GTA GAC TGC AGC CTC CCA GG-3′. -934M-luc was constructed by mutagenesis of two E box class B, CACGTG (-304 and -323) to GTCGTG. Immunoprecipitation—293E cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293E cells (2 × 106) were transfected with the indicated combinations of 5 μg of each plasmid using TransIT LT1 reagent (Mirus Corp.). Immunoprecipitation experiments and detection by Western blotting were performed as described (33Ono Y. Fukuhara N. Yoshie O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6939-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). EMSA—Cell lysates of transfected 293E cells were prepared as described. Biotinylated oligonucleotides were annealed to generate double-stranded probes. One microliter of each cell lysate was incubated with in the presence or absence of competitors (150 ng) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (2.8 μg) for 5 min at room temperature and then with biotinylated probes (0.5 ng) for another 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of a solution consisting of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 μm ZnSO4, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The samples were electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel with Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 50 V for 2.0 h. Detection of the biotinylated oligonucleotides was carried out using a chemiluminescent EMSA kit, LightShift (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotide probes were as follows: E box class A, 5′-TCG AGG GTG GCA GGT GCC ATT-3′; E box class B, 5′-TCG AGG GTG GCA CGT GCC ATT-3′; E box class C1, 5′-TCG AGA GCC GGC ACG CGA CAG G-3′; E box class B mutant, 5′-TCG AGG GTG GAT CGT ACC ATT-3′; E box class C1 mutant, 5′-TCG AGA GCC GGG TCG CGA CAG G-3′; C1-1, 5′-CCT CGC ACG CGA CGG CTC TCG A-3′; C1-2, 5′-TCG AGA GCC GGC ACG CGA CAG G-3′; C1-3, 5′-CCT CTC ACG CGA CGG CTC TCG A-3′; C1-4, 5′-TCG AGA GCC GTC ACG CGA CAG G-3′; C1-5, 5′-TCG AGA GCC GGC ACG CGC CAG G; and C1-6, 5′-CCT AAC ACG CGT TGG CTC TCG A-3′. Reporter Assays—NS20Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Recipient cells (5 × 104) were transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids together with 0.005 μg of pRL-SV40 (Promega) using TransIT LT1 reagent. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared and assayed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized with Renilla luciferase activity. CASTing—Double-stranded degenerate oligonucleotides were amplified using a random oligonucleotide, 5′-CAG CTC CAC AAC CTA CAT CAT TCC ACT TT(N)18TTT GTC AGA GTC TCA GAG AGA AGA TGG AC-3′, as a template and the primer set 5′-CAG CTC CAC AAC CTA CAT CAT TCC AC-3′ and 5′-GTC CAT CTT CTC TCT GAG ACT CTG AC-3′. Amplification was carried out by three cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s (2 min in the first cycle), annealing at 65 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified DNA was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and 50 ng of degenerate oligonucleotides was incubated with 25 μl of cell lysates of transfected 293E cells in an EMSA reaction buffer. Bound oligonucleotides were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody beads and eluted with FLAG peptide. The eluted oligonucleotides were then amplified by 15 cycles of PCR. After four rounds of selection, the amplified oligonucleotides were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—NS20Y cells (1 × 106) were transfected with the indicated expression vector. After 24 h, cells were lysed on ice in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA for 30 min. Nuclei were cross-linked on ice in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min and lysed on ice for 10 min in 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA. The lysates were sonicated on ice and diluted 1:10 in 1.1% Triton X-100, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 167 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA buffer. Cross-linked protein/DNA complex was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified with a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification of endogenous Helt promoter fragment and HNF3β genomic fragment (as a control) was carried out by denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s (5 min in the first cycle), annealing at 65 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s (5 min in the last cycle) with ExTaq polymerase (Takara). The number of cycles was 30 for both genomic fragments. The primer sequences were as follows: Helt promoter, 5′-GCC TCC GTC TCC AGA AGC TCT CCC TT-3′ and 5′-GCC TCT TCA AGT GTT CCA GGT AGA CT-3′; and HNF3β genome, 5′-TGC ACC CAG ACT CGG GCA ACA TGT TC-3′ and 5′-TCC TGA CAC GGA GAA GCG CTG GAA TG-3′. RT-PCR—RT-PCR was performed essentially as described previously (35Ono Y. Fukuhara N. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4576-4581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ExTaq polymerase was used for amplification. Amplification was carried out by denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s (2 min in the first cycle), annealing at 65 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s (2 min in the last cycle). The numbers of cycles were 35 for Helt and 25 for G3PDH. The primer sequences were as follows: Helt, 5′-CTG CTT GAA CGA GCT GGG CAA GAC AG-3′ and 5′-CTT GGA TTG CAA GAA GGC GAG GAT GC-3′; and G3PDH, 5′-ACG ACC CCT TCA TTG ACC TCA ACT AC-3′ and 5′-CAA GTA GAC TCC ACG ACA TAC TCA GC-3′. In Situ Hybridization—Mouse embryos were harvested at E12.5 and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 2 h. After fixation, the embryos were cryoprotected and sectioned into 16-μm coronal and sagittal sections for in situ hybridization. A DIG-labeled Helt probe was transcribed with digoxigenin-11-UTP according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) from a 1.2-kb cDNA amplified using the following primers: 5′-CTT GAA GAG GCA CAC GAG GTG GAA CG-3′ and 5′-TCG CAA GTA ATC TAG GCA GTG AGT GG-3′. For hybridization with Helt probes, cryosections were refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS. Tissue sections were hybridized with Helt probes diluted (final concentration 1 μg/ml) in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml heparin, 50 μg/ml tRNA, pH 4.5) for 40 h at 68 °C. After hybridization, the sections were washed three times with buffer 1 (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1% SDS) at 68 °C for 20 min and then treated with 0.05 μg/ml RNase A in 1× RNase buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature for 5 min followed by three 5-min incubations in 1× RNase buffer at room temperature. The sections were then washed three times with 0.2× SSC at 68 °C for 5 min and three times with 1× TBS-T (TBS containing Tween 20) at room temperature for 5 min. For immunological detection of DIG-labeled hybrids, the sections were first blocked in 1× blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a solution containing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-DIG Fab fragments (DAKO) diluted 1:80 in 1× TBS-T. The sections were then washed three times with 1× TBS-T containing 2 mm levamisole at room temperature for 20 min followed by equilibration with buffer 2 (0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm levamisole) at room temperature for 5 min. The alkaline phosphatase chromogen reaction was performed using nitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (DAKO) as the substrate at room temperature for 20 h. The sections were then washed with distilled water, treated with xylene, and mounted in mounting medium. Immunohistochemistry—A polyclonal rabbit anti-Helt antibody was raised against glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HeltΔbHLH (aa 76–240) and affinity-purified. 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed cryosections, as described above, were washed three times with PBS at room temperature for 5 min. The sections were blocked in 25% Block Ace (Dainipponseiyaku) at room temperature for 30 min and incubated with one of the following antibodies overnight at 4 °C: mouse anti-βIII-tubulin (TuJ1, Covance) or mouse anti-Lim1/2 (4F2, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). The sections were washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (1× PBS-T) and then incubated in one of the following secondary antibodies: fluorescein- or Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson). For immunological reactions, the sections were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times with 1× PBS-T, and mounted in mounting medium. BrdUrd (Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally into pregnant mice (50 μg/g of body weight) 2 h before isolation of embryos at E12.5. Embryos were harvested and analyzed for incorporation of BrdUrd using anti-BrdUrd antibodies (Roche Applied Science) in combination with anti-Helt antibodies. Immunofluorescence analysis of the transfected NS20Y cells was performed as described (34Ono Y. Nakanishi H. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Satoh-Horikawa K. Mandai K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes). Cloning of Helt as a Novel bHLH-O Transcription Factor—To identify transcription factors regulating neuronal differentiation in the developing brain, we performed subtractive PCR using total RNA derived from E10.5 ventral and dorsal neural tubes as the tester and driver, respectively. One of the genes isolated, which encoded a novel protein, was confirmed to be specifically expressed in the ventral region of the E10.5 brain by RT-PCR (data not shown). To obtain the full-length cDNA, a mouse E12.5 brain cDNA library was screened. Four clones were obtained, and the longest clone, 1548 bp (hereafter called Helt: Hey-like transcriptional repressor), had a 240-amino-acid-long open reading frame. Computer data base searches revealed that Helt had a bHLH domain and an Orange domain, which are characteristic motifs among the bHLH-O family transcriptional repressors (Fig. 1A).

We have investigated each step of transcription initiation to determine where T7 lysozyme has the most effect. Stopped flow and equilibrium DNA binding studies indicate that T7 lysozyme does not inhibit the formation of the preinitiation open complex (open complex in the absence of initiating nucleotide). T7 lysozyme, however, does prevent the formation of a fully open initiation complex (open complex in the presence of the initiating nucleotide). This is consistent with the results that in the presence of T7 lysozyme the rate of G ladder RNA synthesis is about 5-fold slower and the GTP Kd is about 2-fold higher, but T7 lysozyme does not inhibit the initial rate of RNA synthesis with a premelted bulge-6 promoter (bubble from -4 to +2). Neither the RNA synthesis rate nor the extent of promoter opening is restored by increasing the initiating nucleotide concentration, indicating that T7 lysozyme represses transcription by interfering with the formation of a stable and a fully open initiation bubble or by altering the structure of the DNA in the initiation complex. As a consequence of the unstable initiation bubble and/or the inhibition of the conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of T7 RNAP, T7 lysozyme causes an increased production of abortive products from 2- to 5-mer that delays the transition from the initiation to the elongation phase.

The regulation of transcription in bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; 3′-dGTP, 3′-deoxyguanosine-triphosphate; ds, double-stranded; 2-AP, 2-aminopurine; nt, nontemplate; t, template. as in all RNA polymerases is dependent on the efficiency of each step of transcription, such as binding promoter DNA, binding nucleotides, overcoming abortive synthesis, RNA synthesis, and termination. Each of these steps is therefore a potential target for regulation. T7 transcription regulation begins with the gradual entry of the phage DNA into a host Escherichia coli cell (1McAllister W.T. Morris C. Rosenberg A.H. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 153: 527-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) followed by the ability of the T7 RNAP, without the aid of auxiliary factors, to recognize and transcribe the phage promoters (2McAllister W.T. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 385-391PubMed Google Scholar, 3McAllister W.T. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1997; 11: 15-25Crossref Google Scholar). The phage then makes T7 lysozyme, which represses transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. Unlike the LacI or the LexA repressors, which sterically block promoters from their polymerases, T7 lysozyme binds the T7 RNAP, not the DNA, forming a tertiary complex with the polymerase and DNA (4Schlax PJ. Capp M.W. Record M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Bertrand-Burggraf E. Hurstel S. Daune M. Schnarr M. J. Mol.

T7 lysozyme binds to the T7 RNAP at a site distal to the polymerase active site as confirmed by both biochemical data and a crystal structure of the T7 RNAP-T7 lysozyme complex (8Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4101-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Moffatt B.A. Studier F.W.

A. 1994; 91: 4034-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that T7 lysozyme inhibits transcription initiation and promoter clearance but not elongation (6Zhang X. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 10-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Kumar A. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13954-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism by which these processes are inhibited is not known. We have therefore investigated T7 lysozyme inhibition under pre-steady state conditions enabling us to more fully dissect the steps that are altered during transcription. Transcription initiation occurs with a minimum of three steps (Reaction 1). In the first step, RNAP (E) binds to the promoter DNA (D) to form a closed complex, EDc, which isomerizes to form the preinitiation open complex, EDo. The preinitiation open complex binds the initiating nucleotides (N) to form the initiation complex, EDoNN. E+D⇄EDC⇄EDo⇄EDoNNReaction 1 A stopped flow kinetic study of DNA binding showed that T7 lysozyme has a very small effect on the observed rate of formation of the preinitiation open complex. In the presence of T7 lysozyme, the initial RNA synthesis rate is slow even with saturating initiating nucleotide. The 2-AP fluorescence of the DNA indicates that the promoter in the initiation complex is not fully open. This is consistent with the results that T7 lysozyme affects the rate of initiation on a duplex promoter but not on a permanently open promoter DNA or a promoter DNA with even a single mismatch in the initiation region. The destabilization or the alteration of the structure of the initiation complex by T7 lysozyme is responsible for the inhibition of initial RNA synthesis and could also be the cause for the formation of more abortive products, which in turn delays the transition from initiation to elongation. Synthetic DNA and Other Materials—The oligodeoxynucleotides (unmodified and 2-AP-modified) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and supplied as desalted samples. As described previously (11Stano N.M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1009-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the oligodeoxynucleotides were further purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroelution, and ethanol precipitation. The 3′-dGTP was purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA). Protein—T7 RNAP was overexpressed in E. coli BL21/pAR1219 (12Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified as described previously (13Jia Y.P. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Jia Y. Patel S.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with the exception that the CM-Sephadex separation step was eliminated. The purified enzyme was stored at -80 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 1 mm trisodium EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm sodium chloride, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. The enzyme concentration was calculated from its absorbance at 280 nm and with a molar extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 105m-1 cm-1 (16King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). T7 lysozyme was purified according to a reported procedure (10Cheng X. Zhang X. Pflugrath J.W. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4034-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The purified enzymes were checked for the lack of DNA exonuclease activity. Pre-steady State Kinetics of RNA Synthesis—The pre-steady state kinetic experiments were carried out on a rapid chemical quenched flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). As a general protocol, T7 RNAP and DNA preincubated either in the presence or absence of T7 lysozyme in buffer X (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol) were mixed rapidly with NTPs containing [γ-32P]GTP in buffer L (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Additional magnesium acetate was added to the NTP solution to maintain a constant amount of free Mg2+. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a water bath in all pre-steady state experiments. After predetermined time intervals, the reaction was quenched by rapidly mixing 1 n HCl from a third syringe. Chloroform was then added, and the reactions were neutralized by the addition of base (0.25 m Tris base and 1 m sodium hydroxide). The RNA products were resolved by electrophoresis on a highly cross-linked (23% polyacrylamide, 3% bis-acrylamide, 3 m urea) gel at 55 °C (110 W) on a Bio-Rad sequencing gel apparatus (0.25-mm spacers and comb). The gels were exposed to a phosphor screen and scanned on a Typhoon instrument (Molecular Dynamics), and the RNA products were quantified using the ImageQuaNT program. Stopped Flow Kinetics—The stopped flow experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a SF-2001 spectrophotometer from KinTek Corp (Austin, TX) equipped with a photomultiplier detection system. The kinetics of GTP binding was monitored by mixing increasing concentrations of GTP in buffer A (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol) from one syringe with a preincubated solution of T7 RNAP and dsDNA with or without T7 lysozyme in buffer A from the second syringe. The dsDNA contained a single 2-AP residue at position nt(+4) on the template strand. Additional magnesium acetate was included with the GTP solution to maintain a constant concentration of free Mg2+. As the two solutions (30 μl from each syringe) were rapidly mixed (flow rate of 6.0 ml s-1), the 2-AP was excited at 315 nm. The progress of the reaction was monitored by measuring the intensity of the fluorescence emission using a cut-on filter >360 nm (WG360, Hi-Tech Scientific, serial no. 273129).

The KinTek stopped flow kinetic software was used to fit the stopped flow kinetic traces to Equation 1 describing single or multiple exponential changes, F=∑An×exp(-kobs,n×t)+C(Eq. 1) where F is the fluorescence intensity at time t; n is the number of exponential terms; An and kobs,n are the amplitude and the observed rate constant of the nth term, respectively; and C is the fluorescence intensity at t = 0. The observed rate constant (kobs) was plotted as a function of GTP, and the dependence was fit by nonlinear regression analysis to the hyperbolic equation 2 (17Johnson K.A. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992: 1-61Google Scholar) using SigmaPlot. kobs=kconf×[GTP]Kd+[GTP](Eq. 2) Where kconf is the rate of a conformational change upon GTP binding, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of GTP. Equilibrium Fluorescence Measurements—T7 RNAP (1 μm) was mixed with 0.5 μm DNA containing a single 2-AP residue at t(-4) in Buffer A in a 200-μl quartz cuvette at 25 °C. The sample was excited with 315-nm light (2.5-nm bandwidth), and the resulting fluorescence intensity at 370 nm (2.5-nm bandwidth) was measured on a Fluoro-Max-2 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon-Spex Instruments S.A., Inc.) using the DataMax software program. The fluorescence was then measured after the addition of T7 lysozyme (10 μm). Similar experiments were carried out in the presence of +2 NTP (500 μm 3′-dGTP, 1 mm ATP, or 4 mm GTP). Additional magnesium acetate was included with the GTP (4 mm) to maintain a constant amount of free Mg2+ in solution. The fluorescence of T7 RNAP and T7 lysozyme was subtracted out by carrying out a control experiment with the nonfluorescent DNAs. The corrected fluorescence is F = Ff - Fnf where Ff and Fnf are the fluorescence intensities of samples containing 2-AP-modified and nonfluorescent DNA, respectively. Promoter DNAs—Several synthetic promoter DNAs were used in these studies (Table I). The dsDNA is a fully duplex promoter that contains the T7 ϕ10 promoter consensus sequence from -21 to +19 and initiates RNA synthesis at +1 with the sequence GGG. The p-dsDNA and bulge-6 DNAs are considered mimics of an opened promoter. To monitor open complex formation and nucleotide binding the fluorescent adenine analog 2-AP was incorporated at position -4 in the template or at position +4 in the nontemplate strand relative to the transcription start site. Altered promoters with the initiation sequence (GAC) were used to distinguish binding of the +1 and +2 initiating nucleotides.Table ISequence of the DNA promotersA, 2-aminopurine.DNADescriptionSequencep-dsDNA-4 to +19 ss template5′-AAATTAATACGACTCAC-3′3′-TTTAATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCTCTGGTGTTGCCAAAG-5′p-dsDNA(GAC)-4 to +19 ss template5′-AAATTAATACGACTCAC-3′3′-TTTAATTATGCTGAGTGATATCtgTCTGGTGTTGCCAAAG-5′Bulge-6-4 to +2 mismatch5′-AAATTAATACGACTCACCCGCATGAGACCACAACGGTTTC-3′3′-TTTAATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCTCTGGTGTTGCCAAAG-5′Bulge-1-2 AA mismatch5′-AAATTAATACGACTCACTAAAGGGAGACCACAACGGTTTC-3′3′-TTTAATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCTCTGGTGTTGCCAAAG-5′dsDNA40-bp concensus5′-AAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACGGTTTC-3′3′-TTTAATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCTCTGGTGTTGCCAAAG-5′dsDNA(GAC)+2 and +3 bases altered from consensus5′-AAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGacAGACCACAACGGTTTC-3′3′-TTTAATTATGCTGAGTGATATCtgTCTGGTGTTGCCAAAG-5′ Open table in a new tab T7 Lysozyme Does Not Affect Promoter Binding or the Rate of Preinitiation Open Complex Formation—Previous studies have shown that T7 lysozyme inhibits both transcription initiation and the transition from initiation to elongation (7Kumar A. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13954-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). T7 lysozyme does not reduce transcription by preventing the promoter DNA from binding to the T7 RNAP or by decreasing the affinity of the promoter for the RNAP (6Zhang X. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 10-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Kumar A. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13954-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because this was determined using indirect method, we sought to verify the observation with a more direct assay. The kinetics of promoter binding and the formation of the preinitiation open complex were measured in real time using a promoter DNA that was modified with the fluorescent adenine analog 2-AP (Table I). During open complex formation, the -4 to +2/+3 region of the promoter is converted from a duplex to a single-stranded region. If 2-AP is substituted for the adenines in the melted region, open complex formation is accompanied by an increase in 2-AP fluorescence, which can be easily monitored. Any adenine in the melting region may be substituted with 2-AP. The greatest increase in fluorescence upon binding to T7 RNAP is observed when the 2-AP is positioned at the -4 position of the template strand, t(-4) (19Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is because the adenine at t(-4) undergoes a large structural change, becoming both unpaired and unstacked from its neighboring guanine (20Cheetham G.M.T. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and it is the latter process that gives the large fluorescence increase (21Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We have verified that the insertion of 2-AP does not affect promoter binding or transcription (13Jia Y.P. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Jia Y. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30147-30153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The steps of DNA binding and the formation of the preinitiation open complex were measured with the dsDNA promoter containing 2-AP at t(-4), as described previously (19Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). T7 RNAP in the presence or the absence of T7 lysozyme was mixed with the promoter DNA in a stopped flow apparatus, and the increasing fluorescence intensity was monitored as a function of time. We used 12 μm of T7 lysozyme, which is above the Kd of T7 lysozyme (7Kumar A. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13954-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as higher concentrations increased the background fluorescence interfering with signal detection. The hyperbolic fit of the observed rate versus [DNA] provided K½ and an observed rate of preinitiation open complex equal to 0.9 ± 0.2 μm and 116 ± 6 s-1 and 1.1 ± 0.5 μm and 87 ± 10 s-1 in the absence and presence of T7 lysozyme, respectively (see supplemental material). The similar rates of DNA binding with and without T7 lysozyme indicates that T7 lysozyme has very little effect on the rate of preinitiation open complex formation. T7 Lysozyme Decreases the Pre-steady State Rate of RNA Synthesis but Does Not Significantly Affect the Kd of the Initiating Nucleotide—Subsequent to the steps of promoter DNA binding and the formation of a preinitiation open complex are the steps of initiating nucleotide binding to form the initiation complex that is ready to make the RNA. By monitoring the steady state kinetics of abortive synthesis, it has been determined that the Km of the initiating nucleotides GTP increases in the presence of T7 lysozyme (18Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The steady state Km, however, is a kinetic constant whose value is influenced by the formation as well as the dissociation rates of the abortive products and thus may not reflect the Kd of GTP, which may be greater than, less than, or equal to the Km (17Johnson K.A. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992: 1-61Google Scholar). Therefore, pre-steady state kinetic experiments were used to measure the rate of RNA synthesis with increasing [GTP] with and without T7 lysozyme. The dsDNA promoter was preincubated with T7 RNAP in the presence or the absence of T7 lysozyme, and transcription was initiated by the rapid addition of [γ-32P]GTP. The reactions were quenched after millisecond time intervals with the aid of a rapid chemical quenched flow apparatus, and the RNA products were quantitated. In the presence of GTP alone, we see the production of pppGpG and pppGpGpG RNA products and also some pppGpGpGpG at longer times (Fig. 1, left panel). The G ladder production increased linearly with time up to 0.25 s, and the slope provided the initial rate. The initial rate was plotted as a function of [GTP], and the results indicated that the rate at maximal [GTP] is reduced ∼5-fold (from 7 s-1 to 1.5 s-1) when T7 lysozyme is present (Fig. 1, right panel). Because of the low signal, we were unable to get an accurate value of the GTP Kd from this radiometric assay in the presence of T7 lysozyme. A 20-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency was calculated from the initial slope of rate versus [GTP] dependence (11.6 ± 2.5 s-1 mm-1 without T7 lysozyme and 0.56 ± 0.1 s-1 mm-1 in the presence of T7 lysozyme). To determine the effect of T7 lysozyme on the Kd of the initiating GTP, a more sensitive fluorescence assay was used. In this assay, GTP binding and a subsequent conformational change is monitored by following the changes in the 2-AP-modified promoter DNA (14Jia Y. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30147-30153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Bandwar R.P. Jia Y. Stano N.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using a stopped flow apparatus, T7 RNAP and the dsDNA containing 2-AP at nt(+4) with or without T7 lysozyme was rapidly mixed with a solution of GTP (Fig. 2a). This resulted in a time-dependent increase in fluorescence (Fig. 2b), and the observed rate was plotted against GTP concentration (Fig. 2c). The hyperbolic fit provided average Kd values of the +1 and +2 GTP as 435 ± 276 and 742 ± 233 μm in the absence and the presence of T7 lysozyme, respectively. Note that in the absence of T7 lysozyme, the GTP Kd is consistent with the values previously reported (11Stano N.M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1009-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Bandwar R.P. Jia Y. Stano N.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, T7 lysozyme doubles the apparent Kd of GTP and causes over a 3-fold decrease in the maximal rate of a conformational change occurring upon GTP binding (kconf). T7 Lysozyme Does Not Inhibit the Rate of Initial RNA Synthesis on a “Premelted” Promoter—The experiments thus far show that T7 lysozyme inhibits the rate of RNA synthesis during initiation. Both the stopped flow and radiometric assays show that the inhibition cannot be overcome by increasing the initiating GTP concentration. We next measured transcription in the presence of all rNTPs to observe the effect of T7 lysozyme on the synthesis of longer RNA. T7 RNAP and dsDNA in the absence or the presence of T7 lysozyme was mixed with four rNTPs (1 mm of GTP and 500 μm other NTPs) and [γ-32P]GTP in a rapid chemical quenched flow instrument. The reaction was quenched after various times, and the products resolved on a sequencing gel are shown in Fig. 3a. In the presence of T7 lysozyme, the pre-steady state rate of RNA synthesis is 3-fold slower (Table II), which is evident from the decrease in the initial burst phase with T7 lysozyme shown in Fig. 3b. The abortive products from 2- to 5-mer on the other hand are produced in greater amounts with T7 lysozyme (Fig. 3c). Hence, the steady state rate of RNA synthesis is actually higher in the presence of T7 lysozyme (Table II). The 19-mer run-off product is produced with a longer delay in the presence of T7 lysozyme (Fig. 3d).Table IIKinetic parameters of RNA synthesis with and without T7 lysozymePromoterPre-steady state rate of RNA synthesisSteady-state rate of RNA synthesis—T7 lysozyme+T7 lysozyme—T7 lysozyme+T7 lysozymeμM s-1μM s-1dsDNA12 ± 54 ± 0.61.0 ± 0.052 ± 0.1Bulge-614.5 ± 1.711 ± 0.24 ± 0.46 ± 0.2Bulge-112 ± 1.214 ± 0.62 ± 0.37 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab Similar measurement of the pre-steady state kinetics of RNA synthesis on a “premelted” DNA was carried out to determine whether T7 lysozyme inhibits the chemistry step. Bulge-6 is considered a mimic of a melted promoter because it contains 6 noncomplementary bases to the template strand in the initiation region (-4 to +2). This substrate was chosen over the p-dsDNA because the bulge-6 contains the nontemplate strand, which is capable of interacting with T7 RNAP. The initial rate of total RNA synthesis with the bulge-6 promoter is unaffected by the presence of T7 lysozyme (Table II), as evident from the similar burst phase with and without T7 lysozyme in Fig. 4a. The bulge-1 DNA shows a similar behavior as bulge-6 (Fig. 4d). This indicates that T7 lysozyme does not alter the chemical step of RNA synthesis as long as the DNA is premelted or easily melted. Even though T7 lysozyme had little effect on the RNA synthesis rate, the production of abortive products from 2- to 5-mer with bulge-6 and from 2- to 5-mer with bulge-1 was increased in the presence of T7 lysozyme (Fig. 4, b and e). This results in a higher steady state rate with T7 lysozyme (Table II). T7 Lysozyme Affects the Formation of the Open Complex in the Presence of the Initiating Nucleotide—Our results indicate that the decrease in the rate of initiation cannot be attributed to a defect in the formation of the preinitiation complex or a defect in chemistry or solely to an increase in the GTP Kd. Increased abortive synthesis in the presence of T7 lysozyme appears to be due to an effect on the stability of the open complex during initiation. To explore this idea, we have used 2-AP fluorescence to investigate the nature of the open complexes in the preinitiation and initiation stages with and without T7 lysozyme. The crystal structure of T7 RNAP-promoter complex, which likely represents the structure of the preinitiation complex, shows that the promoter DNA is unpaired from -4 to +2 and that the -4 base is unstacked from the -5 base (21Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A promoter DNA containing 2-AP at t(-4) when bound to T7 RNAP has a higher fluorescence relative to the fluorescence of the free 2-AP-modified DNA, mainly because the t(-4) base is unstacked in the open complex. To investigate the nature of the open complex with and without T7 lysozyme, we compared the 2-AP fluorescence of E ·p-dsDNA and E ·dsDNA (23Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of E·dsDNA is 30% of E·p-dsDNA (Fig. 5a) as measured with the (GAC) promoter in the absence of the initiating nucleotide. The fluorescence of E·dsDNA·ATP, however, is close to that of E·p-dsDNA·ATP, indicating as previously reported that the addition of the +2 nucleotide NTP drives open complex formation (23Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Even in the presence of T7 lysozyme (L), the fluorescence of EL·dsDNA is 30% of the EL·p-dsDNA. Thus, T7 lysozyme has little effect on the formation or the stability of the preinitiation open complex. However, the fluorescence of EL·dsDNA·ATP is only 42% of EL·p-dsDNA·ATP. The addition of GTP, the +1 nucleotide, along with the ATP produced no further increase in fluorescence (data not shown). The inability of the +2 ATP to drive open complex formation to completion in the presence of T7 lysozyme was not due to subsaturating concentrations of ATP. The Kd of the +2 nucleotide was obtained from fluorescence equilibrium titrations. The preinitiation E·dsDNA complex of the (GAC) promoter in the absence or the presence of T7 lysozyme was titrated with ATP, and the increase in fluorescence was measured. The ATP dependence fit to a hyperbolic equation provided an ATP Kd of 89 ± 12 μm in the absence and 134 ± 64 μm in the presence of T7 lysozyme (data not shown). The +2 nucleotide Kd is only slightly affected by T7 lysozyme. The fact that the fluorescence of EL·dsDNA·ATP does not reach the level of the fully open promoter even with a high concentration of the initiating nucleotide, indicates that T7 lysozyme affects the structure of the initiation complex rather than the equilibrium constant of the initiation complex. Similar experiments were carried out with the (GGG) promoter to eliminate the possibility that the effect of T7 lysozyme on the initiation complex was due to the use of the nonconsensus (GAC) promoter. As shown in Fig. 5b, the results are similar to that of the (GAC) promoter. The nucleotide 3′-dGTP was substituted for GTP to avoid complications from RNA synthesis (14Jia Y. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30147-30153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Bandwar R.P. Jia Y. Stano N.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the preinitiation open complex is not affected by T7 lysozyme, but the initiation complex is perturbed by T7 lysozyme. Because the 2-mer RNA synthesis rate was not affected by T7 lysozyme with an already or readily melted promoter, one would predict that T7 lysozyme would not affect the formation of the initiation complex with these promoters. This is indeed the case as shown in Fig. 5c. The fluorescence of bulge-6 and bulge-1 in complex with T7 RNAP is similar to that of the p-dsDNA. Upon addition of GTP, the dsDNA complex showed the characteristic increase in fluorescence from 30 to 100%, but no change was observed in the bulge DNAs. In the presence of T7 lysozyme (10 μm), a slight decrease in the fluorescence of bulge DNA preinitiation complexes was observed, but this was overcome by the addition of nucleotide. Thus, the initiation complex of bulge-6, bulge-1 or p-dsDNA was unaffected by the presence of T7 lysozyme. The fluorescence of EL·dsDNA with GTP was greater than with 3′-dGTP (65% versus 40%) most likely because of the stabilizing effects of the newly synthesized RNA. The experiments presented here were carried out to investigate the mechanism by which T7 lysozyme inhibits T7 RNAP transcription. It is already known that unlike many other transcriptional repressors, which sterically block promoters from their polymerases, T7 lysozyme does not bind DNA. Rather it directly binds to T7 RNAP to form a tertiary complex with the polymerase and DNA (7Kumar A. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13954-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More specifically, a crystal structure of the T7 lysozyme-T7 RNAP complex revealed that T7 lysozyme binds to a site distal to the polymerase active site and causes little change in the overall T7 RNAP structure with the exception of the extreme C terminus. These last four residues (FAFA883) are disordered in the complexed structure, whereas in the T7 RNAP-DNA complex structure they are located below the polymerase active site (8Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4101-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, biochemical data revealed that mutations in any of these four C-terminal residues result in decreased T7 RNAP activity (24Gardner L.P. Mookhtiar K.A. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2908-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that the C terminus is more sensitive to proteolysis in the presence of T7 lysozyme (25Huang J. Villemain J. Padilla R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been proposed based on this information and steady state transcription assays that showed an increase in the NTP apparent Km during initiation that T7 lysozyme inhibits T7 RNAP by stabilizing the conformation of the T7 RNAP with an altered C terminus. This model predicts that inhibition can be overcome by the addition of nucleotide (18Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Huang J. Villemain J. Padilla R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have further investigated this model for T7 lysozyme inhibition of T7 RNAP transcription initiation using pre-steady state techniques. During T7 RNAP transcription initiation there are several potential points for regulation by T7 lysozyme. The first potential regulatory site is promoter binding. Stopped flow experiments indicated that T7 lysozyme does not prevent T7 RNAP from binding the promoter. Similarly, the preinitiation complex formation rate was affected only to a small extent in the presence of T7 lysozyme. We next explored the possibility that T7 lysozyme altered the binding of the initiating nucleotide to the T7 RNAP-promoter preinitiation complex. A quenched flow radiometric assay measuring the rate of RNA synthesis during initiation at increasing [GTP] showed that the rate of G ladder synthesis decreased 5-fold in the presence of T7 lysozyme. The rate could not be restored even by high concentrations of nucleotide (2 mm GTP). Because obtaining a reliable GTP Kd value was impossible due to the difficulty in measuring the products synthesized in the presence of T7 lyszoyme, a fluorescent assay monitoring an increase in 2-AP fluorescence upon GTP binding was employed. The stopped flow assay also indicated that the maximal rate of a conformational change occurring upon GTP binding (kconf) was reduced ∼3-fold, whereas the average GTP Kd was increased at most 2-fold in the presence of T7 lysozyme. These results are only partly in agreement with the proposed mechanism of Villemain and Sousa (18Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that postulated T7 lysozyme inhibition because of an increase in nucleotide Km values. According to this model, a high concentration of GTP should be able to restore the rate of RNA synthesis to uninhibited levels even in the presence of T7 lysozyme (18Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the pre-steady state rate of RNA synthesis does not increase at high GTP with T7 lysozyme. The observed recovery of steady state synthesis observed by Villemain and Sousa (18Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with increasing nucleotide may have been due to the increased rate of dissociation of small RNA products occurring during multiple turnovers, which is facilitated in the presence of T7 lysozyme (18Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because a defect in initiating nucleotide binding was not the sole cause for inhibition, we next examined whether T7 lysozyme inhibited the inherent ability of T7 RNAP to carry out RNA synthesis. When T7 RNAP was supplied with an already melted or an easily melted promoter (bulge-6 or bulge-1), then T7 lysozyme was unable to slow the rate of initial RNA synthesis. The lack of inhibition on the open promoter is not the result of T7 lysozyme being unable to form a tertiary complex. Complex formation is evident from the greater production of abortive products in the presence of T7 lysozyme. The result that T7 lysozyme does not hinder the ability of T7 RNAP to carry out RNA synthesis but causes additional accumulation of short RNA products is consistent with the idea that T7 lysozyme inhibits a step associated with stable open complex maintenance. The nature or the amount of the open complex formed by T7 RNAP-DNA or T7 RNAP-T7 lysozyme-DNA complexes was investigated by comparing the 2-AP fluorescence of dsDNA and p-dsDNA in complex with T7 RNAP or T7 RNAP-T7 lysozyme complex. The fluorescence of 2-AP in DNA is sensitive mainly to base-stacking interactions (26Rachofsky E.L. Osman R. Ross J.B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar); hence, the measurement of the fluorescence of 2-AP provides information about the degree of t(-4) unstacking. The fluorescence of E·dsDNA is 30% of E·p-dsDNA, and we have shown that the lower fluorescence of dsDNA is due to the unfavorable equilibrium constant for the formation of the preinitiation open complex (19Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The same ratio was observed in the presence of T7 lysozyme, indicating that preinitiation open complex formation is not affected by T7 lysozyme. In the presence of the +2 NTP, the fluorescence of E·dsDNA increases to nearly the level of E·p-dsDNA (23Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the presence of T7 lysozyme, the +2 NTP was unable to increase the fluorescence of 2-AP to the level of the p-dsDNA. This was not due to the fact that +2 NTP was not bound to the RNAP as the +2 NTP Kd is only 1.5-fold higher in the presence of T7 lysozyme. The fact that even saturating concentrations of the initiating nucleotide was unable to drive open complex formation indicates that T7 lysozyme affects the structure of the open DNA in the initiation complex rather than the equilibrium constant for open complex formation. T7 lysozyme interacts with parts of the palm, finger, and the N-terminal domain of T7 RNAP, and this mode of binding can lock the protein or affect protein flexibility to prevent a conformational change that is required to form a fully open initiation complex. There are numerous protein-DNA interactions that are required to maintain the transcription bubble and because T7 lysozyme binds at a site remote from these interactions, the action of T7 lysozyme is allosteric. The allosteric effect of T7 lysozyme results in the destabilization of the transcription bubble, which may happen because of long range perturbation of T7 lysozyme binding on the interactions of T7 RNAP with the nontemplate or the template strand. This hypothesis is consistent with the finding that the G235D and R231H mutations in the intercalating β hairpin, which is involved in maintaining the open bubble (27Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3882-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Stano N.M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1009-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have been identified as T7 lysozyme sensitive mutants (28Zhang X. T7 RNA Polymerase and T7 Lysozyme: Genetic, Biochemical, and Structural Analysis of Their Interaction and Multiple Roles in T7 Infection. 1995; (Ph.D. thesis, State University of New York at Stony Brook)Google Scholar). Similarly, the higher sensitivity of the class II ϕ3.8 promoter to T7 lysozyme (18Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (data not shown) is consistent with the fact that the ϕ3.8 promoter is less efficiently opened by T7 RNAP than a consensus promoter (22Bandwar R.P. Jia Y. Stano N.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The greater production of abortive products in the presence of T7 lysozyme indicates that the RNA dissociates more frequently when T7 lysozyme is complexed to T7 RNAP. This may be because the RNA is bound less stably at the active site either because of the frequent collapse of the initiation bubble back to the duplex form or because of the disruption in the interactions of the T7 RNAP with the RNA at the active site. Nonetheless, because of the increased abortive synthesis, the RNAP spends more time in the recycling mode, which causes a delay in the transition from initiation to elongation. The fact that abortive products from 2- to 5-mer increases with T7 lysozyme also indicates that the delay in the transition from the initiation to the elongation phase could be caused by the inhibition of some or all the conformational changes of the N-terminal domain (29Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) that are necessary to make RNA products longer than 3-mer. T7 lysozyme can therefore allosterically inhibit the rotation of the N-terminal core domain or the refolding of the N-terminal domains delaying promoter clearance.

Previous studies investigating the anti-viral mechanisms of several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors showed that the homeoproteins, pre B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) and PBX-regulating protein-1 (PREP1), function as transcriptional activators of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Here, we examined the involvement of cellular homeoproteins in regulating the activity of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV IE) promoter. We identified a 45-bp element located at position -593 to -549 upstream of the transcription start site of the CMV IE gene, which contains multiple putative homeoprotein binding motifs. Gel shift assays demonstrated the physical association between a homeodomain protein, pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX1) and the 45-bp cytomegalovirus (CMV) region. We further determined that PDX1 represses the CMV IE promoter activity in 293 cells. Overexpression of PDX1 resulted in a decrease in transcription of the CMV IE gene. Conversely, blocking PDX1 protein synthesis and mutating the PDX1 binding sites enhanced CMV IE-dependent transcription. Collectively, our results represent the first work demonstrating that a cellular homeoprotein, PDX1, may be a repressor involved in regulation of human CMV gene expression.

Two CDK inhibitors (CDKIs), flavopiridol and UCN-1, are currently in clinical trials as potential anti-cancer therapeutics (1Sausville E.A. Johnson J. Alley M. Zaharevitz D. Senderowicz A.M. Ann. N.

It has been hypothesized that the CDKIs block viral replication by inhibiting the transcription of specific cellular genes that are required for viral infection. Our previous work tested this hypothesis using microarray technology and identified a cellular homeoprotein, pre B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1), as a target of the CDKIs and a required cellular co-factor for Moloney MLV replication (3Chao S.H. Walker J.R. Chanda S.K. Gray N.S. Caldwell J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PBX1 was shown to form a heterodimer with another homeodomain protein, PBX-regulating protein-1 (PREP1), and function as a transcriptional activator of Moloney MLV (3Chao S.H. Walker J.R. Chanda S.K. Gray N.S. Caldwell J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The PBX1-PREP1 DNA binding motif, TGATTGAC, was further shown to be conserved in the long terminal repeats of 14 other murine retroviruses (3Chao S.H. Walker J.R. Chanda S.K. Gray N.S. Caldwell J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of homeoproteins in regulating retroviral transcription. A number of cellular homeoproteins, including OCT-1, Brn-3a, and Brn-3b, as well as CCAAT displacement protein (CDP), have previously been shown to play a role in viral transcription ranging across several virus families. The HSV transcriptional activator VP16, for example, directs the formation of a multiprotein-DNA complex on a specific element found in the promoters of HSV immediate-early genes (10Preston C.M. Frame M.C. Campbell M.E. Cell. 1988; 52: 425-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This VP16-induced complex is composed of two cellular proteins, HCF-1 and a homeoprotein OCT-1 (11Herr W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). OCT-1 contains a POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) DNA-binding domain, which is composed of an amino-terminal POU-specific domain and a carboxyl-terminal POU homeodomain (12Sturm R.A. Herr W.

Cell. 1994; 77: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The OCT-1 POU homeodomain plays an important role in directing the binding and formation of VP16-induced complexes (14Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W.

Both factors were shown to directly bind to the upstream regulatory region of the virus genome, however the two factors exert opposing effects, with Brn-3a activating transcription directed by the HPV upstream regulatory region, and Brn-3b repressing E6 and E7 expression (20Morris P.J.

The silencer CDP, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila CUT protein and a homeoprotein, negatively regulates HPV-dependent transcription by binding to specific DNA elements located in the viral promoters and long control regions, thus repressing HPV replication (22Ai W.

In addition, CDP has been shown to block the transcription of mouse mammary tumor viruses through binding to the negative regulatory regions located in the long terminal repeats of mouse mammary tumor virus (25Liu J.

Due to the emergence of a role for homeodomain proteins in regulation of viral transcriptional processes, we explored the possible involvement of these factors in regulating transcription of the β-herpes virus group member, human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Expression of the human CMV immediate early (IE) gene is critical for productive viral replication (28Mocarski E.S. Kemble G.W. Lyle J.M. Greaves R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 29Iskenderian A.C. Huang L. Reilly A. Stenberg R.M. Anders D.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 383-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the replication and transcription of human CMV depends on the cellular differentiation status of the host cell. For example, in undifferentiated monocytes, little or no human CMV IE gene products are expressed, and CMV remains latent. Abundant IE gene products are produced and infectious CMV is generated when the monocytes differentiate to macrophages (30Meier J.L. Stinski M.F. Intervirology. 1996; 39: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the repression of CMV IE gene remains largely unknown. In this report, we test a panel of homeoproteins, including HOXA9, PBX1, PREP1, MEIS1, and pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX1), a protein previously shown to complex with PBX1 in the regulation of elastase and somatostatin gene expression (31Goudet G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17985-17993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), for their ability to modulate the activity of human CMV IE promoter. We identified a 45-bp element located within the promoter of the CMV IE gene, which contains 12 putative binding sites for these homeoproteins. Our results indicate that multiple cellular proteins bind to the 45-bp CMV element and that PDX1 is present in this specific protein-DNA complex. We further demonstrate the functional significance of this interaction in cell-based assays that measure CMV IE-dependent transcription. PDX1 was found to negatively regulate the activity of the CMV IE promoter in 293 cells, and mutations in the PDX1 binding motifs alleviated these repressive effects. From these experiments we conclude that PDX1 binds to a specific region of the human CMV IE promoter and represses the promoter activity. Cells and Reagents-293, 293T, HeLa, PANC-1, and THP-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Differentiation of THP-1 cells was achieved with supplementation of growth media with 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) for 2 days. 293 cells were transfected with a CMV-firefly luciferase plasmid, and stable integrants were selected using 5 mg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) to generate the CMV-Luc stable cell line, 293-CMV-Luc. Plasmids and Plasmid Construction-The Pdx1 (accession number: X99894) complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed with gene-specific primers using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) kit as prescribed by the manufacturer. In brief, the cDNA product was synthesized and amplified from 1 μg of purified human pancreatic poly(A) mRNA (Clontech) using two primers (5′-AATAGGATCCGCCGCAGCCATGAACGGCGA and 5′-CTCCTCTAGACTCTCATCGTGGTTCCTGCG). The resultant product was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pUB6/V5-His B (Invitrogen) using the appended BamHI and XbaI (underlined) restriction sites to generate pUB-PDX1, in which the expression of Pdx1 was driven by the human ubiquitin C promoter. Two PDX1 mutants, pUB-PDX1H189F and pUB-PDX1I192Q, were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (34Lu M. Miller C. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2959-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A pUB-PREP1 plasmid was generated by cloning the coding sequences of Prep1 into the pUB6 vector using CMV-PREP1 as the DNA template (3Chao S.H. Walker J.R. Chanda S.K. Gray N.S. Caldwell J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The pCITE-PBX1a, pCITE-MEIS1, and pCITE-PREP1 plasmids were constructed as described previously (3Chao S.H. Walker J.R. Chanda S.K. Gray N.S. Caldwell J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The pCITE-PBX1b and pCITE-PDX1 plasmids (including wild-type and mutant Pdx1) were created by cloning the coding regions of Pbx1b and Pdx1 into pCITE vectors using CMV-PBX1b and pUB-PDX1 (wild-type or mutant Pdx1) as templates (3Chao S.H. Walker J.R. Chanda S.K. Gray N.S. Caldwell J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The pCITE constructs were used to synthesize translated proteins in vitro using TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega). Three luciferase plasmids were used in this study: ubiquitin-firefly luciferase (pUB-F-Luc), CMV-firefly luciferase (CMV-F-Luc; containing the human CMV IE promoter-enhancer), and CMV-Renilla luciferase (CMV-R-Luc; containing the human CMV IE promoter-enhancer). The firefly luciferase sequences of pGL2 control (Promega) were subcloned into pUB6 or pcDNA6 (Invitrogen) to generate pUB-F-Luc or CMV-F-Luc. CMV-R-Luc was purchased from Promega (i.e. pRL-CMV). Mutations and deletions of the human CMV IE promoter were constructed using the QuikChange site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All CMV-Luc mutants were generated using CMV-R-Luc as template. To mutate the potential homeoprotein binding tetramers, the middle two nucleotides were changed to two cytosines (for example, TAAT to TCCT). EMSAs-Three different DNA fragments of the 45-nucleotide CMV sequences were used as the DNA probes for EMSAs: CMV1 (5′-GGCATTGATTATTGACTAGTTATTAATAGTAA), CMV2 (5′-AATAGTAATCAATTACGGGGTCATTAGTTCA), and CMV12 (5′-GGCATTGATTATTGACTAGTTATTAATAGTAATCAATTACGGGGTCATTAGTTCA), which contain the first half, second half, and entire regions of the 45-bp region, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (3Chao S.H. Walker J.R. Chanda S.K. Gray N.S. Caldwell J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using CMV1, CMV2, or CMV12 as the DNA probes. Briefly, anti-PBX1, anti-MEIS1, anti-PREP1, anti-PDX1, anti-HOXA9, or anti-SP1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from 293 or HeLa cells for 10 min at room temperature before the 32P-labeled probe was included. When in vitro translated proteins were used in EMSAs, DNA binding reactions were performed at 4 °C for 30 min. DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels at room temperature in 0.3× TBE (27 mm Tris-borate, pH 8.3, 0.6 mm EDTA). Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Transfection and Luciferase Assays-293 or 293T cells were grown to 50-80% confluence in 96-well plates. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturers' manuals. For the overexpression assays, 293 or 293T cells were co-transfected with CMV-R-Luc, the indicated expression vectors (i.e. pUB-PDX1, -PDX1H189F, -PDX1I192Q, or -PREP1) and a pUB-F-Luc internal control plasmid for 48 h. In the CMV mutant assays, 293 and 293T cells were co-transfected with pUB-F-Luc (as internal control) and a wild-type or mutant CMV-R-Luc. Firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured using the Dual-Glo assay system (Promega), and the activities were determined using an Acquest multimode reader (LJL Biosystems, Inc.). Short interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting positions 29-47 (Pdx1-1 siRNA) or 554-572 (Pdx1-2 siRNA) of the Pdx1 open reading frame and positions 20-38 of the Prep1 open reading frame (accession number: XM_033008) were purchased from Qiagen. A fluorescein-labeled luciferase GL2 duplex was obtained from Dharmacon and used to determine transfection efficiency. An siRNA targeting Renilla luciferase was used as a control (35Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8162) Google Scholar). 293 and 293T cells were co-transfected with CMV-F-Luc and the appropriate siRNA (i.e. Pdx1, Prep1, or R-Luc siRNAs). The effects of the siRNAs on firefly luciferase expression and activity were measured using the Bright-Glo assay system (Promega) 48 h after transfection. The inhibitory effects of the Pdx1 and Prep1 siRNAs on cellular PDX1 and PREP1 protein synthesis were further examined by Western blot analysis using anti-PDX1 and anti-PREP1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). PDX1 Associates with a Specific Region of the Human CMV IE Promoter-Our previous work identified two cellular homeodomain proteins, PBX1 and PREP1, as transcriptional activators of Moloney MLV (3Chao S.H. Walker J.R. Chanda S.K. Gray N.S. Caldwell J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To further investigate a possible role for homeoproteins in the transcriptional regulation of other virus families, we examined the promoter-enhancer regions of the human CMV IE gene for consensus homeoprotein binding elements. A 45-nucleotide fragment located at position -593 to -549 upstream of the transcription start site of the CMV IE gene was found to contain numerous putative homeoprotein binding sites (Fig. 1). Including the reverse complementary sequences, 12 potential tetramer binding sites for homeoproteins were identified, including two PBX1 (i.e. TGAT) (36Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C.

It has been shown that PDX1 associates with the B element of the transcriptional enhancer of the pancreatic elastase I gene by forming a trimeric complex with PBX1b and MEIS2 in pancreatic acinar cell lines, whereas PDX1 binds to the B element alone in β-cell lines (32Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L.J. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It has additionally been observed that cooperative interactions occur between PBX1, PREP1, and PDX1 on the somatostatin mini-enhancer (31Goudet G. Delhalle S. Biemar F. Martial J.A. Peers B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4067-4073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we performed EMSAs to examine the possible association between the 45-bp CMV element and homeodomain proteins, including PBX1, MEIS1, PREP1, and PDX1. The 45-bp region of interest was divided into two segments extending from position -593 to -571 (CMV1) and from position -570 to -549 (CMV2). Incubation of 32P-labeled CMV1 DNA with nuclear extracts prepared from 293 cells resulted in the formation of a major DNA-protein complex, complex C (Fig. 2A; indicated as “C”). The specificity of the complex for CMV1 binding was confirmed using unlabeled specific competitor oligonucleotides (i.e. unlabeled CMV1; Fig. 2A, lane 3). No effects on the complex were observed in the presence of an unlabeled nonspecific competitor (i.e. SP1 consensus oligonucleotide; Fig. 2A, lane 4). The interaction between the CMV1-region and the associated protein complex was then examined using antibodies specific to the individual homeoproteins. Incubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies raised against PDX1 proteins resulted in the appearance of a supershifted complex (Fig. 2A, arrow). However, the incubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies against PBX1, MEIS1, or PREP1 proteins did not produce any significant new species (Fig. 2A). A parallel set of EMSAs performed using CMV2 as the DNA probe yielded the same complex C as indicated in Fig. 2A. The further addition of anti-PDX1 antibodies to the reaction mixture resulted in a supershift of complex C (Fig. 2B, arrow). No effects on the DNA-protein complex were seen using anti-PBX1, -MEIS1, or -PREP1 antibodies (data not shown). When the same EMSAs (CMV1 and CMV2 as DNA probes) were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells, instead of 293 cells, identical results were obtained. In agreement with our findings using 293 nuclear extracts, the supershifted C complex was observed only when anti-PDX1 antibodies were included in the reaction (data not shown). It has been shown that HOXA9 can form a trimeric protein complex with PBX1-MEIS1 or PBX1-PREP1 (43Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Kwong A. Kom ves L.G. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 3051-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 44Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Because there are eight potential HOX binding sites present in the 45-bp CMV region, we investigated the possible association between HOXA9 proteins and the CMV DNA element. EMSAs were thus performed, incubating anti-HOXA9 antibodies with nuclear extracts. The presence of HOXA9 antibodies did not, however, affect the formation of the CMV DNA-protein complex (data not shown). To further validate the EMSA data using nuclear extracts and antibodies, we also performed EMSAs using in vitro translated PBX1a, PBX1b, MEIS1, PREP1, HOXA9, and PDX1 proteins. The results showed that only the PDX1 protein was able to bind to the CMV1 DNA probe (Fig. 2C). PDX1 further did not appear to cooperate with the other homeodomain proteins in associating with CMV1 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the complex of CMV1-PDX1 (Fig. 2C) was much smaller than that observed in the EMSAs using nuclear extracts (Fig. 2A), suggesting that other cellular proteins are also present in the CMV1-protein complexes. An identical set of results was obtained when CMV2 was used as the DNA probe (data not shown). Lastly, the in vitro synthesized HOXA9 protein did not appear to interact with the CMV DNA either as a monomer, or in combination with the other homeoproteins as a dimer (i.e. PBX1-HOXA9, MEIS1-HOXA9, or PREP1-HOXA9), or trimer (i.e. PBX1-MEIS1-HOXA9 or PBX1-PREP1-HOXA9) (data not shown). Collectively, these gel shift experiments indicate that PDX1 protein is a component of a multiprotein complex that binds a region of the CMV IE promoter. The expression of Pdx1 was initially described to be restricted to the pancreas and duodenum (45Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 46Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L. Wright C.V. Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was later reported that Pdx1 is also expressed in the developing brain (47Perez-Villamil B. Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3857-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the expression of PDX1 in 293 and HeLa cells is unknown. Western blot analysis was thus performed using nuclear extracts prepared from 293 and HeLa cells (Fig. 3). In vitro synthesized recombinant PDX1 protein, which contains additional amino acids at the N terminus of PDX1, was used as a positive control (Fig. 3). Nuclear extracts of the pancreatic cell line PANC-1 were also analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of PDX1 in 293 and HeLa cells was confirmed. We next wished to examine the expression of PDX1 in the CMV host cells. It has been shown that the expression of human CMV IE gene does not occur in monocytes but is expressed in terminally differentiated macrophages (30Meier J.L. Stinski M.F. Intervirology. 1996; 39: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). THP-1, a human monocytic cell line, can be induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells through treatment with PMA (48Schwende H. Fitzke E. Ambs P. Dieter P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of untreated and PMA-treated THP-1 cells were analyzed by Western blot using anti-PDX1 antibodies. The results indicate that PDX1 is expressed in both undifferentiated and differentiated THP-1 cells (Fig. 3). PDX1 Binds to Multiple Sites within the Human CMV IE Promoter-We next wished to determine the exact PDX1 binding site(s) within the 45-bp CMV region. There are six putative PDX1 binding tetramers, TAAT, present in this region (Fig. 1). Of note, there are also two TTAT and two TGAT tetramers that contain one mismatch at a single position and could therefore comprise PDX1 binding sites. To determine which tetramer conferred association with PDX1, point mutations at each of the ten potential PDX1 binding sites (i.e. TAAT, TTAT, and TGAT) were generated, by changing the central two nucleotides to two cytosines. Six possible PDX1 sites are present within CMV1 (tetramer 1-6; Fig. 4A) and four in CMV2 (tetramer 7-10; Fig. 4C). EMSAs were thus performed using in vitro synthesized PDX1 protein and a wild-type or site-mutated CMV1 DNA probe. As shown in Fig. 4B, although mild loss of binding effects were obs"
https://openalex.org/W2107607409,"The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a multifunctional, GPI-linked receptor that modulates cell adhesion/migration and fibrinolysis. We mapped the interaction sites between soluble uPAR (suPAR) and high molecular mass kininogen (HK). Binding of biotin-HK to suPAR was inhibited by HK, 56HKa, and 46HKa with an IC50 of 60, 110, and 8 nm, respectively. We identified two suPAR-binding sites, a higher affinity site in the light chain of HK and 46HKa (His477-Gly496) and a lower affinity site within the heavy chain (Cys333-Lys345). HK predominantly bound to suPAR fragments containing domains 2 and 3 (S-D2D3). Binding of HK to domain 1 (S-D1) was also detected, and the addition of S-D1 to S-D2D3 completely inhibited biotin-HK or -46HKa binding to suPAR. Using sequential and overlapping 20-amino acid peptides prepared from suPAR, two regions for HK binding were identified. One on the carboxyl-terminal end of D2 (Leu166-Thr195) blocked HK binding to suPAR and to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). This site overlapped with the urokinase-binding region, and urokinase inhibited the binding of HK to suPAR. A second region on the amino-terminal portion of D3 (Gln215-Asn255) also blocked HK binding to HUVEC. Peptides that blocked HK binding to uPAR also inhibited prekallikrein activation on HUVEC. Therefore, HK interacts with suPAR at several sites. HK binds to uPAR as part of its interaction with its multiprotein receptor complex on HUVEC, and the biological functions that depend upon this binding are modulated by urokinase.

Blood. 2002; 99: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but binding of factor XII in vivo is likely limited both by the low plasma concentration of free Zn2+, which is below the requirement for FXII binding and by the much higher plasma concentration of HK (7Mahdi F.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This multiprotein receptor complex thereby regulates the assembly and activation of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system. The requirements for HK binding to each component of this receptor complex and the effects of other biologically relevant ligands, e.g. urokinase, on this binding have not been well delineated. It is known that both the heavy and light chains of HK interact with a region of cytokeratin 1 coded by exon 1 (2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7137-7145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Antibody to this region completely inhibits HK binding to cytokeratin 1 as well as to the receptor complex (6Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2342-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Likewise, some antibodies to gC1qR and uPAR completely block HK binding to the proteins individually as well as when they are part of the complex expressed on endothelial cells (6Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2342-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43983-43990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether each component of the cellular complex recognizes discrete or overlapping portions of HK and whether each molecule of HK binds to more than one component of the complex at the same time. To begin to address these issues, we sought to identify the regions in HK and uPAR required for binding. The results indicate the existence of multiple potential sites of interaction between this ligand and receptor and provide insight into the assembly of HK on its multireceptor complex and the influence of urokinase on this interaction. Proteins and Materials—Single-chain and two-chain HK (specific activity of 13-17 units/mg and 17 units/ml, respectively) in 4 mm sodium acetate-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 5.3, plasma kallikrein, and PK (specific activity of 22-27 units/mg) in 4 mm sodium acetate-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 5.3, were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN). Carboxymethylated papain was prepared as previously reported (11Meloni F.J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6786-6794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 56-kDa (56HKa) and 46-kDa (46HKa) kallikrein-cleaved HK was prepared by dialyzing 1 mg of single-chain HK into HEPES carbonate buffer (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 14.7 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm dextrose containing 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) pH 7.4. After dialysis, plasma kallikrein in a molar ratio of 1:200 to HK was added (12Meloni F.J. Gustafson E.J. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for various amounts of time, and the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Aliquots from each time point were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Once the optimal time of incubation to generate 56- and 46-kDa HK was determined, larger amounts were incubated at the appropriate molar ratios, and the reactions were stopped by adding 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The cleaved HK then was dialyzed against HEPES carbonate buffer, pH 7.4, to remove the diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The integrity of the cleaved HK was analyzed on a 8% SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay. A biotinylation kit and ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase dihydrochloride (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride) were supplied by Pierce. Prestained low molecular mass standard, nitrocellulose, and polyacrylamide were purchased from Bio-Rad. SDS gel electrophoresis samples were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). cDNA encoding full-length uPAR was generously provided by Dr. F. Blasi (Copenhagen, Denmark). Peptides and Antibodies—The peptides corresponding to domains 3-5 of HK (see Table I) were synthesized at the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility of the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI) as previously reported (13Herwald H.

Open table in a new tab Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analysis—The proteins were separated using 8-15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 volts for 1 h. The electroblots then were incubated in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h (20Schmaier A.H. Farber A. Schein R. Sprung C. J. Lab.

The membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (1:2000) for 1 h, and antibody binding was detected with an ECL system from Amersham Biosciences. All of the steps were carried out at room temperature. Endothelial Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), endothelial cell growth medium, trypsin-EDTA, and trypsin neutralizing solutions were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). The cells were cultured according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells between the first and fifth passages were subcultured onto fibronectin-coated, 96-well plates 24 h prior to the start of the experiment (14Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31822-31830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion. The cell numbers were determined by direct counting on a hemocytometer. Biotinylation and Iodination—Five mg of HK in 200 μl was dialyzed against 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (14Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31822-31830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 5-fold molar excess of sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin was added. After incubation for 2 h on ice, the sample was loaded onto 10-ml Econo-Pac 10 DG column (Bio-Rad). Biotinylated HK (biotin-HK) was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 7.0 for HK and a protein assay (Bio-Rad). Biotin-HK had a specific activity of 13 units/mg. 46HKa was biotinylated in the same way. Peptides PGS20, HKH20, CNA13, QCY21, and DCR20 were synthesized with biotinylated labels at Multiple Peptide Systems. suPAR and HK were radiolabeled with Na125I using Iodogen precoated tubes (Pierce) at a ratio of 100 μCi of 125I/100 μg of protein to avoid oxidative injury (17Bdeir K. Kuo A. Mazar A. Sachais B.S. Xiao W. Gawlak S. Harris S. Higazi A.A. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28532-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Free 125I was removed by gel filtration using Sephadex G25 (PD-10; Amersham Biosciences). Biotin-Protein or -Peptide Binding Studies—Biotinylated proteins or peptides in the absence or presence of competing proteins or peptides in HEPES carbonate buffer, pH 7.4 (8Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z.

After blocking the wells with 1% gelatin, the cuvettes were incubated with biotinylated HK, 46HKa, or peptides for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed three times with HEPES carbonate buffer, pH 7.4. The bound biotinylated proteins or peptides were measured using ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) and peroxidase-specific fast reacting substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (Pierce) by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 450 nm using a microplate autoreader EL 311 (Bio-Tek Instrument, Winooski, VT), as previously described (14Hasan A.A.K.

Binding of Iodinated HK to suPAR—suPAR was immobilized onto Immulon 4HB plates (Thermo Labs Systems, Franklin, MA) in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 overnight at 4 °C at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Binding of 125I-HK to suPAR was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled HK in HEPES carbonate buffer. 125I-suPAR binding to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing scuPA was performed as previously reported (17Bdeir K. Kuo A. Mazar A. Sachais B.S. Xiao W. Gawlak S. Harris S. Higazi A.A. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28532-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Prekallikrein Activation on Endothelial Cells—The ability of peptides from suPAR to block PK activation on endothelial cells was determined. HUVEC were grown as monolayers in microtiter plate wells. HK and PK (20 nm each) were then added to the wells in the absence or presence of 100 μm peptide DLC20, LRG20, YLP20, PGS20, FHN20, TKC19, QCY21, or DCR20 from domains 1-3 of suPAR (see Table II) in HEPES carbonate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with HEPES carbonate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.4 mm H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA was added, and hydrolysis of the substrate was measured over the next 1 h at 405 nm (22Motta G. Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1988; 91: 516-528Crossref Google Scholar). Characterization of HK Species—One μg of HK, 46HKa, and 56HKa was analyzed using 8% SDS-PAGE under reduced and nonreduced conditions. Under reduced conditions, HK, 56HKa, and 46HKa migrated predominantly at 120 kDa, at 64 and 56 kDa, and at 64 and 46 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that 56HKa and 46HKa retained their heavy chains and their respective light chains. Under nonreduced conditions, HK, 56HKa and 46HKa migrated as single bands at 120, 110, and 108 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous reports of a change in the molecular mass of plasma HK when it is activated by plasma kallikrein (20Schmaier A.H. Farber A. Schein R. Sprung C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 112: 182-192PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Biotin-HK to HUVEC and suPAR—We then determined whether these forms of HK differed in their affinity for HUVEC or for suPAR. Initial investigations were with HUVEC. Native HK, 56HKa, and 46HKa blocked the binding of biotinylated HK to HUVEC with IC50 values of 115, 115, and 50 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A). Native HK, 56HKa, and 46HKa blocked biotin-HK binding to suPAR with IC50 values of 60, 110, and 8 nm, respectively (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that 46HKa is a more potent inhibitor of the binding of native HK to HUVEC and suPAR than are the less activated forms of HK. This outcome was consistent with previously reported information that kallikrein-cleaved HK bound more avidly to uPAR than did intact HK (5Colman R.W. Pixley R.A. Najamunnisa S. Yan W. Wang J. Mazar A. McCrae K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1481-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The data also demonstrated that native HK also bound to suPAR, albeit with lower affinity than its cleaved counterparts. This information suggested that cleavage of HK enhanced its binding to suPAR. This increase in the affinity of binding for 46HKa was less pronounced on HUVEC, which express additional binding sites for the kininogens. Binding Sites for suPAR within Domain 5 of HK—It has been shown in previous studies that HK bound to cells through determinants within both its light and heavy chains (13Herwald H. Hasan A.A.K.

Therefore, we next sought to identify the region(s) in domain 5 of HK that bound to suPAR and inhibited the binding of native HK and 46HKa (13Herwald H. Hasan A.A.K. Godovac-Zimmermann J.

Binding of biotin-HK to suPAR was blocked by peptides GKE19, HNL21, GHG19, HKH20, and HVL24 with IC50 values of 300, 20, 30, 2, and 0.7 μm, respectively (Table I). HKH20 was a weaker inhibitor of biotin-46HKa binding (Table I). Peptides HKH20, HNL21, and HVL24 inhibited biotin-46HKa binding to suPAR with IC50 values of 20, 10, and 0.5 μm, respectively (Table I). These data indicate that the HVL24 region corresponding to amino acids 471-494 of domain 5 of HK has the highest affinity for suPAR, although other portions of domain 5 also had the capacity to bind. Binding Sites for suPAR within Domain 3 of HK—A similar investigation was performed with peptides within the cell-binding region in domain 3 of HK (13Herwald H. Hasan A.A.K. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14634-14642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Peptides NAT26, LDC27, and CNA13 inhibited biotin-HK binding to suPAR with IC50 values of 20, 20, and 15 μm, respectively (Table I), whereas peptide KIC11 from the amino-terminal end of this domain was inactive (Table I). The protein CM-papain, a domain 3-binding protein, inhibited the binding of biotin-HK to suPAR with an IC50 values of 1.5 μm (data not shown). NAT12, LDC27, and CNA13 inhibited biotin-46HKa binding to suPAR with IC50 values of 20, 30, and 10 μm, respectively (Table I). CM-papain was an equipotent inhibitor of biotin-46HKa and biotin-HK binding (IC50 = 1.5 μm) (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggested that HK bound to suPAR through regions found on both its heavy and light chains, although the binding of suPAR to domain 5 peptides was at least 10-fold more avid (compare the IC50 value of HVL24 with CNA13). This conclusion was supported by the finding that biotin-HKH20 and biotin-CNA13 bound specifically to suPAR (Fig. 3). Binding Sites for HK in suPAR—We next investigated the binding sites in suPAR for HK. As a first step, the epitope recognized by a monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody (3B10FC) that blocked HK binding to cultured endothelial cells (6Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H.

On immunoblot, 3B10FC bound to suPAR domain 2 and to fragments containing domains 2 + 3 (D2D3 and S-D2D3); 3B10FC bound weakly to D3, but not to D1, under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 4).

Here we have addressed the mechanism by which oligomerization facilitates G protein signaling by examining the ability of ligand binding- and G protein coupling-defective α-factor receptors to form complexes in vivo and to correct their signaling defects when co-expressed (trans complementation). Newly and previously identified receptor mutants indicated that ligand binding involves the exofacial end of transmembrane domain (TM) 4, whereas G protein coupling involves ic1, ic3, the C-terminal tail, and the intracellular ends of TM2 and TM3. Mutant receptors bearing substitutions in these domains formed homo-oligomeric or hetero-oligomeric complexes in vivo, as indicated by results of fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. Co-expression of ligand binding- and G protein coupling-defective mutant receptors did not significantly improve signaling. In contrast, co-expression of ic1 and ic3 mutations in trans but not in cis significantly increased signaling efficiency. Therefore, we suggest that subunits of the α-factor receptor: 1) are activated independently rather than cooperatively by agonist, and 2) function in a concerted fashion to promote G protein activation, possibly by contacting different subunits or regions of the G protein heterotrimer.

For example, transmembrane domain peptides that inhibit oligomerization of β2-adrenergic receptors can attenuate signal transduction in vitro (10Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P.

Strikingly, heterodimerization between the R1 and R2 subunits of the GABA(B) receptor is essential for signal transduction because the R1 subunit can bind agonist but cannot activate G proteins, whereas the R2 subunit cannot bind agonist but can activate G proteins (5White J.H.

In one model, agonist binding to one receptor subunit induces a conformational change that is transmitted allosterically to another receptor subunit, which in turn undergoes a conformational change resulting in G protein activation. This mechanism has been suggested by studies of the GABA(B) receptor heterodimers (16Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B. Prezeau L. Pin J.P.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7352-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), agonist binding to the R1 subunit induces movement that relieves its inhibitory action on the R2 subunit, which is freed for G protein activation. In a third model, suggested by studies of leutinizing hormone receptors (28Osuga Y. Hayashi M. Kudo M. Conti M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25006-25012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Ji I. Lee C. Song Y. Conn P.M. Ji T.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), trans activation of one receptor by another can involve exchange of ligand-binding domains.In contrast, other lines of evidence suggest that subunits of GPCR oligomers may function independently in the process of G protein activation. For example, only one molecule of the photoreceptor rhodopsin, which forms arrays of homodimers in disk membranes (30Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K.

J. 1998; 75: 1836-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Likewise, agonist binding to many GPCRs is not cooperative. Furthermore, GPCRs defective in agonist binding or G protein coupling generally are not dominant negative; those that are dominant negative usually interfere with wild type receptor function by sequestering G proteins or retaining wild type receptors in nonproductive complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum (4Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 6Zhu X. Wess J.

A DRY motif mutant of the CCR2 receptor is dominant negative, apparently because it forms non-productive complexes with wild type receptors on the cell surface (34Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. de Ana A.M. Albar J.P. Martinez A.C. Mellado M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3628-3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).Because the functions of GPCR oligomerization in G protein activation remain unclear for most receptors, we have sought to provide new insight by analyzing the yeast α-factor receptor (STE2 gene product). This receptor forms constitutive (i.e. agonist-independent) oligomeric complexes in vivo, and oligomerization-defective mutants bind agonist normally but are signaling-defective (35Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 36Yesilaltay A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41463-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), suggesting that oligomerization promotes G protein activation. Furthermore, the α-factor receptor is a useful model because mechanisms of receptor-G protein signaling are conserved from yeast to humans (reviewed in Ref. 38Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Here we have identified new mutants defective in G protein coupling, and used them and previously described ligand-binding and G protein-coupling mutants to determine whether receptors with different classes of signaling defects self-associate or form hetero-oligomeric complexes with one another. We also used this collection of mutants to determine whether receptor function is reconstituted when different classes of mutant receptors are co-expressed, a process termed trans complementation. The results suggest that each α-factor receptor subunit is activated independently by agonist and that receptor subunits function in cooperation with one another to activate G protein heterotrimers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Plasmids—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in these studies were KBY58 (MATaleu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3-Δ1 trp1 ste2::leu2 sst1-Δ5) and JE114-8A (MATaleu2,3–112 ura3–52 his3Δ1 trp1 ste2::LEU2 sst2–1). Cells were grown in synthetic medium containing adenine and amino acid supplements, but lacking tryptophan, histidine, or uracil to maintain plasmids. All mutations were made in the single-copy plasmid pRS314Ste2–3myc (39Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which uses native STE2 promoter and terminator sequences to drive expression of full-length or C-terminally truncated (at codon 303) α-factor receptors tagged at their C termini with three copies of the c-Myc epitope.Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis—All mutations were introduced into pRS314Ste2–3myc using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). An HpaI-AatII fragment bearing a mutation of interest was used to replace the equivalent fragment of pRS314Ste2Δtail-3myc to obtain versions of the mutant receptors truncated at position 303. All mutations were subsequently subcloned into pRS313 or pRS426 as XhoI-SpeI fragments. To construct plasmids expressing tailless wild type or mutant receptors tagged with CFP or YFP, we either subcloned the HpaI-AatII fragment bearing a mutation of interest into pRS423Ste2Δtail-YFP and pRS424Ste2Δtail-CFP, or used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce desired mutations into pRS423Ste2Δtail-YFP and pRS424Ste2Δtail-CFP. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.Assays of Agonist Response—Assays of α-factor-induced growth arrest (halo assays) were used to assess the function of wild type or mutant receptors expressed at native levels from single-copy plasmids or overexpressed on high copy (2 μm) plasmids in cells bearing a deletion of the chromosomal gene encoding the α-factor receptor (STE2). Results of dose-response experiments were used to quantify the relative sensitivities of cells expressing mutant receptors to agonist stimulation. Shorter term assays (2 h) of agonist response (transcriptional induction of a FUS1-lacZ reporter in plasmid pSL307) were performed as described (40Sprague Jr., G.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism version 3.0a.Preparation of 35S-labeled α-Factor and Agonist-binding Assays— Methods used to purify 35S-labeled α-factor from metabolically labeled yeast cells and to perform ligand-binding assays with inviable, intact cells are identical to those described previously (39Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Blumer K.J. Reneke J.E. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10836-10842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist binding data were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard and fitted by nonlinear least-squares regression. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled α-factor.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—Scanning fluorometry of intact viable yeast cells co-expressing tailless forms of CFP- and YFP-tagged wild type or mutant α-factor receptors was used to detect FRET between oligomerized receptors in vivo, as previously described in detail (29Ji I. Lee C. Song Y. Conn P.M. Ji T.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Engel A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41463-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and irradiated in 3-ml glass cuvettes. Cells were irradiated at 425 nm to excite CFP and fluorescence emission was recorded from 450 to 610 nm, or cells were irradiated at 510 nm to excite YFP and fluorescence emission was recorded from 520 to 610 nm. The FRET component of the emission spectrum obtained from cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors was obtained by subtracting components resulting from CFP emission and YFP emission produced by direct excitation at 425 nm. The apparent efficiency of FRET was calculated by dividing the peak FRET value by the peak value obtained upon direct excitation of YFP (510 nm).Localization of GFP-tagged Receptors—Fluorescence images of cells expressing wild type and various receptor mutants tagged with GFP were captured by using a cooled CCD camera (DAGE, Inc.) mounted on an Olympus BH-2 or IX81 microscope equipped with a PlanApo100UV 100× objective, as described previously (38Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).RESULTSUse of trans Complementation to Assess Functional Interaction between Subunits of α-Factor Receptor Oligomers—Strong evidence indicating that signaling or functional coupling occurs between subunits of a GPCR complex has come from studies of GABA(B) receptor heterodimers. Whereas each subunit of this receptor has an intrinsic signaling defect (G protein coupling defect for the R1 subunit and an agonist binding defect for the R2 subunit), these signaling defects are complemented to produce a functional receptor when R1 and R2 are co-expressed in trans. We therefore chose to use an analogous approach to determine whether co-expression of different classes of mutant α-factor receptors could restore receptor function by interacting with one another (trans complementation). Accordingly, we needed a collection of mutant receptors defective in various aspects of receptor function. Because relatively few signaling-defective α-factor receptor mutants have been identified and characterized previously, we initially generated a collection of mutant α-factor receptors likely to be defective in G protein coupling. These mutants and previously described agonist-binding and G protein-coupling mutants could then be used to determine whether co-expressed mutant receptors could associate with one another in FRET experiments, and rescue receptor function by a trans complementation mechanism.Identification of New α-Factor Receptor Mutants Apparently Defective in G Protein Coupling—Because the third intracellular loop (ic3) of the α-factor receptor is known to promote G protein coupling (42Weiner J.L. Guttierez-Steil C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8070-8077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Stefan C.J. Blumer K.J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3004-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we sought to identify new G protein coupling mutants by investigating the first or second intracellular loops (ic1 or ic2) or adjacent portions of their appended transmembrane domains (Fig. 1B). Extensive mutagenesis of these domains in the context of full-length receptors failed to identify mutants with a significant signaling defect. For example, in three mutants we replaced triplets of amino acids with alanine residues in the cytoplasmic-proximal portions of TM2 (80-2A) or TM3 (151-3A and 153-5A), and in a fourth mutant (ic1A) we replaced most of ic1 (residues 72–78) with alanine residues (Fig. 1B). None of these substitutions had a significant effect (>2–3-fold; Fig. 2) on signaling efficiency, as indicated by formation of clear zones of growth inhibition of similar size to that obtained with wild type receptors when cells were challenged with the same dose of α-factor (15 nmol). Therefore, we hypothesized that these or other domains may normally function in cooperation with one another to promote G protein activation.Fig. 2Agonist response of cells expressing wild type and mutant receptors. The indicated receptors were expressed in cells that either expressed Sst2 (top panel) or lacked Sst2 (bottom panel). Growth arrest assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Response to a single dose of agonist (α-factor; 15 nmol) is shown. Results shown are representative of three to six experiments for each mutant. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test this hypothesis, we repeated the mutagenesis of ic1, ic2, and adjacent regions of their appended TM domains in the context of receptors lacking their cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (truncated at position 303 following TM7; Fig. 1B). This truncation mutant was used because the C-terminal domain promotes formation of preactivation complexes with G protein heterotrimers (45Dosil M. Schandel K.A. Gupta E. Jenness D.D. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5321-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), yet is dispensable for G protein activation and signaling (46Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Truncated receptors therefore form weakened but functional preactivation complexes, which may allow other receptor domains involved in G protein coupling and signaling to be identified by mutagenesis.Using this approach we identified four receptor mutants that potentially had G protein coupling defects (Figs. 1B and 2). In three mutants, triplets of amino acids were replaced with alanine residues in the cytoplasmic-proximal portions of TM2 (80-2A) or TM3 (151-3A and 153-5A). Whereas this region of TM2 had not been identified previously as being important for receptor signaling, the end of TM3 had been implicated in a recent study (47Parrish W. Eilers M. Ying W. Konopka J.B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 429-443PubMed Google Scholar). A fourth signaling-deficient mutant (ic1A) involved replacing most of ic1 (residues 72–78) with alanine residues, a domain that had not been implicated previously as being involved in α-factor receptor signaling.The phenotypes of cells expressing tailless forms of these mutant receptors from single-copy plasmids and their normal promoters were assessed initially by performing assays of agonist-induced growth arrest (Fig. 2). The results indicated that expression of tailless mutant receptors significantly impaired signaling, as indicated by the formation of turbid or smaller zones of growth inhibition in response to a fixed dose of agonist (15 nmol). In contrast, mutations affecting ic2 had no effect, including one in which all of ic2 was replaced by alanine residues (residues 157–162; data not shown).To further analyze the effects of these newly identified mutations on receptor function, we characterized them with respect to the magnitudes of their signaling defects, cell-surface expression, and agonist binding affinities. Signaling defects were assessed initially by performing experiments using agonist-induced growth arrest as an assay. These experiments used cells lacking the yeast RGS protein, Sst2, which promotes recovery from agonist-induced growth arrest by stimulating the ability of Gα subunits to hydrolyze GTP (48Apanovitch D.M. Slep K.C. Sigler P.B. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this genetic background, zones of agonist-induced growth inhibition would be clear because of impaired recovery caused by lack of Sst2 function. Indeed, expression of tailless forms of mutant receptors in the sst2 mutant background resulted in the appearance of smaller, clear zones of growth inhibition in response to a fixed dose of agonist (15 nmol; Fig. 2), indicating impaired cell responsiveness. By varying the dose of agonist, we generated dose-response curves for agonist-induced growth arrest of cells expressing tailless forms of wild type and mutant receptors (Fig. 3A). These curves were used to calculate the dose of agonist needed to produce a zone of growth inhibition 20 mm in diameter. These values were normalized to that calculated for cells expressing wild type tailless receptors, yielding values of relative sensitivity. This analysis indicated that cells expressing tailless forms of mutant receptors were less sensitive to agonist, as follows: ic1A, 0.05-fold; 80-2A, 0.11-fold; 151-3A, 0.13-fold; 153-5A, 0.06-fold.Fig. 3Quantification of agonist responsiveness of cells expressing wild type and mutant α-factor receptors.A, dose-response relationships indicated by assays of agonist-induced growth arrest. Cells (sst2 mutant bearing a chromosomal deletion of the receptor gene; JE114-8A) expressing tailless forms of wild type (closed circles), ic1A (open circles), 80-2A (closed squares), 151-3A (open squares), and 153-5A (closed triangles) receptors from single-copy plasmids and their normal promoter were assayed. Results shown for each mutant are the average of five independent experiments. B, dose-response relationships indicated by assays of agonist-induced expression of a FUS1-lacZ reporter. Tailless wild type and mutant receptors were expressed from a single-copy plasmid and their normal promoter in cells (KBY58) bearing a chromosomal deletion of the receptor gene and a FUS1-lacZ plasmid (pSL307). Cells expressing wild type (closed circles), ic1A (open circles), 80-2A (closed squares), 151-3A (open squares), and 153-5A (triangles) were assayed. Results for each mutant were averages of three to four independent experiments; S.E. was <10% of the indicated values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because assays of agonist-induced growth arrest are long term (2 days) indicators of signaling function, we also performed dose-response experiments using an agonist-inducible reporter gene (FUS1-lacZ) as a shorter term (2 h) read-out of signaling activity (Fig. 3B). The results indicated that the apparent EC50 values for cells expressing tailless forms of wild type or mutant receptors were: wild type = 3 nm; ic1A = 18 nm; 80-2A = 12 nm; 151-3A = 17 nm; 153-5A = 41 nm. Therefore, cells expressing mutant receptors were 0.25–0.07-fold as sensitive to agonist stimulation as cells expressing wild type tailless receptors, similar to the results of growth arrest assays.To determine whether mutant receptors had defects in agonist-binding aff"
https://openalex.org/W2040089859,"We recently demonstrated that the residues 337–372, comprising the acidic C-terminal region in A1 subunit, interact with factor Xa during the proteolytic inactivation of factor VIIIa (Nogami, K., Wakabayashi, H., and Fay, P. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 16502–16509). We now show this sequence is important for factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VIII. Peptide 337–372 markedly inhibited cofactor activation, consistent with a delay in the rate of cleavage at the A1-A2 junction. Studies using the isolated factor VIII heavy chain indicated that the peptide completely blocked cleavage at the A1-A2 junction (IC50 = 11 μm) and partially blocked cleavage at the A2-B junction (IC50 = 100 μm). Covalent cross-linking was observed between the 337–372 peptide and factor Xa following reaction with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, and the peptide quenched the fluorescence of dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg active site-modified factor Xa, suggesting that residues 337–372 directly interact with factor Xa. Studies using a monoclonal antibody recognizing residues 351–365 as well as the peptide to this sequence further restricted the interactive region. Mutant factor VIII molecules in which clustered acidic residues in the 337–372 segment were converted to alanine were evaluated for activation by factor Xa. Of the mutants tested, only factor Xa-catalyzed activation of the D361A/D362A/D363A mutant was inhibited with peak activity of ∼50% and an activation rate constant of ∼30% of the wild type values. These results indicate that the 337–372 acidic region separating A1 and A2 domains and, in particular, a cluster of acidic residues at position 361–363 contribute to a unique factor Xa-interactive site within the factor VIII heavy chain that promotes factor Xa docking during cofactor activation. We recently demonstrated that the residues 337–372, comprising the acidic C-terminal region in A1 subunit, interact with factor Xa during the proteolytic inactivation of factor VIIIa (Nogami, K., Wakabayashi, H., and Fay, P.

Factor VIII, a plasma protein deficient of defective in individuals with hemophilia A, functions as a cofactor for the serine protease, factor IXa, in the anionic phospholipid surface-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIII is synthesized as a multi-domain single chain molecule (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) consisting of 2332 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of ∼300 kDa (2Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C.

Factor VIII is processed to a series of metal ion-dependent heterodimers by cleavage at the B-A3 junction, generating a heavy chain consisting of the A1 and A2 domains, plus heterogeneous fragments of a partially proteolyzed B-domain linked to a light chain consisting of the A3, C1, and C2 domains (2Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C. Eaton D.L. Gitschier J. Keyt B. Seeburg P.H. Smith D.H. Hollingshead P. Wion K.L. Delwart E. Tuddenham E.D.G. Vehar G.A. Lawn R.M.

Acta. 1986; 871: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Factor VIII is converted into an active form, factor VIIIa, following limited proteolysis catalyzed by either thrombin or factor Xa (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Cleavages at Arg372 and Arg740 of the heavy chain produce the 50-kDa A1 and 40-kDa A2 subunits. Cleavage of the 80-kDa light chain at Arg1689 produces a 72-kDa A3-C1-C2 subunit. Additionally, cleavage by factor Xa at Arg1721 produces a 67-kDa A3-C1-C2 subunit. Proteolysis at Arg372 and Arg1689 is essential for generating factor VIIIa cofactor activity (see for review see Ref. 6Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the former site exposes a functional factor IXa-interactive site within the A2 domain that is cryptic in the inactivated molecule (7Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the latter site liberates the cofactor from its carrier protein, von Willebrand factor (8Lollar P. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10451-10455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as contributes to overall specific activity of the cofactor (9Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Factor Xa also inactivates factor VIII(a) following cleavages at Arg336 (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and Lys36 (11Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16502-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) within the A1 subunit. Inactivation following cleavage at Arg336 probably occurs by altered interaction of the A2 subunit with the truncated A1 (12Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) coupled with an increase in the Km for substrate factor X (13Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the latter reflecting a loss of a factor X-interactive site within an acidic residue-rich region defined by residues 337–372 (14Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Other proteases including activated protein C (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and factor IXa (15Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to also attack this site. Furthermore, cleavage at Lys36 by factor Xa has been suggested to alter the conformation of A1, limiting productive interaction with the A2 subunit (13Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, factor Xa represents a unique enzyme relative to factor VIII in that its catalytic mechanisms include both the up- and down-regulation of cofactor function. A factor Xa-interactive site required for cofactor activation has been mapped within the residues 2253–2270 of the C2 domain of factor VIII (16Nogami K. Shima M. Hosokawa K. Suzuki T. Koide T. Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Shibata M. Kamisue S. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31000-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, factor VIII alloantibody inhibitors recognizing this epitope within the C2 domain inhibit factor Xa-catalyzed factor VIII activation by directly blocking the interaction between the factor VIII and factor Xa (17Nogami K. Shima M. Nishiya K. Sakurai Y. Tanaka I. Giddings J.C. Saenko E.L. Yoshioka A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction of factor Xa with the light chain of the cofactor is a requisite step for catalysis. However, we recently presented kinetic evidence suggesting that residues 337–372, which comprise the C-terminal acidic region in A1 subunit, may directly interact with factor Xa (11Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16502-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), possibly via the heparin-binding exosite of the proteinase (18Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the current study, we identify a factor Xa-interactive site within the 337–372 acidic region that separates the A1 and A2 domains using a combination of approaches employing synthetic peptides, antibodies, and recombinant factor VIII mutants in both functional and physical assays. Our results indicate that the 337–372 region and, in particular, a cluster of acidic residues at position 361–363 contribute to a unique factor Xa-interactive site within the factor VIII heavy chain that promotes factor Xa docking during cofactor activation. Reagents—Purified recombinant factor VIII preparations were generous gifts from Bayer (Berkeley, CA). The factor VIII heavy chain was isolated from EDTA-treated factor VIII following chromatography on SP- and Q-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (7Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies 58.12 (19O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F.

Investig. 1988; 82: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) recognizing the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the factor VIII A1 domain were gifts from Drs. James Brown and Zaverio Ruggeri, respectively. The monoclonal antibody R8B12 and the polyclonal antibody GMA-7 recognizing the factor VIII A2 domain were obtained from Green Mountain Antibodies (Burlington, VT). IgG was purified following protein A-Sepharose chromatography. Human α-thrombin and factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN), DEGR-factor Xa (Hematologic Technologies Inc., Essex Junction, VT), peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Calbiochem), EDC, 1The abbreviations used are: EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride; DEGR-factor Xa, 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-factor Xa; BHK, baby hamster kidney. and sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) were purchased from the indicated vendors. Phospholipid vesicles containing 20% phosphatidylserine, 40% phosphatidylcholine, and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma) were prepared using N-octylglucoside (21Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptides corresponding to factor VIII residues 337–372 and 373–395 were prepared by the Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (San Diego, CA), and the peptide 351–365 was a gift from Dr. Paul Foster. The B-domainless factor VIII expression vector (RENeo factor VIII) and Bluescript cloning vector (pBS factor VIII) were kindly provided by Dr. Pete Lollar and John Healey. BHK cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All of the reagents used for the BHK cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Factor VIII Mutants— B-domainless factor VIII cDNA was restricted from the RENeo factor VIII expression construct using the endonucleases XhoI and NotI and cloned into the pBS factor VIII vector. Mutations were introduced into the shuttle constructs using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (22Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Factor VIII molecules bearing cluster mutation of 341–345Ala, 347–349Ala, and 361–363Ala were constructed. The presence of only the desired mutations was confirmed by sequence analysis using DNA sequence analysis. The mutated factor VIII cDNA was then restricted and ligated back into the RENeo expression vector and subjected to a second round of sequence analysis to confirm that only the desired mutation was present. The factor VIII expression vector constructs were transfected in BHK cells by liposome-mediated transfection. The selection, subcloning, and cloning of stable transfectants were done by standard methods, and the cloned cells were cultured in roller bottles (22Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was collected daily, and the expressed proteins were purified following chromatography on a SP-Sepharose as described previously (23Wakabayashi H. Freas J. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 10.1074/jbc.M311042200Google Scholar). Active fractions were detected using a one-stage clotting assay. Resultant factor VIII forms were typically >80% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE with albumin representing the major contaminant. Factor VIII samples were quick-frozen and stored at –80 °C. Biotinylation of Peptides—The synthetic peptides were reacted with biotin reagent in a 1:10 ratio (mol/mol) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 0.15 m NaCl at 4 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was fractionated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) developed with a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min. The biotinylated peptide was detected at 214 nm, and fractions were manually collected in 100-μl aliquots. Each fraction was lyophilized and resuspended in distilled water. Assays—Factor VIIIa activity was measured by a one-stage clotting assay with factor VIII-deficient plasma (24Casillas G. Simonetti C. Pavlovsky A. Coagulation. 1971; 4: 107-111Google Scholar). All of the reactions were run at 22 °C. Factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VIII as well as cleavage of factor VIII-derived substrates were run in a buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20) plus phospholipid vesicles (10 μm) in the absence or presence of peptides or anti-factor VIII IgG. Anti-factor VIII IgG preparations were preincubated with factor VIII for 1 h prior to reacting with factor Xa. Samples were removed from the mixtures at indicated times and were assayed for factor VIII activity and/or polypeptide composition. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were conducted using an Amico-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY) at 22 °C. The quenching of DEGR-factor Xa by peptide was determined following dansyl fluorescence. All of the measurements were made in a 200-μl reaction volume. DEGR-factor Xa (200 nm) and various concentrations of synthetic peptide in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of phospholipid (10 μm) were reacted for 30 min. Samples were excited at 340 nm, and the emission spectra were monitored at 480–600 nm. Emission scans were run at 3 nm/s in quadruplicate, and average values of the spectra were recorded. An appropriate blank was subtracted prior to integration of each spectrum. The relative dansyl fluorescence (F) was calculated in Equation 1, F(&x0025;)=FDP-FPFD×100(Eq. 1) where FDP, FP, and FD are the fluorescence intensities of DEGR-factor Xa and peptide, peptide alone, and DEGR-factor Xa alone, respectively. Integrated fluorescence intensities at 510–570 nm were averaged. Relative fluorescence as a function of peptide concentration was plotted, and the data were fitted to the quadratic equation by nonlinear least-squares regression using the formula shown in Equation 2, F=100-k·(D0+P0+Kd-(D0+P0+Kd)2-4D0P0)(Eq. 2) where F is the relative fluorescence (%), D0 is the DEGR-factor Xa concentration, P0 is the peptide concentration, Kd is the dissociation constant, and k is a constant. Cross-linking with EDC—Cross-linking reactions contained the indicated reactant concentrations and were run in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed on 8 or 13% gels using the procedure of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out using a Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus at 150 V for 1 h. For Western blotting, the protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed using the indicated monoclonal or polyclonal antibody followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody, respectively. The signal was detected using the enhanced chemifluorescence system (Amersham Biosciences), and the blots were scanned at 570 nm using Storm 860 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). In addition, biotinylated peptide was probed using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The signal was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Bioscience), and the blots were exposed to film for various times. Densitometric scans were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Devices). Data Analysis—To evaluate the catalytic efficacy of factor Xa for factor VIII, we calculated the activation rate constants based on the values of generated factor VIIIa activity. Assuming that the cleavage event and release of products are rapid, the concentration of free factor Xa should be constant. Therefore, the rate constants correlate with the concentration of substrates as shown in Scheme 1. factorVIII←k1factorVIIIa←k2factorVIIIiScheme 1 Factor VIIIa and factor VIIIi represent the activated factor VIII and inactivated factor VIIIa, respectively. The apparent rate constant values (k1 and k2) in Scheme 1 are based on a series reactions for factor VIII activation by factor Xa and were estimated by nonlinear least squares regression using Equation 3, [FactorVIIIa]t=[factorVIII]0·k1×(e-k1t-e-k2t)/(k2-k1)(Eq. 3) where [factor VIIIa]t is the concentration at time point (t) of factor VIIIa and [factor VIII]0 is the initial concentration of factor VIII. All of the experiments were performed at least three separate times, and the average values are shown. Inhibition of Factor Xa-catalyzed Factor VIII Activation by Synthetic Peptide 337–372—We recently demonstrated that factor Xa interacted with residues 337–372 that form the C-terminal acidic region in the A1 subunit of factor VIIIa, leading to the proteolytic inactivation of the cofactor (11Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16502-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this same region, which separates the A1 and A2 domains in the heavy chain of the factor VIII procofactor, represents a factor Xa-interactive site utilized in the activation of factor VIII, factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VIII was performed in the absence and presence of the 337–372 peptide. Factor VIIIa activity was followed using a one-stage clotting assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” Control experiments showed the presence of either peptide or factor Xa did not affect this assay, probably the result of the 5000-fold dilution of the reaction mixture prior to factor VIIIa activity determination. Using reaction conditions of 100 nm factor VIII and 1 nm factor Xa, maximal factor VIIIa activity was observed at the 1-min time point and reflected an ∼2.5-fold increase (Fig. 1A). The 337–372 peptide demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VIII activation with up to ∼70% inhibition observed (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 337–372 peptide (400 μm), the peak value of factor VIIIa activity was reduced by ∼50% and the time increment to reach this value was delayed compared with that of control. These observations in activity were supported by evaluation of extents of factor VIII proteolysis during the time course. Western blotting using the anti-A1 antibody 58.12, demonstrated similar rates of cleavage of intact factor VIII (∼240 kDa) independent on the presence of peptide. However, the rate of cleavage at the A1-A2-domainal junction (at Arg372) in derived heavy chain (∼90 kDa) was somewhat delayed in the presence of peptide compared with the control (Fig. 1A, inset). These data were consistent with earlier observations that factor VIIIa activity correlates with cleavage of the A1-A2 junction (4Fay P.J. Anderson M.T. Chavin S.I. Marder V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The cleavage of the light chain was not affected by the peptide (data not shown). These data suggest that the 337–372 region in A1 contributes to the efficiency of factor Xa-catalyzed cleavage of heavy chain. Effect on 337–372 Peptide on Isolated Heavy Chain Cleavage by Factor Xa—An interactive site in factor VIII for factor Xa was previously localized within the C2 domain in the light chain (16Nogami K. Shima M. Hosokawa K. Suzuki T. Koide T. Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Shibata M. Kamisue S. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31000-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The C2 domain also binds to anionic phospholipid surfaces (26Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1990; 75: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this interaction affects the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of factor VIII light chain probably influences (limits) the extent of cleavage at the A1-A2-domainal junction by the peptide. For this reason, a series of experiments were performed where we examined the inhibitory effects of the peptide using isolated heavy chain in place of intact factor VIII. Heavy chain (50 nm), free of detectable light chain (data not shown), was reacted for 2 h with factor Xa (5 nm) and phospholipid (10 μm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the 337–372 peptide. Fig. 2A shows the results from Western blotting of the cleavage reactions using an anti-A2 monoclonal antibody. Densitometry scanning was employed to quantitate the band density of the substrate (isolated intact heavy chain, Fig. 2B) and product (A2 subunit, Fig. 2C). The 337–372 peptide (125 μm) completely blocked the cleavage at the A1-A2 junction. The inhibition was observed in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 11 ± 3.5 μm. In addition, cleavage at the A2-B junction was partially blocked (∼70%) with the IC50 value of 100 ± 20 μm.In a control experiment, a peptide to the adjacent residues (373–395) representing the N-terminal region of the A2 domain showed marginal (∼10%) inhibition of heavy chain cleavage at the maximal peptide concentration employed (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the 337–372 peptide demonstrated no effect on the cleavage of isolated heavy chain by thrombin (data not shown). These data indicate that the 337–372 region in A1 subunit contributes to a specific interactive site for factor Xa necessary to facilitate cleavage of the heavy chain. Localization of a Factor Xa Site within the 337–372 Region—To validate the data obtained using the synthetic peptides, we examined factor Xa-catalyzed factor VIII activation and cleavage of the isolated heavy chain cleavage in the presence of the anti-A1 monoclonal antibody C5. This antibody binds an epitope defined by residues 351–365 in A1 subunit (20Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. de Graaf Mahoney S. Zimmerman T.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Factor VIII (100 nm) preincubated with the various concentration of C5 IgG for 1 h was reacted with factor Xa (1 nm), and factor VIIIa activity was determined using a one-stage clotting assay. Control experiments showed that the antibody did not affect the procoagulant activity in this assay over the range of concentrations employed. C5 IgG resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the peak levels of factor VIIIa activity activated by factor Xa (data not shown). In contrast, the anti-A2 antibody R8B12 used in a control experiment to exclude any nonspecific inhibition possessed little inhibitory activity. Effects of C5 IgG on the cleavage of the isolated heavy chain by factor Xa were further examined by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-A2 antibody for fragment detection. Preincubation of heavy chain (50 nm) with C5 IgG (250 nm) for 2 h completely inhibited cleavage at the A1-A2 junction and partially inhibited cleavage of A2-B junction by factor Xa (5 nm) (Fig. 3A). Calculated IC50 values obtained by densitometry scanning were 45 ± 10 and 410 ± 81 nm for inhibition of cleavage at the A1-A2 and A2-B sites, respectively (Fig. 3B). Because the epitope for C5 is well defined (20Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. de Graaf Mahoney S. Zimmerman T.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we performed a similar series of experiments using synthetic peptide 351–365. The 351–365 peptide inhibited maximal generation of activated factor VIIIa activity catalyzed by factor Xa in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibitory activity was similar to that of the 337–372 peptide (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the 351–365 peptide (500 μm) blocked factor Xa-catalyzed cleavages at A1-A2 and A2-B junction sites in the isolated heavy chain by ∼80 and ∼50%, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C), although this level of inhibition was somewhat weaker compared with that of the 337–372 peptide. Taken together, these results based upon peptide and antibody-dependent inhibition assays suggest that residues 351–365 within the A1 C-terminal acidic region contribute to an interactive site for factor Xa. Binding of the 337–372 Peptide to DEGR-Factor Xa—Binding of the 337–372 peptide was evaluated following changes in fluorescence emission of the dansyl group in DEGR-factor Xa in response to titration with the peptide. In the presence of phospholipid and calcium, the 337–372 peptide quenched the fluorescence of the dansyl group in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent Kd value = 92 ± 30.2 μm (Fig. 4). However, in the absence of lipid, we could not detect significant alterations of the dansyl fluorescence in response to the peptide (data not shown), suggesting that the presence of surface facilitates this association. On the other hand, the 373–395 peptide showed no significant effect on the dansyl fluorescence. The dose response observed for fluorescence quenching by the 337–372 peptide was similar to the response observed for its inhibition of factor VIII activation by factor Xa. Thus, this result provides physical evidence consistent with direct interaction of the A1 337–372 region with factor Xa. Zero-length Cross-linking of the 337–372 Peptide and Factor Xa—Previous results from our laboratory demonstrated that the 337–372 peptide yielded a covalent adduct with the heavy chain of factor X, and this linkage was retained following treatment with the factor X-activator in Russell's viper venom to liberate the activation peptide (27Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These observations suggested the potential for the formation of a cross-linked product using factor Xa. Thus, the zero-length cross-linking reagent EDC was used to monitor the interaction between the 337–372 peptide and factor Xa. Variable concentrations of biotinylated peptides were combined with a fixed concentration of factor Xa (430 nm), and the mixtures were reacted with 300 μm EDC at pH 7.2 at 4 °C for 1 h. Following this cross-linking protocol, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 5). Results using the 337–372 peptide showed the formation"

Our aim was to elucidate the pathway of PPARγ2 activation-mediated modulation of cyclin D1 transcription in mouse hepatocytes. To address this we utilized stable control and PPARγ hepatocyte cell lines created via retroviral overexpression utilizing AML-12 hepatocytes. Addition of PPARγ ligand troglitazone (TZD) activated PPARγ2 in proliferating hepatocytes and resulted in growth arrest accompanied by a down-regulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin D1, and β-catenin expression. Furthermore activation of PPARγ2 attenuated cyclin D1 promoter activity indicating a transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1. Since β-catenin plays a pivotal role in regulating cyclin D1 transcription, we studied whether PPARγ2-mediated inhibition of cyclin D1 transcription involved β-catenin. Interestingly overexpression of either wild-type or S37A mutant β-catenin was unable to rescue PPARγ2-mediated suppression of cyclin D1 transcription, whereas overexpression of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) was capable of antagonizing this inhibitory effect of PPARγ2. Additionally pretreatment with okadaic acid antagonized PPARγ2-mediated inhibition of cyclin D1 transcription without any effect on β-catenin expression. These studies also showed a TZD-mediated inhibition of total and phospho-CREBSer133 levels, CREB promoter activity, and cAMP-response element-mediated transcription in PPARγ hepatocytes. Pretreatment of PPARγ hepatocytes with okadaic acid, however, maintained higher total and phospho-CREBSer133 levels in the presence of TZD. These results indicated that PPARγ2 activation inhibited cyclin D1 transcription in hepatocytes via CREB-dependent and β-catenin-independent pathways.

The three known members of the PPAR family, PPARα, PPARδ, and PPARγ, can regulate transcription of genes in response to specific ligands (1Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B.

The PPARγ subfamily consists of two protein isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, with the former being expressed in a wide variety of tissues and the latter being preferentially expressed in adipose tissue (4Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). PPAR-mediated transactivation of target genes involves dimerization of PPARs with the retinoid X receptor and binding of the resulting heterodimer to specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elements (PPREs) located within the target gene promoters/enhancers (5Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This process of transcriptional activation also involves the recruitment of different coactivator molecules to specify select target gene activation, which include p300 (6Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8008-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the preadipocytes PPARγ is known to orchestrate the process of differentiation into adipocytes via regulation of the transcription of target genes, which requires a prior exit from the cell cycle (12Shao D. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21473-21478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, PPARγ activation can inhibit proliferation in a wide variety of cell types (for a review, see Ref. 13Debril M.B. Renaud J.P. Fajas L. Auwerx J. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 30-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) including those originating from hepatocellular carcinoma (14Yoshizawa K. Cioca D.P. Kawa S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K.

Kojiro M. Sata M. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which PPARγ regulates cell growth is still unclear, although it mostly involves a G1/S-specific arrest (14Yoshizawa K. Cioca D.P. Kawa S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Cancer. 2002; 95: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Wakino S. Kintscher U. Kim S. Yin F. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts PPARγ-mediated growth arrest was associated with reduced transcriptional activity of E2F·DP, which was a consequence of the down-regulation of serine-threonine phosphatase PP2A expression (18Altiok S. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Similarly, in fibroblastic cell lines, activation of PPARγ resulted in induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21CIP1 and p18INK4c (19Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) accompanied by differentiation into adipocytes. Additionally PPARγ activation in vascular smooth muscle cells resulted in G1/S arrest associated with reduced Retinoblastoma phosphorylation and modulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor levels (17Wakino S. Kintscher U. Kim S. Yin F. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). PPARγ activation in the MCF-7 breast cancer cells attenuated cyclin D1 transcription due to a decreased availability of p300 (20Wang C. Fu M. D'Amico M. Albanese C. Zhou J.N. Brownlee M. Lisanti M.P. Chatterjee V.K. Lazar M.A. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3057-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The normal cell growth cycle is tightly regulated via a complex interplay of multiple regulatory proteins. The transition from G1 to S phase is regulated by the controlled expression of cyclins, particularly cyclins D1 and E, which can bind and activate the corresponding cyclin-dependent kinases (21Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 can drive cells through G1 to S phase in a growth factor-independent manner (22Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar), and chronic expression of cyclin D1 is sufficient to initiate hepatocellular carcinoma (23Deane N.G. Parker M.A. Aramandla R. Diehl L. Lee W.J. Washington M.K. Nanney L.B. Shyr Y. Beauchamp R.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5389-5395PubMed Google Scholar). Therapeutic interventions targeted toward regulation of cyclin D1 expression might thus be an effective means of controlling growth. The capability of the PPARγ ligands to regulate cyclin D1 expression indicates the possibility of utilizing these ligands as chemotherapeutic drugs. Detailed studies of the mechanism(s) by which PPARγ attenuates cyclin D1 expression are required to achieve this goal. Apart from the NFκB and AP-1 (24Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y.

Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). The cyclic AMP-response element (CRE) is another key site in the cyclin D1 promoter regulating cyclin D1 expression (28D'Amico M. Hulit J. Amanatullah D.F. Zafonte B.T. Albanese C. Bouzahzah B. Fu M.

Hirono S. Hayashi K. Tsubouchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PPARα and PPARγ are expressed together in several tissues, and their relative abundance changes in response to physiological effectors and disease (30Wahli W. Devchand P.R. IJpenberg A. Desvergne B.

Life Sci. 1999; 55: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although expressed at lower levels in normal liver, hepatic expression of PPARγ2 is elevated in obese mice compared with lean littermates (32Memon R.A. Tecott L.H. Nonogaki K. Beigneux A. Moser A.H.

Kiyosawa K. Cancer. 2002; 95: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In a recent study, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PPARγ1 resulted in hepatic steatosis in the liver of PPARα–/– mice (34Yu S. Matsusue K. Kashireddy P. Cao W.Q. Yeldandi V. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Gonzalez F.J. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 498-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In other studies expression of PPARγ and its downstream target genes were increased following a homozygous deletion of cyclin D1 gene (35Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Li Z. Wu K. Hulit J. Neumeister P. Novikoff P.M. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Jones J.G. Whitney K.D. Donehower L.A. Harris E.L. Rohan T. Johns D.C. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6159-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These cyclin D1–/– mice developed hepatic steatosis with increased neutral lipid accumulation in the liver indicative of increased PPARγ activity. These results clearly indicate a distinct involvement of PPARγ in regulating hepatocyte physiology, although the mechanism and effectors involved are largely unclear. To understand the role of PPARγ in regulating hepatocyte growth and to elucidate the pathway involved, we designed studies with control and PPARγ hepatocytes (see “Experimental Procedures”) in the presence and absence of the PPARγ-specific ligand TZD. Our studies indicated that activation of PPARγ2 in exponentially growing AML-12 hepatocytes attenuated growth and inhibited expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D1, and β-catenin. PPARγ2-mediated inhibition of cyclin D1 transcription in these cells, however, was completely restored following overexpression of CRE-binding protein (CREB) but not β-catenin and involved modulation of total and phospho-CREBSer133 levels as well as CREB transcription. Additionally pretreatment of the PPARγ hepatocytes with okadaic acid maintained higher cyclin D1 transcription despite PPARγ2 activation via maintaining high total CREB and phospho-CREBSer133 levels and without restoring β-catenin expression. These studies demonstrated that PPARγ2 activation-mediated attenuation of cyclin D1 transcription in the hepatocytes was independent of β-catenin and dependent on CREB-mediated pathways.

Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Stable hepatocyte cell lines ectopically expressing PPARγ2 (PPARγ cells) or the empty control retroviral vector (control cells) were generated using AML-12 hepatocytes (46Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) as described previously (19Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol.

Stably transfected cells were selected for neomycin resistance, and individual clones were screened for HA expression. Cell Proliferation Assay—PPARγ and control cells were plated at a density of 0.1 × 106 cells in each well of a 6-well plate and treated with either Me2SO (vehicle) or 10 μm TZD. Cells were harvested at the indicated time intervals via trypsinization and counted using a hemocytometer. The cell number in the TZD-treated samples at each time point was calculated as percentage of control considering the corresponding vehicle-treated sample as 100%. Cells for each time point were plated in three separate wells, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Western Blot Analysis—Total cellular or nuclear protein was extracted from the cells at different time intervals according to the procedure described previously (47Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed with equal amounts of each protein sample and blotted with the respective antibodies. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—PPARγ and control vector cells plated at a density of 0.15 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with the respective luciferase vectors along with a β-galactosidase vector to correct for transfection efficiency. The amount of DNA transfected in any particular experiment was maintained equal by adjusting the amount of empty vector DNA. Following an overnight recovery in the growth medium, the transfected cells were treated with either Me2SO (as vehicle) or TZD for the indicated periods of time. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using a microplate luminometer LB 96V (EG&G Berthhold, Bad Wilbad, Germany) and a plate reader, respectively. Each assay was performed in duplicate, and each transfection was repeated at least six to nine times. The results obtained were calculated as the ratio of relative light units to the β-galactosidase values and expressed as percent increase of luciferase activity considering those obtained from the controls as 100%. The relative light units/β-galactosidase values obtained from the vehicle-treated samples for each set of transfections were considered as controls for that particular experiment. PPARγ Hepatocytes Express Functional PPARγ2 Protein—To investigate the role of PPARγ2 in regulating hepatic function, control and PPARγ hepatocytes ectopically expressing either a control retroviral vector (pBabe-puro) or PPARγ2-containing retroviral vector (pBabe-PPARγ-puro), respectively, were utilized (48Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Western analysis at different time intervals with a PPARγ-specific antibody showed the specific expression of PPARγ2 protein in the PPARγ hepatocytes and not in control cells (Fig. 1A). Luciferase assays designed with the PPARγ-responsive reporter tk-PPREx3-Luc (containing PPRE sites attached to a luciferase vector) (38Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) showed a low PPRE luciferase activity in the control cells, irrespective of the presence of TZD, that was highly activated in the PPARγ cells following exposure to TZD (Fig. 1B). Comparison of the basal level of activity of this promoter also showed a significantly higher activity in the PPARγ cells compared with the control cells in the absence of TZD (data not shown). These results indicated that the PPARγ hepatocytes express a functional PPARγ2 protein. Ectopic Expression and Activation of PPARγ2 in Proliferating Hepatocytes Arrests Growth and Inhibits Expression of PCNA—To determine whether the ectopic expression and activation of PPARγ2 in AML-12 hepatocytes can suppress growth, we analyzed the cell proliferation rate in the two cell types. These results showed that activation of PPARγ2 following addition of TZD resulted in complete inhibition of growth in the PPARγ cells (Fig. 2A) and was associated with an overall decrease in PCNA expression (Fig. 2B). Since PPARγ activation inhibits growth at the G1/S boundary in other cell types (14Yoshizawa K. Cioca D.P. Kawa S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Cancer. 2002; 95: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Wakino S. Kintscher U. Kim S. Yin F. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and inhibited PCNA expression in AML-12 hepatocytes, we examined the effect of PPARγ2 on cell cycle distribution. These studies indicated a major population of the PPARγ hepatocytes in G0-G1 phase that was further increased following addition of TZD (data not shown). The control hepatocytes, however, multiplied exponentially with a major population in the S phase but not in the G0-G1 phase. This clearly indicated a PPARγ2-mediated inhibition of hepatocyte growth at G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle. Activation of PPARγ2 in Proliferating Hepatocytes Inhibits Cyclin D1 Expression—Since PPARγ2 activation in hepatocytes resulted in a G1/S arrest, we determined whether it inhibited expression of cyclin D1. TZD-mediated activation of PPARγ2 inhibited expression of cyclin D1 protein in the PPARγ hepatocytes without affecting its expression in the control hepatocytes (Fig. 3A). To determine whether PPARγ2 activation in the hepatocytes attenuated cyclin D1 transcription, we transfected the full-length –1745 cyclin D1 promoter luciferase construct along with the β-galactosidase plasmid (for correction of transfection efficiency) in both PPARγ and control cells and performed luciferase and β-galactosidase assays following treatment with TZD over a period of 72 h. While addition of TZD to the control cells showed no change in the cyclin D1 promoter activity (Fig. 3B, compare– and + TZD lanes in control cells), it significantly attenuated cyclin D1 promoter activity in the PPARγ cells during the 72-h culture period (compare– and + lanes in PPARγ cells). Cyclin D1 luciferase assays carried out to determine the dose of TZD required for optimal inhibition of cyclin D1 transcription indicated that 1 μm TZD significantly inhibited cyclin D1 transcription in PPARγ cells (Fig. 3C). Activation of PPARγ2 by TZD Inhibits Expression of β-Catenin—Since β-catenin is known to regulate cyclin D1 transcription (27Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar), we determined whether PPARγ2-mediated attenuation of cyclin D1 transcription and thus hepatocyte growth involved β-catenin. Results in Fig. 4A show that activation of PPARγ2 by exposure to TZD significantly blocked the accumulation of β-catenin and reduced its expression to virtually undetectable levels in the PPARγ cells without affecting its expression in the control cells. Luciferase assays were then carried out with the β-catenin-responsive luciferase vectors pGL3OT or pGL3OF (containing wild-type or mutant TCF sites, respectively). The pGL3OT and pGL3OF vectors were modified versions of the original TCF-4 reporters TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH, respectively (39He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar), designed to reduce the levels of background activity via incorporation of transcriptional stop signals surrounding the TCF-4 sequences. These results indicated a significant attenuation of TCF-responsive luciferase activity following activation of PPARγ2 in the PPARγ cells (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 6) without any change in the mutant pGL3OF activity (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 7 and 8). These observations suggested that activation of PPARγ2 might attenuate cyclin D1 transcription and thus arrest hepatocyte growth in part by attenuating the β-catenin-TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 signaling pathway. β-Catenin Overexpression Is Unable to Restore PPARγ2 Activation-mediated Down-regulation of Cyclin D1 Transcription and Growth—To determine whether PPARγ2 activation reduced cyclin D1 transcription via attenuating β-catenin levels, we measured cyclin D1 promoter activity in the PPARγ cells (in the presence and absence of TZD) following overexpression of either wild-type or S37A-β-catenin or the corresponding empty"
https://openalex.org/W2079572256,"Transmembrane proteins destined to the basolateral cell surface of epithelial cells contain in their cytosolic domain at least two classes of sorting signals: one class promotes exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transport to the Golgi complex, and the other class operates at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) specifying segregation into basolateral exocytic pathways. Both kinds of addressing motifs are quite diverse among different proteins. It is unclear to what extent this feature reflects alternative decoding mechanisms or variations in motifs recognized by the same sorting factor. Here we applied a novel strategy based on permeable peptide technology and temperature-sensitive model proteins to study competition between cytosolic sorting motifs in the context of mammalian living cells. We used the transduction domain of HIV-1 Tat protein to make a membrane-permeable peptide of the cytosolic tail of GtsO45, which contains a well characterized ER exit di-acidic (DIE) motif and a tyrosine-based basolateral sorting signal (YTDI). This peptide added to the media inhibited transport of GtsO45 from both ER-to-Golgi and TGN-to-basolateral cell surface in transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Instead, it did not affect the exocytic trafficking of a GtsO45-derived chimeric protein bearing 30 juxtamembrane residues from the cytosolic domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor that contains a variant ER exit motif (ERE) and an unconventional proline-based basolateral sorting signal. These results not only proved the feasibility of competing for sorting events in intact cells but also showed that distinct plasma membrane proteins can be discriminated at pre-TGN stages, and that basolateral sorting involves different recognition elements for tyrosine-based motifs and an unconventional basolateral motif.

Intriguing characteristics of such cytosolic sorting signals include their diversity and apparent redundancy (5Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 6Nufer O. Guldbrandsen S. Degen M. Kappeler F. Paccaud J.P. Tani K. Hauri H.P. J.

This could mean that different cytosolic recognition decoders exist for each species of sorting information or that the same decoders interact with different sorting signals with variable affinity. Both alternatives could increase the possibilities of regulatory events on subsets of proteins that hold similar addressing information. How many categories of sorting factors or mechanisms exist for a similar destination or how many classes of sorting signals use one or another decoding factor are still unanswered questions. Indeed, systematic competition experiments are required. Here we used temperature-sensitive reporters and membrane-permeant peptides as feasible and convenient approaches to interfere selectively and differentially with plasma membrane protein trafficking from the ER to the Golgi and from the TGN to the basolateral cell surface in intact polarized epithelial cells, revealing unexpected aspects of the exocytic sorting machinery in mammalian cells.Although the mechanism of ER to Golgi complex transport has been controversial regarding requirements of specific sorting signals, there is now compelling evidence supporting the notion of cargo selection mediated by the COP-II proteinaceous coat (3Antonny B. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Klumperman J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Distinct elements of the COP-II complex seem to be responsible for the recognition of sorting information in the cytosolic domain of cargo transmembrane proteins and the manufacture of ER exporting vesicles (16Miller E. Antonny B. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 213-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Soluble cargo also seems to leave the ER selectively by interacting with specific transmembrane proteins, which presumably act as COP-II linking receptors (21Belden W.J. Barlowe C. Science. 2001; 294: 1528-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The most characterized ER exit motifs are diphenylalanines (6Nufer O. Guldbrandsen S. Degen M. Kappeler F. Paccaud J.P.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which in certain proteins can be part of a longer moiety (25Sevier C.S. Weisz O.A. Davis M. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A third class of ER export motifs based on RKXRK has been reported recently (26Giraudo C.G. Maccioni H.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3753-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) in the cytosolic tails of Golgi resident glycosyltransferases, type II membrane proteins, whose recognition involved direct interaction with Sar1. How all this diversity is related to the transport process of subsets of proteins remains incompletely defined. Recent evidence in yeast suggested that cargo discrimination could occur upon exit from the ER (16Miller E. Antonny B. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Cell. 2003; 114: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), for instance, leading to package glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in distinct transport vesicles (27Muniz M. Morsomme P. Riezman H. Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the still missing evidence in mammalian cells has contributed to maintain the current notion that discrimination among different plasma membrane proteins occurs only upon reaching the TGN (1Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Alternative exocytic pathways emerge from the TGN carrying distinct plasma membrane proteins according to specific sorting information (1Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Musch A. Xu H. Shields D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This is more evident in polarized epithelial cells, in which apical and basolateral exocytic pathways nurture the corresponding plasma membrane domain with specific proteins giving rise to distinct compositions (11Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 12Mostov K.E. Cardone M.H. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Apical plasma membrane proteins have sorting information in their extracellular membrane, anchoring or cytosolic domains, suggesting a variety of decoding mechanisms (29Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Instead, basolateral sorting signals have been found exclusively in cytosolic tails (2Aroeti B. Okhrimenko H. Reich V. Orzech E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 57-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 30Mostov K.E. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and therefore should be recognized by cytosolic sorting factors, presumably including elements of the AP adaptor family (31Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 32Folsch H. Pypaert M. Schu P. Mellman I. J.

A. 2002; 99: 6755-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although most basolateral sorting signals are based on tyrosine residues in the context of YXXΦ (where Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid), or NPXY or involve di-leucine residues, they are highly degenerate, frequently indistinguishable from endocytic motifs (14Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and can be even conformed by unconventional motifs entailing none of these residues (13Odorizzi G.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) as sorting mediators of at least certain basolateral proteins, seemingly recognizing tyrosine sorting signals as well as a distinct range of non-tyrosine motifs. AP-3 could potentially expand the range (34Nishimura N. Plutner H. Hahn K. Balch W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6755-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and there still may be additional basolateral sorting mediators to be discovered. The functional and mechanistic implications of diversity in both the basolateral sorting sequences and these AP decoders remain unknown.The following observations prompted us to attempt a previously unexploited strategy for competing with sorting signals in intact cells. First, in vitro reconstitution systems have shown that synthetic peptides bearing sorting information for ER exit (5Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) or basolateral delivery (9Musch A. Xu H. Shields D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J.

Second, membrane-permeable peptides containing transducing sequences that drive them through the plasma membrane have been used recently to interfere with a variety of cytosolic protein-protein interactions (39Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 40Schwarze S.R.

This opens the convenient possibility of testing competition between cytosolic sorting sequences in the context of living cells. Third, VSVG protein has been widely used as reporter protein for sorting events mediated by a well characterized ER exit di-acidic (DIE) motif (5Nishimura N. Balch W.E.

Cell. 2000; 11: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and for exocytic sorting from the TGN mediated by an overlapping YXXΦ basolateral sorting signal (YTDI) (42Thomas D.C. Brewer C.B.

Its temperature-sensitive variant GtsO45 is retained in the ER at the non-permissive temperature (44Gallione C.J. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 374-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Doms R.W. Ruusala A. Machamer C. Helenius J. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and at the TGN by the established 20 °C block (46Matlin K.S. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2131-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), thus allowing the ER-to-Golgi and TGN-to-cell surface transport (47Lippincott-Schwartz J. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 557-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) to be analyzed separately. GtsO45 is also suitable to make hybrid proteins with segments of other proteins while conserving its temperature sensitivity (48Cole N.B. Ellenberg J. Song J. DiEuliis D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).We found that a peptide made up of the protein transduction domain of HIV-1 Tat followed by the cytosolic domain of GtsO45 inhibited transport of GtsO45 from the ER to the Golgi and from the TGN to the basolateral plasma membrane in intact Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. On the contrary, it did not affect a temperature-sensitive chimeric model protein differing only in that the cytosolic domain was replaced by residues from the EGFR receptor, which included a putative EXE (ERE) di-acidic ER exit motif (24Bannykh S.I. Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and a proline-dependent basolateral sorting signal (15He C. Hobert M.E. Friend L. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38284-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated for the first time that mammalian cells discriminate among different plasma membrane proteins at pre-Golgi steps, during ER to Golgi complex transport, and suggest that subtly different diacidic ER exit motifs might not be equivalent. They also showed that basolateral sorting involves different recognition elements for proteins bearing either tyrosine-based or unconventional sorting signals.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression Plasmids and Antibodies—The GtsO45 cDNA (44Gallione C.J. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 374-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A cDNA fragment encompassing residues 1–482 of GtsO45 was amplified by PCR and cloned into NheI-XhoI sites of pcDNA 3.1(-) vector (Invitrogen). Into the XhoI-HindIII site of this vector, we ligated in-frame a DNA segment encoding the cytosolic residues 645–674 of the human EGFR. This chimeric cDNA encodes the extracellular and transmembrane domains of GtsO45 followed by the 30 cytosolic juxtamembrane residues of the EGFR (G-EGFRc). This construction was corroborated by sequencing. The expression of both GtsO45 and G-EGFRc was assessed with a monoclonal antibody directed against the NH2 terminus of VSVG provided by Dr. E. Rodriguez-Boulan (Cornell University).Permanently Transfected MDCK Cells—Strain-II MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bioproducts for Science, Inc.), 200 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) and fungizone (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.). Transfections with GtsO45 and G-EGFRc cDNAs were made using the LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer's protocol, and permanent transformants were obtained after 2 weeks of selection with G418 (0.8 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) (49Bravo-Zehnder M. Orio P. Norambuena A. Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Latorre R. Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13114-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 50Salazar G. Gonzalez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1677-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced by 10 mm sodium butyrate (49Bravo-Zehnder M. Orio P. Norambuena A. Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Latorre R. Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13114-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 50Salazar G. Gonzalez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1677-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) at the restrictive temperature of 40 °C for 20 h to accumulate the model proteins in the ER.Domain-specific Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation—Domainspecific biotinylation was made in MDCK cells cultured in Transwell chambers (49Bravo-Zehnder M. Orio P. Norambuena A. Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Latorre R. Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13114-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM), and then sulfo-NHS-biotin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 60 min. After three washes in ice-cold PBS-CM, the cells were incubated with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min and then lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, 0.150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and anti-protease mixture (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm leupeptin; Sigma). Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating with a monoclonal anti-VSVG antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then adding protein A-Sepharose previously incubated with 10 μg of a rabbit anti-mouse antibody. The beads were washed six times in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, resuspended in sampler buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the biotinylated proteins detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Image Quantification—Indirect immunofluorescence was done as described (50Salazar G. Gonzalez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1677-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Permanently transfected MDCK cells grown to confluence on glass coverslips were subjected to the different experimental conditions, washed with PBS, and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM). All washes were made in PBS plus 0.2% gelatin (300 Bloom, Sigma). The cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS-CM for 10 min at room temperature. Incubation with anti-VSVG monoclonal antibody (1:250) and secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antimouse IgG (1:100) was made for 30 min at 37 °C. Digital images of fluorescence were acquired on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a ×63 immersion objective and the 14-bit Axiocam camera and then transferred to a computer workstation running Axiovision imaging software. For quantification, all images from a single experiment were acquired under identical settings (8 bits; 1030 × 1300 pixels; and the same exposure times). Digital images were then analyzed with MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imagining, West Chester, PA). In each region of interest, total fluorescence intensities were measured for all samples using black and white 8-bit unsaturated and background-less images, thus minimizing nonspecific fluorescence. The entire lateral plasma membrane was selected by drawing a strip fit with a maximum width of 15 pixels. The integrated fluorescence intensities of lateral plasma membranes between two cells were divided to estimate the contribution of each cell. The perinuclear Golgi staining and vesicular structures were enclosed within lined areas, and fluorescence measures were made adjusting similar threshold intensities in each cell.Cell-permeable Peptides—Cell-permeable peptides were manufactured at the Institute of Biochemistry, Charité, Humboldt University of Berlin. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified (95% purity) and lyophilized peptides were dissolved in Me2SO immediately before use to prevent aggregation by oxidation or denaturation. The peptides were added directly to the cell culture medium at a concentration of 40 μm.Uptake of 125I-Labeled Tat-GpY487Y501—The Tat-GpY487Y501 peptide (10 μg) was labeled with 125I following established procedures with minimal modifications (50Salazar G. Gonzalez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1677-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Free [125I] was separated by chromatography from radiolabeled peptide according to the manufacturer's procedures. The specific activity was ∼6 × 105 cpm/mg. Uptake of iodinated peptide was estimated by incubating MDCK cells with the labeled peptide (about 400,000 cpm) at 20 °C for 20 min. The cells were then shifted to the permissive temperature for 60 min. Cell-bound peptide was removed by washing twice with PBS and then performing an acid wash (50Salazar G. Gonzalez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1677-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with buffer 0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.5, for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed in 1 n NaOH, and the remaining radioactivity was assessed in a gamma counter (Cobra II, Packard Instrument Co.).Endoglycosidase-H Resistance Assay—Pulse-chase experiments and acquisition of endo-H resistance were used to assess ER to Golgi complex transport. MDCK cells (106 cells) were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys (100 μCi/ml) for 4 h at 40 °C, washed three times in PBS containing 100-fold excess of Met/Cys, and then incubated for 30 min at 40 °C with cycloheximide (10 μm) and cell-permeable peptides in in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES. After shifting the temperature to 32 °C for different periods of time, cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation, and the immunocomplexes were digested for 17 h at 37 °C with 2 milliunits of endoglycosidase-H (Calbiochem) in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 0.2% SDS, 0.02% Trito"
https://openalex.org/W2051563185,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules load peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum in a process during which the peptide cargo is normally optimized in favor of stable MHC-peptide interactions. A dynamic multimolecular assembly termed the peptide-loading complex (PLC) participates in this process and is composed of MHC class I molecules, calreticulin, ERp57, and tapasin bound to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) peptide transporter. We have exploited the observation that the rat MHC class I allele RT1-Aa, when expressed in the rat C58 thymoma cell line, effectively competes and prevents the endogenous RT1-Au molecule from associating with TAP. However, stable RT1-Au molecules are assembled efficiently in competition with RT1-Aa, demonstrating that cargo optimization can occur in the absence of TAP association. Defined mutants of RT1-Aa, which do not allow formation of the PLC, fail to become thermostable in C58 cells. Wild-type RT1-Aa, which does allow PLC formation, also fails to become thermostable in this cell line, which carries the rat TAPB transporter that supplies peptides incompatible for RT1-Aa binding. Full optimization of RT1-Aa requires the presence of the TAP2A allele, which is capable of supplying suitable peptides. Thus, formation of the PLC alone is not sufficient for optimization of the MHC class I peptide cargo.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; β2m, β2-microglobulin; PLC, peptide-loading complex; IFN, interferon; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. class I molecules are composed of two subunits, a heavy chain and a β2-microglobulin (β2m), which fold such that the α1 and α2 domains of the heavy chain form a binding groove capable of accepting short peptides of between 8–10 amino acids in length. These peptides, usually derived by cytosolic proteasomal degradation (1Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar), are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) (2Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hämmerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 3Momburg F. Ortiz-Navarrete V. Neefjes J. Goulmy E. van de Wal Y. Spits H. Powis S.J. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C. Walden P. Hämmerling G.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules traffic to the cell surface where they can be recognized by CD8+ T lymphocytes, potentially leading to the activation of an immune response. During assembly in the lumen of the ER, MHC class I molecules form the peptide-loading complex (PLC), a multi-molecular complex comprising the MHC class I heavy chain and β2m, the chaperone calreticulin, the oxidoreductase ERp57, the class I-specific accessory molecule tapasin, and the peptide transporter TAP (4Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Elliott T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, assembly of MHC class I molecules is a complex process involving multiple interactions with ER-resident chaperones and accessory polypeptides. Each of the components of the PLC is likely to perform one or more specific roles. Tapasin, for example, not only forms a bridge between the MHC class I molecule and TAP but also stabilizes TAP in an as yet unknown manner (5Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P.

It is also involved in the process of editing, or optimization of peptides loaded into MHC class I (8Williams A.P. Peh C.A. Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This process leads to high-affinity peptides being loaded onto MHC class I molecules in the ER. Although peptide optimization is thought to be highly dependent upon tapasin for many MHC class I alleles, it is not yet clear if TAP association is a prerequisite for this process to occur. The oxidoreductase ERp57 may be involved in multiple stages of MHC class I assembly, including the early stages of calnexin association, and later, in the PLC (9Hughes E.A. Cresswell P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lindquist J.A. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Hämmerling G.J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As part of the PLC, one of the two thioredoxin-like redox active sites of ERp57 (Cys-Gly-His-Cys) seems to be involved in a disulfide interaction with an unpaired cysteine residue on tapasin (14Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The role of the other redox site during MHC class I assembly remains to be established. Calreticulin and calnexin are lectins which assist in polypeptide folding by binding to N-linked glycans, in particular monoglucosylated (Glc1Man5–9GlcNAc2) structures that exist transiently during assembly in the ER. Both calnexin and calreticulin possess an extended P-domain arm (15Ellgaard L. Riek R. Herrmann T. Guntert P. Braun D. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A quality control mechanism seems to exist in which cycles of folding and disulfide formation or isomerization occur during association of calnexin- or calreticulin-ERp57 complexes, controlled by the addition or removal of the terminal glucose residue on the glycan. MHC class I molecules contain between one and three N-linked glycans, attached to Asn86 in the α1 domain, Asn176 in the α2 domain, and Asn256 in the α3 domain. The number and distribution of these glycans differs between species and sometimes between alleles within species. Human MHC class I molecules contain glycans only on Asn86, whereas for mouse MHC class I molecules, glycans are found on Asn86 and Asn176, and additionally in some alleles (for example H-2Ld and H-2Db) on Asn256. Most rat MHC class I molecules possess a different distribution of glycans; they are found at Asn86 and Asn256. It has not been established whether the role of these glycans in the rat is analogous to those in human and mouse, wherein the Asn86-linked glycan seems to be important for association of calreticulin (18Harris M.R.

Tissue Antigens. 2002; 59: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As part of our ongoing studies into the control of the assembly of rat MHC class I molecules (12Morrice N.A. Powis S.J.

Immunol. 1997; 27: 2744-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we studied the formation of the rat PLC. We show that formation of the PLC does not lead to the rapid optimization of the peptide cargo of RT1-Aa in C58 cells, most likely as a consequence of improper peptide supply. Conversely, utilizing competition between RT1-Aa and -Au for TAP binding in these cells (22Knittler M.R. Gulow K. Seelig A. Howard J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5967-5977PubMed Google Scholar), we also show that RT1-Au can optimize its peptide cargo in the absence of TAP association. Cell Lines and Antibodies—The C58(NT)D rat thymic lymphoma cell line (23Silva A. MacDonald H.R. Conzelmann A. Corthesy P. Nabholz M. Immunol.

Transfectants were generated by electroporation at 975 μF and 160–180 V, followed by selection in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (PAA Laboratories). The previously generated line C58.Aa.TAP2A clone B5 (22Knittler M.R. Gulow K. Seelig A. Howard J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5967-5977PubMed Google Scholar, 24Powis S.J. Deverson E.V. Coadwell W.J.

Human 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of 293 cells was performed with Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) using 4 μl of Fugene and 2 μg of plasmid DNA per well of a six-well plate. Cells were stimulated with 200 units/ml human IFN-γ (Sigma) as required. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) MAC30 recognizes RT1-Aa, and mAbs NR5/10 and GN7/5.B11 recognize RT1-Au. mAb W6/32 recognizes HLA class I molecules. Rabbit antiserum 116 recognizes rat TAP2. Anti-calreticulin (SPA600) was purchased from Stressgen. Anti-murine tapasin antiserum was a gift from Ted Hansen (Washington Univ. School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Anti-human tapasin antiserum was a gift from Tim Elliott (University of Southampton, Southampton, UK). Anti-ERp57 antiserum was a gift from Neil Bulleid (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK). PCR-mediated Site-directed Mutagenesis—Wild-type RT1-Aa was subcloned into the pCR3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) by excision of the full-length cDNA with EcoR1 from the pHBneo vector (25Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), and orientation was confirmed by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with QuikChange methodology (Stratagene) using the following primers (mutated position underlined, but complementary sequences not listed): N86K 5′-CGCGGCTACTACAAGCAGAGCGAGGGC-3′; N256K 5′-GGGAAGGAGCAGAAGTACACATGCCGT-3′; B27.H114D 5′-CTCCGCGGGTACGACCAGGACGCCTACGACGGC-3′. The double mutant N86K/N256K was created in a second round of mutagenesis of the N86K mutant. All mutants were verified by sequencing of the full-length cDNA insert. FACS Analysis—Cells were stained with 50 μl of relevant tissue culture supernatant for 30 min at 4 °C, then washed three times in PFN (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide), stained with FITC conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), washed three more times and fixed with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Staining of HLA-B27 on 293 cells was performed directly with FITC-coupled anti-HLA-B27 (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed using CellQuest software on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—For metabolic-labeling experiments, cells were preincubated in methionine and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) for 30 min and then labeled for 15 min with 7.2 MBq Trans-label (ICN). Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide) containing 1% digitonin (Sigma) or 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), as required.

Lysates of metabolically labeled cells were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 30 min, followed by immunoprecipitation with MAC30 or GN7/5.B11. For immunoprecipitations of the PLC, aliquots of digitonin lysates of metabolically labeled cells were immunoprecipitated with antisera to calreticulin, tapasin, and TAP. Control lysates were immunoprecipitated with MAC30 and NR5/10. Pulse-chase analysis was performed on metabolically labeled cells returned to culture at 37 °C. Samples were removed, lysed at the indicated times of chase, and immunoprecipitated with MAC30 or GN7/5.B11. Immunoprecipitates were then digested with 5 milli-units of endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C. Western blotting of N-ethylmaleimide-treated lysates of 293 cells was performed as described previously (27Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Expression of RT1-Aa and N-linked Glycosylation-site Mutants in C58 Cells—Using site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed cDNAs of RT1-Aa devoid of its Asn86 and Asn256 glycosylation sites by mutation of the relevant Asn residues to Lys (Fig. 1a). Rat C58 thymoma cells were transfected with the mutated constructs lacking Asn86 (denoted N86K), Asn256 (N256K), and the double-mutant (N86K/N256K). FACS analysis with MAC30 confirmed that all three mutants were expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 1b) and at levels similar to wild-type RT1-Aa. To further verify that each mutant retained the ability to form a peptide-binding structure, we incubated Nonidet P-40 lysates of metabolically radiolabeled cells with or without the specific RT1-Aa binding peptide SMFPVSENR. Lysates were then heated at 37 °C to induce dissociation of molecules devoid of high-affinity peptides, and then followed by immunoprecipitation with MAC30. All three mutants of RT1-Aa were stabilized by the presence of peptide, indicating correct folding of the MHC class I molecule by the criterion of peptide-receptiveness (Fig. 1c). Immunoprecipitation of the RT1-Aa mutants also revealed a small difference in the relative molecular mass of the N86K and N256K products (Fig. 1d), with mutant N256K resolving with slightly higher mobility than N86K. Digestions with endo H and N-glycosidase F, the latter to remove completely the glycan unit, suggested that the difference was due to glycosylation (not shown). This supposition was further supported by pulse-chase experiments in which the molecular mass change occurred at the onset of glycan maturation (Fig. 2d). Taken together, these data suggest that the N-linked glycans situated on the α1 and α3 domains are subjected to differential glycan modification. Glycosylation at Asn86 Controls Association of RT1-Aa with the Peptide-loading Complex—Next, we determined whether the removal of glycosylation sites from RT1-Aa disrupted the formation of the PLC. Digitonin lysates of radiolabeled N86K and N256K cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies recognizing calreticulin, tapasin, and TAP. In addition, to distinguish the association of mutant RT1-Aa molecules from that of the endogenous RT1-Au class I allele expressed in C58 cells, lysates were also immunoprecipitated with antibodies specifically recognizing RT1-Aa (MAC30) and RT1-Au (NR5/10). RT1-Au can be resolved from RT1-Aa by its slightly different gel mobility. Fig. 2a shows the region of the gel containing the MHC class I heavy chains. Removal of the α1 domain glycan (N86K) abolished the association of RT1-Aa with the PLC, in contrast to the removal of the α3 domain glycan (N256K), which still allowed PLC formation (Fig. 2a). The association of RT1-Au in the N86K line can be seen very faintly in this image, but can readily be detected upon longer exposure of the autoradiograph. We conclude, therefore, that it is the α1 domain glycan of RT1-Aa which is crucial for the formation of the PLC. The absence of PLC interactions has been linked to a failure in quality control and peptide cargo optimization of some MHC class I molecules (28Lewis J.W. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MHC class I molecules which have been optimized and contain high-affinity peptides are more resistant to heat treatment (8Williams A.P. Peh C.A. Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the thermostability of the mutant RT1-Aa molecules by heating lysates of radiolabeled cells at 37 °C and 42 °C for 30 min, followed by immunoprecipitation with MAC30. However, both the wild-type and the mutant RT1-Aa molecules displayed poor thermostability (not shown). We reasoned that this result may have occurred because of the inability of the TAPB allele of the rat TAP transporter expressed in C58 cells to supply suitable peptides, which for RT1-Aa would normally require the presence of the rat TAPA allele (24Powis S.J. Deverson E.V. Coadwell W.J. Ciruela A. Huskisson N.S. Smith H. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C. Nature. 1992; 357: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 29Powis S.J. Young L.L. Joly E. Barker P.J. Richardson L. Brandt R.P. Melief C.J. Howard J.C. Butcher G.W. Immunity. 1996; 4: 159-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we repeated the thermostability experiment, but this time, we included cells co-expressing RT1-Aa and the rat TAP2A allele (which in combination with rat TAP1 forms the TAPA transporter). Poor thermostability of RT1-Aa was again observed, except in the presence of the TAP2A allele, which displayed good thermostability even after treatment at 42 °C (Fig. 2b). We next tested if optimization increased with the passage of time. Wildtype and mutant N256K displayed some limited acquisition of thermostability after a 1 h chase, whereas the N86K mutant failed to become thermostable, indicating that formation of the PLC can have some effect on RT1-Aa in the context of TAPB (Fig. 2c). However, our data clearly demonstrate that the rapid acquisition of thermostability is dependent upon the presence of an adequate supply of relevant peptides suitable for MHC class I binding, and that formation of the PLC alone is not enough to ensure optimization. Mutations which affect the formation of the PLC often influence the kinetics of MHC class I molecule export from the ER to the cell surface (28Lewis J.W. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed pulse-chase analysis to investigate the export of the RT1-Aa mutants. Wild-type C58.Aa and mutant N86K, N256K, N86K/N256K cells were pulse-radiolabeled and subsequently lysed in detergent buffer after 30, 60, and 120 min of chase in ordinary medium. MAC30 immunoprecipitates of the resulting lysates were digested with endoglycosidase H to determine the acquisition of resistance, which acts as a readout of exit from the ER. As shown in Fig. 2d, N86K cells displayed more rapid exit of RT1-Aa from the ER in comparison to wild-type and N256K cells, with full acquisition of endo H resistance by 120-min chase. This phenotype of more rapid exit from the ER is in keeping with other mutations in class I molecules, such as T134K, which fail to form interactions with the PLC (28Lewis J.W. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). With no glycans present in the N86K/N256K mutant, no maturation was observed. RT1-Au Achieves Optimization in the Absence of TAP Association—It has been reported previously that expression of RT1-Aa in C58 cells results in retention of a pool of RT1-Aa molecules in the ER and accumulation in association with the TAPB transporter allele expressed by this cell line (22Knittler M.R. Gulow K. Seelig A. Howard J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5967-5977PubMed Google Scholar). The net effect is to prevent RT1-Au molecules from associating detectably with TAP, an observation that we confirm in Fig. 3a by immunoprecipitation of TAP from digitonin lysates of C58, C58.Aa, and C58.Aa.N86K cells. In the latter cells, the inability of N86K to form a PLC allows the restoration of RT1-Au association with TAP. We decided, therefore, to determine whether preventing the association of RT1-Au with TAP resulted in defects in its ability to optimize peptide cargo. N86K cells provided a control cell line in which RT1-Aa is present, but as a non-TAP-competing variant. FACS analysis of the three cell lines revealed similar expression levels of RT1-Au on the cell surface (Fig. 3b). In addition, the pulse-chase kinetics of ER-exit of RT1-Au was not significantly altered in the three lines (Fig. 3c). RT1-Au molecules from all three lines were similarly thermostable after the initial labeling period, matching the data for RT1-Aa in the presence of TAP2A (Fig. 3d). We conclude from this data that RT1-Au is capable of loading and optimizing its peptide cargo despite being prevented from associating with TAP. We next determined whether RT1-Au represented a tapasin-independent allele, which may explain its ability to optimize in competition with RT1-Aa. Both RT1-Au and -Aa possess Arg114 and Asp116 residues in the F-pocket region of the peptide-binding groove, a pattern similar to that of HLA-B* 2705, which permits a tapasin-independent phenotype (31Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Ahn K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Repeated attempts to transfect the tapasin-deficient cell line .220 with RT1-Au and -Aa were unsuccessful. Therefore, we made use of the human cell line 293 which expresses little, if any, tapasin in the absence of stimulation with IFN-γ. As shown in Fig. 4a, tapasin and the tapasin-ERp57 disulfide-linked complex (14Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 27Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were only detected by Western blot after IFN-γ stimulation. FACS analysis with W6/32 showed that IFN-γ treatment increased endogenous MHC class I expression. To test the system, we transiently expressed wild-type HLA-B* 2705 (tapasin-independent) and also a mutant of B* 2705, in which residue His114 had been altered to Asp114 (denoted H114D) which, based on the data of Park et al. (31Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Ahn K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), should induce a tapasin-dependent phenotype into B27. Wild-type B* 2705 was expressed on the cell surface of unstimulated 293 cells, with up-regulation in the presence of IFN-γ (Fig. 4b). In marked contrast, B27.H114D was only detected at the cell surface after IFN-γ treatment. Expression of RT1-Au and -Aa constructs at the cell surface in the presence and absence of IFN-γ treatment suggested that both behave as tapasin-independent alleles (Fig. 4c). Removal of the α1 domain glycan located at Asn86 prevents the association of class I molecules, such as human HLA-B27 (32Harris M.R. Lybarger L. Myers N.B. Hilbert C. Solheim J.C. Hansen T.H. Yu Y.Y. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and mouse H2-Ld (33Yu Y.Y. Turnquist H.R. Myers N.B. Balendiran G.K. Hansen T.H. Solheim J.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4427-4433PubMed Google Scholar), with the PLC. In contrast, removal of Asn176 in the α2 domain of Ld, leaves the PLC intact (18Harris M.R. Yu Y.Y. Kindle C.S. Hansen T.H. Solheim J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5404-5409PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that Asn86 bears the crucial glycan unit. Our data now extend this observation to a rat MHC class I molecule, with the observation that removal of Asn86 from RT1-Aa prevents formation of the PLC. The function of this glycan is most likely to provide a site of interaction for calreticulin. In the absence of Asn86, calreticulin is not found in contact with MHC class I molecules, whereas, in the absence of tapasin, calreticulin can still associate with MHC class I (19Turnquist H.R. Vargas S.E. McIlhaney M.M. Li S. Wang P. Solheim J.C. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 59: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This latter observation suggests that calreticulin plays a critical role in the formation of the normal PLC. However, it has also been reported that tapasin, ERp57, and MHC class I heavy chain can be found associated with TAP in calreticulin-deficient cells (34Gao B. Adhikari R. Howarth M. Nakamura K. Gold M.C. Hill A.B. Knee R. Michalak M. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which may argue against such a role. A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy may reside in the observation that tapasin forms a disulfide-bonded partnership with ERp57 (14Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In β2m-deficient Daudi cells, tapasin and ERp57 can be detected in a disulfide-conjugate (27Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ERp57 and tapasin can also be found in association with TAP in Daudi cells (35Diedrich G. Bangia N. Pan M. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1703-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although unfolded MHC class I molecules cannot associate with this tapasin-ERp57-TAP complex in Daudi cells, partially folded MHC class I/B2m molecules may be able to form this association in calreticulin-deficient cells. Nevertheless, such complexes in calreticulin-deficient cells do not complete normal assembly and are loaded with a suboptimal peptide cargo, indicating that calreticulin is indeed an important partner in the PLC (34Gao B. Adhikari R. Howarth M. Nakamura K. Gold M.C. Hill A.B. Knee R. Michalak M. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Clear roles for the glycans situated on Asn176 or Asn256 of MHC class I molecules have not been elucidated. In the case of mouse MHC class I bearing Asn176 glycans, it is possible that this site permits the co-operative binding of calnexin, which has similar lectin specificity to calreticulin. Indeed, the engineering of an Asn176 site into a human class I allele resulted in increased calnexin association (36Zhang Q. Salter R.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 831-837PubMed Google Scholar). However, removal of Asn176 from mouse Ld did not prevent calnexin binding (18Harris M.R. Yu Y.Y. Kindle C.S. Hansen T.H. Solheim J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5404-5409PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for a role for glycans at Asn256 is also rare. H2-Db molecules may require this glycan to permit stable assembly and cell surface expression in the absence of B2m (37Fraser J.D. Allen H. Flavell R.A. Strominger J.L. Immunogenetics. 1987; 26: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There is currently no evidence in the rat that a similar situation may occur for RT1-Aa or any other rat allele. However, our data do indicate that the processing MHC class I glycans received during assembly in the ER and/or transit to the cell surface differs for the α1 and α3 domain glycans, confirming data previously observed that compared the three glycan sites on H-2Dk (38Swiedler S.J. Freed J.H. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4046-4054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference observed in electrophoretic mobility (Figs. 1d and 2d) was also detectable in transient transfections of HeLa cells (not shown) and is, therefore, not a specific effect of expression in C58 thymoma cells. The physical location of the two different glycans may permit easier access to Asn86 compared with Asn256 (the latter being juxtaposed to the cell surface, as is evident from Fig. 1a), with the difference, therefore, representing steric hindrance to the accessibility of glycan-modifying enzymes. The emerging picture of the PLC is that of a complex which has evolved to perform the optimization of peptide cargo, leading to the production of stable cell surface MHC class I molecules. By expressing glycosylation-site mutants of RT1-Aa in the C58 cell line, we have been able to separate the formation of the PLC from its ability to perform peptide optimization. C58 cells express the rat TAPB transporter allele, which is highly inefficient in supplying suitable peptides for the loading and assembly of RT1-Aa. This mismatching of rat TAP allele and rat MHC class I is known as the class I modification (cim) phenomenon and is due to functional polymorphism in rat TAP2 (24Powis S.J. Deverson E.V.

Immunogenetics. 1991; 34: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). TAP complexes which contain the rat TAP2A allele (and are therefore called TAPA) transport a wider range of peptides than TAP2B containing complexes (TAPB complexes) (43Momburg F. Roelse J. Howard J.C. Butcher G.W. Hämmerling G.J. Neefjes J.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) including, crucially, a pool of peptides with arginine at the COOH terminus, which is a preferred anchor residue of RT1-Aa (29Powis S.J.

In the results described here, wild-type RT1-Aa and its N256K mutant formed a PLC, whereas N86K did not. However, even in the presence of the PLC, heat treatment of lysates revealed suboptimal peptide loading, with only partial recovery over time. Full, rapid optimization was only achieved in the additional presence of the TAP2A allele. This is a useful confirmation of the model that optimal stabilization of a class I molecule requires both the correct formation of the PLC and the presence of a suitable pool of peptides for loading. Williams et al. (8Williams A.P. Peh C.A. Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) recently studied the optimization of various HLA class I alleles in .220 and tapasin-restored .220 cells, noting that, for some alleles such as B2705, there may be a route of optimization without the need for TAP interaction. We have been able to address this question directly utilizing the ER competition for TAP association between RT1-Aa and RT1-Au (22Knittler M.R. Gulow K. Seelig A. Howard J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5967-5977PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that loading and rapid optimization of RT1-Au molecules can occur without TAP association. It remains to be determined in more detail what the relative dependence on tapasin may be for both RT1-Aa and -Au alleles. We describe here a useful model system using 293 cells, in which tapasin expression is very low in the absence of IFN-γ stimulation. Such a system may prove useful for rapid screening of mutants for tapasin-dependent expression. However, it is possible that there may be subtle differences in the tapasin-MHC class I interaction between human and rodent. For example, expression of mouse tapasin in .220 cells fails to result in peptide cargo optimization of the tapasin-dependent HLA class I allele B* 4402 (44Tan P. Kropshofer H. Mandelboim O. Bulbuc N. Hämmerling G.J. Momburg F. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Co-expression of rat tapasin with various RT1-A alleles in a suitable host cell line will be required to address this issue fully.

Single amino acid substitutions in the coat protein of P22 cause a temperature-sensitive-folding phenotype (tsf). 1The abbreviations used are: tsf, temperature-sensitive-folding; N, native state; I, intermediate state; U, unfolded state; su, suppressor; CD, circular dichroism; bisANS, 1,1′-bis(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid; WT, wild type. The tsf substitutions cause coat protein to aggregate in vivo when infected cells are grown at high temperature but are able to assemble into phage at low temperature (17Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gordon C.L. King J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 427-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At high temperatures, the folding of the tsf coat proteins is rescued by overproduction of the molecular chaperones GroEL and GroES in vivo, but WT coat protein folds independently of these chaperones (19Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nakonechny W.S. Teschke C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27236-27244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our initial in vitro investigations of WT coat protein and tsf coat proteins determined how the tsf amino acid substitutions affect the folding and assembly of coat protein (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We found that coat protein has two folding domains defined by spectroscopic probes: a domain of secondary structure primarily monitored by circular dichroism (CD) and a hydrophobic domain with a tryptophan pocket, which can be monitored by tryptophan fluorescence. Coat proteins carrying the tsf substitutions A108V, G232D, and F353L all have decreased stability when compared with WT coat protein. In addition, the unfolding kinetics for the tsf coat proteins, monitored by fluorescence of the six tryptophans in coat protein (11Eppler K. Wykoff E. Goates J. Parr R. Casjens S. Virology. 1991; 183: 519-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), are ∼8–14 times faster than the unfolding rate of WT coat protein. The most surprising result came from the kinetic experiments monitored by CD. Both the unfolding and refolding reactions of the tsf coat proteins are too fast to be monitored by manual mixing experiments (with a dead time of ∼5–7 s), whereas WT coat protein had readily observable kinetics for both reactions (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). From our experiments, we concluded that the domain of secondary structure, which is monitored by CD, is “flickering” in and out of its native state and populating an intermediate. It is this flickering that makes the tsf coat proteins more aggregation-prone than WT coat protein and causes the tsf coat proteins to require GroEL and GroES for efficient folding in vivo. Suppressor (su) substitutions were isolated at additional sites in coat protein to identify other amino acids that are important for folding or assembly (23Aramli L.A. Teschke C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22217-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The isolated su substitutions result in a WT phenotype in vivo. Three second site suppressors, D163G, T166I, and F170L, were repeatedly isolated from several different tsf coat protein mutants and are therefore referred to as global suppressors. Surprisingly, when purified tsf:su coat proteins were studied in vitro, we found that they were more aggregation-prone than their tsf parent coat proteins (24Aramli L. Teschke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25372-25377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, with the addition of scaffolding protein, the phage assembly chaperone, to the tsf:su monomers, procapsid assembly can occur. The tsf:su coat proteins showed improved assembly rates and yields compared with the tsf parent coat proteins. From recent experiments, 2K. N. Parent, M. J. Ranaghan, and C. M. Teschke, submitted for publication. we determined that the tsf:su proteins also had enhanced interactions with GroEL and GroES in vivo. Thus, we propose that the global suppressor substitutions rescue coat protein from the non-productive pathway of irreversible aggregation through a two-pronged mechanism in vivo: first through enhanced interactions with GroEL and GroES and second by increasing the rate of assembly of coat protein into a procapsid through interactions with scaffolding protein (24Aramli L. Teschke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25372-25377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Enhanced binding of the tsf:su coat proteins by GroEL and GroES might suggest that folding intermediates are either more populated or less stable. However, increased ability to assemble into procapsids indicates that the native state could be stabilized. Thus, our in vivo results present a puzzle: how can the folding of tsf:su coat proteins require enhanced interactions with GroEL and GroES and still have a stabilized native state for more efficient interactions with scaffolding protein? Here, we examine the folding and stability of the tsf:su coat protein monomers in vitro to understand the molecular basis of the dual suppression mechanism. Using the tsf coat proteins S223F and F353L as well as these proteins with the global suppressor substitution T166I, we monitored changes in the folding rates and stability of the single and double substitution mutants. It appears that the T166I substitution may have differing effects on the stability of coat protein depending on the parent tsf substitution. Nevertheless, the T166I substitution appears to slow the folding and unfolding kinetics of the domain of secondary structure monitored by CD, as well as decreases the unfolding rate of the intermediate. Both changes in kinetics lead to an increased population of intermediate. Our data are consistent with our proposed hypothesis that the kinetic partitioning between aggregation and procapsids is regulated by the su substitutions. Moreover, the tsf and tsf:su substitutions in P22 coat protein highlight how particular amino acids in a protein sequence are crucial to proper folding and assembly. Chemicals, Buffers, and Proteins—Ultrapure urea was purchased from ICN. All other chemicals were reagent grade and purchased from common sources. Purification of tsf and tsf:su coat protein mutants was done as previously described (14Prevelige Jr., P.E. Thomas D. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Teschke C.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Teschke C.M. King J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16595-16601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The final products of purification are empty procapsid shells, which are composed solely of coat protein. All experiments described below were done in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. Unfolded and Refolded Coat Protein Monomers—To obtain unfolded coat protein, empty procapsid shells were incubated in 6.75 m urea for 30 min at room temperature, which dissociates and denatures the subunits to monomers (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol.

Refolded coat protein monomers were formed by first denaturing empty procapsid shells in 6.75 m urea as described above. The unfolded coat protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against phosphate buffer to remove the urea. The refolded coat protein monomers were held on ice until use. Velocity Sedimentation Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The tsf and tsf:su coat protein samples, at about 1.0 mg/ml, prepared by microdialysis as described above, were diluted to 0.2 mg/ml and centrifuged in an AN-50Ti rotor pre-equilibrated at 20 °C. The solvent compartment was loaded with the dialysis buffer. The material was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman XLI AU and monitored with interference optics until sedimentation of the boundary was complete. The analysis was done as previously described (22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using the programs Sednterp (28Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N.

J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Fluorescence and Circular Dichroism Measurements—Fluorescence experiments were done with an SLM Aminco-Bowman 2 spectrofluorometer. The temperature of the cuvette was maintained at 20 °C with a circulating water bath. For equilibrium measurements, the excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emission wavelength was 340 nm, with both band-passes set to 4 nm. For kinetic measurements, an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, emission wavelength of 340 nm, and band-passes of 1 and 8 nm, respectively were used. Circular dichroism (CD) was done with an Applied Photophysics Pi-Star 180 spectropolarimeter with the cuvette maintained at 20 °C with a circulating water bath. The CD signal was monitored at 222 nm with a slit width of 4 nm for equilibrium and kinetic experiments. A 1-cm path-length cell was used for equilibrium titrations and kinetic experiments. Equilibrium measurements in the CD and fluorometer were averaged for 30 s per sample. Unfolding and Refolding to Equilibrium—Samples for urea equilibrium titration curves were made using a Hamilton Microlab 500 titrator as described previously (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Approximately 70 samples were used for each technique to define the equilibrium curves. The equilibrium transitions were monitored by tryptophan fluorescence and CD as described above. Data analysis was done as previously described, using the program Savuka (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), except least-square errors are reported rather than the errors from the robust analysis. The ΔG0(H2O) and the sensitivity of each transition to denaturant, m, were determined by fitting the equilibrium data sets assuming a linear relationship between the free energy of unfolding for each transition and the denaturant (31Finn B.E. Chen X. Jennings P.A. Saal'au-Bethell S.M. Matthews C.R. Rees A.R. Sternberg M.J.E. Wetzel R. Protein Engineering: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 168-189Google Scholar, 32Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1305-1322Crossref Scopus (562) Google Scholar). For the global fit, all of the data from each technique were analyzed simultaneously, and the thermodynamic parameters were obtained as described in Finn et al. (31Finn B.E. Chen X. Jennings P.A. Saal'au-Bethell S.M. Matthews C.R. Rees A.R. Sternberg M.J.E. Wetzel R. Protein Engineering: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 168-189Google Scholar) using the formula, Fsignal=KNI(ZI+KIU)/[1+KNI(1+KIU)](Eq. 1) where KNI = [I]/[N] and KIU = [U]/[I] and ZI = (YI - YN)/(YU - YN). The Z-parameter normalizes the optical properties (Y) of the intermediate to that of the native and unfolded states. The Y values were treated as local parameters, whereas the ΔG0(H2O), and the m values were globally fit. The Z value was allowed to vary between the fluorescence curve and the CD curve, so that two Z values were determined for each fit. A Z value of 0 means the intermediate has native-like spectroscopic properties, and a Z value of 1 means the intermediate is like the unfolded state. Initial fitting estimates of the native and unfolded baseline slopes for the tsf mutants were based on the slopes from the fit of the equilibrium data for WT coat protein (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The native baseline slopes for the equilibrium curves monitored by CD for each tsf:su coat protein and their tsf parent were set to be similar. The fraction of each species at different urea concentrations was calculated using the equilibrium parameters for each transition from the three-state fit, again using the program Savuka (33Zitzewitz J.A. Bilsel O. Luo J. Jones B.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12812-12819Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 34Bilsel O. Zitzewitz J.A. Bowers K.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). bisANS Binding Assay—bisANS binding to WT and tsf coat proteins was determined using a double titration method with the excitation wavelength set at 400 nm and the emission wavelength at 490 nm (35Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 36Secnik J. Gelfand C.A. Jentoft J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2982-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In one titration the bisANS concentration is fixed and the concentration of coat protein is varied. The y-intercept of a plot of 1/F versus 1/[coat] is 1/Fmax, where Fmax is the maximum fluorescence intensity. Fmax/[bisANS] is the maximum fluorescence units/μm bisANS bound to coat protein. In the second titration, the coat protein concentration was held at 0.5 μm, and the bisANS concentration varied from 0.5 to 50 μm. The fluorescence of both background and sample was corrected for the inner filter effect, which becomes substantial at high [bisANS], as described by Lakowicz (37Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 52-54Google Scholar). The fluorescence values were converted into μm bisANS bound/μm coat protein. A plot of μm bisANS bound/μm coat protein versus free [bisANS] was analyzed with KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) using the formula y = n[bisANS]/(Kd + [bisANS]), where n is the number of sites and Kd is the dissociation constant (35Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The bisANS binding isotherm of WT coat protein, and for one of the tsf:su coat proteins, showed positive cooperativity, and therefore was analyzed with the Hill equation, log F/Fmax = n log[bisANS] - log Kd (38Freidfelder D. Physical Biochemistry: Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1982: 662-664Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Kinetics of Unfolding and Refolding—Unfolding experiments were done with coat protein monomers prepared as described above at a final protein concentration of 0.4 μm. To initiate an unfolding reaction, the tsf coat protein monomers were diluted 1:50 with buffered urea. Refolding experiments were done with coat protein that had been denatured in 6.75 m urea. To initiate refolding, unfolded coat protein was diluted 1:100 with buffered urea solutions (0.4 μm final protein concentration). The constantly stirred reactions were monitored by fluorescence. The final urea concentration was determined by measuring the refractive index. Kinetic experiments monitored by CD at 222 nm were done as described above, but with a final protein concentration of 2 μm monomer. The kinetic traces were fit with two exponentials as described previously to obtain a relaxation time for each experiment (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The log of the relaxation times from the kinetic experiments was plotted in a chevron plot against the urea concentration. The urea dependence of the slow refolding and unfolding relaxation times, when monitored by tryptophan fluorescence, was fit with an equation for a two-state system modified from Ghaemmaghami et al. (39Ghaemmaghami S. Word J.M. Burton R.E. Richardson J.S. Oas T.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9179-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), as previously described (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). From this analysis, the τf and τu (1/kf° and 1/ku°, respectively), which are the folding and unfolding relaxation times in the absence of urea; the meq and α are determined. The meq = RT(mu‡ - mf‡), where mu‡ and mf‡ are the slopes of the unfolding or refolding arms of the chevron plot and reflect the sensitivity of each reaction to denaturant. The meq is similar to the m value obtained from equilibrium urea titrations. α = (mu‡/mu‡ - mf‡) and is a measure of how similar the transition state of the reaction is to the native state or the unfolded state. When α is close to 1, the position of the transition state is near the native state, and if α is close to 0, the transition state is near the unfolded state (40Gloss L.M. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15990-15999Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The errors presented are the standard deviation values from the fitting of the equation using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). In an earlier study, we determined that tsf substitutions in coat protein lead to a destabilized native state and a highly populated intermediate state (22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This destabilization is caused by a rapid flickering between the native and unfolded states of a domain of secondary structure of coat protein, as well as an increased rate of unfolding of a hydrophobic tryptophan pocket. Here, we determine how the su substitutions modify the folding of the original tsf substitution. We have chosen S223F and S223F:T166I as well as F353L and F353L: T166I coat proteins for this study. In our previous experiments we used the T166I substitution, because it was the most frequently isolated global suppressor (24Aramli L. Teschke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25372-25377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, S223F and F353L were the parents that most often isolated the global suppressors. tsf Parent and Suppressor Coat Proteins Fold into Monomers—We previously reported that WT coat protein and tsf coat proteins with single amino acid substitutions are monomeric when refolded from denaturant. Under identical conditions (22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we studied the oligomeric state of S223F:T166I and F353L:T166I substitution mutants, as well as their parent tsf coat proteins using velocity sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation. The velocity sedimentation data were analyzed using the program Sedfit (30Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Using the c(s) method for sedimentation analysis, the s20,w values for S223F, S223F:T166I, and F353L:T166I coat proteins were determined to be 3.6, 3.2, and 3.6, respectively. The previously published values for WT, A108V, G232D, and F353L coat proteins are 3.4, 3.3, 3.3, and 3.6, respectively (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These values are consistent for proteins with a molecular mass of 47 kDa and varying asymmetries. Additionally, the percentage of higher molecular weight species was between 4 and 19%, which is similar to that observed for WT coat protein and the previously studied tsf coat proteins. From these results, we can conclude that the tsf:su coat proteins fold into monomers, as do the WT and tsf coat proteins. The Stability of the tsf:su Proteins—The thermodynamics of folding for WT coat protein, as well as coat proteins with tsf amino acid substitutions have been previously studied (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For both WT coat protein and the tsf coat proteins, the equilibrium folding data were fit to a three-state model (N ⇔ I ⇔ U) (21Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2003; 313: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Zhu D. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M. J. Mol.

In these experiments, we found that the tsf coat proteins are less stable than WT coat protein, especially in the N ⇔ I transition. Equilibrium urea titrations were done to determine the stability of the tsf:su coat proteins. The equilibrium transition"
https://openalex.org/W1866226773,"Although they were probably already used in ancient Mesopotamia, catapults became increasingly common in the Mediterranean area from the 4th century B.C. Their design was improved over time through a combination of trial-and-error and geometrical procedures. By the 1st century A.D., it was possible to compile accurate tables of specifications for catapults of different size, and to build engines capable of hurling heavy projectiles at a distance of more than a hundred meters. In her essay, [Cuomo][1] asks who the men behind these machines were. What motivated the ancient military engineers, and how did they relate to their artifacts? And who did they work for? The author shows that ancient catapults provide unique insights into the interface of science and war, theory and practice, politics and knowledge.
