To address this, we have created a transparent adult zebrafish in which we transplanted either hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells or tumor cells. In a hematopoiesis radiation recovery assay, transplantation of GFP-labeled marrow cells allowed for striking in vivo visual assessment of engraftment from 2 hr–5 weeks posttransplant. Using FACS analysis, both transparent and wild-type fish had equal engraftment, but this could only be visualized in the transparent recipient. In a tumor engraftment model, transplantation of RAS-melanoma cells allowed for visualization of tumor engraftment, proliferation, and distant metastases in as little as 5 days, which is not seen in wild-type recipients until 3 to 4 weeks. This transparent adult zebrafish serves as the ideal combination of both sensitivity and resolution for in vivo stem cell analyses.

This transparent adult zebrafish serves as the ideal combination of both sensitivity and resolution for in vivo stem cell analyses. Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells into immunosuppressed recipients has been used over the past three decades as a treatment for diseases such as leukemia (Machida et al., 1999Machida U. Kami M. Hirai H. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for acute leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 810PubMed Google Scholar). In animal models, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) activity of a given population is assessed by analyzing multilineage engraftment of bone marrow or peripheral blood of recipient animals (Uchida et al., 1994Uchida N. Aguila H.L. Fleming W.H. Jerabek L. Weissman I.L. Rapid and sustained hematopoietic recovery in lethally irradiated mice transplanted with purified Thy-1.1lo Lin-Sca-1+ hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 1994; 83: 3758-3779PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, tumor stem cells have been shown to exist for breast cancer (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (7906) Google Scholar) and medulloblastoma (Singh et al., 2004Singh S.K. Hawkins C. Clarke I.D. Squire J.A. Bayani J. Hide T. Henkelman R.M. Cusimano M.D. Dirks P.B. Identification of human brain tumour initiating cells.Nature. 2004; 432: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (5696) Google Scholar). These rare cells, which are thought to form the seed from which all other tumor cells arise, have been isolated by selecting for cells (i.e., CD133+) that can be repeatedly propagated in serial transplantation studies (Piccirillo et al., 2006Piccirillo S.G. Reynolds B.A. Zanetti N. Lamorte G. Binda E. Broggi G. Brem H. Olivi A. Dimeco F. Vescovi A.L. Bone morphogenetic proteins inhibit the tumorigenic potential of human brain tumour-initiating cells.Nature. 2006; 444: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). It is evident that tumor cells undergo a homing process after transplantation (Ninomiya et al., 2007Ninomiya M. Abe A. Katsumi A. Xu J. Ito M. Arai F. Suda T. Ito M. Kiyoi H. Kinoshita T. Naoe T. Homing, proliferation and survival sites of human leukemia cells in vivo in immunodeficient mice.Leukemia. 2007; 21: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which is particularly dependent upon the site of transplantation. Transplantation of cancer cells, either purified or not, has long been utilized as an assay for demonstrating metastatic capacity (Gupta et al., 2005Gupta P.B. Kuperwasser C. Brunet J.P. Ramaswamy S.

Both HSPCs and tumor cells home to similar sites within the bone marrow vascular compartment of mice, an interaction that is critically dependent upon the SDF1-CXCR4 pathway (Sipkins et al., 2005Sipkins D.A. Wei X. Wu J.W. Runnels J.M. Cote D. Means T.K. Luster A.D. Scadden D.T. Lin C.P. In vivo imaging of specialized bone marrow endothelial microdomains for tumour engraftment.Nature. 2005; 435: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Prior work from our laboratory has demonstrated that the zebrafish is a useful model for understanding the genetics of both HSPC (Burns et al., 2005Burns C.E. Traver D. Mayhall E. Shepard J.L.

Effects of lethal irradiation in zebrafish and rescue by hematopoietic cell transplantation.Blood. 2004; 104: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and tumor stem cell biology (Langenau et al., 2007Langenau D.M. Keefe M.D. Storer N.Y. Guyon J.R. Kutok J.L. Le X. Goessling W. Neuberg D.S. Kunkel L.M. Zon L.I. Effects of RAS on the genesis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.Genes Dev. 2007; 11: 1382-1395Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As in murine and human systems, however, the in vivo spatial resolution of the adult animal is limited due to the normal opacification of skin and subdermal structures. Current in vivo imaging techniques, such as bioluminescence, PET, CT, or MRI, each have specific disadvantages in terms of resolution, sensitivity, or the need for costly equipment. Because the in vivo behavior of stem cell populations is considerably more complex than in vitro models can offer, we now describe a transparent adult zebrafish model in which the dynamics and spatial characteristics of stem cell transplantation can be fully characterized at the single cell level in an intact in vivo vertebrate system that is amenable to genetic manipulation. The characteristic adult pigmentation pattern of the zebrafish consists of three distinct classes of pigment cells arranged in stripes (Figure 1A): black melanophores, reflective iridophores, and yellow xanthophores (Rawls et al., 2001Rawls J.F. Mellgren E.M. Johnson S.L. How the zebrafish gets its stripes.Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The nacre mutant (Figure 1B) has a complete lack of melanocytes due to a mutation in the gene encoding the mitfa gene. (Lister et al., 1999Lister J.A. Robertson C.P. Lepage T. Johnson S.L. Raible D.W. Nacre Encodes a Zebrafish Microphthalmia-Related Protein that Regulates Neural-Crest-Derived Pigment Cell Fate.Development. 1999; 126: 3757-3767PubMed Google Scholar). The roy orbison (roy) zebrafish (Figure 1C) is a spontaneous mutant and has a complete lack of iridophores, uniformly pigmented eyes, sparse melanocytes, and a translucency of the skin. The gene responsible for this mutant phenotype is currently unknown. Fish that are doubly mutant for nacre and roy are shown in Figure 1D. This line, which we have named casper for its ghost like appearance, demonstrates a complete lack of all melanocytes and iridophores in both embryogenesis and adulthood. Most strikingly, the body of the fish is almost entirely transparent. In female adults, individual eggs are easily observable, as seen in Figure 1D. We compared the optical transparency of the casper line to several commonly used zebrafish pigmentation mutants, including golden, albino, rose, and panther. Organs that can be seen using standard stereomicroscopy in casper include the heart, intestinal tube, liver, and gallbladder. Brain tissue is visible to a small extent. None of these organs are easily visible in any of the other pigment mutants studied (see Figure S1 available online) other than the heart and intestinal tube in rose. Examination of the cardiac region of the casper mutant (Movie S1) shows that ventricular contraction can be observed, making this mutant useful for in vivo analysis of genetic perturbations in cardiac function. The casper mutant is entirely viable, with incrossed adults producing large numbers of viable offspring at expected mendelian ratios and no heterozygous phenotype. Casper fish were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, as well as Masson's trichrome to identify collagenous fibers. The gross morphology of the casper eye is normal, with maintenance of the scleral-corneal border and normal pigmented retinal epithelial cells. However, there is a complete absence of the scleral iridophore layer (Figure 2A, arrow), which is demonstrated by the loss of refractive crystalline plates (Clothier and Lythgoe, 1987Clothier J. Lythgoe J.N. Light-induced colour changes by the iridophores of the Neon tetra, Paracheirodon innesi.J. Cell Sci. 1987; 88: 663-668PubMed Google Scholar) referred to as schemochromes. In wild-type animals, the pigmented retinal epithelium is normally obscured by the reflective iridophores; their absence in roy mutants exposes the black cells across the entire surface of the eye. The iridophores of the skin are a dermal-hypodermal structure which are normally intimately connected to the surrounding xanthophores and lie just above the trunk skeletal muscle (Le Guellec et al., 2004Le Guellec D. Morvan-Dubois G. Sire J.Y. Skin development in bony fish with particular emphasis on collagen deposition in the dermis of the zebrafish (Danio rerio).Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). While wild-type fish (Figure 2B, arrow) show a substantial layer of these reflective cells, the casper mutant has a complete absence of this layer, while the remaining skin structures are relatively intact, including epidermal scales and dermal collagen fibers as demonstrated by Masson's trichrome stain (data not shown). These data suggest that the relative transparency of the casper mutant is due to a combination of melanocyte loss (which normally absorbs incident light and protects subdermal structures) and iridophore loss (which normally reflect incident light away from the internal organs). Prior work from our laboratory has demonstrated that the transplantable hematopoietic stem/progenitor (HSPC) marrow population resides within the adult kidney, and can be isolated using flow cytometric analysis of forward and side scatter (Traver et al., 2003Traver D. Paw B.H. Poss K.D. Penberthy W.T. Lin S. Zon L.I. Transplantation and in vivo imaging of multilineage engraftment in zebrafish bloodless mutants.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). We isolated whole kidney marrow from beta-actin:GFP transgenic fish (which labels all cell types except red blood cells) and performed intracardiac (ventricular) transplantation of 100,000 whole kidney marrow cells along with 200,000 carrier red blood cells into a recipient casper mutant that had previously been irradiated with 25 Gy. At 4 hr posttransplant, a pool of blood surrounds the cardiac chambers, which likely represents extravasated blood in the pericardial sac. Within 2 weeks (Figure 3A, left), a GFP-labeled population of cells is seen within the region of the zebrafish kidney as well as in the gill vasculature. By 4 weeks, a significant increase in the size and distribution of this GFP-labeled population can be easily visualized and is now largely confined to the anatomical area of the kidney of the fish (Figure 3B, right). For comparison, a wild-type fish transplanted in an identical manner is shown, demonstrating that essentially no GFP can normally be seen in an opaque adult. These data suggest that the transparent casper mutant allows for ready visualization of hematopoietic progenitor engraftment after a sublethal dose of 25 Gy, consistent with short-term hematopoietic engraftment. The kidneys were dissected from the 4 week posttransplant fish (both casper and wild-type) and analyzed for their forward/side scatter profile as well as GFP. Although no GFP can be visualized with a fluorescent stereoscope in the wild-type, a normal distribution of hematopoietic cells is seen at 4 weeks posttransplant, and many of these cells are GFP positive (Figure 3B, top). Based on the scatter profile, multilineage engraftment has occurred, which indicates that the engrafted cells represent a primitive hematopoietic population. The kidney from the casper mutant shows a similar reconstitution of hematopoietic lineages which are also GFP positive to the same degree (Figure 3B, bottom). These data demonstrate that the anatomic localization of GFP-positive cells in the casper mutant is indeed indicative of marrow reconstitution. Recipient fish at 4 weeks posttransplant were fixed and processed for H&E and anti-GFP IHC. Kidney sections show large numbers of hematopoietic cells (H) surrounding the tubules (T) and glomeruli (G) of the kidney (Figure 3C, left), consistent with previous observations (Traver et al., 2004bTraver D. Winzeler A. Stern H.M. Mayhall E.A. Langenau D.M. Kutok J.L. Look A.T. Zon L.I. Effects of lethal irradiation in zebrafish and rescue by hematopoietic cell transplantation.Blood. 2004; 104: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). All of the hematopoietic cells are strongly GFP-positive by IHC (Figure 3C, right, brown staining), whereas none of the kidney tubule cells stain for GFP. This confirms the proper homing of the GFP-labeled marrow cells back to the kidney marrow of the recipient casper fish. Because one of the major advantages of an optically clear adult animal is the ability to achieve single-cell resolution in a live animal, we next used confocal microscopy on adult zebrafish that had been transplanted with beta-actin GFP HSPCs 4 weeks earlier. Imaging of a transplanted wild-type recipient yielded no discernable GFP signal due to the opacity of the normal skin. In contrast, the casper mutant allowed for identification of cells both singly and in clusters (Figure 3D) at a resolution of approximately 5 μm. The maximal depth of field achieved with a Zeiss confocal microscope was 88 μm from the surface of the skin. To ensure that the casper mutant will be generally applicable to stem cell biologists, we measured survival after HSPC transplant in wild-type and casper recipients. As shown in Figure 3E, although both groups show an initial procedural mortality, there is no significant difference in survival between the groups, indicating that casper will function similarly to wild-type animals in transplant studies. We next assessed whether the transparent casper zebrafish could be used to analyze in vivo tumor engraftment and migration after transplantation. Stable transgenic zebrafish carrying either the mutated human B-raf or N-ras-GFP fusion oncogene under the control of the melanocyte specific mitf promoter were crossed to p53−/− fish. These fish reliably develop highly aggressive melanoma in 4–12 months. A tumor from an adult fish was disaggregated into a single cell suspension, and 200,000 cells were transplanted either into the ventral peritoneum (IP) or via intraventricular (IC) injection into an irradiated casper recipient. Within 5 days post-IP transplantation of the NRAS-GFP melanoma (Figure 4A, top), a large mass of deeply pigmented tumor cells could be visualized within the peritoneum. In addition, a small number of cells have localized to the dorsal epidermal scales (Figure 4A, top, circled). The pattern of engraftment at 5 days in the intracardiac recipients of NRAS-GFP cells (Figure 4A, bottom) largely reflects local deposition of tumor cells along the transplantation tract, although some cells can be seen migrating dorsally. The inset of Figure 4A (bottom) demonstrates that the tumor cells (taken at 10 days posttransplant) continue to be strongly GFP positive and indicates that they could be localized even in the absence of black pigmentation. In Figure 4B, a large mass is seen 14 days after IP transplantation of 200,000 BRAF;p53 melanoma. Mediolateral and ventral views of this tumor allow for three-dimensional calculation of tumor volume (in this case 1496 mm3). The ability to calculate 3D tumor volume and whole body distribution of tumor cells provides an important quantitative analysis of engraftment after small numbers of tumor cells and offers the potential for monitoring in vivo effects of therapeutically useful molecules. We repeatedly imaged a single recipient fish over a period of 4 weeks using standard stereomicroscopy in order to quantify tumor growth over time. As shown in Figure 4C, this individual fish is fully viable over this period of time, and the tumor volume can be assessed at each time point without sacrificing the animal. Because nonmelanized but fluorescently labeled tumor cells can be visualized in the same manner, this tumor transplant model should be amenable to virtually any transplantable tumor. Finally, to explore the utility of casper as a tool in understanding metastatic progression, we examined each fish that had been transplanted with BRAF;p53 melanoma cells for evidence of tumor dissemination. Between 5 and 28 days posttransplant, 9/24 (37.5%) of all transplant recipients had evidence of distant metastasis, with the peak of initial dissemination occurring between 5 and 10 days. In Figure 4D, two representative fish are shown, with the initial site of implantation demonstrated by the arrow. In the left-hand figure, very widespread dissemination is seen throughout the animal, both as single cells as well as in clusters of cells. In the right-hand figure, a small cluster of individual cells (see inset) have disseminated far away from the implantation site and have become embedded in the dorsal skin. At least one of these cells has the stellate appearance of a migratory melanoma cell. Because there are no pigmented cells between the primary mass and this single dorsal cell, this supports the concept that these cells represent dissemination from the primary transplant. In a similarly transplanted wild-type fish, no visible tumors are seen until 2 to 3 weeks posttransplant, and metastatic cells are not detectable. Although the mechanism of such early and widespread dissemination is unclear at this point, it may represent the accumulation of complex genetic changes in the BRAF;p53 donor cells, since the donor tumors had been present for well over a month. In the future, we plan on studying the factors that determine the capacity for transplanted cells to undergo early dissemination, as well as the mechanism of the “switch” between disseminated micrometastatic disease and bulk macrometastases. The data presented here demonstrate that the optical properties of the casper fish offers a unique combination of high resolution (∼5 μm), sensitivity, and amenability to deep tissue imaging with commonly available laboratory equipment. Although similar to the “see through” medaka strain (Wakamatsu et al., 2001Wakamatsu Y. Pristyazhnyuk S. Kinoshita M. Tanaka M. Ozato K. The see-through medaka: a fish model that is transparent throughout life.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 10046-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the zebrafish has become a more commonly utilized tool for studying stem cell and tumor biology and should be broadly applicable to stem cell researchers. One limitation of this line is that it requires that both mutations (nacre and roy) be present in the homozygous state, which will require at least two breeding cycles to take advantage of currently available transgenic lines. In addition, because the mutation in roy is currently unknown (but under active investigation), it is possible that this gene defect may affect some unknown aspects of tumor or stem cell biology, although it clearly does not affect survival. Identification of the roy defect will help clarify this point. Finally, imaging of very deep tissues may require multiphoton microscopy, which is currently experimental in the zebrafish system. In vivo imaging is a critical counterpart to studying molecular processes in cell culture systems (Koo et al., 2006Koo V. Hamilton P.W. Williamson K. Non-invasive in vivo imaging in small animal research.Cell. Oncol. 2006; 28: 127-139PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of all imaging techniques is to combine resolution (i.e., single or subcellular) with sensitivity (whole-animal or organ) to gain a comprehensive understanding of processes that have unique in vivo behavior, such as tumor metastasis and stem cell homing. Current in vivo imaging of small animals consists of several techniques, summarized in Table S1, that are often used in complement. Bioluminescence has been utilized to detect engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution after transplantation of luciferase-positive HSC populations (Welsh and Kay, 2005Welsh D.K. Kay S.A. Bioluminescence imaging in living organisms.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2005; 16: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, Cao et al., 2006Cao F. Lin S. Xie X. Ray P. Patel M. Zhang X. Drukker M. Dylla S.J. Connolly A.J. Chen X. et al.In vivo visualization of embryonic stem cell survival, proliferation, and migration after cardiac delivery.Circulation. 2006; 113: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Although bioluminescence had high sensitivity in this study, it had limited spatial resolution (on the order of 1–10 mm), required several minutes of imaging per animal, showed detection of light from deep tissues is limited, and requires intravenous administration of substrate. Whole animal imaging using bioluminescent marking of transplanted tumor cells has the capacity to give broad pictures of tumor metastasis using cells such as uveal melanoma (Notting et al., 2005Notting I.C. Buijs J.T. Que I. Mintardjo R.E. van der Horst G. Karperien M. Missotten G.S. Jager M.J. Schalij-Delfos N.E. Keunen J.E. van der Pluijm G. Whole-body bioluminescent imaging of human uveal melanoma in a new mouse model of local tumor growth and metastasis.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 1581-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or lung cancers (Zacharakis et al., 2005Zacharakis G. Kambara H. Shih H. Ripoll J. Grimm J. Saeki Y. Weissleder R. Ntziachristos V. Volumetric tomography of fluorescent proteins through small animals in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 18252-18257Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but the sensitivity of this technique is somewhat limited in metastasis since bioluminescent evidence of metastatic spread can take 4 weeks or more to detect. Our ability to detect clearly evident metastases in as few as 3–5 days is unique among vertebrate models, and the resolution is such that single metastatic cells can be easily visualized using standard stereomicroscopes. In addition, bioluminescence has met with only limited success in the zebrafish system (Creton et al., 1997Creton R. Steele M.E. Jaffe L.F. Expression of apo-aequorin during embryonic development; how much is needed for calcium imaging?.Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, Kaneko and Cahill, 2005Kaneko M.

Light-dependent development of circadian gene expression in transgenic zebrafish.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e34https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030034Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fluorescent imaging is widely available and is a standard method of analysis of gene function in zebrafish embryos; image acquisition is rapid, but is of limited use in adult wild-type zebrafish. Our data indicate that the useful range of the stereomicroscope can be considerably extended to the adult fish, in both the visible and fluorescent ranges, due to the optical clarity of our model. When combined with confocal microscopy, single cell resolution is easily achievable, and the use of dual-photon confocal microscopy is likely to yield much greater depth of image resolution in the casper line. Crossing the casper line to the numerous transgenic lines that label vasculature (i.e., fli-GFP, shown in Figure S2) or internal organs with fluorescent tags (i.e., pdx-GFP for pancreas, LFABP-GFP for liver) may be of considerable use to those interested in in vivo analysis of angiogenesis, organ homeostasis and regeneration after injury. However, direct injection of transgenic constructs in the casper background may be advantageous since it eliminates the need for complex breeding strategies to maintain double homozygosity of roy and nacre. Although microCT, MRI, and PET scans each have considerable advantages in terms of whole-body imaging, they all require highly specialized equipment, significant optimization, and intravenous contrast agents. MRI is a useful technique for visualizing transplanted cells in vivo and has a spatial resolution of 25–50 μm but requires a significant amount of magnetic dye treatment of transplanted cells, has limited sensitivity, and requires considerably complex and expensive equipment (Lee et al., 2007Lee J.H. Huh Y.M. Jun Y.W. Seo J.W. Jang J.T. Song H.T. Kim S. Cho E.J. Yoon H.G. Suh J.S. Cheon J. Artificially engineered magnetic nanoparticles for ultra-sensitive molecular imaging.Nat.

Pathol. 2005; 205: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). PET imaging, which can detect relatively small numbers of tumor cells, requires radioactive labeling of cell populations, is only moderately sensitive, and necessitates small animal PET scanners, which are not broadly available (Beckmann et al., 2007Beckmann N. Kneuer R. Gremlich H.U. Karmouty-Quintana H. Ble F.X. Muller M.

Chow P.L. Laforest R. Performance evaluation of the microPET focus: a third-generation microPET scanner dedicated to animal imaging.J. Nucl. Med. 2005; 46: 455-463PubMed Google Scholar). Another concern is the dose of radiation in both CT and PET that would need to be delivered to the fish to achieve adequate resolution, which may have independent biological effects (Paulus et al., 2000Paulus M.J. Gleason S.S. Kennel S.J. Hunsicker P.R. Johnson D.K.

USA. 2005; 102: 3419-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although each of these techniques will likely have a future role in zebrafish imaging, none currently offers the rapidity, cellular resolution, and sensitivity that fluorescent microscopy offers that is achievable in the casper zebrafish. The development of a robust, fertile, and easily maintained transparent adult zebrafish provides an important adult complement to the studies that are achievable in the transparent zebrafish embryo. Our data suggests that the casper fish will serve as a useful platform for researchers interested in processes such as stem cell engraftment and homing. For cancer biologists, it opens a window onto longitudinal analysis of tumor growth, invasion, metastases and angiogenesis at an anatomic resolution not readily achievable in murine or other systems. When combined with transgenic lines that label structures such as the vasculature (i.e., fli-GFP) or epithelium (i.e., keratin-GFP), a detailed understanding of the manner in which individual stem cells interact with their endogenous niche can be analyzed. Because the adult zebrafish is well suited to genetic and small molecule based screens, the casper fish will allow for detailed in vivo study of stem and cancer biology in a vertebrate organism with great relevance to human biology. Zebrafish were bred and maintained in the Karp fish facility, in temperature (28° C), pH (7.4), and salinity-controlled conditions. All fish were maintained in a 14 hr on/10 hr off light cycle. Lines used in these studies included wild-type (AB), tg(beta-actin:GFP) kindly provided by Ken Poss, roy orbison (provided by the Dowling lab at Harvard), panther/rose (provided by the Parichy laboratory at University of Washington), nacre (provider by the Lister lab at Virginia Commonwealth University). The p53, golden, and albino lines are maintained in our laboratory, as previously described. The tg(mitf:NRAS-GFP) line was developed by Michael Dovey in the Zon laboratory (manuscript in preparation). The tg(mitf:BRAF) line was described previously. Adult animals were anesthetized with 0.2% Tricaine in E3 fish water. After mounting on a fixed plastic or agarose plate, whole animal images were taken with a Nikon D200 digital camera using an adjustable flash system. For fluorescent and magnification views, a Zeiss Discovery V8 stereomicroscope with a 1.2× PlanApo lens and GFP/RFP filters was used. Images were captured using Zeiss proprietary software and analyzed using ImageJ. Transplant recipient zebrafish were embedded in 1% low-melting-point agarose containing 0.04 mg/ml Tricaine-S in glass-bottom culture dishes. Confocal microscopy was performed for GFP-positive cells using a Zeiss LSM Meta confocal microscope. Adult fish were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. After processing and paraffin embedding, 5 μm sections were cut in either longitudinal or transverse sections. Staining was done with either hematoxylin and eosin or Masson's trichrome for collagen analysis. For immunohistochemistry, sections were counterstained with eosin and stained using an anti-GFP antibody (Upstate, catalog no. 06-896). Hematopoietic transplantation was done as previously described, with the following modifications: whole kidneys from beta actin:GFP donor fish were dissected using forceps and placed in 0.9× PBS/5% FCS. Manual disaggregation using a P1000 pipette resulted in single cell suspensions. Cells were filtered over a 40 μm nylon mesh filter, and resuspended in PBS/FCS to give a final concentration of 100,000 cells/μl. Recipient fish were irradiated with 25 Gy of gamma irradiation 2 days prior to transplantation and allowed to recover in standard fish water. On the day of transplant, recipients were anesthetized in 0.2% Tricaine. Using a Hamilton syringe, 5 μl of cell suspension was transplanted into the cardiac chamber, and the fish immediately returned to fresh fish water. Recipients were kept off of system water (to minimize infectious risk) for 1 week and fed standard flake/brine shrimp meals. At 4 weeks posttransplant, recipient fish were sacrificed with an overdose of tricaine and kidney marrow cells isolated as above. FACS sorting of single cells were analyzed for forward/side scatter profiles as well as GFP fluorescence. FACS data were analyzed using FloJo software. A single melanoma from a stable tg(mitf:NRAS-GFP);p53−/− or tg(mitf:BRAF);p53−/− adult was dissected from from skin and underlying connective tissue and placed in a dish with 100 μl of 0.9× PBS/0.1 mg/ml Liberase. The tumor was minced and manually disaggregated with razor blades, with additional Liberase solution applied as needed to maintain hydration. After 1 hr of digestion, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5% FCS. The cell suspension was filtered as above and resuspended to a final concentration of 50,000 cells/μl. Cells were transplanted into previously irradiated recipients, as above, using 5 μl into either the peritoneal cavity or via intracardiac injection.

https://openalex.org/W2095417588,"Ectopic expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 in fibroblasts generates induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Little is known about the nature and sequence of molecular events accompanying nuclear reprogramming. Using doxycycline-inducible vectors, we have shown that exogenous factors are required for about 10 days, after which cells enter a self-sustaining pluripotent state. We have identified markers that define cell populations prior to and during this transition period. While downregulation of Thy1 and subsequent upregulation of SSEA-1 occur at early time points, reactivation of endogenous Oct4, Sox2, telomerase, and the silent X chromosome mark late events in the reprogramming process. Cell sorting with these markers allows for a significant enrichment of cells with the potential to become iPS cells. Our results suggest that factor-induced reprogramming is a gradual process with defined intermediate cell populations that contain the majority of cells poised to become iPS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2018091219,"Understanding the mechanisms of nephron repair is critical for the design of new therapeutic approaches to treat kidney disease. The kidney can repair after even a severe insult, but whether adult stem or progenitor cells contribute to epithelial renewal after injury and the cellular origin of regenerating cells remain controversial. Using genetic fate-mapping techniques, we generated transgenic mice in which 94%-95% of tubular epithelial cells, but no interstitial cells, were labeled with either beta-galactosidase (lacZ) or red fluorescent protein (RFP). Two days after ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), 50.5% of outer medullary epithelial cells coexpress Ki67 and RFP, indicating that differentiated epithelial cells that survived injury undergo proliferative expansion. After repair was complete, 66.9% of epithelial cells had incorporated BrdU, compared to only 3.5% of cells in the uninjured kidney. Despite this extensive cell proliferation, no dilution of either cell-fate marker was observed after repair. These results indicate that regeneration by surviving tubular epithelial cells is the predominant mechanism of repair after ischemic tubular injury in the adult mammalian kidney."

https://openalex.org/W2115094273,"Cell fate decisions of pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells are dictated by activation and repression of lineage-specific genes. Numerous signaling and transcriptional networks progressively narrow and specify the potential of ES cells. Whether specific microRNAs help refine and limit gene expression and, thereby, could be used to manipulate ES cell differentiation has largely been unexplored. Here, we show that two serum response factor (SRF)-dependent muscle-specific microRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, promote mesoderm formation from ES cells but have opposing functions during further differentiation into cardiac muscle progenitors. Furthermore, miR-1 and miR-133 were potent repressors of nonmuscle gene expression and cell fate during mouse and human ES cell differentiation. miR-1's effects were in part mediated by translational repression of the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll-1). Our findings indicate that muscle-specific miRNAs reinforce the silencing of nonmuscle genes during cell lineage commitment and suggest that miRNAs may have general utility in regulating cell-fate decisions from pluripotent ES cells."

In phase 2, we genotyped the 15,008 highest-ranked SNPs in 2,057 Scottish cases and 2,111 controls. We then genotyped the five highest-ranked SNPs from the joint phase 1 and 2 analysis in 14,500 cases and 13,294 controls from seven populations, and identified a previously unreported association, rs3802842 on 11q23 (OR = 1.1; P = 5.8 × 10−10), showing population differences in risk. We also replicated and fine-mapped associations at 8q24 (rs7014346; OR = 1.19; P = 8.6 × 10−26) and 18q21 (rs4939827; OR = 1.2; P = 7.8 × 10−28). Risk was greater for rectal than for colon cancer for rs3802842 (P < 0.008) and rs4939827 (P < 0.009). Carrying all six possible risk alleles yielded OR = 2.6 (95% CI = 1.75–3.89) for CRC.

https://openalex.org/W2037262941,"Wingless (Wnt) is a potent morphogen demonstrated in multiple cell lineages to promote the expansion and maintenance of stem and progenitor cell populations. Wnt effects are highly context dependent, and varying effects of Wnt signaling on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been reported. We explored the impact of Wnt signaling in vivo, specifically in the context of the HSC niche by using an osteoblast-specific promoter driving expression of the paninhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, Dickkopf1 (Dkk1). Here we report that Wnt signaling was markedly inhibited in HSCs and, unexpectedly given prior reports, reduction in HSC Wnt signaling resulted in reduced p21Cip1 expression, increased cell cycling, and a progressive decline in regenerative function after transplantation. This effect was microenvironment determined, but irreversible if the cells were transferred to a normal host. Wnt pathway activation in the niche is required to limit HSC proliferation and preserve the reconstituting function of endogenous hematopoietic stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2018492629,"Nuclear tumor suppressor p53 transactivates proapoptotic genes or antioxidant genes depending on stress severity, while cytoplasmic p53 induces mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis without gene transactivation. Although SIRT1, a p53 deacetylase, inhibits p53-mediated transactivation, how SIRT1 regulates these p53 multifunctions is unclear. Here we show that SIRT1 blocks nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic p53 in response to endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggers mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. ROS generated by antioxidant-free culture caused p53 translocation into mitochondria in wild-type mES cells but induced p53 translocation into the nucleus in SIRT1(-/-) mES cells. Endogenous ROS triggered apoptosis of wild-type mES through mitochondrial translocation of p53 and BAX but inhibited Nanog expression of SIRT1(-/-) mES, indicating that SIRT1 makes mES cells sensitive to ROS and inhibits p53-mediated suppression of Nanog expression. Our results suggest that endogenous ROS control is important for mES cell maintenance in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1988697020,"The mouse placenta was unveiled as an important reservoir for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), yet the origin of placental HSCs was unknown. By tracking developing HSCs by expression of Runx1-lacZ and CD41, we have found that HSCs emerge in large vessels in the placenta. Analysis of Ncx1−/− embryos, which lack a heartbeat, verified that HSC development is initiated in the placental vasculature independent of blood flow. However, fewer CD41+ hematopoietic cells were found in Ncx1−/− placentas than in controls, implying that some HSCs/progenitors colonize the placenta via circulation and/or HSC emergence is compromised without blood flow. Importantly, placentas from Ncx1−/− embryos possessed equal potential to generate myelo-erythroid and B and T lymphoid cells upon explant culture, verifying intact multilineage hematopoietic potential, characteristic of developing HSCs. These data suggest that, in addition to providing a niche for a large pool of HSCs prior to liver colonization, the placenta is a true site of HSC generation."
https://openalex.org/W1990412352,"α-Tocopheryl succinate (α-TOS) is a selective inducer of apoptosis in cancer cells, which involves the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The molecular target of α-TOS has not been identified. Here, we show that α-TOS inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity of complex II (CII) by interacting with the proximal and distal ubiquinone (UbQ)-binding site (QP and QD, respectively). This is based on biochemical analyses and molecular modelling, revealing similar or stronger interaction energy of α-TOS compared to that of UbQ for the QP and QD sites, respectively. CybL-mutant cells with dysfunctional CII failed to accumulate ROS and underwent apoptosis in the presence of α-TOS. Similar resistance was observed when CybL was knocked down with siRNA. Reconstitution of functional CII rendered CybL-mutant cells susceptible to α-TOS. We propose that α-TOS displaces UbQ in CII causing electrons generated by SDH to recombine with molecular oxygen to yield ROS. Our data highlight CII, a known tumour suppressor, as a novel target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2011776457,"Targeting TRAIL receptors with either recombinant TRAIL or agonistic DR4- or DR5-specific antibodies has been considered a promising treatment for cancer, particularly due to the preferential apoptotic susceptibility of tumor cells over normal cells to TRAIL.

Our studies suggest that various apoptosis defects that block TRAIL-mediated cell death at different points along the apoptotic signaling pathway shift the signaling cascade from default apoptosis toward cytoprotective autophagy. We also obtained evidence that inhibition of such a TRAIL-mediated autophagic response by specific knockdown of autophagic genes initiates an effective mitochondrial apoptotic response that is caspase-8-dependent.

Our analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in the shift from protective autophagy to apoptosis in response to TRAIL sheds new light on the negative regulation of apoptosis by the autophagic process and by some of its individual components. Accumulating evidence suggests that autophagy functions as an adaptive cell response, allowing the cell to survive bioenergetic stress via a mechanism associated with clearance of damaged organelles and the degradation of mutant or misfolded proteins (1Levine B. Nature. 2007; 446: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Certain therapeutic approaches to cancer, including radiation and cytotoxic drugs that have been known to activate apoptosis, were observed to induce autophagy in certain human cancer cell lines (2Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). The functional relationship between apoptosis and autophagy and the potential cross-regulation between these two processes are complex and remain to be resolved. The complexity stems partly from the findings that in certain cellular scenarios, autophagy constitutes a stress adaptation response that avoids and suppresses cell death, whereas in other cellular settings, autophagy constitutes an alternative pathway to cellular demise that is called autophagic cell death (type II cell death) (3Baehrecke E.H.

In addition, Atg5 and Beclin-1 are required for etoposide- and staurosporin-induced cell death in apoptosis-resistant Bax/Bak double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (7Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that the removal or functional inhibition of proteins essential for the apoptotic machinery can switch a cellular stress response from apoptotic default to massive autophagy (4Levine B.

Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). In this regard, dogma-altering studies were reported by Craig Thompson's group, who discovered that when apoptosis-resistant cells are exposed to stress mediated by the decreased availability of growth factor, the ensuing autophagy actually protects cells from death (8Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Specifically, they demonstrated that immortalized IL-3-dependent cell lines generated from the bone marrow of Bax-/-Bak-/- mice failed to undergo apoptosis upon IL-3 withdrawal and entered a month-long autophagic process that caused a severe reduction in cell size with the removal of most of the cytoplasm. Inhibition of autophagy by the knockdown of atg5 or atg7 or by the addition of 3-methyladenine (3MA; an inhibitor of Class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) or chloroquine (an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification, which is required for the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes) killed Bax-/-Bak-/- cells, indicating that the observed autophagy functions as a survival mechanism. Autophagy in this cellular setting was concluded to be a catabolic process that mobilizes nutrients by macromolecular degradation, thus replenishing the depleted energy reserves of the IL-3-dependent cells and hence preventing a bioenergetic crisis that would otherwise result in an immediate cell death. Induction of apoptosis due to inhibition of autophagy has mainly been reported for starvation experimental models, where autophagy is the immediate response for the recycling of essential metabolites and the fueling of the bioenergetic machinery. Inhibition of autophagy in starving cells results in accelerated apoptotic cell death, characterized by activation of caspases, mitochondrial permeabilization, and chromatin condensation (9Boya P.

The applicable nature of targeting autophagy for anticancer therapeutic benefit has recently been indicated by two studies that employed the pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy, chloroquine and 3MA. Thus, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine was shown to enhance the anticancer activity of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide in a Myc-driven model of lymphoma (11Amaravadi R.K. Yu D. Lum J.J. Bui T. Christophorou M.A. Evan G.I. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Thompson C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). In an additional study, both chloroquine and 3MA synergistically augmented the proapoptotic effects and overall anticancer activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (12Carew J.S.

TRAIL has been considered a promising candidate for cancer therapeutics because of its selective cytotoxicity against malignancies (13Almasan A. Ashkenazi A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 14French L.E. Tschopp J. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 146-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2007; 224: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis by TRAIL is mediated by its interaction with two death domain-containing receptors, TRAIL-R1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5. This, in turn, orchestrates the assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) that contains FADD, an adaptor that activates initiator caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-10, leading (in Type I cells) to direct activation of effector caspases, such as caspase-3 (16Kischkel F.C.

Unfortunately, as with a multitude of other chemotherapeutic compounds, TRAIL-responsive tumors acquire a resistant phenotype, which renders TRAIL therapy ineffective (21Cheng J. Hylander B.L.

The realization that many tumors are unresponsive to TRAIL treatment has stimulated interest in identifying apoptotic agents that when used in combination with TRAIL can sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Indeed, multiple studies have demonstrated that a variety of apoptotic agents and proteins sensitize several classes of tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (13Almasan A. Ashkenazi A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 15Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2007; 224: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The current study was designed to investigate the involvement of autophagy in the response to TRAIL treatment of T leukemic and colon carcinoma cells with various apoptotic defects. Our findings suggest that various apoptosis defects that block TRAIL-mediated cell death at different points along the apoptotic signaling pathway shift the signaling cascade toward cell-protective autophagy. We also obtained evidence that inhibition of such a TRAIL-mediated autophagic response initiates an effective TRAIL-dependent apoptotic cascade. We propose that divergent mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis can be reversed by a common approach of targeting for inhibition-specific components of the autophagic process. This novel concept may have significant implications for the development of new strategies to circumvent TRAIL resistance in tumors.

RNAi—atg5, atg7, bak, beclin-1, caspase-8, cortactin, and UVRAG siRNAs were obtained as siGENOME SMARTpool reagents from Dharmacon. beclin-1 siRNA was also obtained as ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA from Dharmacon. Both siGENOME SMARTpool and ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNAs consist of four distinct RNA oligoduplexes per target gene, and both have a guaranteed silencing effectiveness of at least 75% at the mRNA level. To confirm results obtained with beclin-1 siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA, some of the experiments were repeated with beclin-1 ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA, which is reported to reduce off-target effects up to 90%. bid siRNA was obtained as a duplex in purified and desalted form (Option C) from Dharmacon with the following sense strand sequence: 5′-GAAGACATCATCCGGAATAdTdT-3′. The nontargeting siRNA control used in our RNAi experiments is the siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA pool 2 (Dharmacon), which contains four nontargeting siRNAs. The nontargeting control for beclin-1 ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA also consists of four nontargeting oligoduplexes. WT Hct116, Hct116-FLIP, or Bax-/- Hct116 cells (2.5 × 105) were plated in a 6-well plate and, following 16 h (at ∼30% confluence), were transfected with 200 nm siRNA in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) without fetal calf serum using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's transfection protocol. After 4 h, fetal calf serum was added to a final concentration of 10%. At the end of the siRNA treatment period (48-72 h), the medium over the cells was adjusted to 1 ml before the addition of an apoptotic agent. Stable Transfection—Hct116 cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in electroporation buffer (AMAXA) at a final concentration of 3 × 107 cells/ml. Five μg of linearized FLIP or linearized GFP-LC3 plasmids and linearized pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen) were mixed with 0.1 ml of cell suspension, transferred to a 2.0-mm electroporation cuvette, and nucleofected with an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus, utilizing the appropriate program according to the manufacturer's directions. Geneticin-resistant cell lines were grown in the presence of G418 (1500 μg/ml). Geneticin-resistant clonal cell lines harboring either the FLIP-expressing vector or the empty vector were generated by dakocytomation (1 cell/well) utilizing a MOFLO high speed cell sorter and Summit Software. Cell Microscopy—Cytospins were made from Jurkat cells on noncoated slides. Hct116 cells were grown in culture chamber slides, and cytospins were made only when treatment resulted in floating apoptotic cells. Confocal microscopy was performed with an OlympusFluoview 1000 confocal microscope and the companion software FV10-ASW1.6. For electron microscopy, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), followed by 1% OsO4. After dehydration, thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for observation under a JEM 1011CX electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA). Images were acquired digitally.

Hct116 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were treated with various siRNAs for 48-60 h and then with TRAIL (50 or 100 ng/ml) for 6 h. The length of the TRAIL treatment is indicated where it was longer (16 or 24 h). Cell lysates were prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. To prepare cell extracts, cultured cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 20 min, cells (2.5 × 106/0.5 ml) were disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cellular extracts were obtained as the supernatants resulting from centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Subcellular Fractionation—To obtain an enriched mitochondrial fraction, Hct116 or Jurkat cells were suspended in mitochondrial buffer composed of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and lysed by Dounce homogenization.

Following probing with a specific primary Ab and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Cell Survival Assays—Cell viability based on the ATP levels present in live cells was tested with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Clonogenic assays were performed with methylcellulose-based semisolid medium (MethoCult H4230; StemCell Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, after treatment, the cells were washed, suspended in MethoCult medium, and cultured in triplicates (300 cells/3 ml) in 35-mm Petri dishes. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 14 days, and colonies were counted using an inverted microscope and gridded scoring dishes. Cytofluorometric analyses of apoptosis were performed by co-staining with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V conjugates (BD Biosciences). TRAIL Induces a Protective Autophagic Response in Apoptosis-defective Tumor Cells—Recent studies suggest that an autophagic response is developed in apoptotic defective cells subjected to various forms of stress (8Lum J.J.

FLIP is a potent inhibitor of death receptor-initiated apoptotic cascades that functions at the DISC to block the development of downstream apoptotic events. It has been well established that the apoptotic response to either TRAIL or Fas ligand is blocked by FLIP, but the possibility that such an apoptotic blockade gives rise to an autophagic process has not yet been explored. Therefore, we revisited the response of FLIP-overexpressing cells to TRAIL. As previously reported, the ligation of either Fas or TRAIL-Rs by their agonistic ligands in cells overexpressing FLIP does not result in productive apoptosis. Thus, no caspase activity is detected in either Jurkat or Hct116 cells stably transfected with FLIP (Fig. 1, A and B), and the cells maintain their pretreatment proliferation rate (Fig. 1C). However, we observed an unexpected change in the expression levels of Beclin-1, whereas under apoptotic conditions in vector control cells, the Beclin-1 expression level was reduced, in FLIP-overexpressing cells, agonistic ligation of either Fas or TRAIL-Rs resulted in increased Beclin-1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Likewise, treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR that induces autophagy, also resulted in significant increased expression of Beclin-1. These findings indicate that despite the apoptotic block mediated by FLIP overexpression, the ligated death receptors transmit a signal that leads at least to an increase in the expression level of Beclin-1. Since Beclin-1 is an autophagic protein, we assessed the possibility that TRAIL induces an autophagic response in such TRAIL apoptosis-resistant cells. Beclin-1 up-regulation in the response of FLIP-overexpressing cells to TRAIL was associated with increased autophagosome formation as detected by electron microscopy (Fig. 2A). The increased accumulation of autophagosomes was further confirmed by treatment of the cells with TRAIL in the presence of two lysosomal protease inhibitors, E64D, a membrane-permeable inhibitor of cathepsins B, H, and L, and pepstatin A, an inhibitor of cathepsins D and E (29Tanida I. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Such a combined treatment by TRAIL and cathepsin inhibitors, but not with the inhibitors alone, gave rise to numerous large autophagosomes having a significant amount of enclosed undigested content, including multiple organelles. Using confocal microscopy, we confirmed the increase in the expression level of Beclin-1 in FLIP-overexpressing Hct116 or Jurkat cells (Fig. 2, B and D). As previously reported (30Liang X.H. Yu J. Brown K. Levine B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3443-3449PubMed Google Scholar), in Hct116-FLIP cells, Beclin-1 localized both to nuclei and mitochondria (Fig. 2B). A TRAIL-mediated increase in MAP-LC3/Atg8 expression and a change in its subcellular distribution from cytoplasm to membranous autophagosomes or lysosomes was confirmed for both endogenous (Fig. 2, C and E) and transfected GFP-LC3 (Fig. 2H) (31Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). The punctate appearance of endogenous LC3 is more clearly evident in the higher magnification of Fig. 2C shown in the supplemental materials (Fig. S1). Likewise, increased expression of UVRAG was observed in TRAIL-treated Hct116-FLIP or Bax-/- Hct116 cells (Fig. 2, F and G). Similar to LC3, the increased expression of UVRAG had a punctate appearance and cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 2, F and G). LC3 is initially synthesized as an unprocessed form, proLC3, which is converted to a proteolytically processed form lacking C-terminal amino acids, LC3-I, and is finally modified into the phycoerythrin-conjugated form, LC3-II. LC3-II is the only protein marker that is reliably associated with completed autophagosomes (32Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. Agostinis P. Agrawal D.K. Aliev G. Askew D.S. Baba M. Baehrecke E.H. Bahr B.A. Ballabio A. Bamber B.A. Bassham D.C. Bergamini E. Bi X. Biard-Piechaczyk M. et al.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). To further investigate the ability of TRAIL to induce an autophagic flux in apoptosis-resistant cells, we assessed by immunoblotting the level of LC3-II in Bax-/- Hct116 cells treated with TRAIL in the presence of E64D and/or pepstatin A (29Tanida I. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). An increased expression level of LC3-II was observed in TRAIL-treated cells, particularly in cells treated in the presence of both inhibitors that together cover a wide range of cathepsins (Fig. 2I). To determine the subcellular localization of TRAIL-induced LC3-II, we performed a subcellular fractionation experiment for control and TRAIL-treated Hct116-FLIP cells. The increased expression in LC3-II was detected in the pellet of the S-20 cytosolic fraction, which includes autophagosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 2J). Reversal of TRAIL Resistance by Inhibition of F-actin Polymerization—Surprisingly, we consistently observed increased polymerization of F-actin as detected by rhodaminephalloidine in association with TRAIL-mediated autophagy in either Hct116-FLIP or Bax-/- Hct116 cells (Fig. 2, B-G). To further investigate if the changes we observed in the F-actin dynamics in response to TRAIL were essential for the protective response, we interfered with the F-actin polymerization process by RNAi knockdown of arp2 or cortactin. The actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex is responsible for the dynamics of the actin networks by virtue of its ability to initiate actin filament branches (33Goley E.D. Welch M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Cortactin regulates the function of the Arp2/3 complex and hence is a key mediator of actin polymerization (34Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). As expected, cortactin siRNA (Fig. 3A) and also arp2 siRNA (not shown) reduced the basal level of F-actin polymerization. Furthermore, the reduction in expression of either Cortactin or Arp2 blocked the protective autophagic cell response to TRAIL, as indicated by a lack in LC3 up-regulation and LC3-II formation (Fig. 3B). Note that the affinity of different anti-LC3 Abs to various LC3 forms (I and II) determines the strength of the signal detected by immunoblotting (29Tanida I. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 31Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 32Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. Agostinis P. Agrawal D.K. Aliev G. Askew D.S. Baba M. Baehrecke E.H. Bahr B.A. Ballabio A. Bamber B.A. Bassham D.C. Bergamini E. Bi X. Biard-Piechaczyk M. et al.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). AnaSpec anti-LC3 Ab detects an increase in both LC3-I and LC3-II in TRAIL-treated cells, and this increase is reversed by either cortactin or arp2 RNAi. The difference in the level of LC3-II between treatments is considered significant in determination of an autophagic flux. Unexpectedly, we observed induction of caspase activity and the appearance of fragmented nuclei in Hct116-FLIP cells treated with TRAIL and cortactin siRNA but not in cells treated with only the cortactin siRNA alone (Fig. 3A). Increased caspase activity was detected in either Hct116-FLIP or Bax-/- Hct116 cells treated with TRAIL and cortactin or arp2 siRNAs (Fig. 3, B and C). These findings suggest that the up-regulation in F-actin polymerization in the response of apoptosis-defective cells to TRAIL is an essential part of the protective mechanism, since specific interference of F-actin polymerization shifts the cell response to apoptosis. Since increased F-actin polymerization has not been previously connected to autophagy, we further assessed F-actin changes in the Hct116 cell response to amino acid starvation. We observed up-regulated F-actin poly"

https://openalex.org/W2083802966,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a water transport protein expressed in glial cell plasma membranes, including glial cell foot processes lining the blood-brain barrier. AQP4 deletion in mice reduces cytotoxic brain edema produced by different pathologies. To determine whether AQP4 is rate-limiting for brain water accumulation and whether altered AQP4 expression, as occurs in various pathologies, could have functional importance, we generated mice that overexpressed AQP4 in brain glial cells by a transgenic approach using the glial fibrillary acid protein promoter. Overexpression of AQP4 protein in brain by ∼2.3-fold did not affect mouse survival, appearance, or behavior, nor did it affect brain anatomy or intracranial pressure (ICP). However, following acute water intoxication produced by intraperitoneal water injection, AQP4-overexpressing mice had an accelerated progression of cytotoxic brain swelling, with ICP elevation of 20 ± 2 mmHg at 10 min, often producing brain herniation and death. In contrast, ICP elevation was 14 ± 2 mmHg at 10 min in control mice and 9.8 ± 2 mmHg in AQP4 knock-out mice. The deduced increase in brain water content correlated linearly with brain AQP4 protein expression. We conclude that AQP4 expression is rate-limiting for brain water accumulation, and thus, that altered AQP4 expression can be functionally significant."
https://openalex.org/W1975861025,"The rapamycin-sensitive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) contains mTOR, raptor, mLST8, and PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa). PRAS40 functions as a negative regulator when bound to mTORC1, and it dissociates from mTORC1 in response to insulin. PRAS40 has been demonstrated to be a substrate of mTORC1, and one phosphorylation site, Ser-183, has been identified. In this study, we used two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping in conjunction with mutational analysis to show that in addition to Ser-183, mTORC1 also phosphorylates Ser-212 and Ser-221 in PRAS40 when assayed in vitro. Mutation of all three residues to Ala markedly reduces mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 in vitro. All three sites were confirmed to be phosphorylated in vivo by [32P]orthophosphate labeling and peptide mapping. Phosphorylation of Ser-221 and Ser-183 but not Ser-212 is sensitive to rapamycin treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mutation of Ser-221 to Ala reduces the interaction with 14-3-3 to the same extent as mutation of Thr-246, the Akt/protein kinase B-phosphorylated site. We also find that mutation of Ser-221 to Ala increases the inhibitory activity of PRAS40 toward mTORC1. We propose that after mTORC1 kinase activation by upstream regulators, PRAS40 is phosphorylated directly by mTOR, thus contributing to the relief of PRAS40-mediated substrate competition.

Thus, the surrounding amino acids appear not to be the major determinant for phosphorylation. A critical motif called the TOR signaling (TOS) motif has been discovered in the NH2 terminus of S6K1 (FDIDL) and COOH terminus of 4E-BP1 (FEMDI) (5Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr.

This finding leads to the possibility that PRAS40 is a direct substrate of mTORC1, as is S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Indeed, Oshiro et al. discovered that PRAS40 was phosphorylated by mTORC1, and one phosphorylation site, Ser-183, was identified (12Oshiro N. Takahashi R. Yoshino K. Tanimura K. Nakashima A.

The inhibitory activity of PRAS40 is suggested to occur by direct competition with 4E-BP1 and S6K1 for binding to raptor (11Wang L. Harris T.E. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

PRAS40 was originally isolated with a 14-3-3 affinity column, and its binding with 14-3-3 depends on Akt/protein kinase B-mediated phosphorylation at Thr-246 (14Kovacina K.S. Park G.Y. Bae S.S.

PRAS40 binding to 14-3-3 also depends on nutrient sufficiency and is inhibited by treatment with rapamycin, the specific inhibitor against mTORC1 (13Fonseca B.D. Smith E.M. Lee V.H. MacKintosh C.

The cellular function of PRAS40 is poorly understood. It has been shown that overexpression of PRAS40 inhibits apoptotic neuronal cell death after transient focal cerebral ischemia (16Saito A. Narasimhan P. Hayashi T. Okuno S. Ferrand-Drake M. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1584-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), decreased phosphorylation of PRAS40 at Thr-246 is correlated with increased tumor cell apoptosis (17Madhunapantula S.V. Sharma A. Robertson G.P. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3626-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of PRAS40 at Thr-246 is reduced in rats fed a high fat diet, which induces insulin resistance (18Nascimento E.B.

However, decreased expression of PRAS40 has also been shown to protect against induction of apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-α and cycloheximide in HeLa cells, suggesting that PRAS40 may be a proapoptotic agent (19Thedieck K.

Presumably, the function of PRAS40 is regulated by its phosphorylation. In this study, we investigate phosphorylation sites in PRAS40 catalyzed by mTORC1. Two sites, Ser-212 and Ser-221, were identified by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, and the regulation of phosphorylation at these sites upon mTORC1 activity and PRAS40 binding to 14-3-3 was determined.

Cell Culture, Treatment, and Extract Preparation—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% newborn calf (Invitrogen) serum. Fibroblasts were converted to adipocytes by using differentiation medium as described previously (25Lin T.A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and then were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for 10–12 days. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to study insulin-stimulated mTOR kinase activity in vitro. HEK293, HEK293E, and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum and used for transfection experiments. Compared with HEK293 and HEK293T cells, there are low basal levels of phosphorylation of mTOR targets in HEK293E cells, and thus HEK293E cells were used for insulin signal study. For experiments, cells were serum-starved with DMEM overnight and then incubated at 37 °C without or with insulin and/or other additions. To terminate the incubation, cells were rinsed once with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized with a syringe with a 20-gauge needle in lysis buffer as described previously (20Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24293-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were retained for analyses. Mutagenesis and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—PRAS40 cDNAs having point mutations were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of HA-tagged PRAS40 in pcDNA3 by using a QuikChange II kit (Stratagene) according to the manual instructions. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The pGEX-4T-1 constructs encoding NH2-terminal GST-tagged PRAS40 and PRAS point mutations were expressed in bacteria (BL21) and purified as described previously (26Sabers C.J. Martin M.M. Brunn G.J. Williams J.M. Dumont F.J. Wiederrecht G. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 815-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to assess purity and confirm concentrations of the recombinant proteins. The pGEX-4T-1 constructs of 14-3-3 and FKBP12 with GST tag were expressed and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The amount of recombinant proteins retained on glutathione beads was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and GST Pulldown Assay—HEK293 or HEK293E cells were seeded in a 10- or 6-cm dish or 6-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a 1:1 ratio (w/v). The cells were harvested and analyzed at 36 h after transfection. Cell extracts were incubated with antibodies (2 μg) bound to protein A- or G-agarose beads or GST-tagged recombinant proteins (10 μg) bound to glutathione beads at 4 °C for 2 h with constant mixing. The beads were then washed four times. In Vitro Kinase Assay—As described previously (20Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24293-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), immune complex beads were rinsed with 1 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm microcystin LR, 10 mm HEPES, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4) and suspended in 60 μl of kinase buffer. After removing a sample for immunoblots, the kinase reactions were initiated by adding to 20 μl of the suspension 5 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 50 mm MnCl2, and 1 μg of PRAS40 wild type, mutants, or 4E-BP1 as substrates. Reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by adding SDS sample buffer. The relative amounts of 32P incorporated into the PRAS40 and 4E-BP1 proteins were determined by phosphorimaging after SDS-PAGE. In Vivo 32P Radiolabeling—Prior to radiolabeling, HEK293 cells cultured in 10-cm dishes were serum-starved overnight. The medium was then replaced by phosphate-free DMEM (Invitrogen), and cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.4 mCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h at 37°C, followed by incubation with rapamycin (20 nm) and insulin (200 nm) for 30 min. The cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated by HA antibody described as above. The samples were subject to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the radioactivity was analyzed by autoradiography. Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping—Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed according to the manual instructions of the Hunter Thin Layer Peptide Mapping Electrophoresis System. Briefly, 32P-labeled PRAS40 wild type and mutant proteins either phosphorylated in vitro by mTORC1 isolated from insulin-stimulated HEK293 cells or immunoprecipitated from radiolabeled and insulin-stimulated HEK293 cells were excised from polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and digested with 10 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin in buffer containing 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) twice for 12 and 3 h, respectively, at 37 °C. Digests were lyophilized and resuspended in 50 μl of hydrogen peroxide/formic acid (1:9) for oxidation, incubating on ice for 30 min. After lyophilization, samples were resuspended in the first dimension running buffer and loaded onto cellulose TLC plate and subject to two-dimensional peptide mapping. The first dimension was run for 30 min at 1000 V at pH 1.9 (formic acid/acetic acid/water (50:156:1794)), and second dimension chromatography was performed in phosphochromo buffer (butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (750:500:150:600)) for 16 h. 32P-Labeled peptides were subsequently visualized by phosphorimaging chromatography plates. mTORC1 Phosphorylates Ser-212 and Ser-221 in Vitro in Addition to Ser-183—To investigate whether mTORC1 phosphorylates PRAS40 at sites other than Ser-183, recombinant proteins of PRAS40 wild type and mutants of Ser-183 to Ala (S183A) and Thr-246 to Ala (T246A) were generated and utilized in phosphorylation assays in vitro. mTORC1, Akt1, and S6K1 were immunoprecipitated from extracts of 3T3-L1 adipocytes by using antibodies to raptor, Akt1, and S6K1. Intact mTORC1 was recovered, and PRAS40 disassociation was induced by insulin treatment as reported previously (11Wang L. Harris T.E. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20036-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Akt1 and S6K1 immune complexes did not contain mTORC1 components. To measure mTORC1 kinase activity toward PRAS40, immune complexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and recombinant PRAS40. As shown by 32P incorporation, PRAS40 was phosphorylated by mTORC1, and treating adipocytes with insulin increased PRAS40 phosphorylation more than 2-fold (Fig. 1A). mTORC1 phosphorylated the PRAS40 mutant T246A to the same extent as wild type, whereas the S183A mutation decreased but did not eliminate the phosphorylation of PRAS40 compared with wild type (Fig. 1A). In contrast, Akt1 phosphorylated wild type PRAS40 and the S183A mutant equally well, whereas the T246A mutation completely eliminated phosphorylation by Akt1 (Fig. 1A), indicating that Thr-246 is the only site phosphorylated by Akt1, as previously reported (14Kovacina K.S. Park G.Y. Bae S.S. Guzzetta A.W. Schaefer E. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10189-10194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). As a control, in an S6K1 kinase assay, 32P incorporation into PRAS40 showed only background level. Thus, mTORC1 specifically phosphorylates PRAS40 in vitro at site(s) in addition to Ser-183. The specificity of mTORC1-catalyzed phosphorylation of PRAS40 was confirmed by using mTOR kinase-dead (S2338A, KD) and constitutive active (deleting 2433–2451, ΔRD) mutants in HEK293 cells. The mTOR kinase-dead mutant abolished kinase activity toward PRAS40, whereas mTOR ΔRD substantially enhanced phosphorylation of PRAS40 (Fig. 1B). We next used two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping in conjunction with point site mutagenesis to identify sites in PRAS40 phosphorylated by mTORC1. Preliminary results showed that the truncation of PRAS40 with amino acid residues from 1 to 181 substantially reduced the phosphorylation of PRAS40 by mTORC1, whereas the truncation with amino acid residues from 97 to 256 was phosphorylated by mTORC1 to the same extent as wild type (data not shown). This suggests that the mTORC1 phosphorylation sites are predominantly located in the COOH terminus of PRAS40. Therefore, PRAS40 recombinant proteins with point mutations in the COOH terminus (S183A, T198A, S202A/S203A, S211A, S212A, S221A, S232A, T246A, and S247A) were generated. PRAS40 wild type and mutant proteins were phosphorylated by mTORC1 in vitro, and after SDS-PAGE, 32P-labeled PRAS40 was digested by trypsin and subjected to phosphopeptide mapping analysis. The tryptic digestion pattern of PRAS40 extracted directly from the gel was compared with the pattern of PRAS40 digested after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and was found to be identical (data not shown); therefore, the latter method was used for subsequent analyses. As illustrated in Fig. 1C (first panel) and summarized in Fig. 1C (last panel), five major phosphopeptides were obtained after digestion of 32P-incorporated PRAS40 wild type phosphorylated by mTORC1 in vitro. The cluster of three spots in the upper left were confirmed to arise from incomplete digestion of the peptide that contains Ser-183, since mutation of Ser-183 to Ala eliminated these spots (Fig. 1C). The other two sites phosphorylated by mTORC1 were Ser-212 and Ser-221, demonstrated by alanine substitution abolishing the two remaining spots (Fig. 1C). T198A and S202A/S203A and the rest of the mutants (S211A, S232A, T246A, and S247A; data not shown) did not change the phosphopeptide mapping pattern. To confirm that these identified residues are the major sites phosphorylated by mTORC1 in vitro, PRAS40 mutants S212A, S221A, and the combined S183A/S212A/S221A mutations were used in an mTORC1 kinase assay. S212A and S221A modestly reduced the mTORC1-catalyzed phosphorylation of PRAS40, and mutations in Ser-212, -221, and -183 together essentially eliminated the phosphorylation of PRAS40 (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Ser-183, -212, and -221 account for the essential sites in PRAS40 phosphorylated by mTORC1 in vitro. To investigate further whether PRAS40 phosphorylation catalyzed by mTORC1 is rapamycinsensitive in vitro, the immune complex isolated by raptor antibody was incubated with the addition of rapamycin and FKBP12. Incubating mTORC1 with rapamycin or FKBP12 alone was without effect on PRAS40 phosphorylation; however, the combination of rapamycin and FKBP12 abolished the phosphorylation of PRAS40 (Fig. 1E). As predicted, LY294002, which is previously shown to inhibit mTOR (20Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24293-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), abolished PRAS40 phosphorylation as well. PRAS40 phosphorylation was also inhibited by rapamycin-FKBP12 in the S212A and S183AS221A mutants (Fig. 1E), demonstrating that phosphorylation at individual sites catalyzed by mTORC1 in vitro, such as Ser-183 and Ser-212, were rapamycin-sensitive. Phosphorylation of PRAS40 by mTORC1 in Vivo—To investigate whether Ser-212 and Ser-221 are phosphorylated by mTORC1 in vivo, HEK293 cells were transfected with PRAS40 and labeled by [32P]orthophosphate. Recombinant PRAS40 was isolated by HA immunoprecipitation. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping shows six major 32P-labeled peptides (a–f) after digestion of wild-type PRAS40 (Fig. 2A). In comparison with the in vitro mapping pattern, spots a, c, and f run in similar positions with the peptides shown to contain Ser-183, -221, and -212 individually (Fig. 2A). Indeed, the S183A mutant eliminated spot a, confirming that Ser-183 is phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 2A). Spot c represents the highly phosphorylated peptide containing Thr-246, as demonstrated by its elimination in the T246A mutant (Fig. 2A). In contrast, mutants S212A and S221A did not alter the in vivo phosphopeptide pattern (Fig. 2A). Importantly, mutation of Thr-246 to Ala uncovered a previously obscured spot (spot g), which was eliminated by the combined mutation of Thr-246 and Ser-221 (Fig. 2A). This indicates that Ser-221 is also phosphorylated in vivo (spot g). Inspecting the predicted peptides arising from trypsin digestion revealed that Ser-212 is located in the same peptide as Ser-202 and Ser-203. The combined mutations of S202A/S203A and S212A substantially eliminated spot f, whereas mutation of S202A/S203A or S212A alone was not able to abolish spot f (Fig. 2A). This suggests that both Ser-202/203 and Ser-212 are phosphorylated in vivo. Of note, in PRAS40 wild type, there was a long tailed spot below spot g, but this spot disappeared in the S202A/S203A mutant (Fig. 2A). It is possible that phosphorylation at Ser-202/203 causes incomplete digestion of trypsin between Arg-201 and Ser-202 and produces a longer and more hydrophilic peptide with four extra amino acids of Thr-Glu-Ala-Arg. We also consistently observed peptides represented in spots b, d, and e that were phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 2A), but what phosphorylation sites these spots represent is yet to be identified. Compared with HEK293 cells, in HEK293E cells, the spots of d and e showed very little phosphorylation (data not shown). Therefore, as indicated in the last panel of Fig. 2A, Ser-183, Ser-221, Ser-212, Ser-202/203, and Thr-246 in PRAS40 are phosphorylated in vivo. To compare the sites phosphorylated in PRAS40 in vivo and in vitro by mTORC1, we mixed PRAS40 peptides phosphorylated by mTORC1 in vitro with in vivo phosphorylated T246A and S202A/S203A peptides, respectively, after trypsin digestion, followed by two-dimensional peptide mapping. The peptides in vitro phosphorylated by mTORC1 represented Ser-183 (spot 1), Ser-221 (spot 2), and Ser-212 (spot 3) comigrated with phosphopeptides in vivo containing Ser-183 (spot a in S202A/S203A and spot d in T246A), Thr-246 (spot b in S202A/S203A), Ser-221 (spot e in T246A), and Ser-212 (spot c in S202A/S203A and spot f in T246A), respectively (Fig. 2B). We further investigated whether the phosphorylations of Ser-212 and Ser-221 are sensitive in vivo to rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTORC1. As predicted, phosphorylation of Ser-183 was reduced by rapamycin treatment in PRAS40 wild type and mutants (T246A and S202A/S203A) (Fig. 2C). In mutant T246A, which is used to show the Ser-221-co"
https://openalex.org/W2122078852,"Selectin-mediated adhesion of tumor cells to platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells may regulate their hematogenous dissemination in the microvasculature. We recently identified CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v) as functional P-, but not E- or L-, selectin ligands on colon carcinoma cells. Moreover, an approximately 180-kDa sialofucosylated glycoprotein(s) mediated selectin binding in CD44-knockdown cells. Using immunoaffinity chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, we identify this glycoprotein as the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Blot rolling assays and flow-based adhesion assays using microbeads coated with CEA immunopurified from LS174T colon carcinoma cells and selectins as substrate reveal that CEA possesses E- and L-, but not P-, selectin ligand activity. CEA on CD44-knockdown LS174T cells exhibits higher HECA-452 immunoreactivity than CEA on wild-type cells, suggesting that CEA functions as an alternative acceptor for selectin-binding glycans. The enhanced expression of HECA-452 reactive epitopes on CEA from CD44-knockdown cells correlates with the increased CEA avidity for E- but not L-selectin. Through the generation of stable knockdown cell lines, we demonstrate that CEA serves as an auxiliary L-selectin ligand, which stabilizes L-selectin-dependent cell rolling against fluid shear. Moreover, CEA and CD44v cooperate to mediate colon carcinoma cell adhesion to E- and L-selectin at elevated shear stresses. The novel finding that CEA is an E- and L-selectin ligand may explain the enhanced metastatic potential associated with tumor cell CEA overexpression and the supportive role of selectins in metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2031487445,"Cyclin A/cdk2 has a role in progression through S phase, and a large pool is also activated in G2 phase. Here we report that this G2 phase pool regulates the timing of progression into mitosis. Knock down of cyclin A by siRNA or addition of a specific cdk2 small molecule inhibitor delayed entry into mitosis by delaying cells in G2 phase. The G2 phase-delayed cells contained elevated levels of inactive cyclin B/cdk1. However, increased microtubule nucleation at the centrosomes was observed, and the centrosomes stained for markers of cyclin B/cdk1 activity. Both microtubule nucleation at the centrosomes and the phosphoprotein markers were lost with short-term treatment of the cdk1/2 inhibitor roscovitine but not the Mek1/2 inhibitor U0126. Cyclin A/cdk2 localized at the centrosomes in late G2 phase after separation of the centrosomes but before the start of prophase. Thus G2 phase cyclin A/cdk2 controls the timing of entry into mitosis by controlling the subsequent activation of cyclin B/cdk1, but also has an unexpected role in coordinating the activation of cyclin B/cdk1 at the centrosome and in the nucleus."

Lifelong spermatogenesis is sustained by stem cells, which are defined by their ability to self-renew and differentiate into mature cells (de Rooij, 2001de Rooij D.G. Proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells.Reproduction. 2001; 121: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, Oatley and Brinster, 2006Oatley J.M. Brinster R.L. Spermatogonial stem cells.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 419: 259-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mammalian spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testis and is maintained by a unipotent stem cell system. The male germ stem cell system is composed of premeiotic spermatogonia containing stem cells, meiotic spermatocytes, haploid spermatids, and sperm (de Rooij, 2001de Rooij D.G. Proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells.Reproduction. 2001; 121: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). For extensive self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells, spermatogonia possess a nearly unlimited cellular lifespan (Ogawa et al., 2003Ogawa T. Ohmura M. Yumura Y. Sawada H. Kubota Y. Expansion of murine spermatogonial stem cells through serial transplantation.Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Spermatogonia reside in contact with the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules and are supported by Sertoli cells. Murine spermatogonial stem cell ability is restricted to an as-yet-unidentified subpopulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Undifferentiated spermatogonia constitute the most primitive fraction of adult male germ cells and are topologically subdivided into As (Asingle; solitary cells), Apr (Apaired; two cells connected by intercellular bridges), and Aal (Aaligned; chains of 4–16 cells connected by intercellular bridges) cells in the seminiferous tubules (de Rooij, 2001de Rooij D.G.

In other stem cell systems, particularly the hematopoietic system, development of methods to purify a potential stem cell fraction has initiated substantial progress in the field (Spangrude et al., 1988Spangrude G.J. Heimfeld S. Weissman I.L. Purification and characterization of mouse hematopoietic stem cells.Science. 1988; 241: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). Likewise, purification of undifferentiated spermatogonia containing stem cell activity is required for germ cell studies. The protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) regulates apoptosis and cell-cycle checkpoint responses after DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), telomere erosion, and oxidative stress (Shiloh, 2003Shiloh Y. ATM and related protein kinases: safeguarding genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). We previously showed that, in Atm−/− hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the cell-cycle inhibitor p16Ink4a is upregulated, suggesting that ATM is necessary for the HSC system in the bone marrow (Ito et al., 2004Ito K.

We recently reported progressive loss of premeiotic germ cells in Atm−/− testis (Takubo et al., 2006Takubo K. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Azuma M. Arai F. Nagamatsu G. Suda T. Premeiotic germ cell defect in seminiferous tubules of Atm-null testis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The premeiotic defect in Atm−/− testis was independent of p16Ink4a upregulation, suggesting involvement of a molecular mechanism different from that in the HSC system (Takubo et al., 2006Takubo K. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Azuma M. Arai F. Nagamatsu G. Suda T. Premeiotic germ cell defect in seminiferous tubules of Atm-null testis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this report, we established efficient isolation of undifferentiated spermatogonia by using a combination of surface markers. This method enabled us to analyze undifferentiated spermatogonia and stem cell activity of meiotic and premeiotic germ cell mutant Atm−/− mice, whose stem cell ability had been difficult to investigate due to their meiotic arrest. We found that undifferentiated spermatogonia from Atm−/− mice were defective in cell-cycle progression and lost genomic integrity. This self-renewal defect depended on accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1 in undifferentiated spermatogonia, a molecular program different from that seen in Atm−/− HSCs. To isolate undifferentiated spermatogonia, we utilized several surface antigen markers. It has been shown that the adhesion molecule EpCAM is a pan-spermatogonial marker (Anderson et al., 1999Anderson R. Schaible K. Heasman J. Wylie C. Expression of the homophilic adhesion molecule, Ep-CAM, in the mammalian germ line.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1999; 116: 379-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the stem cell factor receptor c-Kit is not expressed on undifferentiated spermatogonia, and α6-integrin is expressed on spermatogonial fraction with stem cell capacity (Shinohara et al., 1999Shinohara T. Avarbock M.R. Brinster R.L. beta1- and alpha6-integrin are surface markers on mouse spermatogonial stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Spermatogonial stem cell enrichment by multiparameter selection of mouse testis cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 8346-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first selected EpCAM-positive spermatogonia by magnetic cell sorting (MACS), followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-mediated isolation of undifferentiated spermatogonia with anti- α6-integrin and anti-c-Kit antibodies. This strategy enabled isolation of undifferentiated spermatogonia (Figure 1A and Figure S4, available online), which are characterized by high α6-integrin expression, weak nuclear chromatin staining with nuclear vacuoles, and intense staining for Plzf, a zinc finger protein essential for undifferentiated spermatogonia (Buaas et al., 2004Buaas F.W. Kirsh A.L. Sharma M. McLean D.J. Morris J.L. Griswold M.D. de Rooij D.G. Braun R.E. Plzf is required in adult male germ cells for stem cell self-renewal.Nat.

Essential role of Plzf in maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). More than 98% of cells in this fraction were Plzf positive, although a residual fraction contained hardly any Plzf-positive cells (Figure S4). The integrity of this method was confirmed by higher expression of other markers of undifferentiated spermatogonia (namely, GFR-1α, E-cadherin, and CD9) (Viglietto et al., 2000Viglietto G. Dolci S. Bruni P. Baldassarre G. Chiariotti L. Melillo R.M. Salvatore G. Chiappetta G. Sferratore F. Fusco A. Santoro M.

In contrast, differentiating spermatogonia were isolated from the c-Kit-positive, α6-integrin-dull fraction, which is characterized by condensed nuclear chromatin staining, a lack of Plzf staining, and lower expression of GFR-1α, E-cadherin, and CD9 (Figures 1A and 1B). In addition, the “side-population (SP) phenotype,” defined by the higher efflux of DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342, was also observed in the undifferentiated spermatogonial fraction (more than 40% of this fraction was SP). Other fractions contained only a few SP cells (Figure 1C). Because there is controversy as to whether undifferentiated spermatogonia exhibit the SP phenotype (Kubota et al., 2003Kubota H. Avarbock M.R. Brinster R.L. Spermatogonial stem cells share some, but not all, phenotypic and functional characteristics with other stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Analysis of DNA content revealed the lower proportion of S/G2/M phase of the cell cycle in undifferentiated spermatogonia, in clear contrast to differentiating spermatogonia (Figure 1D). The α6-integrinhigh, c-Kitneg undifferentiated spermatogonia exhibited weak staining for Pyronin Y among spermatogonia, a functional characteristic of quiescent (G0) cells (p < 0.002, Figures 1E and 1F). Moreover, SP cells in undifferentiated spermatogonia were more quiescent than total undifferentiated spermatogonia were (p < 0.002, Figures 1E and 1F). Altogether, our investigation utilizing MACS-selected spermatogonial cells to avoid contamination with other cells gave clear evidence for the SP phenotype in the undifferentiated spermatogonial fraction. Similar to the SP fraction in HSCs (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar), among undifferentiated spermatogonia, SP cells in undifferentiated spermatogonia were particularly quiescent. Using our isolation method, we analyzed an undifferentiated spermatogonial fraction in germ cell mutant Atm−/− mice. Although this mutant is known as a meiosis mutant (Hamer et al., 2004Hamer G. Kal H.B. Westphal C.H. Ashley T. de Rooij D.G. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated expression and activation in the testis.Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we previously reported premeiotic germ cell loss in Atm−/− testis in addition to the meiotic defect (Takubo et al., 2006Takubo K. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Azuma M. Arai F. Nagamatsu G. Suda T. Premeiotic germ cell defect in seminiferous tubules of Atm-null testis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the meiosis-defective mutant, it was difficult to investigate the premeiotic germ cell fraction because of massive arrest of cells at meiosis and the resulting debris. To avoid this difficulty, we applied our purification strategy. In postnatal day 60 (P60) mice, we observed no alteration between wild-type and Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia, in terms of proportion and number (Figures 2A and 2B). In older P400 Atm−/− testis, the undifferentiated spermatogonial fraction constituted a smaller proportion of spermatogonial cells than was seen in wild-type testis (Figure 2A). The number of Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonial cells per testis was also significantly less than that seen in wild-type mouse (Figure 2B). To determine what event led to loss of undifferentiated spermatogonia, we examined the cell-cycle status of Atm−/− undifferentiated or differentiating spermatogonia with a short-term (2 hr) BrdU pulse labeling assay. As shown in Figure 2C, Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia exhibited significantly reduced BrdU uptake (7.7% ± 1.5%, p < 0.001), reflecting cell-cycle arrest, compared to wild-type undifferentiated spermatogonia (25.8% ± 2.7%). Wild-type differentiating spermatogonia exhibited higher BrdU uptake (85.4% ± 6.9%) than undifferentiated spermatogonia did, consistent with cell-cycle analysis (Figures 1D–1F). In contrast to undifferentiated spermatogonia, Atm−/− differentiated spermatogonia showed BrdU uptake comparable to wild-type (86.8% ± 2.0%, p = 0.77, Figure 2C), indicating that cell-cycle arrest is specific to Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia. We next determined the quiescent G0 population in undifferentiated spermatogonia by Pyronin Y staining. Although 76.8% ± 8.7% of wild-type undifferentiated spermatogonia was Pyronin Yneg, Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia showed a significant reduction of G0 fraction in the cell cycle (Figure 2D, 57.8% ± 4.4%, p < 0.001). Because there was no significant difference in proportion of total G0/G1 cells between wild-type and Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia (data not shown), these data suggest a relative accumulation of cells at G1 phase and a block of S phase entry in Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia. Because cell-cycle progression of undifferentiated spermatogonia is regulated by multiple factors, including undifferentiated or differentiated germ cells, soma, and hormones, it was difficult to determine whether these defects were cell autonomous. To examine the direct contribution of ATM in undifferentiated spermatogonia, we first evaluated ATM protein in spermatogonial subpopulations. As shown in Figure 2E, there was no difference in terms of total ATM protein between wild-type undifferentiated or differentiated spermatogonia. ATM protein was both cytoplasmic and nuclear in both spermatogonial subpopulations (Figure 2E). In contrast, activation of ATM, indicated by phosphorylation of serine 1987 residue of the murine ATM protein (Shiloh, 2003Shiloh Y. ATM and related protein kinases: safeguarding genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar), was specifically observed in undifferentiated spermatogonia, as were numerous dot-like signals in nucleus (Figure 2F). To determine whether ATM is required for maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia, we utilized an in vitro cultivation system for undifferentiated spermatogonia known as germline stem (GS) cells. GS cells are stem cells maintained in the presence of GDNF, which is secreted from Sertoli cells (Meng et al., 2000Meng X. Lindahl M. Hyvonen M.E. Parvinen M. de Rooij D.G. Hess M.W. Raatikainen-Ahokas A. Sainio K. Rauvala H. Lakso M. et al.Regulation of cell fate decision of undifferentiated spermatogonia by GDNF.Science. 2000; 287: 1489-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), and they possess transplantation ability to produce mature, functional sperm even after long-term cultivation in vitro (Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2003Kanatsu-Shinohara M. Ogonuki N. Inoue K. Miki H. Ogura A. Toyokuni S. Shinohara T. Long-term proliferation in culture and germline transmission of mouse male germline stem cells.Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). We treated GS cells with caffeine, a pharmacological inhibitor of ATM, and analyzed potential changes in GS cells by flow cytometry. In this assay, short-term (1 week) pharmacological inhibition of ATM did not induce loss of GS cells in culture (Figure 3A and Figure S1A). In contrast, more persistent treatment (4 weeks) with an ATM inhibitor induced progressive loss of EpCAM+ α6-integrinhigh c-Kitneg GS cells (Figure 3B and Figure S1B), relative to vehicle treatment, which showed good correlation with the relatively slow effects of ATM deficiency on premeiotic germ cells in vivo (Takubo et al., 2006Takubo K. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Azuma M. Arai F. Nagamatsu G. Suda T. Premeiotic germ cell defect in seminiferous tubules of Atm-null testis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and Figures 2A and 2B). Because we observed that the expression levels of GDNF and its receptors are not significantly decreased in Atm−/− testis (Figure S2), and we also observed efficient recolonization of Atm−/− seminiferous tubules with wild-type spermatogonia (Figure S5), the defect in Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia is mainly cell autonomous. We next examined the capacity to form GS cells from neonatal testis in vitro. In support of the previous histological observation (Takubo et al., 2006Takubo K. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Azuma M. Arai F. Nagamatsu G. Suda T. Premeiotic germ cell defect in seminiferous tubules of Atm-null testis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), at the onset of cultivation, there was no difference in the proportion of undifferentiated spermatogonia between the two genotypes, as revealed by flow cytometry (Figure 3D and Figure S1C), and the loss of undifferentiated spermatogonia was detected only after long-term in vitro cultivation (Figure 3E and Figure S1D). Atm−/− testis did not produce any GS cell colonies, which are characterized by chain-like compact cells (Figures 3C and 3F). These progressive defects in ATM-inhibited or -defective GS cells are consistent with undifferentiated spermatogonial loss seen only after aging in vivo (Figures 2A and 2B). A requirement for ATM for the establishment of GS cells in vitro implies that ATM activity directly affects the maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia. To evaluate the stem cell capacity of Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia, we transplanted isolated undifferentiated spermatogonia into spermatogenesis-defective W/Wv mutant testis by microinjection. Colonization efficiency of recipient seminiferous tubules was severely impaired in Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia (Figures 4A–4C). We next transplanted Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia that ubiquitously express a GFP transgene and counted the spermatogenic colonies 3 months after transplantation. The colonization efficacy was also severely impaired by the loss of ATM (Figures 4D and 4E). These experiments clearly support a cell-autonomous defect in maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia and their stem cell activity. In addition, we could find some Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia-derived colonies in the recipient testis (data not shown). This observation can remove the possibility of the undetectable lodgment of undifferentiated spermatogonia due to the lack of differentiation. We next focused on molecular mechanisms underlying the Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonial defect. Because ATM protein maintains genomic stability by activating various DNA damage response signals (Shiloh, 2003Shiloh Y. ATM and related protein kinases: safeguarding genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar), we directly evaluated DNA damage in Atm−/− versus wild-type undifferentiated spermatogonia by whole nuclear DNA electrophoresis (CometAssay). Only a few nuclei from undifferentiated spermatogonia in wild-type mice showed comet-like tails, sensitive indicators of accumulated nuclear DNA damage (Figure 5A). In contrast, most nuclei from Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia showed damage, as evidenced by comet-like nuclear tails (Figure 5A). The frequency of comet-positive cells in Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia was 54.5% ± 9.2% (Figure 5B), significantly higher than that seen in wild-type spermatogonia (15.1% ± 4.0%, p < 0.001). This phenomenon is likely cell autonomous because pharmacological inhibition of ATM induces DNA damage in cultured wild-type GS cells, as assessed by the same assay (data not shown). Therefore, loss of ATM promotes accumulation of DNA damage in undifferentiated spermatogonia. The observation of accumulated DNA damage in Atm−/− undifferentiated spermatogonia led us to investigate involvement of the p19Arf-p53 pathway, which along with the p16Ink4a-pRb pathway (Sherr, 2004Sherr C.J. Principles of tumor suppression.Cell. 2"
https://openalex.org/W1984790349,"The ascidian voltage-sensing phosphatase (Ci-VSP) consists of the voltage sensor domain (VSD) and a cytoplasmic phosphatase region that has significant homology to the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome TEN (PTEN). The phosphatase activity of Ci-VSP is modified by the conformational change of the VSD. In many proteins, two protein modules are bidirectionally coupled, but it is unknown whether the phosphatase domain could affect the movement of the VSD in VSP. We addressed this issue by whole-cell patch recording of gating currents from a teleost VSP (Dr-VSP) cloned from Danio rerio expressed in tsA201 cells. Replacement of a critical cysteine residue, in the phosphatase active center of Dr-VSP, by serine sharpened both ON- and OFF-gating currents. Similar changes were produced by treatment with phosphatase inhibitors, pervanadate and orthovanadate, that constitutively bind to cysteine in the active catalytic center of phosphatases. The distinct kinetics of gating currents dependent on enzyme activity were not because of altered phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels, because the kinetics of gating current did not change by depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, as reported by coexpressed KCNQ2/3 channels. These results indicate that the movement of the VSD is influenced by the enzymatic state of the cytoplasmic domain, providing an important clue for understanding mechanisms of coupling between the VSD and its effector.

Physiol. 2000; 116: 461-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have led to proposed models for the operation of the VSD (7Long S.B. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). However, the VSD has long been studied as a structure unique to voltage-gated ion channels. We have recently identified a protein, Ci-VSP, that contains the VSD but not the pore domain (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Ci-VSP has the following two modules in its structure: the transmembrane spanning region that corresponds to the VSD of voltage-gated ion channels and the cytoplasmic region with homology to the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome TEN (PTEN), a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase (9Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar). The VSD of Ci-VSP exhibits gating currents that indicate the conformational change in response to membrane voltage, and the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity is voltage-dependently regulated (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This is the first example where an effector other than an ion pathway is regulated by the VSD. Furthermore, another protein that contains the VSD but lacks the pore domain was identified as the long sought molecular correlate of voltage-gated proton channels (10Sasaki M. Takagi M. Okamura Y. Science. 2006; 312: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 11Ramsey I.S. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 440: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the VSD is a protein module that operates as a self-contained functional unit. Recently, detailed relationships between voltage-sensor movement and phosphatase activity of Ci-VSP were examined by using several types of phosphoinositide sensors (12Murata Y. Okamura Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 583: 875-889Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This revealed that phosphatase activity changes over a range of membrane voltages as the voltage-sensor movement is increased. A shift of the voltage dependence of the VSD leads to a shift of the voltage dependence of the phosphatase activity to the same direction (12Murata Y. Okamura Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 583: 875-889Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), verifying that VSD confers voltage sensitivity to phosphatase activities of the cytoplasmic region. Deletion of 8 amino acids in the linker region between the VSD and the phosphatase domain eliminates coupling between the two modules (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The above findings indicate that VSD of VSP is tightly coupled with the downstream effector, as for voltage-gated ion channels. A recent study showed that after replacement of a part of the VSD of a voltage-gated potassium channel by that of Ci-VSP or a voltage-gated proton channel, the voltage-gating is still retained, indicating that the mechanisms of voltage sensing are conserved between conventional voltage-gated ion channels and voltage sensor domain proteins (13Alabi A.A. Bahamonde M.I. Jung H.J. Kim J.I. Swartz K.J. Nature. 2007; 450: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study with single molecule photobleaching has shown that Ci-VSP operates as a monomer (14Kohout S.C. Ulbrich M.H. Bell S.C. Isacoff E.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), indicating simpler stoichiometry than voltage-gated ion channels. Thus VSP serves as a simple model to understand how VSD is coupled with its effector. In this study, a VSP ortholog gene was identified from zebrafish, Danio rerio (named Dr-VSP). Dr-VSP shares most properties with Ci-VSP, including gating currents and voltage-sensitive phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. Dr-VSP showed much more robust gating currents in tsA201 cells than Ci-VSP, providing us with a unique opportunity to explore how the phosphatase module interacts with the VSD. We found that inhibition of phosphatase activity, either by the introduction of a point mutation or by pharmacological inhibition with vanadate, accelerates the movement of the VSD, providing evidence that the enzyme activity of the phosphatase domain influences the VSD movement. cDNAs and Mutagenesis—The zebrafish ortholog of Ci-VSP was cloned by RT-PCR. Rat KCNQ2/3 clones in the Xenopus expression vector were provided by Dr. Nakajo (National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan). The same inserts were subcloned into pIRES2-EGFP (BD Biosciences) for transfection into HEK293 cells. To identify the zebrafish VSP cDNA, the mouse VSP protein sequence was used to survey zebrafish translated by expressed sequenced tag (EST) data base. Two EST clones were found, each of which putatively covers the middle and C-terminal region of VSP. Based on this information, we designed two primers, TTCTCGAGTATTTCAGCTCAAAACTGA and TTGAATTCAAGGCTCAGTGAAAGACAG, and performed RT-PCR with cDNA from 24- to 60-h embryos as template. A 1.186-kb PCR product was obtained. Because this lacked the 5′ end of zebrafish VSP, 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed with the primers CTCACATACGTCACAGAAAGA and GTCCAGATCAAATCCATCTTT. These two clones were ligated to reconstitute the entire coding sequence, and subcloned into the pSD64TF expression vector (provided by Dr. Terry Snutch, University of British Columbia) between EcoRV and SpeI sites. Dr-VSP was subcloned into the pIRES2-EGFP expression plasmid between NheI and SacII restriction sites. For electrophysiology of Ci-VSP, the coding regions of the wild type and the enzyme-defective mutant, C363S (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), were cloned into pIRES2-EGFP at PstI and SacII sites. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligo primers in both directions were synthesized with 10-15-bp correct sequences in both sides of the modified sequence(s). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire insert with the Beckman Coulter sequencer. Primers used for the mutation, C302S, were GTTATTGCCATCCACAGCAAAGGAGGAAAGG (forward) and CCTTTCCTCCTTTGCTGTGGATGGCAATAAC (reverse). For mutation of T156R, the primers CCCAGGGTGGTGAGGTTCCTGAGGTCT (forward) and AGACCTCAGGAACCTCACCACCCTGGG (reverse primer) were used. The double mutation I165R/T156R was further constructed from Dr-VSP-T156R using the following primers: CTGAGGATCCTAAGGCTGGTACGCATC (forward) and GATGCGTACCAGCCTTAGGATCCTCAG (reverse). For mutation of R153Q, the primers were GCCAGTCTGATTCCCCAGGTGGTGACATTCCTG (forward) and CAGGAATGTCACCACCTGGGGAATCAGACTGGC (reverse). In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—For expression of the phosphatase domain of Dr-VSP, GST was fused to the N terminus of the 332-amino acid cytoplasmic region. The cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX4T3 (GE Healthcare) at EcoRI and XhoI sites. The GST fusion protein was synthesized in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The malachite green assay (16Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was performed by using 1 nmol of l-α-phosphatidyl-d-myo-inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and 10 nmol of phosphatidylserine (Wako) per microcentrifuge tube and dispersed in the phosphatase assay buffer following lyophilization. 1 μg of purified protein was added to each reaction tube containing substrate solution and incubated at 31 °C. At various time points, the reaction was stopped by adding N-ethylmaleimide. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation. BIOMOL GREEN™ (Biomol) was added to the supernatant and incubated at room temperature for ∼20 min. The amounts of phosphate were determined by measurements of absorption at 620 nm. H2O was used for reference reading. The values of released phosphate from Dr-VSP(WT), Dr-VSP(C302S), and GST alone were calculated by using a standard curve according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biomol). Generation of Antibody and Western Blot Analysis of Recombinant Dr-VSP Proteins—A polyclonal antibody against Dr-VSP was raised in rabbit against the protein of the whole C-terminal cytoplasmic region of Dr-VSP. A cDNA fragment corresponding to the cytoplasmic region (amino acid residues Glu-180 to Pro-511) was subcloned into a vector, pGEX-4T-3, that has a thrombin cleavage site after the GST sequence. After the GST fusion protein was produced and purified from E. coli using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare), GST was removed from the cytoplasmic region of Dr-VSP by treatment with thrombin. Purified protein was injected into rabbit six times. Wild type and C302S mutant Dr-VSP DNA were transfected into tsA201 cell with pIRES-EGFP plasmid (BD Biosciences) as a transfection marker. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to collect a membrane fraction. 20 μg of each sample was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The membrane was reacted with the Dr-VSP anti-serum (1/500) and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1/2000) (GE Healthcare). The labeled band was detected using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). Mammalian Cell Expression and Whole-cell Patch Recording—tsA201 cells, a derivative of HEK293 cells that stably express SV40, were used for most of studies. HEK293 cells were used for coexpression of Dr-VSP with KCNQ2/3 channels, because HEK293 cells exhibited more robust K+ currents than tsA201 cells. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cDNAs were transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen) reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. Whole-cell patch clamp recording was done using Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices) with tsA201 cells. The external bath solution was 75 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 180 mm HEPES, 0-10 mm glucose (pH 7.0). The internal solution was 65 mm NMDG, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). The pH and osmolality were adjusted with methanesulfonic acid and glucose, respectively. For stimulation and data acquisition, Pclamp Digidata 1322A 16-bit data acquisition system was used. Drumond 100-μl calibrated pipettes were fabricated with 8-15-MΩ resistance and used as patch pipettes. Macroscopic current records were filtered at 5-kHz low pass Bessel filter/80 db. Symmetrical and linear currents were subtracted by P/5 procedure to isolate the gating current. Total carried charge was calculated by Clampfit 9.0 software. Kinetics of gating currents were examined by measuring half-decay times, rather than fitting with exponentials. In some cases, gating currents were fitted by single exponentials, giving basically similar results. More than a single exponential was required for fitting the curves in many cases, consistent with the view that more than single transition occurs in the activation of the voltage sensor of Ci-VSP as examined by profiles of voltage-induced movements of fluorescence-labeled amino acid residues of S4 in Ci-VSP (14Kohout S.C. Ulbrich M.H. Bell S.C. Isacoff E.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Q-V curve was fitted by the Boltzmann equation Q = 1/(exp(ze(V - V½)/kT)), where the parameter e is elementary electric charge; k is Boltzmann constant; z is the effective valance; and T is the absolute temperature. Because NMDG and methanesulfonate in the pipette solution have low mobility, pipette resistance was not less than 8 MΩ even when the inner tip diameter was as large as 1-1.5 μm. In this study, we did not perform compensation of series resistance in most of measurements. Therefore, changes in gating current kinetics of less than ∼1 ms, or gating currents larger than 1 nA, were not interpretable. Data presented in Fig. 7 with extremely fast and robust gating currents of the S4 double mutant were not analyzed in detail. Oocyte Preparation and cRNA Expression—Oocytes were isolated by surgery from Xenopus laevis. Animals were anesthetized by immersion in 1.5% ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt (Sigma) for about 10 min and placed on ice. The excised ovary was rinsed with ND96 (containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) with NaOH) and was agitated for an hour in a solution containing 10 mm collagenase (Nitta Gelatin). The isolated oocytes were incubated at 18 °C. In vitro transcription was performed to synthesize cRNA by capped transcription kit (mMESSAGEmMACHINE®, Ambion). The oocyte expression vector, pSD64TF, containing the Dr-VSP insert, was linearized with XbaI, and SP6 RNA polymerase was used for transcription. Total cRNA of 0.1-0.5 ng was microinjected into oocytes a day after harvesting. The cRNA-injected oocytes were incubated in ND96 containing gentamycin and pyruvate (18Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The incubation temperature was maintained at ±2 °C. Recording was carried out 2-3 days after injection. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp with Oocyte Expression—KCNQ2/3 current was measured by bath clamp amplifier OC-725C (Warner Instrument Corp.). The bath solution for gating current was 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) with NaOH. The bath solution was 2 mm KCl, 92 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 4 mm NaOH, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained 3 m KCl. The microelectrode resistance was 0.1 to 0.6 MΩ. Output current was filtered at 1 kHz by a four-pole Bessel filter. A holding potential during intervals (10 s) was set to -70 mV for hyper-polarization and 70 mV for depolarization. KCNQ2/3 currents were evoked by a depolarizing step to 60 mV, 50 ms. The sampling frequency was 13-27.7 kHz. Data were acquired by ITC-16 AD/DA converter with pulse software (HEKA) on a Macintosh computer. The recordings were performed at 23-27 °C. Data were analyzed with Igor pro (WaveMetrics, Inc.) and presented as mean ± S.D. Drugs—Sodium pervanadate (Na3VO8) was applied to inhibit the phosphatase activity of the phosphatase domain. Sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) (Sigma) was dissolved in water to make 20 mm stock solution. 20 mm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Wako) was added in a final volume of 200 ml, and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Then catalase (Sigma, 100 unit) was added. The solution was then kept on ice until used for recording. Catalase was dissolved in water to make a stock solution of 10 mg/ml. For intracellular perfusion of orthovanadate, orthovanadate was diluted to 200 μm in the internal solution for patch pipette. Identification and Electrophysiological Characterization of Dr-VSP—Our bioinformatics search showed that ortholog genes of Ci-VSP exist in genomes of zebrafish, Xenopus, chick, mouse, rat, and human. To clone a teleost Ci-VSP ortholog cDNA, RT-PCR was performed using RNA isolated from 24- to 60-h stage embryos of zebrafish, D. rerio. The amino acid sequence of mouse VSP was used as a query against the zebrafish data base of expressed sequenced tag. By subcloning RT-PCR products, a single species of cDNA that matches the sequence of the EST clone was obtained. The deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length cDNA of Dr-VSP showed significant similarity to Ci-VSP (31% identity in the transmembrane regions and 53% in the cytoplasmic region) and human PTEN (26% identity in the cytoplasmic region). Like Ci-VSP, Dr-VSP shows a pattern of positively charged residues interspersed with hydrophobic residues in the 4th transmembrane segment (S4), which is a signature motif conserved among all voltage-gated ion channels. However, the position of positive charges in Dr-VSP is slightly distinct from Ci-VSP. Dr-VSP has isoleucine, at a site corresponding to arginine (Arg-229) of Ci-VSP (Fig. 2A). The cytoplasmic phosphatase domain of VSP has a sequence, HCKGGKGRTG, similar to that of PTEN in the phosphatase active site. This includes cysteine that is known to exist at the active site of all spectrums of phosphoinositide phosphatase (9Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases to provide thiol-phosphate bonding during catalysis. The downstream region of the cytoplasmic domain has high sequence homology to the C2 domain of human PTEN. Like Ci-VSP, Dr-VSP lacks the PDZ domain which is contained in the C terminus of PTEN (supplemental Fig. S1). To examine whether the VSD of Dr-VSP senses membrane potential like Ci-VSP (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), we measured gating currents as an indication of the movement of the voltage sensor (1Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). A tsA201 cell line was used as the heterologous expression system. On transient transfection of Dr-VSP cDNA, cells produced highly robust ON- and OFF-gating currents (Ig-ON and Ig-OFF) (Fig. 1A). The total and standardized curve of the charge versus voltage (Q-V) showed that charge movement was almost equal between Ig-ON and Ig-OFF over a wide range of membrane potential (Fig. 1B and inset), consistent with the interpretation that both ON-charges and OFF-charges are derived from the same structural elements. Decay kinetics of Ig-ON and Ig-OFF were examined at distinct voltage levels by measuring half-decay times (Fig. 1, C and D). Both of Ig-ON and Ig-OFF are voltage-dependent. Notably, decay kinetics of Ig-OFF during a fixed repolarizing membrane potential were dependent on the levels of preceding depolarizing pulse; Ig-OFF became slower as depolarizing pulse became more positive (Fig. 1C). Ci-VSP was also expressed in tsA201 cells to compare with gating currents of Dr-VSP. Gating currents from Dr-VSP were more robust than from Ci-VSP (Fig. 1A, bottom); maximum carried charge was 2.89 ± 0.27 pC/pF (n = 5) for Dr-VSP versus 1.08 ± 0.1 pC/pF (n = 6) in Ci-VSP. The voltage-charge relationship was more positive for Dr-VSP (voltage for half-activation V½, 94.27 ± 6.83 mV, n = 5) than Ci-VSP (V½, 62.9 mV ± 4.5 mV, n = 6). The Q-V curve of Ci-VSP was less steep than Dr-VSP(Fig. 1B); the effective valence, Z values of Ig-OFF for Ci-VSP and Dr-VSP were 1.01 ± 0.15, n = 6, and 1.61 ± 0.15, n = 5, respectively (see Table 1). Such properties of voltage sensing of Ci-VSP are similar to those previously characterized in Xenopus oocytes(8).TABLE 1ON and OFF gating parametersV½(ON)V½(Off)Z (ON)Z (Off)Maximum charge (Off)Current densitymVmVpCpC/pFDr-VSP(WT), n = 596.70 ± 7.0794.00 ± 6.131.45 ± 0.041.61 ± 0.154.57 ± 0.292.89 ± 0.27Dr-VSP(R153Q), n = 1213.06 ± 7.6016.18 ± 8.940.60 ± 0.100.77 ± 0.301.14 ± 0.621.58 ± 0.64Dr-VSP(C302S), n = 6107.16 ± 7.8296.48 ± 5.981.54 ± 0.251.77 ± 0.172.25 ± 0.511.13 ± 0.52Dr-VSP(DM), n = 921.25 ± 2.5825.26 ± 2.511.42 ± 0.251.52 ± 0.211.93 ± 0.551.23 ± 0.78Dr-VSP(TM), n = 331.62 ± 5.3536.28 ± 4.101.49 ± 0.111.42 ± 0.101.28 ± 0.300.99 ± 0.09Ci-VSP(WT), n = 655.26 ± 5.1944.83 ± 4.160.90 ± 0.071.01 ± 0.145.24 ± 1.171.08 ± 0.10Ci-VSP(C363S), n = 393.47 ± 9.6435.46 ± 0.140.65 ± 0.081.01 ± 0.151.75 ± 0.650.12 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab In voltage-gated ion channels, positive charges in S4 play critical roles in voltage sensing. To test if positive charges on S4 are critical for the voltage-sensing nature of Dr-VSP, arginine, Arg-153 (Fig. 2A), was replaced by the uncharged residue, glutamine, and gating currents were measured. Although gating currents of R153Q were less robust (1.58 ± 0.64 pC/pF, n = 12) than for the wild type Dr-VSP, the kinetics of ON- and OFF-currents were significantly faster (Fig. 2B). Ig-OFF exhibited two phases of decay. The Q-V curve was shifted leftward by about 80 mV (V½ was 16.18 mV ± 8.94 mV, n = 12) compared with the wild type (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with the finding that a similar mutant of Ci-VSP with replacement by glutamine at a site, R217Q, corresponding to Arg-153 of Dr-VSP, showed a leftward shift of voltage dependence as shown by voltage clamp fluorometry (14Kohout S.C. Ulbrich M.H. Bell S.C. Isacoff E.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, voltage dependence was significantly less steep than the wild type (valence, Z, for OFF-gating currents was 0.77 ± 0.30 versus 1.61 ± 0.15 for R153Q and wild type, respectively), consistent with the idea that positive charge on Arg-153 contributes to charge movement upon voltage-triggered conformational change of the voltage sensor. When the S4 amino acid sequences of Ci-VSP and Dr-VSP were aligned, residue 165 was different, arginine for Ci-VSP and isoleucine for Dr-VSP (Fig. 2A). To test if the distinct voltage dependence of charge movements between Ci-VSP and Dr-VSP is derived from the amino acid sequence in the VSD, Ile-165 was replaced by arginine, and gating currents were compared. In Dr-VSP I165R, Ig-OFF was faster, and the Q-V curve was shifted leftward as compared with the wild type. This Q-V curve has a similar profile to that of Ci-VSP (Fig. 3C). We also introduced arginine 156, and this mutation accelerated kinetics and exhibited a leftward shift of the Q-V curve (data not shown), although the shift was less remarkable than that of I165R. These findings indicate that positively charged residues of S4 play principal roles in determining voltage dependence of voltage sensor of VSP. PTEN is known to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (9Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar), and Ci-VSP exhibits similar activity (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). A fusion protein of C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with glutathione S-transferase (GST) of Dr-VSP was synthesized in E. coli, and phosphatase activity was measured by the malachite green assay as described previously (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Released phosphate increased in a time-dependent manner and became saturated around at 60 min from the starting point (Fig. 4B). The concentration of released phosphate was estimated as 500 pmol with 1 nmol of substrate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. This value was much higher than the low constant level when PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was incubated with GST alone. Cysteine is a critical residue for phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (9Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar), and mutating the corresponding site to serine in Ci-VSP abolished its phosphatase activity (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). No free phosphate (Pi) was detected when the cytoplasmic region of Dr-VSP(C302S) was incubated with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 4B). To test if the phosphatase activity of Dr-VSP is voltage-sensitive, we took a similar approach to that utilized for the analysis of Ci-VSP (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide-sensitive potassium channels were coexpressed with Dr-VSP in Xenopus oocytes, and their voltage dependence was examined following the method previously established (8Murata Y. Iwasaki H. Sasaki M. Inaba K. Okamura Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The KCNQ2/3 potassium channel that mediates M current and is best characterized for its sensitivity to PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration (19Zhang H. Craciun L.C. Mirshahi T. Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Jin T.

https://openalex.org/W2062515644,"Hyperactivation of ErbB signaling is implicated in metastatic breast cancer. However, the mechanisms that cause dysregulated ErbB signaling and promote breast carcinoma cell invasion remain poorly understood. One pathway leading to ErbB activation that remains unexplored in breast carcinoma cell invasion involves transactivation by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a GPCR activated by extracellular proteases, is overexpressed in invasive breast cancer. PAR1 is also proposed to function in breast cancer invasion and metastasis, but how PAR1 contributes to these processes is not known. In this study, we report that proteolytic activation of PAR1 by thrombin induces persistent transactivation of EGFR and ErbB2/HER2 in invasive breast carcinoma, but not in normal mammary epithelial cells. PAR1-stimulated EGFR and ErbB2 transactivation leads to prolonged extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 signaling and promotes breast carcinoma cell invasion. We also show that PAR1 signaling through Gαi/o and metalloprotease activity is critical for ErbB transactivation and cellular invasion. Finally, we demonstrate that PAR1 expression in invasive breast carcinoma is essential for tumor growth in vivo assessed by mammary fat pad xenografts. These studies reveal a critical role for PAR1, a receptor activated by tumor-generated proteases, in hyperactivation of ErbB signaling that promotes breast carcinoma cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2019645929,"Mature spermatozoa acquire progressive motility only after ejaculation. Their journey in the female reproductive tract also includes suppression of progressive motility, reactivation, capacitation, and hyperactivation of motility (whiplash), the mechanisms of which are obscure. MAPKs are key regulatory enzymes in cell signaling, participating in diverse cellular functions such as growth, differentiation, stress, and apoptosis. Here we report that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK are primarily localized to the tail of mature human spermatozoa. Surprisingly, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2, which is thought to be ubiquitously expressed, could not be detected in mature human spermatozoa. ERK1/2 stimulation is downstream to protein kinase C (PKC) activation, which is also present in the human sperm tail (PKCβI and PKCϵ). ERK1/2 stimulates and p38 inhibits forward and hyperactivated motility, respectively. Both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK are involved in the acrosome reaction. Using a proteomic approach, we identified ARHGAP6, a RhoGAP, as an ERK substrate in PMA-stimulated human spermatozoa. Inverse correlation was obtained between the relative expression level of ERK1 or the relative activation level of p38 and sperm motility, forward progression motility, sperm morphology, and viability. Therefore, increased expression of ERK1 and activated p38 can predict poor human sperm quality. Mature spermatozoa acquire progressive motility only after ejaculation. Their journey in the female reproductive tract also includes suppression of progressive motility, reactivation, capacitation, and hyperactivation of motility (whiplash), the mechanisms of which are obscure. MAPKs are key regulatory enzymes in cell signaling, participating in diverse cellular functions such as growth, differentiation, stress, and apoptosis.

Therefore, increased expression of ERK1 and activated p38 can predict poor human sperm quality. Sperm are immotile in the testes and they acquire progressive motility after ejaculation. They cross the uterine cervix, undergo suppression of progressive motility, become capacitated (capable to fertilize), including resumption of another form of motility, hyperactivation, bind the egg, undergo the acrosome reaction, and fertilize it (1Garbers D.L.

Relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate spermatozoan functions in general and the various forms of motility in particular (1Garbers D.L.

MAPK cascades consist of several tiers of protein kinases that activate each other by sequential phosphorylation. Four major MAPK cascades are known in mammals: ERK1–2, JNK 1–3, p38 α–δ, and ERK5 (big MAPK; BMK) (3Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 4Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Activation of MAPK is initiated by activation of MAP3Ks by the small G-proteins of the Ras family (e.g. Ras, CDC42, and Rac), followed by sequential activation of MAPKKs and MAPKs. The prototypic ERK cascade is activated by growth factors, mitogens, and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and consists of Rafs (MAP3K), MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and several MAPK-activating protein kinases (MAPKAPKs). The stress-activated protein kinases are now known as JNK and p38 MAPK. Both are initiated by stress stimuli, GPCRs, inflammatory cytokines, and growth factors. JNK1–3 consists of a sequential activation of Rac1/Cdc42, mixed lineage kinases as MAP3Ks, MAPK kinases 4 and 7, and JNK1–3. The p38 MAPK cascade is composed of sequential activation of MAP3Ks, MKK3/4/6, p38α–δ, and several MAPKAPKs (3Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 4Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Mature spermatozoa are fully differentiated cells that lack active transcriptional machinery. Hence, it is of great interest to investigate whether ejaculated human spermatozoa express and utilize MAPKs, which specialize in growth, differentiation, and stress. Because spermatozoa lack those functions, the studies might point to novel functions mediated by MAPKs. During spermatogenesis, MAPKs mediate cell division, differentiation, survival, adhesion, and death (8Wong C.H. Cheng C.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 286: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). MAPKs were reported to play a role during meiotic progression of mouse spermatocytes (9Sette C. Barchi M. Bianchini A. Conti M. Rossi P. Geremia R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2005; 286: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the role of MAPK in mature mammalian spermatozoan motility, capacitation, and acrosome reaction is limited and controversial as detailed below (10Lu Q. Sun Q.Y. Breitbart H. Chen D.Y. Arch. Androl. 1999; 43: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Baldi E. Luconi M. Bonaccorsi L. Forti G. Front.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4692-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In particular the role of JNK and p38 MAPK in ejaculated spermatozoa is not known (8Wong C.H. Cheng C.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 286: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We therefore inquired whether ejaculated mature human spermatozoa express and utilize the various MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) (6Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 268-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 7Yoon S. Seger R. Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may orchestrate the fine-tuning of sperm motility. Our results indicate that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, but not JNK1/2, are expressed in the tail of ejaculated human spermatozoa. Activation of ERK1/2 is downstream to PKC activation, and two of its isoforms (PKCβI and PKCϵ) are also present in the human sperm tail (18Rotem R. Paz G.F. Homonnai Z.T. Kalina M. Lax J. Breitbart H. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2235-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we discovered that ERK stimulates and p38 MAPK inhibits forward and hyperactivated motility, respectively. We also found that both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK are positively involved in PKC-mediated acrosome reaction. Using a proteomic approach, we identified ARHGAP6, a RhoGAP, as an ERK substrate in PMA-stimulated human spermatozoa. Finally, we found that inverse correlation exists between ERK1 and phospho-p38 and sperm motility, forward progression motility, sperm morphology, and viability. Indeed, increased expression of total ERK1 and activated phospho-p38 MAPK could predict poor human sperm quality. Preparation of Human Spermatozoa—Human semen was obtained from healthy donors with normal sperm density, motility, and morphology according to World Health Organization guidelines (19World Health Organization WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Sperm-Cervical Mucus Interaction. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1999Google Scholar) or from males attending either the Male Infertility Unit, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Israel, or the Andrology Laboratory in Assuta Hashalom Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. The human semen was liquefied for 60 min at 36 °C. Sperm was washed twice with Ham's F-10 medium containing bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.3%) and incubated with the medium for 3 h for capacitation (20Rotem R. Paz G.F. Homonnai Z.T. Kalina M. Naor Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7305-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PMA or progesterone (Sigma) were added with or without the PKC inhibitor GF109203x (Calbiochem) or the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126, or the p38 inhibitors SB203580 and PD169316 (Biomol), or the Ca2+ inhibitors EGTA, nifedipine, and BAPTA/AM (Sigma) to the above medium as described in the legends. Immunocytochemistry—Human sperm (1.5 × 106) were collected on glass slides by cytospin (600 rpm). The cells were fixed and permeabilized by cold methanol (10 min), followed by cold acetone (10 min) (20Rotem R. Paz G.F. Homonnai Z.T. Kalina M. Naor Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7305-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with the respective anti-general MAPK (ERK, JNK, and p38) antibodies (Sigma) or antibodies against mSos, MEK1/2, Raf-1, or tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:25) for 18 h at 4 °C. Cells were then treated with biotinylated second antibody (1:100) for 30 min. After washing in PBS the cells were further treated for 30 min at room temperature using the avidin-biotin complex method as described previously (20Rotem R. Paz G.F. Homonnai Z.T. Kalina M. Naor Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7305-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Visualization was performed in solutions containing diaminobenzidine (0.25 mg/ml) and 0.01% H2O2 in PBS. Specificity of the MAPK staining was confirmed by omission of the primary antibody and by the preabsorption of the antibody with an excess of the respective MAPK peptide (Sigma). All the reagents for the immunohistochemistry studies were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Immunoelectron Microscopy—Human sperm were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 60 min at room temperature (21Kalina M. Socher R. Rotem R. Naor Z. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After washing, the tissue samples were dehydrated in acetone and embedded in araldite. The cells were not treated with osmium because of loss of antigenicity in osmium-treated cells. Sections were placed on silver grids, and immunogold labeling was performed as described previously (21Kalina M. Socher R. Rotem R. Naor Z. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sections were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min, washed in PBS, and placed in 1% BSA for 1 h. After draining, the sections were incubated with anti-ERK antibody (1:50) (Sigma) for 18 h at 4 °C. After rinsing in 0.05 m Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.3, the sections were incubated for 1 h with 8- or 15-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Biocell, Cardiff, UK) and diluted 1:10 with TBS, pH 8.4, containing 1% egg albumin. Following the immunostaining, sections were rinsed, and contrast was enhanced with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were then examined with a JEOL 100B electron microscope. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Sperm were washed and smeared on polylysine slides and then allowed to air-dry. Cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized with Triton X-100, 0.5% buffered in PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% BSA buffered in PBS. Cells were probed first with monoclonal anti-p38 (1:100) or anti-ERK1/2 (1:100) polyclonal antibody, washed three times with PBS, and then probed with a secondary anti-rabbit Hilyte Fluor™ 488-labeled antibody or a secondary anti-mouse Hilyte Fluor™ 647-labeled antibody (Anaspec). Slides were viewed with a laser scanning microscope (510, Zeiss). Activation of MAPK Cascades—Capacitated and noncapacitated human spermatozoa were prepared as above and stimulated with PMA, progesterone, or other drugs as indicated (Sigma), and cell extract was used for Western blotting. After stimulation, the cells were diluted immediately with excess Ham's F-10 medium, precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 s at room temperature, and washed once more, and the resulted pellets were stored at -20 °C until used. The thawed pellets (all these steps were made at 4 °C) were resuspended in a minimal volume of lysis buffer (50 μl per 3 × 107 cells) made of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 nm okadaic acid, 0.50% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The suspensions tubes were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatants, which contained unbound proteins, were collected, and aliquots from each sample (20 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with mouse monoclonal anti-active (doubly phosphorylated) MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) (Sigma), MPM2 (anti-phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-ARHGAP6 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abnova). Total MAPKs were detected with polyclonal antibodies for the various general MAPKs (Sigma) as a control. The blots were developed with alkaline phosphatase- or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Fab antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The blots were autoradiographed on Kodak X-100 films, and the phosphorylation was quantified by densitometry (690 densitometer, Bio-Rad). Each band from the anti-phospho-MAPK (ERK, JNK, and p38) was normalized to the corresponding band from the anti-general MAPK antibodies blot for even loading (22Bonfil D. Chuderland D. Kraus S. Shahbazian D. Friedberg I. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2228-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recombinant Expression of pERK—To obtain doubly phosphorylated ERK, activated human GST-ERK2 was co-expressed with constitutively active MEK1 in BL21 bacteria, as described (23Wilsbacher J.L. Cobb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The bacteria were grown in 2YT medium at 30 °C to an absorbance of 0.6, and then 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for an additional 4 h. Proteins were purified over glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or nickel-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 100-mm plates 24 h prior to transfection and were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA ARHGAP6-GFP, using the calcium phosphate method, and grown as above. 16 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced, and 48 h later the cells were lysed. Lysis buffer contained 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors mixture. The lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (Roche Applied Science) conjugated to protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by gentle shaking for 3–4 h in 4 °C, and washed three times with lysis buffer. Samples were frozen in -20 °C and were later subjected to in vitro phosphorylation. In Vitro Phosphorylation—Immunoprecipitated ARHGAP6 attached to beads (15 μl) (0.5 μg per reaction) was mixed with immunoprecipitated ERK attached to beads (15 μl). The buffer reaction mix (3×) (75 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 3.8 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm orthovanadate, 30 mm MgCl2, 30 μm calmidozolium, 0.3 mm ATP), containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4000 cpm/pmol), was added to the reaction in a final volume of 30 μl and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 4× Sample buffer, and the phosphorylated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of MBP (8 μg per reaction) by ERK was carried out as a positive control. Assessment of Sperm Motility—Progressive flagellar motility was determined manually (20Rotem R. Paz G.F. Homonnai Z.T. Kalina M. Naor Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7305-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or by using Computer-aided Sperm Analysis (CASA) (Sperm Analysis System version 12-IVOS, Hamilton Thorne Biosciences, Beverly, MA), which was also used to measure hyperactivation (24Ho H.C. Suarez S.S. Reproduction. 2001; 122: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Hyperactivation parameters were as follows: curvilinear velocity >100 μm/s, linearity <60%, amplitude of lateral head >5 μm. Assessment of Sperm Acrosome Reaction—The percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm was determined microscopically on air-dried sperm smears using FITC-conjugated Pisum sativum agglutinin, which is a fluorescent lectin capable of binding to the acrosomal content. Washed cells (107 cells/ml) were capacitated for 3 h at 37 °C and 0.5% CO2 in F-10 medium supplemented with BSA 3 mg/ml (20Rotem R. Paz G.F. Homonnai Z.T. Kalina M. Naor Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7305-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The inhibitors were added for the last 10 min of incubation, and then PMA (100 nm) was added for another hour. At the end of incubation an aliquot of the sperm was spread on microscope slides and allowed to air-dry. The sperm were then permeabilized by methanol for 15 min at room temperature, washed once with 25 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, for 5 min and twice with H2O at 5-min intervals, air-dried, and then incubated with FITC-P. sativum agglutinin (60 μg/ml) for 1 h, washed twice with H2O at 5-min intervals, and mounted with FluoroGuard Antifade (Bio-Rad). For each experiment, at least 150 cells per slide in duplicates were evaluated. Cells with green staining over the acrosomal cap were considered acrosome-intact; those with equatorial green staining or no staining were considered acrosome-reacted. The analysis of multiple groups was performed by one-way analysis of variance using SPSS software with p < 0.05 considered significant. Correlation between MAPK Levels and Sperm Quality Parameters—Human spermatozoa from 47 males attending the Male Infertility Unit were analyzed for MAPK levels and activity as above and correlated with percent sperm motility (SM), forward progression motility (FPM), morphology, and viability (19World Health Organization WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Sperm-Cervical Mucus Interaction. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1999Google Scholar). The correlations were obtained using Pearson correlation coefficients. Logarithmic transformation (when needed) was used to obtain normal distribution. Aiming to discriminate normal and abnormal motility and FPM samples, single variable analysis was used utilizing Student’s t test. Stepwise logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To define optimal cut points for MAPK levels, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (25Zweig M.H. Campbell G. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (5341) Google Scholar) was used discriminating normal versus abnormal motility and FPM. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), which represented the accuracy of the test, and a p value <0.05 was considered predictive. Data Analysis—Results from two or three experiments were expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were subjected to statistical analysis with one-way analysis of variance and Fisher’s protected least significant difference tests, and statistical significance was accepted when p < 0.05. Other statistical tests are detailed in the legends. ERK1/2 (and its cascade members Sos/Raf-1/MEK1) and p38 MAPK, but not JNK, were identified in the tail of mature ejaculated human spermatozoa by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1A). The ERK cascade (Sos/Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2) and p38 were localized in the neck and distributed along the mid-, principal, and end pieces of the tail. Tubulin in the axoneme was evenly distributed along the tail. Electron microscopy revealed (Fig. 1B) that ERK1/2 was localized to the outer dense fibers. Confocal microscopy revealed that ERK1/2 is distributed mainly to the entire mid-piece (Fig. 2), whereas p38 is primarily localized to the upper mid-piece (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Fluorescence microscopy for expression of ERK1/2 and p38 in human spermatozoa. Precapacitated spermatozoa were reacted with anti-ERK (A) and anti-p38 (E) antibodies. Phase-contrast images are shown for ERK1/2 and p38 immunolabeling in B and F, respectively, and negative controls with secondary antibodies are shown in C and G. Phase-contrast images are shown for controls with secondary antibodies in D and H. Like the diaminobenzidine staining of Fig. 1, ERK1/2 was distributed along the tail, whereas p38 seems to localize also in post-acrosomal regions, the mid-piece, and the tail (C). Scale bars indicate 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then identified the presence of active ERK1/2 and p38 in human ejaculated spermatozoa by Western blotting and compared it with the known PMA-stimulated MAPK in the mouse pituitary gonadotrope LβT2 cells (22Bonfil D. Chuderland D. Kraus S. Shahbazian D. Friedberg I. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2228-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Human ejaculate spermatozoa express mainly ERK2, which was stimulated by PMA or by the general activator vanadate peroxide (Na3VO4). PMA serves as an analog of diacylglycerol, the physiological activator of PKC, and both stimulants revealed the activation of ERK1. The sperm-ligand progesterone, reported to activate human sperm ERK (26Luconi M. Krausz C. Barni T. Vannelli G.B. Forti G. Baldi E. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), had no effect. p38 MAPK in its phosphorylated form was very low in control LβT2 cells but was present in spermatozoa. We could not detect further activation of phospho-p38 by PMA, vanadate, nor progesterone versus a positive effect of PMA in LβT2 cells (Fig. 3). The data suggest that ejaculate sperm p38 MAPK is fully phosphorylated, hence activated. p38 MAPK is encoded by four genes that yield nine isoforms (5Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar), and we could detect mainly p38α and occasionally p38β. JNK1/2 is present in LβT2 cells and is activated by PMA but is undetectable in PMA-, vanadate-, or progesterone-treated spermatozoa. We then incubated spermatozoa for 2.5 h in a capacitation medium (Fig. 4) to reach capacitation in vitro (20Rotem R. Paz G.F. Homonnai Z.T. Kalina M. Naor Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7305-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Exposure to PMA (15 min) throughout the entire capacitation process further stimulated ERK1/2 levels in comparison with controls (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01). Thus, ERK activation by PMA can be detected in both noncapacitated and capacitated spermatozoa. ERK2 activation by PMA was sensitive to the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 (Fig. 5A, left panel), confirming the functioning of a canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade (6Murphy L.O. Blenis J.

The selective p38 inhibitor SB203580 had no effect on PMA to ERK signaling, ruling out an inhibitory cross-talk between p38 MAPK and ERK (27Zhang H. Shi X. Hampong M. Blanis L. Pelech S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6905-6908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The selective pan-PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, completely abolished the PMA-induced activation of ERK1/2, indicating that the PMA effect was PKC-dependent (Fig. 5A, right panel). ERK activation by PMA was insensitive to EGTA (extracellular Ca2+ chelator), to nifedipine (voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker), or to BAPTA/AM (intracellular Ca2+ chelator) (Fig. 5B), unlike LβT2 cells, in which activation of ERK by PMA was markedly reduced by the above Ca2+ inhibitors (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5A, PMA-induced ERK activation in human spermatozoa is sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibitors and insensitive to p38 inhibitor (left panel) and to the pan-PKC inhibitor GF109203X (right panel). Capacitated human sperm were preincubated with the specific MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 (50 μm) and U0126 (50 μm), the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (50 μm) and the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (3 μm) for 15 min and PMA (100 nm) was added for another 15 min. Cell lysates were subsequently prepared and ERK2 activity was determined as in Fig. 3. Bars are mean ± S.D. from three experiments. Means designated by different letters are significantly different (p < 0.05). B, PMA-induced ERK activation is Ca2+-independent. Capacitated human spermatozoa were preincubated with or without various Ca2+ blockers: nifedipine (l-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker, 1 μm), EGTA (a general Ca2+ chelator, 5 mm) and BAPTA/AM (intracellular Ca2+ chelator, 50 μm) for 30 min. PMA (100 nm) was then added for 15 min and ERK2 activity was determined as in Fig. 3. A representative blot is shown and bars are mean ± S.D. from three experiments.

The last decade has revealed much knowledge about the intracellular events accompanied by T lymphocyte activation following recognition of antigens bound to major histocompatibility complexes. K+ selective ion channels in T cells and their role in immune responses have been discussed for decades, since the discovery that non-selective K+ blockers could inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro (1Schell S.R.

The role of K+ channels in the activation of T cells is pivotal, because opening the channels hyperpolarizes the membrane potential, which in turn increases the influx of Ca2+ via Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels (CRAC) 4The abbreviations used are: CRAC, calcium release-activated calcium channel; KV1.3, voltage-gated potassium channel; IKCa1, intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channel; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CFSE, carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MBP, myelin basic protein. 4The abbreviations used are: CRAC, calcium release-activated calcium channel; KV1.3, voltage-gated potassium channel; IKCa1, intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channel; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CFSE, carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MBP, myelin basic protein.

With the combined use of patch clamp electrophysiology and molecular biology, the voltage-dependent K+ channel 1.3 (KV1.3 channel) and the intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated channel (IKCa channel; IKCa1 or KCa3.1; which acquires its Ca2+ dependence from constitutively bound calmodulin) were found to be the dominating K+ channel types expressed in T cells (7DeCoursey T.E.

Vamosi G. Bodnar A. Gaspar R. Damjanovich S. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 565-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Selective blockade of KV1.3 leads to suppression of T cell effector function, e.g. decreased cytokine release and suppression of proliferation (11Ghanshani S. Wulff H. Miller M.J. Rohm H. Neben A.

Underlining this finding, in vivo blockade of KV1.3 has been shown to mediate beneficial effects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model for multiple sclerosis (12Beeton C. Wulff H. Barbaria J. Clot-Faybesse O. Pennington M. Bernard D. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Beraud E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The importance of K+ channels has been further validated by research on human T lymphocytes, which revealed a differential expression patterns of KV1.3 and KCa3.1 on specific T cell subtypes (14Cahalan M.D. Wulff H. Chandy K.G. J. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 21: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, “chronically activated” T cells induced by repeated antigenic challenges of the cells selectively and stably up-regulate KV1.3 channels (15Beeton C. Chandy K.G. Neuroscientist. 2005; 11: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these cells could be defined as CCR7−CD45RA− effector memory T lymphocytes (16Wulff H. Calabresi P.A. Allie R. Yun S. Pennington M. Beeton C. Chandy K.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1703-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), which are implicated in different autoimmune disorders (15Beeton C. Chandy K.G. Neuroscientist. 2005; 11: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In agreement with that KV1.3 has been shown to be highly expressed in human myelin-reactive T cells of patients with multiple sclerosis (17Wulff H. Beeton C. Chandy K.G. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2003; 6: 640-647PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in autoreactive T cells from patients with other autoimmune diseases such as type-1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis (18Beeton C. Wulff H.

Thus K+ channels, especially KV1.3, have emerged as attractive targets for highly selective immunosuppressive strategies applicable for example in the therapy of T cell-mediated autoimmune disorders (19Kleinschnitz C. Meuth S.G. Kieseier B.C. Wiendl H. Endocr. Metab. Immune Disord. Drug Targets. 2006; 7: 35-63Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Two-pore-domain K+ channels (K2P, KCNK), often described as “background” or “leak” channels, play a pivotal role in setting the resting membrane potential and modulating neuronal excitability (20Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 21Lesage F.

Kanyshkova T. Broicher T. Munsch T. Pape H.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6460-6469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). K2P channels consist of four transmembrane domains arranged in tandem building two pores. Importantly, their action is mostly time and voltage independent (21Lesage F. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). TASK1 and TASK3 channels, two functional members of the K2P channel family, can be regulated by a diversity of stimuli (extracellular acidification, Gq proteins, and muscarine (20Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 22Chen W.C. Davis R.L. Hear.

Based on their specific electrophysiological properties, pharmacological profile, and functional impact on the resting membrane potential they might represent a relevant ionic conductance influencing basic T cell function. We therefore questioned whether K2P channels are expressed on T lymphocytes and dissect their functional role on the level of electrophysiological properties and T cell effector function, both in vitro and in an animal model of multiple sclerosis in vivo. Materials and Reagents—Charybdotoxin, bupivacaine, spermine, and ruthenium red (diluted in H2O; Sigma), Psora-4 (DMSO; Carl Roth GmbH, Germany), and anandamide (EtOH; Tocris, Germany) were frozen as aliquots for further use. CD3/CD28 dynabeads for cell stimulation were obtained from Dynal Biotech (Karlsruhe, Germany). Annexin-FLUOS (Roche), propidium iodide (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), DAPI (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) were used for cell labeling. Isolation and Culture of Human T Cells—Human T cells were purified from peripheral blood samples of healthy donors (n = 49). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared by density centrifugation (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This was followed by magnetic cell sorting (MACS®, CD3 Microbeads, Miltenyi Biotec, Karlsruhe, Germany) for CD3. Purity of CD3+ T lymphocytes was >98% as assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% human AB-serum, 25 mm HEPES, 1% glutamine, and 1% antibiotics. Assessment of T Cell Function, Pharmacological Blockades— 4 × 106 freshly isolated CD3+ T lymphocytes were seeded in 1 ml of T cell medium per well. CD3/CD28 dynabeads (Dynal Biotech) were added at a T cell to bead ratio of 1:1. Channel blockers in different concentrations were applied in parallel to bead stimulation (KV1.3 blockers, 10 and 100 nm charybdotoxin, and 1, 10, and 100 nm Psora-4; TASK1/3 blocker, 30, 100, and 250 μm bupivacaine; TASK1 inhibitor, 3, 30, and 100 μm anandamide; TASK3 blockers, 50 μm, 500 μm, and 1 mm spermine, and 100 nm, 1 μm, 10 μm ruthenium red). The solvent solution in the final experimental solution did not exceed 1%. Application of the solvent alone (1%) did not influence the analyzed parameters. Stimulations were all done in duplicates. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cells were centrifuged and subjected to further analysis by flow cytometry (stainings for annexin V and propidium iodide). In parallel, supernatants were assessed for IFNγ or IL2 protein levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Flow Cytometry for TASK Channel Expression on T Lymphocytes—Flow cytometry acquisition was done by standard methods. For antibody staining cells were resuspended in FACS® buffer (PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3), directly labeled antibodies were added. For annexin V/propidium iodide assays, cells were resuspended in annexin binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.18 mm CaCl2) and stained with annexin-FLUOS (Roche) and propidium iodide (Calbiochem). For evaluation of TASK1/3 antibody specificity the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-TASK1 (number P0981, Sigma), goat anti-TASK1 (number SC-32067), rabbit anti-TASK3 (number AB5721, Chemicon, Ochsenhausen, Germany), and goat anti-TASK3 (number SC-11320, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate or donkey anti-goat Cy3; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) using standard protocols for extracellular (see above) and intracellular staining (permeabilization buffer and fixation buffer from ebioscience, San Diego, CA). Data acquisition was done using a FACS Calibur system (BD Biosciences). Results were analyzed using CellQuest Pro Software (BD Biosciences). T Cell Proliferation Assay in the Presence and Absence of TASK Channel Modulators—Human T cells were labeled with 4 μm CFSE (Molecular Probes) for 10 min in the dark. RPMI containing 15% fetal calf serum was added for 20 min to stop labeling and was followed by three washing steps with RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum. CFSE-labeled cells were suspended in T cell medium and 1 × 105 cells per well were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the presence of CD3/CD28 beads and ion channel modulators as described above. After 3 days of proliferation CFSE-labeled cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. Proliferation assays were performed in duplicate and analyzed by flow cytometry calculating the responder frequency (dividing the number of dividing cells by total number of cells). Immunocytochemistry of Human and Rat T Cells—Immunocytochemical stainings were performed on human T cells and rat myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells. Cells were placed on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, cells were blocked with PBS containing 10% horse serum (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany), 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100 overnight. Next, the primary antibodies (rabbit anti-TASK1, Sigma; rabbit anti-TASK3, Chemicon; rabbit anti-KV1.3, Chemicon) were added and incubated for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated rabbit anti-goat, 1:100, Dianova) for another hour. Counterstaining of cell nuclei was performed using DAPI (0.5 μg/ml, Merck). Pictures were collected by immunofluorescence microscopy (Axiophot, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Negative controls without the primary antibody revealed no positive signals (data not shown). Western Blot of T Cell Lysates—Whole cell lysates from isolated purified T cells were used for Western blot analysis. In brief, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and solubilized by sonification on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged and protein content in the clarified supernatant was measured by Bradford reaction. Samples (50 μg/lane for TASK1 and 100 μg/lane for TASK3) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Whole mouse brain (C57/Bl6) was used as a positive control for TASK channel expression (23Meuth S.G. Budde T. Kanyshkova T. Broicher T. Munsch T. Pape H.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6460-6469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein transfer was visualized by Ponceau S staining and membranes were then blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk. The membranes were probed with rabbit anti-TASK1 (raised against the C-terminal part of the channel, 1:200; Sigma) or rabbit anti-TASK3 (polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal part of TASK3, 1:200; Chemicon), respectively. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:3,000; Amersham Biosciences). The antibody reaction was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Electrophysiological Recording of Whole Cell Outward Currents in T Cells—All experiments were conducted in whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Individual human T lymphocytes were visually identified by infrared differential interference contrast video microscopy (25Dodt H.U. Zieglgansberger W. Brain Res. 1990; 537: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Starting from a holding potential of -80 mV, membrane currents were recorded with pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass (GC150TF-10, Clark Electromedical Instruments, Kent, UK), connected to an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Elektronic, Lamprecht, Germany), and filled with (in mm): K-gluconate, 95; K3-citrate, 20; NaCl, 10; HEPES, 10; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 0.5; 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 1; Mg-ATP, 3; Na-GTP, 0.5. The internal solution was set to a pH of 7.25 with KOH and an osmolarity of 295 mOsm/kg. Extracellular solution (in mm): NaCl, 120; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.25; HEPES, 30; MgSO4, 2; CaCl2, 2; dextrose, 10; pH 7.2, was adjusted with NaOH and osmolarity was set to 305 mOsm/kg. Outward currents were elicited by repeated 500-ms pulses from -80 to 40 mV, applied at 30-s intervals. Typical electrode resistance was 3–6 megohms with an access resistance of 6–15 megohms. Series resistance compensation of more than 40% was routinely used. Voltage clamp experiments were governed by Pulse software (HEKA Elektronic) operating on an IBM compatible PC. A liquid junction potential of 6 ± 2 mV (n = 6) was measured and taken into account according to Neher (26Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Adoptive Transfer Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis—Female Lewis rats (150–160 g) were kept at standard conditions with free access to food and water. All animal experiments were approved by local authorities and conducted according to the German law of animal protection. Adoptive transfer experimental allergic encephalomyelitis was induced using a specific rat MBP T cell line (MBP-TC), which was generated as described previously (27Tischner D. Weishaupt A. van den Brandt J. Muller N. Beyersdorf N. Ip C.W. Toyka K.V. Hunig T. Gold R. Kerkau T. Reichardt H.M. Brain. 2006; 129: 2635-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The MBP-TCs used for this experiment were freshly restimulated for 3 days with antigen presenting cells and guinea pig MBP protein (in one Petri dish: 3 × 106 MBP-TCs + 150 × 106 antigen presenting cells + guinea pig MBP 10 μg/ml in 10 ml of restimulation medium, which consists of RPMI 1640 containing 1% glutamine, 1% antibiotics, 1% rat serum, and 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol). After 24 and 48 h cells were split and fed RPMI 1640 containing 1% glutamine, 1% antibiotics, 5% fetal calf serum, and 7.5% supernatants of concanavalin A-activated spleen cells. 24 h before cell transfer, channel blockers (10 nm Psora-4, 30 μm anandamide, and 100 nm charybdotoxin) were added directly into the cell cultures. After separation from the antigen presenting cells by Ficoll gradients, 6 × 106 MBP-TCs were transferred into four groups of Lewis rats intravenously (each n = 8–9) or plated for another 24 h for evaluation of IFNγ production. The animals were weighed and scored every day by a blinded investigator. Disease severity was assessed following a well established 6-grade scoring system: 0 = healthy; 1 = weight loss, limp tip of tail; 2 = limp tail, mild paresis; 3 = moderate paraparesis, ataxia; 4 = tetraparesis; 5 = moribund; 6 = death (28Schmidt J. Metselaar J.M. Wauben M.H. Toyka K.V. Storm G. Gold R. Brain. 2003; 126: 1895-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Numeric Model of T Cell Outward Currents—A single compartment T cell model including currents IKv1.3, ITASK, and IC was developed within the NEURON Simulation Environment (29Hines M.L. Carnevale N.T. Neural Comput. 1997; 9: 1179-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). The length and diameter of the compartment were set to 10 μm each, resulting in a total membrane area of 314 μm2.By assuming the following ion distribution (mm): K+in = 135, K+out = 3.5, Ca2+in = 6.5 × 10−4 (30Schwarz E.C. Kummerow C. Wenning A.S. Wagner K. Sappok A. Waggershauser K. Griesemer D. Strauss B. Wolfs M.J. Quintana A. Hoth M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Ca2+out = 0.13, we derived a potassium reversal potential (Ek) of about -94 mV and a calcium reversal potential (ECa) of about 98 mV following the Nernst equation. A specific membrane capacitance of 1 μF/cm2 was applied and all simulations were executed at 25 °C. The delayed rectifier current IKv1.3 was realized by adapting the membrane mechanism IKD from a Purkinje cell model (31De Schutter E. Bower J.M. J.

Shifting the half-maximum activation and inactivation to -28.8 and -57.8 mV, respectively, led to a current that matches the slowly inactivating current component seen in human T cells (32Teisseyre A. Mozrzymas J.W. Cell Mol. Biol. Lett. 2007; 12: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 33Beeton C. Pennington M.W. Wulff H. Singh S. Nugent D. Crossley G. Khaytin I. Calabresi P.A.

The maximum specific conductance gkbar was set to 0.0023 S/cm2 to reach a maximum current of about 200 pA at a membrane potential of +40 mV. The Ik current amplitude was calculated according to the following equation: Ik = gkbar × m × h × (VM - Ek); m, activation state variable; h, inactivation state variable; and VM, membrane voltage. Including the potassium leak current ITASK into the model was accomplished by using the corresponding membrane mechanism as described earlier (34Meuth S.G. Kanyshkova T. Meuth P. Landgraf P. Munsch T. Ludwig A. Hofmann F. Pape H.C. Budde T. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 1517-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The described kinetic of that current thereby remained unaffected, whereas the maximum specific conductance was adapted to reach a maximum current of about 200 pA at a membrane potential of +40 mV. The calcium-dependent potassium current IC originates from Arthur Houweling's NEURON demo. Kinetics of the current were described previously (35Meuth S.G. Aller M.I. Munsch T. Schuhmacher T.

Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1468-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and remained unchanged during all simulations. Setting the maximum specific conductance gkbar to 0.00034 S/cm2 resulted in an approximate 115 pA at a membrane potential of +40 mV. The following equation describes this non-inactivating current: Ik = gkbar × m × (VM - Ek), where Ik, current amplitude; m, activation state variable; and VM, membrane voltage. Statistical Analysis—All results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t test modified for small samples as described previously (36Meuth S.G. Simon O.J.

TASK1 and TASK3 Channels Are Expressed on Human T Lymphocytes—In a first set of experiments purified human CD3+ T lymphocytes (n = 6 donors) were assessed by immunocytochemistry for the expression of K2P channels TASK1 and TASK3. Voltage-gated KV1.3 channel was stained as a positive control (18Beeton C. Wulff H. Standifer N.E. Azam P. Mullen K.M. Pennington M.W. Kolski-Andreaco A. Wei E. Grino A. Counts D.R. Wang P.H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17414-17419Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity for TASK1, TASK3, and KV1.3 was clearly detectable (Fig. 1, A–C). Counterstaining of cell nuclei with DAPI indicated a membrane-bound distribution pattern for all channels, whereas incubation with the secondary antibody alone showed no signals (data not shown). Protein expression of TASK1 and TASK3 by human T cells was corroborated by Western blot analysis (n = 6 donors). The band recognized by the anti-TASK1 antibody was ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1D, lanes 4–6) as published earlier (37Rajan S. Preisig-Muller R. Wischmeyer E. Nehring R. Hanley P.J. Renigunta V. Musset B. Schlichthorl G. Derst C. Karschin A. Daut J. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In human lymphocytes as well as in our positive control (whole mouse brain, lane 3) a second band was visible at 65 kDa (Fig. 1D, second arrow), not visible in specificity controls (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). Using an anti-TASK3 antibody a distinct band at 60 kDa was visible, both in the mouse brain and human T lymphocytes (Fig. 1E, lanes 2–5). To verify antibody specificity, different antibodies for TASK1 and TASK3 were also assessed by flow cytometry. Antibodies from Sigma (TASK1) and Santa Cruz (TASK3) recognizing intracellular epitopes of these channels showed specific binding only in intracellular FACS staining with permeabilized cells (Fig. 1F, right side) and not in extracellular staining protocols (Fig. 1F, left side). The same specificity was found for an anti-TASK1 antibody (intracellular target) by Santa Cruz, whereas anti-TASK3 (extracellular; Chemicon) revealed positive signals in intracellular and extracellular staining protocols (data not shown). Taken together, these results point to expression of K2P channels TASK1 and -3 on human CD3+ T lymphocytes. TASK1 and TASK3 Modulate T Cell Effector Function: Pharmacological Blockade Inhibits IFNγ Secretion, IL2 Secretion, and T Cell Proliferation—To correlate K2P channel expression to T cell effector functions we next studied the influence of pharmacological blocking reagents for K+ channels on cytokine production and T cell proliferation. Human CD3+ T cells were stimulated with CD3/CD28 beads. Levels of IFNγ and IL2 secreted in the supernatants were assessed in response to application of different ion channel modulators. To exclude unspecific effects of the compounds on cell viability, each inhibitor was titrated and tested by annexin V/propidium iodide staining to estimate T cell apoptosis and necrosis. The gating procedure, results under control conditions, and after treatment with H2O2 (100 μm, positive control for cell death) are depicted in Fig. 2A. Charybdotoxin (C, 10 nm, 100 nm) and Psor"

AMPK in solution at low concentrations (∼1 mg/ml) largely consisted of individual heterotrimers in TEM analysis, revealed a precise 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the three subunits in MS, and behaved as an ideal solution in SAXS. At higher AMPK concentrations, SAXS revealed concentration-dependent, reversible dimerization of AMPK heterotrimers and formation of higher oligomers, also confirmed by STEM mass measurements. Single particle reconstruction and averaging by SAXS and TEM, respectively, revealed similar elongated, flat AMPK particles with protrusions and an indentation. In the lower AMPK concentration range, addition of AMP resulted in a significant decrease of the radius of gyration by ∼5% in SAXS, which indicates a conformational switch in AMPK induced by ligand binding. We propose a structural model involving a ligand-induced relative movement of the kinase domain resulting in a more compact heterotrimer and a conformational change in the kinase domain that protects AMPK from dephosphorylation of Thr172, thus positively affecting AMPK activity.

AMPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase, consisting of one catalytic α and two regulatory subunits (β and γ), that exist as multiple isoforms (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, γ3) and splice variants (γ2 and γ3), thus allowing for the generation of multiple heterotrimeric isoform combinations. Critical for activation of AMPK is its phosphorylation at Thr172 in the kinase domain of the α-subunit by either of the two upstream kinases of AMPK, LKB1-MO25α-STRADα or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) (6Hawley S.A.

More detailed structural information about mammalian heterotrimeric AMPK is needed to understand its complex molecular architecture and function. Valuable but limited insight has been provided by x-ray structures of isolated AMPK domains: the catalytic domain of the human α2-subunit (Protein Data Bank code 2H6D) and its yeast ortholog Snf1 (38Rudolph M.J.

More informative, but still limited in their explanatory power, are the recent x-ray structures of truncated versions of a mammalian AMPK complex (14Xiao B. Heath R. Saiu P. Leiper F.C. Leone P.

Science. 2007; 315: 1726-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (44Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). For successful crystallization, large truncations were introduced into the mammalian α- and β-subunits or their yeast homologs. The published core structures all lack the α-subunit kinase domain and a more or less large N-terminal part of the β-subunit. In the S. pombe and mammalian structures, almost 50% of the entire complex is missing. The S. cerevisiae structure (supplemental Fig. S1) is somewhat less truncated and contains a regulatory sequence (RS, α-subunit) and the glycogen-binding domain (β-subunit). A major contribution of these structures is the exact definition of subunit interactions. They confirm the structural consensus model of AMPK that had been challenged before (20Iseli T.J. Walter M. van Denderen B.J. Katsis F. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. J. Biol.

In addition, the larger S. cerevisiae structure reveals novel interactions of the γ-subunit homologue with both the regulatory domain (α-subunit) and the glycogen-binding domain (β-subunit). The structures also identify the precise nucleotide binding sites on the γ-subunit (see also Fig. 9B). Although in yeast only a single AMP (or ATP) molecule is bound to the γ-homolog (43Townley R. Shapiro L. Science. 2007; 315: 1726-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 44Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), probably because yeast AMPK is not activated by AMP, the mammalian AMPK γ-subunit revealed three nucleotide binding sites (14Xiao B. Heath R. Saiu P. Leiper F.C. Leone P. Jing C. Walker P.A. Haire L. Eccleston J.F. Davis C.T. Martin S.R. Carling D. Gamblin S.J.

One site, corresponding to the yeast binding site, contains a non-exchangeable, fixed AMP, whereas the other two allow for ATP/AMP exchange and thus provide the AMP sensor function of AMPK. However, neither of the AMP-containing AMPK core structures showed an appreciable structural difference as compared with ATP-containing or nucleotide-free structures. This observation and the absence of the kinase domain in all known AMPK core structures have so far hampered a molecular explanation for AMP-dependent activation of the holo-complex. This mechanism necessarily involves a cross-talk between AMP binding on γ and the activating Thr172 phosphorylation on the α kinase domain, which most likely implies a conformational change and/or a domain movement. Therefore, detailed analysis of the full-length mammalian AMPK heterotrimer and its dynamic structure upon activation is obviously necessary. Here we report on the molecular shape of γ1-containing AMPK holoenzyme complexes obtained using different biophysical approaches. We have set up a high level expression and automated purification protocol of untagged AMPK protein on the basis of our His6-tagged tricistronic expression system (45Neumann D. Woods A. Carling D. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 30: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It yields sufficient quantities of homogeneous functional kinase complexes without the need of a potentially interfering purification tag. This allowed us to study AMPK in solution by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and by different electron microscopy techniques, including single particle reconstruction. These data characterize AMPK as an elongated, flat particle with a large indentation and protrusions. Importantly, they demonstrate a ligand-induced conformational change of the AMPK heterotrimer upon binding of AMP. Plasmids and Expression of Proteins in Bacteria—Tricistronic AMPK expression plasmids were constructed as described earlier (45Neumann D. Woods A. Carling D. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 30: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but encoding non-tagged versions of the four different mammalian AMPK isoform combinationsα1β1γ1, α2β1γ1, α1β2γ1, and α2β2γ1 (GenBank™ accession numbers U40819, Z29486, X95577, AJ224538, and X95578). Proteins were expressed in Tuner (DE3) Escherichia coli cells (Novagen, EMD Chemicals Inc., Darmstadt, Germany). Expression of AMPK in rich medium in a self-constructed fermenter is described elsewhere (46Riek U. Tuerk R. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Neumann D. Biotechniques. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Preculturing and expression in minimal medium was developed for full-length heterotrimeric AMPK and was also later successfully applied for the expression of the LKB1 complex as described recently (47Neumann D. Suter M. Tuerk R. Riek U. Wallimann T. Mol. Biotechnol. 2007; 36: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The same method was used here for AMPK expression in a 42-liter bioreactor (MBR Switzerland), except that the growth temperature was kept at 34 °C, or in a 5-liter bioreactor (Minifors, Infors AG, Switzerland), except for some adaptations to the reduced vessel volume. After inoculation with cells from 400 ml of pre-culture, batch growth was continued for 12 h overnight at 32 °C with a stirrer speed at 1000 rpm and an air flow of about 4 liters/min until depletion of glucose and acetate (pO2 ∼100%). The feed was balanced with O2 consumption until reaching the pO2 limitation at the maximal air flow (∼7-8 liters/min; to obtain such high air flow, the original air inlet filter was changed to an AcroPac 300, Pall, Switzerland) and maximal stirrer speed (1250 rpm). Protein expression was induced with 50 mg/liter isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at around OD600 nm = 25 for 7.5 h at 34 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed in physiological NaCl solution, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The yield per fermentation, expressed as wet weight of bacterial pellet, was reproducibly 200-250 or 1200-1400 g in the 5- or 42-liter bioreactor with 3 or 27 liters of medium, respectively. Protein Extraction—A 70-g aliquot of the frozen bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (LysB: 30%(w/v) glycerol, 0.5 m sucrose, 50 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0, at 7 °C) to a total volume of about 200 ml. Cells were lysed with an Emulsiflex C5 high pressure homogenizer (Avestin, Germany), first applying 100-300 bar to resuspend cells, and then using 1200-1500 bar for cell lysis. The lysate was supplemented with 7 μl of Benzonase (purity grade II, Merck, Germany), stirred gently at 4 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 1 h to pellet cell debris. The clear supernatant was used for HPLC purification. Protein Purification—A new protocol was developed based on (i) the fact that untagged AMPK heterotrimer is able to bind to some metal affinity matrices, and on (ii) the availability of an Äkta Explorer 100 Air HPLC system (GE Healthcare) that was modified to allow automated multidimensional purification. Details of the machine setup will be published elsewhere. 5U. Riek, S. Ramirez, T. Wallimann, and U. Schlattner, unpublished data. The setup used here included the following columns: (i) XK 26/40 (GE Healthcare) containing 140 ml of Protino Ni-IDA (Macherey Nagel, Switzerland), (ii) XK 26/20 containing 45 ml with Reactive Red 120 fast flow highly cross-linked 6% agarose (R-6143 Sigma), (iii) two 1-ml Ni-HP columns (GE Healthcare), (iv) Superdex 200 16/60 (GE Healthcare); as well as a 10-ml Super-loop (SL) (GE Healthcare) at the first injection valve. The buffers used were: elution buffer (EluB: as LysB, but with the addition of 250 mm imidazole), Red Sepharose elution buffer (RSEluB: as LysB, but with the addition of 600 mm NaCl), Ni-HP elution buffer (HPEluB: as EluB but with the addition of 200 mm NaCl and 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), size exclusion buffer one (SE1: 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 8 mm EDTA, 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, pH 8.0, at 7 °C), and size exclusion buffer two (SE2: as SE1, but without EDTA and with only 2 mm MgCl2). The fully automated purification procedure was carried out at 7 °C except for the Superdex column, which was run at 25 °C. Sample tubing at S1, S2, and S3 were connected to vessels containing LysB, EluB, and RSEluB, respectively, and were primed manually. The Ni-IDA column was equilibrated with LysB, the Reactive Red column with EluB, and the Ni-HP column with RSEluB. Tubing and valves were flushed with the appropriate buffers. Bacterial lysate was added to the sample vessel S1 and the automated run was started. Lysate was then applied to the Ni-IDA column at a flow rate of 4 ml/min using an air sensor to stop direct load injection. The column was washed with 160 ml of LysB (flow rate 5 ml/min at maximal 0.5 MPa pressure feedback). After flushing the system and P960 with EluB, bound proteins were eluted with EluB (5 ml/min, maximum 0.5 MPa). Elution fractions between 63 and 156 ml after EluB application were recovered in the S2 vessel and re-injected into the Reactive Red column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, maximum 0.2 MPa. After washing with 94 ml of LysB at 2 ml/min (maximum 0.2 MPa), the volume eluting between 20 and 95 ml after application of RSEluB was collected in the S3 vessel and re-injected into the Ni-HP columns (1 ml/min, maximum 0.4 MPa). Columns were washed with 8 ml of LysB (0.5 ml/min, maximum 0.4 MPa) and eluted with EluB. A 5-ml peak fraction (starting at A > 280 0.6) was collected in the SL. The Superdex column was equilibrated with 200 ml of SE1 buffer (1.6 ml/min, maximum 0.1 MPa) and, finally, 4 ml of the SL fraction were loaded and 1-ml fractions were collected. Material left in the tubing and SL was collected later in separate fractions. For mass spectrometry (MS), STEM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), SAXS, crystallization, and activity experiments, the first part of the size exclusion peak showing the highest specific AMPK activity was pooled, and subjected to a second size exclusion chromatography on the same Superdex column but using SE2 buffer without EDTA. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford Bio-Rad microassay (Bio-Rad) in SE2 buffer, calibrated by the 280-nm extinction coefficient for unfolded AMPK protein (α1β1γ1, 0.911; α2β2γ1, 0.892 g/liter). Dynamic Light Scattering—The dynamic light scattering signal was recorded on a DynaPro molecular sizing instrument (Wyatt). Samples after elution from the second size exclusion chromatography were concentrated to 10 mg/ml in SE2 buffer and centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min prior to the measurements. Data were acquired using a 50-μl sample in an Eppendorf UVette cuvette at 20 °C with 10-s acquisition intervals and maximum laser intensity and analyzed with the software Dynamics. Enzyme Activity Assay—Following full activation by upstream kinases, activity of purified AMPK was determined by phosphorylation of the synthetic substrate SAMS in the presence of saturating AMP concentrations, using a non-radioactive, HPLC-based method that quantifies SAMS, phosphoSAMS, AMP, ADP, and ATP, as described previously (10Suter M. Riek U. Tuerk R. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Neumann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32207-32216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)—Cross-linking of 1 mg/ml AMPK obtained in SE2 buffer after a second size exclusion chromatography was done at a final concentration of 1% glutaraldehyde (Fluka, Switzerland) for 60 s on ice and quenched with Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. The cross-linked AMPK was then repurified by size exclusion on column 4 in SE2 to remove aggregates. An aliquot of this preparation was diluted 4× in SE2 buffer, and 5-μl aliquots were adsorbed for 60 s to glow-discharged STEM films (thin carbon films that span a thick fenestrated carbon layer covering 200-mesh/inch, gold-plated copper grids). The grids were blotted, washed on 5 drops of quartz double-distilled water, freeze-dried at -80 °C and 5 × 10-8 torr overnight in the microscope. Tobacco mosaic virus particles (kindly provided by R. Diaz Avalos, University of California, Davis, CA) were used for absolute mass calibration. These particles were similarly adsorbed to separate STEM films, washed on 4 drops of 10 mm ammonium acetate, and air-dried. A Vacuum Generators STEM HB-5 interfaced to a modular computer system (Tietz Video and Image Processing System GmbH, Gauting, Germany) was employed. Series of 512 × 512-pixel, dark-field images were recorded from the unstained sample at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV and a nominal magnification of ×200,000. The recording dose ranged from 474 to 945 electrons/nm2. The digital images were evaluated using the software package IMPSYS (48Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the pr"
https://openalex.org/W2014100758,"The role of UVA-radiation—the major fraction in sunlight—in human skin carcinogenesis is still elusive. We here report that different UVA exposure regime (4 × 5 J/cm2 per week or 1 × 20 J/cm2 per week) caused tumorigenic conversion (tumors in nude mice) of the HaCaT skin keratinocytes. While tumorigenicity was not associated with general telomere shortening, we found new chromosomal changes characteristic for each recultivated tumor. Since this suggested a nontelomere-dependent relationship between UVA irradiation and chromosomal aberrations, we investigated for alternate mechanisms of UVA-dependent genomic instability. Using the alkaline and neutral comet assay as well as γ-H2AX foci formation on irradiated HaCaT cells (20–60 J/cm2), we show a dose-dependent and long lasting induction of DNA single and double (ds) strand breaks. Extending this to normal human skin keratinocytes, we demonstrate a comparable damage response and, additionally, a significant induction and maintenance of micronuclei (MN) with more acentric fragments (indicative of ds breaks) than entire chromosomes particularly 5 days post irradiation. Thus, physiologically relevant UVA doses cause long-lasting DNA strand breaks, a prerequisite for chromosomal aberration that most likely contribute to tumorigenic conversion of the HaCaT cells. Since normal keratinocytes responded similarly, UVA may likewise contribute to the complex karyotype characteristic for human skin carcinomas."

Beyond a role for UPR signaling during terminal differentiation of mature B cells to antibody-secreting plasma cells, the status or importance of UPR signaling during hematopoiesis has not been explored, due in part to difficulties in isolating sufficient quantities of cells at developmentally intermediate stages required for biochemical analysis. Following reconstitution of irradiated mice with hematopoietic cells carrying a fluorescent UPR reporter construct, we found that IRE1 nuclease activity for XBP1 splicing is active at early stages of T- and B-lymphocyte differentiation: in bone marrow pro-B cells and in CD4+CD8+ double positive thymic T cells. IRE1 was not active in B cells at later stages. In T cells, IRE activity was not detected in the more mature CD4+ T-cell population but was active in the CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell population. Multiple signals are likely to be involved in activating IRE1 during lymphocyte differentiation, including rearrangement of antigen receptor genes.

Pluripotent stem cells are constantly faced with critical decisions between self-renewal and starting to differentiate into various cell types (1Dzierzak E. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 187: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Giesen K. Hoehn J. Koegler G. Wernet P. Giebel B. Blood. 2001; 98: 115BGoogle Scholar). Commitment of differentiating stem cells toward the various lineages is influenced by many factors, including microenvironment and external cues that are integrated into signaling pathways regulating transcriptional programs and protein production. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) 3The abbreviations used are: HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; UPR, unfolded protein response; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL, interleukin; Syn-1, syndecan-1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 3The abbreviations used are: HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; UPR, unfolded protein response; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL, interleukin; Syn-1, syndecan-1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. that differentiate into the erythroid, myeloid, or lymphoid lineages, primarily in the bone marrow of vertebrate adults, undergo dramatic changes in cellular architecture during differentiation to functionally specialized cells. For cells that are specialized for protein secretion, such changes include the creation of extraordinary protein processing and secretory apparatus. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a conserved signal transduction pathway that in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress enables cells to increase the protein folding capacity of the ER, the major cellular compartment for folding and maturation of secreted and membrane proteins, by increasing the transcription of genes involved in protein folding. In addition, UPR activation also increases expression of genes involved in ER membrane biosynthesis, presumably resulting in ER expansion. Thus, UPR signaling may play a role in the differentiation of HSC. In fact, an importance for the UPR signaling components IRE1 and XBP1 has been demonstrated during the terminal differentiation of activated B lymphocytes (B cells) to immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells (3Reimold A.M.

In mammalian cells, three ER transmembrane components, IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, serve to monitor ER protein folding needs and initiate UPR activation (7Mori K.

In addition to its ER luminal sensor domain, IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1α), a type I ER transmembrane protein. is particularly unique for containing both kinase and sequence-specific endoribonuclease (RNase) activities (11Tirasophon W.

Upon sensing ER demand for protein folding capacity, often referred to as ER stress, initial steps of IRE1 activation include oligomerization and autophosphorylation. Despite efforts, IRE1 itself remains the only known substrate for IRE1 kinase activity. Rather, evidence suggests that the IRE1 kinase activity functions to regulate activation of the IRE1 RNase activity, which cleaves an intron (the UPR intron) from mRNA coding for a key UPR-specific transcription factor (XBP1 in mammalian cells, HAC1 in yeast) (5Calfon M.

The subsequently spliced forms of XBP1 and HAC1 mRNA produce a potent UPR-specific transcription factor, and thus splicings are critical steps in UPR signaling and regulation. For its part, recognition of ER stress by PERK (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase) causes eIF2 α phosphorylation, producing a general attenuation of protein translation, presumably to reduce influx of new protein into the ER (20Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 21Shi Y.G. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J.D. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ER stress is also recognized by a second UPR-specific transcription, ATF6, a type II ER transmembrane protein (22Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar, 23Shen J.S. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Stress recognition by ATF6 leads to proteolytic release of its transcription factor-containing cytosolic domain from the ER membrane. Together, the coupling of these three ER proximal stress sensors to downstream effectors produces an array of cellular effects that promote ER functional capacity. In addition to IRE1, activation of ATF6 during plasma cell differentiation has been reported, although the exact timing and duration of activation differs from that of IRE-dependent splicing of XBP (25Gunn K.E. Gifford N.M. Mori K. Brewer J.W. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PERK-induced translation repression has not been observed during plasma cell differentiation (26Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W. J. of Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 27Zhang K. Wong H.N. Song B. Miller C.N. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), although the status of PERK activation remains to be determined. The ability of UPR sensors to be activated independently from each other is supported by our recent findings that the activation profiles of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 differ from each other both in response to a single form of ER stress and between different forms of stress (28DuRose J.B. Tam A.B. Niwa M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3095-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, the ER sensor domains of each UPR initiator may respond preferentially to changes in the ER environment to provide a molecular basis for “best fit” responses in physiological settings through selective activation of the UPR signaling branches. Although the molecular mechanisms of the luminal domain recognition of certain ER luminal components have been proposed (29Bertolotti A. Zhang Y.H. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar, 30Liu C.Y. Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

A. 2005; 102: 18773-18784Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), little is known about the molecular basis for the recognition of specific forms of ER stress or about how the timing and magnitude of UPR signaling branch activation are regulated, highlighting a need for in vivo studies designed to gain insight into UPR regulation in physiological settings. Specifically, examination of UPR component activities during differentiation of pluripotent HSC poses significant challenges, as obtaining sufficient quantities of intermediate cell populations for conventional molecular analyses are problematic. Commonly, UPR studies have involved the use of pharmacological agents such as dithiothreitol and the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin to generate massive ER stress. Although these agents have been invaluable for the discovery and characterization of UPR signaling fundamentals, similar conditions are unlikely to occur in physiological settings where the extent of UPR activation is likely to be more subtle. Furthermore, UPR signaling may have roles beyond regulation of protein processing capacity or may function in cells unrecognized as secretory cells. In addition, there may be cellular responses that do not require input from each UPR signaling branch. In this regard, the identification of cellular events dependent on UPR signaling is an important step to understanding how UPR signaling integrates into normal cell physiology. Toward this goal, we have developed a fluorescent reporter that allows the activation of IRE1 to be monitored in single cells. Here, in order to examine IRE1 activation in differentiating hematopoietic cells, we have performed bone marrow reconstitution experiments using hematopoietic stem cells carrying this reporter. Our analysis of mice reconstituted with reporter-carrying bone marrow cells reveals, for the first time, IRE1 activation in developmentally intermediate B and T lymphocytes. Demonstration and validation of this reporter-based approach will therefore facilitate the identification of UPR functions during HSC differentiation. Cell Culture and UPR Induction—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Cellgro) medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The UPR was induced by treating cells with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin for 18 h (Calbiochem). Transient and Stable Transfection—2.5 × 105 CHO cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid using Effectene transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. To generate stable cell lines, transfected cells were transferred to selective medium containing 600 μg/ml G418. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Upon harvesting cells, RNA was isolated using RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen). After consecutive DNase I treatments of isolated RNA, cDNA was prepared using a mixture of random hexamers and poly(A) primers, followed by PCR using the primers described in Fig. 1. PCR fragments generated from unspliced and spliced forms of XBP1-GFP mRNA and the endogenous XBP1 mRNA were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. Sequences of primers used for PCR reactions were MN028, TTAGTTCATTAATGGCTTCCAGC; MN056, CACCTGAGCCCCGAGGAG; X3, GGAATGAAGTGAGGCCAGTGG; GFP reverse, CCATCGATCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGAG. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—Cells harvested for FACS analysis were washed with 3 ml of PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum and stained with appropriate antibodies. Dilutions of individual antibodies were determined based on the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against mouse B220, IgM, IgD, CD5, CD43, CD11b, and hCD2 were purchased from eBioscience. Anti-mouse CD4 and CD8 antibodies were from BD Biosciences. Isolation and Activation of Primary B Cells—Primary naive splenic B cells were isolated from three pooled spleens from C57B6 mice after osmotic lysis of erythrocytes by collecting flow-through from CD43 magnetic beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). B cells were activated immediately after isolation by treatment with 25 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma) and 5 ng of IL-4 (Sigma). At indicated times after incubation with LPS and IL-4, B cells were harvested and protein lysates were prepared by lysing in Laemmli buffer containing 20 mm Na2VO4. Mouse Bone Marrow Cell Collection and Infection—The bones were collected from the hind legs of two mice for every mouse to be reconstituted. After removing excess tissue, cells were flushed from bone marrow cavities with a 26-gauge needle. Upon lysis of red blood cells by addition of buffer containing 0.15 m NH4Cl, 1 mm KHCO3, 0.1 m EDTA, cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% IL-3 containing culture supernatant, 10 ng/ml IL-6, and 100 ng/ml SCF (Peprotech) and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After a quick thaw at 37 °C, viral supernatants expressing the XBP1-GFP reporter gene were mixed with 10 μg/ml DOTAP (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in DPTAP treated viral supernatants so that the final concentration was 106 cells/ml. After spinning at 2600 rpm for 90 min at 30 °C, cells were resuspended in fresh media plus cytokines and cultured overnight followed by a second spinfection prior to reconstitution of irradiated hosts. Irradiation and Injection—The host mice were irradiated with 1000 rads (10 Gy) of γ irradiation. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS and injected through the mouse tail vein by standard procedures. Efficiencies of reconstitution were tested 4 weeks after injection. Tissue Collection and Analysis—At 8 weeks after reconstitution, the mice were sacrificed using CO2 asphyxiation. The bone marrow was collected as described above. The spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes were collected using common surgical techniques and homogenized in separate wells of a 6-well dish containing 4 ml of PBS. After a brief spin (1,200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C), cells were resuspended in 1 ml of cold PBS on ice. After lysing the red blood cells as described above, cells were resuspended to 107 cells/ml in PBS for staining. To monitor IRE1 activation status in single cells, we constructed a reporter gene by fusing human XBP1 sequence to green fluorescent protein (Fig. 1A, GFP). In contrast to full-length XBP1 mRNA, the XBP1-GFP reporter only includes the sequence surrounding the XBP1 UPR intron to avoid potential effects from XBP1 protein fragment expression. However, the XBP1 sequence present in the reporter was sufficient for IRE1-dependent splicing of the XBP1 intron upon UPR induction. Without removal of the UPR intron, mRNA generated from the reporter stop its translation at the stop codon placed between XBP1 and the GFP sequence. Upon IRE1-mediated splicing of the XBP1 intron, the GFP sequence becomes in-frame, insuring GFP expression only upon correct splicing of the UPR intron mediated by activated IRE1 (Fig. 1A). Validation of the XBP1-GFP reporter was carried out in a cultured cell line as well as in mouse primary splenic B cells. Upon stable transfection of the reporter in CHO cells, GFP expression during tunicamycin treatment was correlated with the extent of splicing of the UPR intron from XBP1/GFP mRNA in splicing assays. Tunicamycin is a glycosylation inhibitor and well characterized to induce UPR upon incubation with tissue culture cells. Splicing was assayed by reverse transcription of cellular RNA followed by PCR amplification with primers unique to the reporter sequence (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, PCR primers complementary to the sequence unique to endogenous XBP1 showed that the extent of reporter splicing was similar to that of endogenous XBP1 mRNA (Fig. 1C). These results confirm that the XBP1 fragment of the reporter containing the UPR intron is sufficient to promote UPR-dependent splicing by IRE1. XBP1 splicing was further examined during recovery from UPR activation, following removal and washout of tunicamycin. In this case, splicing of endogenous and reporter XBP1 genes continued for an extended period before returning to basal levels (Fig. 1C). Because tunicamycin blocks an early step of protein glycosylation, continued splicing of XBP1 presumably reflects sustained levels of unfolded protein that remain high until oligosaccharides are replenished. In addition, GFP expression was examined for fluorescence by FACS. Under normal growth conditions, XBP1/GFP-transfected CHO cells showed basal fluorescence similar to CHO cells without reporter (Fig. 1D, panel 1, –UPR). Treatment of XBP1/GFP-CHO cells with tunicamycin caused increased fluorescence in a significant proportion of cells (Fig. 1D, panel 2, +UPR). Similarly, increased fluorescence was observed in XBP1/GFP-CHO cells treated with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of ER-localized Ca2+-dependent ATPase (data not shown). The observed heterogeneity in fluorescence levels presumably reflects cell populations carrying different copy numbers of reporter as well as differences due to reporter integration sites. Furthermore, GFP expression was in good correlation with splicing of the UPR intron from both endogenous and reporter XBP1 genes during the recovery phase and ultimately went back to the basal fluorescent level. Next, XBP1-GFP reporter behavior was tested during the in vitro differentiation of activated splenic B cells to antibody-secreting plasma cells, a system in which XBP1 has been reported to undergo splicing (5Calfon M.

The XBP1-GFP reporter was introduced into mature B cells isolated from adult mouse spleens using a retroviral expression system (Fig. 2A). At 72 h after incubation with IL-4 and LPS, a majority of cultured B cells had differentiated into plasma cells, based on expression of the well established plasma cell surface markers B220, Syndecan-1 (Syn-1), CD69, and B7 (supplemental Fig. S1). Analyses of endogenous XBP1 activation and other UPR components during the 72-h incubation period correlated with increased cellular Ig heavy chain (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, both the kinetics and extent of XBP1 activation we observed are consistent with previous reports of splenic B-cell differentiation induced by either LPS, IL-4, or anti-CD40 alone or combination (26Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W. J. of Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 33Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Vallabhajosyula P. Otipoby K.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Based on cell surface markers, three distinct populations of cells were observed at 72 h after culture with IL-4 and LPS, fully differentiated, partially differentiated, and undifferentiated (Fig. 2C). In the retroviral transduction plasmid used for these experiments, the XBP1-GFP reporter sequence is followed by the coding sequence for the human cell surface protein CD2 (hCD2), such that reporter transcription produces a bicistronic mRNA containing both XBP1-GFP and hCD2. An internal ribosome entry site on this transcript assures expression of hCD2 protein regardless of the splicing state of XBP1-GFP. Thus, selection for hCD2+ cells allowed us to limit our subsequent analyses only to reporter-expressing cells. Among the hCD2+ cell population (22.6%), ∼60% of cells expressed significant levels of GFP resulting from XBP1-GFP mRNA splicing (Fig. 2C), and ∼50% of these GFP-expressing cells expressed relatively high levels of Syn-1 and have down-regulated B220 (cells inside small boxes shown in FACS data). In contrast, GFP–cells (∼40% of hCD2+ cells) were Syn-1low negative, indicative of undifferentiated mature B cells. Thus, these results show that XBP1-GFP splicing correlates with B-cell differentiation and remains unspliced in undifferentiated cells. Furthermore, GFP expression in plasma cells corresponded to the appearance of the spliced form of endogenous p50 XBP1 protein (Fig. 2B). Following these initial experiments to validate the utility of our XBP1-GFP reporter, we reasoned that our ability to detect IRE1 RNase activity in small cell populations would be of value in examining whether IRE1 is activated during earlier stages of hematopoiesis. Thus, we examined reporter expression in reporter-transduced murine HSCs during their development in irradiated hosts. HSCs from mouse bone marrow were infected with a retroviral vector carrying the XBP1-GFP reporter gene and transferred into recipient mice previously irradiated to eliminate endogenous HSC. Injected HSC home to bone marrow of recipient mice where they undergo differentiation into the various hematopoietic lineages and eventually populate the periphery. In control experiments, donor bone marrow stem cells were infected with an otherwise identical retroviral vector lacking the XBP1-GFP reporter sequence. Because of inherent differences between individual mice, each bone marrow transplant experiment was performed with three mice reconstituted with reporter-transduced HSC and three control reconstitution mice and all subsequent analyses were performed separately with each mouse. We repeated these procedures two additional times (total of three independent bone marrow reconstitution experiments), using freshly transduced donor HSC with the reporter each time. At 8 weeks post cell transfer, donor-derived hCD2+ cells were isolated from recipient thymus, spleen, and bone marrow and analyzed for GFP expression. Although cells from any of the hematopoietic lineage could be examined for GFP expression at this point, we limited our analysis to cells of the B-cell and T-cell lineages, classified by developmental stage-specific surface markers, as our initial experiments demonstrating the usefulness of the reporter-carrying HSC. For the B-cell lineage, markers included B220, CD43, IgD, and IgM (Fig. 3). Selection for only hCD2+ cells insured the donor origin of analyzed cells. GFP expression levels in each cell population (Fig. 3, red line) were compared with those from mice reconstituted only with control bone marrow cells (blue). hCD2-positive cells were grouped based on their expression of B220 and CD43. GFP expression in B220–/CD43+ and B220+ CD43+ bone marrow populations, representing developmentally early stages, was at least 10-fold higher than similar populations isolated from control mice (Fig. 3). IgM–B220+ CD43– and IgM–B220+IgD– cell populations, indicative of early pre-B cells, also expressed GFP above control populations. In contrast, only minimal GFP expression was observed in more developed populations, including IgM+ B220+CD43–, IgM+B220highCD43–, IgM+B220+IgD–, and IgM+B220+IgD+ B cells. Together, these results show that the XBP1-GFP reporter was spliced early in B-cell development. Following early development in bone marrow, developing B cells migrate to populate the spleen, where they undergo further maturation. To examine reporter splicing past pre-B-cell stages, we analyzed splenic B cells in reconstituted mice (Fig. 4). In cells maturing to IgM or IgD surface expression, we observed no concomitant expression of GFP, confirming that XBP1 slicing was limited to earlier developmental stages. Furthermore, GFP expression was insignificant in mature B-cell populations. including B220+CD21low follicular B cells and B220+CD21+ marginal zone B cells (Fig. 4). Together, our analysis of bone marrow and splenic B cells showed that XBP1-GFP reporter splicing occurred early in lymphoid development at pro-B-cell stages. We performed three sets of experiments, each with three experimental and three control mice. Freshly transduced bone marrow cells were used as donors for each experimental set. Similar results were obtained both within each experimental set and between each experimental set. Our results therefore are consistent with IRE1 activation during two distinct phases of B-cell development: at the pro-B-cell stage during which precursors commit to the B-cell lineage and during the terminal differentiation of mature B cells to plasma cells. Although our classifications of B and T cells into developmental stages are somewhat coarse, they provide a foundation for future higher resolution analysis. We next asked whether IRE1 activation occurs in developing cells of the T-lymphoid lineage by examining reporter activation in cells obtained from both thymus and spleen of recipient mice (Fig. 5). Immature T cells migrate from bone marrow to thymus, where as CD4–CD8– cells (double negative) development continues through the CD4+CD8+ (double positive) stage and, later, to mature single positive CD4+CD8– or CD4–CD8+ T cells. Thus, cells from each stage were characterized by expression of appropriate surface markers and analyzed for GFP expression (Fig. 5A). Cells at the earliest stage of development examined, the CD4–CD8– population, showed levels of GFP expression only slightly higher than of double negative T cells from control hosts. On the other hand, GFP expression was significant in the CD4+ CD8+ double positive population, indicating IRE1 activation had occurred in these cells. A role for UPR signaling during T-cell development has not been reported previously. These findings suggest that IRE1 activation may play a role during the “commitment stages” of T-cell development where both CD4 and CD8 appear on the cell surface. Cells may activate UPR (or, only IRE1) in anticipation of a pending need for protein-processing capacity. Later in T-cell de"
https://openalex.org/W2037702603,"The Staphylococcus aureus transpeptidase sortase A (SrtA) is responsible for anchoring a range of virulence- and colonization-associated proteins to the cell wall. SrtA recognizes substrates that contain a C-terminal LPXTG motif. This sequence is cleaved following the threonine, and an amide bond is formed between the threonine and the pentaglycine cross-bridge of branched lipid II. Previous studies have implicated the beta6/beta7 loop region of SrtA in LPXTG recognition but have not systematically characterized this domain. To better understand the individual roles of the residues within this loop, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Val-168 and Leu-169 were found to be important for substrate recognition, and Glu-171 was also found to be important, consistent with its hypothesized role as a Ca(2+)-binding residue. Gly-167 and Asp-170 were dispensable for catalysis, as was Gln-172. The role of Arg-197 in SrtA has been the subject of much debate. To explore its role in catalysis, we used native chemical ligation to generate semi-synthetic SrtA in which we replaced Arg-197 with citrulline, a non-ionizable analog. This change resulted in a decrease of <3-fold in k(cat)/K(m), indicating that Arg-197 utilizes a hydrogen bond, rather than an electrostatic interaction. Our results are consistent with a model for LPXTG recognition wherein the Leu-Pro sequence is recognized primarily by hydrophobic contacts with SrtA Val-168 and Leu-169, as well as a hydrogen bond from Arg-197. This model contradicts the previously proposed mechanism of binding predicted by the x-ray crystal structure of SrtA."
https://openalex.org/W2009193372,"Doublet mutations in cancer are not well studied. We find that allelic somatic doublet mutations are present at high frequency in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) domain in lung cancers. When doublets from the literature are added, a total of 96 doublets are available for analysis. The frequency of doublets overall is 6%, which is sevenfold greater than that observed in normal tissue in mouse. All characterized doublets are allelic, and silent mutations occur rarely. About half of all doublets contain one or two of 12 distinct missense mutations at five amino acids: E709, G719, S768, T790 and L861. The mutations at these five amino acids are seldom reported as singlets. Moreover, when the common L858 target is included, more than one-third of EGFR doublets are one of five specific missense pairs: G719/E709, G719/S768, G719/L861, L858/E709 and L858/T790. Structure suggests function: The data imply that most EGFR doublets are NOT consistent with a 'driver and passenger' mutation mechanism. EGFR doublets are highly skewed relative to singlets, consistent with functional selection of two individually suboptimal mutations that, in combination, have enhanced oncogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2027239007,"Phosphoinositide 3-OH kinases (PI3Ks) are a group of major intracellular signaling molecules. In our previous study, we found that inhibition of PI3K activity suppressed the androgen receptor (AR)-mediated gene expression in prostate cancer cells. The AR has been considered as a critical determinant for the development and progression of human prostate cancers. In this study, we sought to identify the PI3K isoforms involved in AR transactivation. Using a gene-specific small interference RNA (siRNA) approach, we determined that the regulatory isoform p85α and the catalytic isoform p110β, but not p110α, were required for androgen-stimulated AR transactivation and cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells. Consistently, overexpression of wild-type p110β but not p110α gene led to androgen-independent AR transactivation. Silencing p110β gene in prostate cancer cells abolished tumor growth in nude mice. Of the dual (lipid and protein) kinase activities, p110β’s lipid kinase activity was required for AR transactivation. Further analysis by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that p110β is indispensable for androgen-induced AR–DNA interaction. Finally, gene expression analysis of clinical specimens showed that both p85α and p110β were highly expressed in malignant prostate tissues compared to the nonmalignant compartments, and their expression levels correlated significantly with disease progression. Taken together, our data demonstrated that p85α and p110β are essential for androgen-stimulated AR transactivation, and their aberrant expression or activation might play an important role in prostate cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W1982500489,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia, and stroke. The mechanism by which TG2 modulates disease progression have not been elucidated. In this study we investigate the role of TG2 in the cellular response to ischemia and hypoxia. TG2 is up-regulated in neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), and increased TG2 expression protects neurons against OGD-induced cell death independent of its transamidating activity. We identified hypoxia inducible factor 1beta (HIF1beta) as a TG2 binding partner. HIF1beta and HIF1alpha together form the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1). TG2 and the transaminase-inactive mutant C277S-TG2 inhibited a HIF-dependent transcription reporter assay under hypoxic conditions without affecting nuclear protein levels for HIF1alpha or HIF1beta, their ability to form the HIF1 heterodimeric transcription factor, or HIF1 binding to its DNA response element. Interestingly, TG2 attenuates the up-regulation of the HIF-dependent proapoptotic gene Bnip3 in response to OGD but had no effect on the expression of VEGF, which has been linked to prosurvival processes. This study demonstrates for the first time that TG2 protects against OGD, interacts with HIF1beta, and attenuates the HIF1 hypoxic response pathway. These results indicate that TG2 may play an important role in protecting against the delayed neuronal cell death in ischemia and stroke."

Through expression profiling of prospectively isolated stem and primitive progenitor cells as well as committed progenitors from cord blood (CB), we identified MLLT3 as a candidate regulator of erythroid/megakaryocytic (E/Meg) lineage decisions. Through the analysis of the hematopoietic potential of primitive cord blood cells in which MLLT3 expression has been knocked down, we identify a requirement for MLLT3 in the elaboration of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Conversely, forced expression of MLLT3 promotes the output of erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors, and analysis of MLLT3 mutants suggests that this capacity of MLLT3 depends on its transcriptional regulatory activity. Gene expression and cis-regulatory element analyses reveal crossregulatory interactions between MLLT3 and E/Meg-affiliated transcription factor GATA-1. Taken together, the data identify MLLT3 as a regulator of early erythroid and megakaryocytic cell fate in the human system."
https://openalex.org/W2062167883,"Activation of Bax following diverse cytotoxic stress has been shown to be an essential gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway characterized by cytochrome c release with caspase-9/-3 activation. Interestingly, c-Myc has been reported to promote apoptosis by destabilizing mitochondrial integrity in a Bax-dependent manner. Stress-induced activation of caspase-2 may also induce permeabilization of mitochondria with activation of the intrinsic death pathway. To test whether c-Myc and caspase-2 cooperate to activate Bax and thereby mediate intrinsic apoptosis, small interfering RNA was used to efficiently knock down the expression of c-Myc, caspase-2, and Apaf-1, an activating component in the apoptosome, in two human cancer cell lines, lung adenocarcinoma A-549 and osteosarcoma U2-OS cells. Under conditions when the expression of endogenous c-Myc, caspase-2, or Apaf-1 is reduced 80-90%, cisplatin (or etoposide)-induced apoptosis is significantly decreased. Biochemical studies reveal that the expression of c-Myc and caspase-2 is crucial for cytochrome c release from mitochondria during cytotoxic stress and that Apaf-1 is only required following cytochrome c release to activate caspases-9/-3. Although knockdown of c-Myc or caspase-2 does not affect Bax expression, caspase-2 is important for cytosolic Bax to integrate into the outer mitochondrial membrane, and c-Myc is critical for oligomerization of Bax once integrated into the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1995392215,"Type I procollagen is a heterotrimer composed of two proalpha1(I) chains and one proalpha2(I) chain, encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively. Mutations in these genes usually lead to dominantly inherited forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) by altering the triple helical domains, but a few affect sequences in the proalpha1(I) C-terminal propeptide (C-propeptide), and one, which has a phenotype only in homozygotes, alters the proalpha2(I) C-propeptide. Here we describe four dominant mutations in the COL1A2 gene that alter sequences of the proalpha2(I) C-propeptide in individuals with clinical features of a milder form of the disease, OI type IV. Three of the four appear to interfere with disulfide bonds that stabilize the C-propeptide conformation and its interaction with other chains in the trimer. Cultured cells synthesized proalpha2(I) chains that were slow to assemble with proalpha1(I) chains to form heterotrimers and that were retained intracellularly. Some alterations led to the uncharacteristic formation of proalpha1(I) homotrimers. These findings show that the C-propeptide of proalpha2(I), like that of the proalpha1(I) C-propeptide, is essential for efficient assembly of type I procollagen heterotrimers. The milder OI phenotypes likely reflect a diminished amount of normal type I procollagen, small populations of overmodified heterotrimers, and proalpha1(I) homotrimers that are compatible with normal skeletal growth."

From a detailed structural characterization, it is likely that the mutants retain functionality as enzymes but have a reduced activity to produce the reaction intermediate biotinyl-5′-AMP. The observed biotin and partly disordered ATP in the mutant structures may act as a non-reactive analog of the substrates or biotinyl-5′-AMP, thereby providing the complex crystals.

Biotin-dependent carboxylases constitute a ubiquitous family of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of carbon dioxide between metabolites using the biotin moiety as a carboxyl carrier (1Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem.

The attachment of biotin to the biotin-dependent enzymes is catalyzed by the biotin protein ligase (BPL) 2The abbreviations used are: BPL, biotin protein ligase; BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 2The abbreviations used are: BPL, biotin protein ligase; BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. in two steps (Reactions 1 and 2). Firstly, BPL activates biotin at the expense of ATP to the reaction intermediate biotinyl-5′-AMP in which the carboxyl group of inert biotin is activated by the addition of an adenylate group. Subsequently, the biotin moiety of biotinyl-5′-AMP is transferred to the ϵ-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the target protein (e.g. the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (3Beckett D. Matthews B.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). The biotinylated holo-BCCP subunit carries a covalently bound carboxyl unit between different active sites of the multienzyme biotin-dependent carboxylase complexes, which play essential roles in the fatty acid synthesis, the amino acid degradation, and the CO2 fixation (4Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 5Menendez C. Bauer Z. Huber H. Gad'on N. Stetter K.-O. Fuchs G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1088-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria and eukaryotes, biotinylation is essential to initiate the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Because human biotin-dependent carboxylases are the direct targets for the development of anti-obesity and anti-diabetes agents, structural information on these enzymes is important for drug discovery research (6Tong L. Harwood Jr., H.J. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 99: 1476-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In archaea, the function of acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylases is different due to the absence of usual fatty acids in membranes: they act as CO2 fixation enzymes in the modified 3-hydroxypropionate cycle to assimilate CO2 into the cell (5Menendez C. Bauer Z. Huber H. Gad'on N. Stetter K.-O. Fuchs G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1088-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the structural basis of biotinylation is important to develop useful applications in protein engineering, such as the high affinity biotin tagging for protein purification (7de Boer E. Rodriguez P. Bonte E. Krijgsveld J. Katsantoni E. Heck A. Grosveld F. Strouboulis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2005; 102: 7583-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The understanding of the first step of BPL reaction at the atomic level was reached based on the crystal structures of BPL from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (PhBPL) in complex with various biological ligands including biotinyl-5′-AMP (9Bagautdinov B. Kuroishi C. Sugahara M. Kunishima N. J. Mol.

Weaver L.H. Brown P.H. Beckett D. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, scientists have not yet been able to resolve the structural details in the second step of biotinylation reaction in which the activated biotin is transferred to the special lysine of BCCP. This exceptionally selective post-translational modification makes understanding how the proteins BPL and BCCP carry out the biotin transfer of particular interest. To elucidate the biotin transfer reaction, several biophysical or biochemical studies on the BPL·BCCP complex have been performed (e.g. an NMR study (11Reche P. Howard M.J. Broadhust R.W. Perham R.N.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). Despite these efforts, the structural mode of the biotin transfer reaction is not fully understood due to the absence of three-dimensional structures for the BPL·BCCP complex. To gain insight into a complex array of interactions between BPL and BCCP at biotinylation, we cocrystallized and determined the crystal structures of BPL·BCCP from P. horikoshii OT3. For the experiments, we used the biotinyl domain of PhBCCP, the C-terminal 73-residue fragment of the 149-residue long hypothetical methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase gamma chain (PhBCCPΔN76). Although the cocrystallization of the wild-type PhBPL with PhBCCPΔN76 was unsuccessful, using PhBPL mutants carrying a single mutation R48A (PhBPL*), and a double mutation R48A/K111A (PhBPL**), successfully yielded the complex crystals. Here we report the crystal structures of PhBPL*, PhBPL*·biotinyl-5′-AMP, PhBPL**, PhBPL**·biotin·adenosine, PhBPL**·biotinol-5′-AMP, PhBCCPΔN76, and the complexes PhBPL*·biotin·adenosine·PhBCCPΔN76 and PhBPL**·biotin·adenosine·holo-PhBCCPΔN76. The information obtained from these structures provides a good starting point to understand the structural basis of protein biotinylation. Protein Expression, Purification, Crystallization, and Data Collection—The expression and purification of PhBPL, PhBPL*, PhBPL**, and PhBCCPΔN76 were performed as described elsewhere (15Bagautdinov B. Kuroishi C. Sugahara M. Kunishima N. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2005; 61: 193-195Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 16Bagautdinov B. Matsuura Y. Bagautdinova S. Kunishima N. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2007; 63: 334-337Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Crystals of the ATP liganded form of wild-type PhBPL (PhBPL·ATP) were prepared by adding 5 mm ATP to the previously reported crystallization condition for the unliganded wild-type PhBPL (15Bagautdinov B. Kuroishi C. Sugahara M. Kunishima N. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2005; 61: 193-195Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Crystals of the liganded forms of PhBPL mutants were prepared using the wild-type crystallization condition except for adding ligands: 5 mm ATP and 5 mm biotin for PhBPL*·biotinyl-5′-AMP and PhBPL**·biotin·adenosine; 5 mm biotinol-5′-AMP for PhBPL**·biotinol-5′-AMP. Other forms of crystals were prepared as described elsewhere (16Bagautdinov B. Matsuura Y. Bagautdinova S. Kunishima N. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2007; 63: 334-337Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All data were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation on a Jupiter 210 charge-coupled device at the beamline BL26B1 of SPring-8, Japan (17Ueno G. Kanda H. Hirose R. Ida K. Kumasaka T.

Open table in a new tab Model Building and Refinement—The structures of the mutated and/or liganded forms of PhBPL were determined by the difference Fourier synthesis based on its wild-type structure. The structures of PhBCCPΔN76 in two different crystal forms were determined by the molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (19Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4137) Google Scholar), using coordinates of the C-terminal domain of E. coli BCCP (EcBCCP, PDB ID 1BDO) as a search model (20Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The initial phases of the protein·protein complexes were obtained by the molecular replacement with MOLREP, using the crystal structures of PhBPL*, PhBPL**, and PhBCCPΔN76 as search models. After rebuilding the initial models using QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), several rounds of the manual model revision and the structure refinement using CNS (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) were performed for all the structures. The electron densities for biotinyl-5′-AMP and biocytin clearly indicate a covalent linkage between biotin and AMP and between biotin and the Lys115 of BCCP, respectively. Refinement statistics are summarized in tables (Table 1 and supplemental Tables S1 and S2). All of the models have excellent stereochemistry, as evaluated by the program PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structural superposition analysis was performed using the program LSQKAB (23Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2327) Google Scholar) and a subsequent classification of structural changes according to the multiple superposition method (24Kunishima N. Asada Y. Sugahara M. Ishijima J. Nodake Y. Sugahara M. Miyano M. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Sugahara M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 212-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The figures illustrating these structures were prepared using the program PyMOL. 3W. L. DeLano (2002) PyMOL, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA. Sequence alignments were generated by ClustalX (26Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem.

Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). Structures of PhBPL—To examine the effect of mutations R48A and R48A/K111A on the structure and reactivity of PhBPL, we determined the crystal structures of PhBPL* and PhBPL** and their liganded forms PhBPL*·biotinyl-5′-AMP, PhBPL**·biotin·adenosine, and PhBPL**·biotinol-5′-AMP (supplemental Table S1). Overall, all the structures were found isomorphous to the wild-type PhBPL (9Bagautdinov B. Kuroishi C. Sugahara M. Kunishima N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The crystals contain one dimer in the asymmetric unit. The mutants have essentially the same overall protomer conformation as the wild-type PhBPL: a Cα superposition between any pair of the protomers results in the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) value of <1 Å. The liganded forms of crystals were prepared by a cocrystallization with ligands, to avoid crystal packing effects. The apo structures of PhBPL mutants show that the active site loop Gly45-Trp53 is disordered. In the liganded structures, the loop becomes ordered and closes over the bound substrates to form the main hole of the active site. This ligand-induced ordering of the active site loop is also observed in the structures of wild-type PhBPL (9Bagautdinov B. Kuroishi C. Sugahara M. Kunishima N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cocrystallization of PhBPL* with ATP and biotin provided the PhBPL*·biotinyl-5′-AMP complex where the U-shaped biotinyl-5′-AMP was found in the bifurcated main hole of BPL*, indicating the retained functionality of the single mutant (Fig. 1A, and supplemental Table S3 Fig. S1). However, the same cocrystallization condition using PhBPL** resulted in a substrate complex where the active site hole was occupied by biotin and adenosine. Because ATP dominates the adenosine nucleotide species in the crystallization solution, it is likely that the modeled adenosine is an ordered part of ATP. The nucleotide binding mode in the double mutant was compared with that in the wild-type enzyme (supplemental Table S3 and Fig. S2): PhBPL·ATP (PDB ID 1X01) and PhBPL·ADP (PDB ID 1WNL). In the wild-type enzyme, the phosphate part of nucleotides is recognized by polar interactions with the basic residues Arg48, Arg51, Lys111, and Arg233. Thus the mutations R48A and K111A would induce the disordering of the triphosphate moiety of ATP and tend to prevent it from reacting with biotin in the mutant crystals. Most likely, this reduced reactivity of bound ATP allowed the successful cocrystallization of single and double mutants with BCCP. As described in the later section of BPL·BCCP complex, PhBPL** can produce holo-BCCP, indicating the retained functionality of the double mutant. However, the lowest ability in the reaction intermediate production may hinder the formation of biotinyl-5′-AMP-liganded crystals in the double mutant. The binding mode of the reaction intermediate in the double mutant could be estimated from the PhBPL**·biotinol-5′-AMP structure, which was determined from a cocrystal with the reaction intermediate analog biotinol-5′-AMP (supplemental Table S3 and Fig. S1). The conformation of bound biotinol-5′-AMP in PhBPL** is quite similar to that of bound biotinyl-5′-AMP in PhBPL* as well as in wild-type PhBPL, suggesting that the mutations used are not essentially defective in the formation of biotinyl-5′-AMP. Structures of PhBCCPΔN76—We designed and expressed a truncated version of PhBCCP lacking N-terminal 76 residues and containing 73 C-terminal amino acids from Val77 (PhBCCPΔN76, residues 76-149), to improve its handling and crystallizability. It is well known that the C-terminal half of biotinyl domain is expressed as a stable protein, which can be biotinylated normally both in vivo and in vitro (28Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

Harmon F.R. Wuhr B. Hubner K. Lynen F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7397-7409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Located upstream of the biotinyl domain sequence are proline/alanine-rich sequences of varying lengths, which have been proposed to act as flexible linkers (34Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22520-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PhBCCPΔN76 (form I; modeled residues 76-149) has been solved by the molecular replacement using BCCP from EcBCCP (PDB ID 1BDO) as a search model and refined at a resolution of 1.55 Å (supplemental Table S2). The second form of crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement using the form I structure and refined at a resolution of 1.55 Å (form II; modeled residues 80-149). In the form I crystal, there is one protomer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, whereas the form II crystal has two protomers in the asymmetric unit. The r.m.s.d. values from a Cα superposition between the observed three crystallographically independent protomers are <1 Å, indicating an essentially identical protomer fold. The overall fold of PhBCCPΔ76 is described as a flattened β-barrel structure comprising two four-stranded β-sheets with the N- and C-terminal residues close together at one end of the structure (Fig. 1B). The biotinyl domain has an internal 2-fold symmetry. The Cα atoms in two halves of the molecule (residues 80-112 and 117-149) can be aligned with an r.m.s.d. of 0.48 Å after a rotation about the 2-fold axis, clearly indicating that this molecule was created by a duplication of two identical ancestor genes as first suggested by Toh et al. (35Toh H. Kondo H. Tanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and structurally confirmed by Athappilly and Hendrickson (20Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). From a structural perspective, it is likely that the ancestor protein is a dimer of two identical hammerhead motifs β6-β7-β8-β1 and β2-β3-β4-β5. The biotinylation target Lys115 is located at the type I’ hairpin β-turn involving two residues Met114 and Lys115, which connects the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the biotinyl domain. The sequences of C-terminal regions corresponding to the biotinyl domain are well conserved among different BCCPs (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, the crystal structure of PhBCCPΔ76 confirms the same overall folding with the reported crystal structures of the C-terminal fragment of EcBCCP (20Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 36Roberts E.L. Shu N. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the 1.3 S subunit of the Propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase complex (37Reddy D.V. Shenoy B.C. Carey P.R. Sonnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, biotinyl domains have been shown to bear sequence and structural similarities to the lipoyl domains of 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes, which undergo an analogous post-translational modification (1Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 38Brocklehurst S.M. Perham R.N. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 626-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 39Dardel F. Davis A.L. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). There are two main differences among these structures: PhBCCP and many other BCCP structures lack the β2-β3 “thumb” loop, which is observed in EcBCCP (20Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); the two symmetric halves of all biotinyl domain structures are connected by a type I′ β-turn, whereas the lipoyl domains adopt a type I conformation for this turn. PhBCCP may be an evolutionally more primitive form as compared with EcBCCP, because PhBCCP is more symmetric in terms of the duplication on hammerhead motifs and lacks the thumb loop providing additional recognition for the biotinyl moiety. Structures of PhBPL·PhBCCP Complex—The complex structures of PhBPL*·biotin·adenosine·PhBCCPΔN76 and PhBPL**·biotin·adenosine·holo-PhBCCPΔN76 were determined by molecular replacement using the coordinates of PhBPL*, PhBPL**, and PhBCCPΔN76 structures and refined at resolutions of 2.7 and 2.0 Å, respectively (Fig. 1C and Table 1). These two forms of PhBPL·PhBCCP complex crystals are nearly isomorphous and both have a 2:2 heterotetramer in the asymmetric unit. The PhBPL·PhBCCP association involves the formation of a large intermolecular β-sheet, which is solvent-exposed on one side to house the biotinyl-5′-AMP. Notably, the bifurcated main holes of both the complexes are occupied by biotin and adenosine. As mentioned in the first section, we suppose that the modeled adenosine is an ordered part of ATP. The B-factors for the ligand atoms are comparable to those of other atoms in the crystal structure; averaged B-factors for the ligand atoms and all atoms are 43.7 Å2 and 42.1 Å2 in the single mutant complex and 24.8 Å2 and 28.4 Å2 in the double mutant complex, respectively (Table 1 and supplemental Table S3). Judging from this fact, it is likely that the bound ligands have some biological role in the reaction mechanism rather than a mutation/crystallization artifact from the binding of low affinity ligands. In both the complexes, although the binding mode of the biotin and the adenine ring is similar to that of the corresponding part of biotinyl-5′-AMP seen in the other liganded forms, the ribose ring shows distinct conformation when compared with that of biotinyl-5′-AMP (supplemental Fig. S3). This suggests that the mutations tend to prevent ATP from reacting with biotin in the complex crystals. However, because the single mutant can provide the biotinyl-5′-AMP liganded form and the biotinylated holo-PhBCCP is found in the double mutant complex, the functionality of the mutants would be retained. Therefore, the snapshots fortunately captured at points before and after the biotinylation of PhBCCP may shed light on the interaction of proteins and the target protein/lysine residue specificity of BPL. The association of two 1:1 complexes of PhBPL·PhBCCP to make the 2:2 complex is mediated by the PhBPL dimer interface analogous to one observed in the wild-type PhBPL (9Bagautdinov B. Kuroishi C. Sugahara M. Kunishima N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). At the PhBPL·PhBCCP interface, buried solvent-accessible surface area is ∼900 Å2 per protomer, which is comparable to the PhBPL dimer interface area of 1030 Å2 in the complex. The intermolecular interface is mainly hydrophobic (over 60% of interface atoms are non-polar) and defined by a number of hydrogen bonds (Table 2). The electrostatic potential on the surfaces of proteins shows a heterogeneous charge distribution that reflects a good charge complementarity between the interacting surfaces (Fig. 3). This indicates that electrostatic interactions are important for the complex formation in addition to a pronounced molecular surface complementarity. The structures of the apo and holo forms of PhBCCPΔN76 in free and complex states are generally similar, suggesting that binding to PhBPL and biotinylation causes few significant changes in the overall fold of the biotinyl domain, except for the β4-β5 hairpin turn. In contrast, structures of PhBPL* and PhBPL** show more extensive local conformational changes. Although the catalytic domain is relatively similar to the one in free state, the C-terminal domain shows large variations (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S4). In the present two complex structures, we observed four crystallographically independent BPL·BCCP complexes. From the overall structural similarity in the orientational relationship between BPL and BCCP, the four independent complexes can be classified into three groups (Fig. 4A and supplemental Table S4). The B and D subunits of the complexes are in a nearly identical spatial relationship, in which the substrate lysine of BCCP enters close to the BPL active site. We designate this state as the formation stage 1. The A and C subunits of both the complexes are also in closely related orientations. In the single mutant complex, BCCP seems to approach the BPL active site in another way; this state is referred to as the formation stage 2. The designation of “stage 1” or “stage 2” does not imply an order in which these putative snapshots of the reaction occur along the reaction coordinate. On the other hand, in the double mutant complex, the biotinylated holo-BCCP is observed as the reaction product; this state is referred to as the product stage. Thus, there is a certain amount of plasticity around the active site of PhBPL to accommodate its substrate PhBCCP. Especially, a conformational flexibility of a C-terminal domain loop (Ile226-Asp229) in the side hole to the active site provides an entry for the substrate lysine residue and an exit pathway for the product biocytin residue of holo-BCCP (Fig. 1C). Notably, the loop residue Tyr227 undergoes an open/close motion, which may act as a lid of the side hole to regulate the traffic of ligands: open in the formation stage 1 and closed in the other stages (Fig. 4B). In addition, the induced-fit ordering of the active site loop (Gly45-Trp53) upon binding substrat"
https://openalex.org/W1981873211,"Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are a family of primary malignant brain tumors that include medulloblastomas. Although genetic models of a subset of medulloblastomas are documented over the past decade, the molecular basis of other subclasses of PNET remains unclear. As elevated c-Myc expression, activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and dysfunction of p53 are seen in human PNETs, we investigated what role these abnormalities have in the formation of PNETs. Incorporating these abnormalities, we generated supratentorial PNET (sPNET) in mice using somatic cell gene transfer. We show that sPNETs arise from GFAP-expressing cells by forced c-Myc expression combined with p53 inactivation. beta-catenin activation promotes tumor progression and induces divergent differentiation. These c-Myc+beta-catenin-induced PNETs are histologically similar to large cell/anaplastic medulloblastomas and can occur in both cerebrum and cerebellum. Furthermore, we have obtained one PNET with marked epithelial differentiation having histological resemblance to choroid plexus carcinoma in this series. Our results in mice suggest that sPNET with varied differentiation and large cell/anaplastic medulloblastomas may be two tumor groups with similar genetic foundations. These data provide insights into the biology and classification of human PNETs and suggest that multiple tumor types or variants can be generated from a fixed set of genetic abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2087686852,"In this study, we have used the PC12 cell model to elucidate the mechanisms by which sublethal doses of oxidants induce neuritogenesis. The xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) system was used for the steady state generation of superoxide, and CoCl2 was used as a representative transition metal redox catalyst. Upon treatment of purified protein kinase C (PKC) with these oxidants, there was an increase in its cofactor-independent activation. Redox-active cobalt competed with the redoxinert zinc present in the zinc-thiolates of the PKC regulatory domain and induced the oxidation of these cysteine-rich regions. Both CoCl2 and X/XO induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, as determined by an overexpression of neuronal marker genes. Furthermore, these oxidants induced a translocation of PKC from cytosol to membrane and subsequent conversion of PKC to a cofactor-independent form. Isoenzyme-specific PKC inhibitors demonstrated that PKCϵ plays a crucial role in neuritogenesis. Moreover, oxidant-induced neurite outgrowth was increased with a conditional overexpression of PKCϵ and decreased with its knock-out by small interfering RNA. Parallel with PKC activation, an increase in phosphorylation of the growth-associated neuronal protein GAP-43 at Ser41 was observed. Additionally, there was a sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, which was correlated with activating phosphorylation (Ser133) of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. All of these signaling events that are causally linked to neuritogenesis were blocked by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (both l and d-forms) and by a variety of PKC-specific inhibitors. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that sublethal doses of oxidants induce neuritogenesis via a direct redox activation of PKCϵ.

Understanding the signaling mechanisms involved in neuritogenesis resulting from a compensatory response to injury is crucial to the development of therapeutic agents for recovery after spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries (1Schwab M.E.

The study of neuritogenesis requires the identification of molecular targets using a suitable experimental model. One of the best characterized cellular models for studying the neuronal pathways involved in neuritogenesis is the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 (3Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Stork P.J.S. Lazarovici P. Eliden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 5Gerdin M.J. Eiden L.E. Sci. STKE 2007. 2007; : pe15Google Scholar). In addition to damage from mechanical forces, spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries may result from secondary mechanisms involving ischemia, excitotoxicity, cytokines, and an infiltration of neutrophils at the site of injury (6Klushman I. Schwab M.E. Brain Res. 1997; 762: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Hausmann O.N. Spinal Cord. 2003; 41: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The inflammatory response results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PKC, protein kinase C; NGF, nerve growth factor; X/XO, xanthine/xanthine oxidase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; DTNB, 5,5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid); PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; DTT, dithiothreitol; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; qRT, quantitative reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PKC, protein kinase C; NGF, nerve growth factor; X/XO, xanthine/xanthine oxidase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; DTNB, 5,5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid); PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; DTT, dithiothreitol; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; qRT, quantitative reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA. including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which can cause oxidative damage to tissues and lead to cell death (8Moskovitz J. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, sublethal doses of oxidants can also induce a variety of cellular processes, including cell growth, adhesion, invasion, and differentiation (9Wagner S. Hussain M.Z. Hunt T.K. Bacic B. Becker H.D. Wound Repair Regen. 2004; 12: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Katoh S. Mitsui Y. Kitani K. Suzuki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Importantly, ROS are involved in the action of a variety of growth factors and neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), which supports neuronal survival during development and promotes axonal regeneration after neuronal injury (12Bae Y.S.

NGF induces neuritogenesis in PC12 cells by binding to and activating receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, TrkA (4Vaudry D. Stork P.J.S. Lazarovici P. Eliden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 5Gerdin M.J. Eiden L.E. Sci. STKE 2007. 2007; : pe15Google Scholar, 16Neet K.E. Campenot R.B. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2001; 58: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The associated signaling pathway leads to the activation of B-Raf (via Ras and Rap1), which is coupled to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase. This activation leads to a rapid and sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). The activation of ERKs is both necessary and sufficient for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (17Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TrkA activation is also coupled to phospholipase Cγ activation, which in turn leads to protein kinase C (PKC) activation (18Obermeier A. Bradshaw H.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This is relevant, since PKC also contributes to the activation of ERKs via Raf. Many different stimuli act on PC12 cells to induce signaling pathways that may converge in the sustained activation of the MAPK pathway. This ultimately leads to phosphorylation-mediated activation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), which induces a set of genes involved in neuritogenesis (19Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although it has been established that NGF mediates its action through this protein kinase cascade, it is not known which protein kinases are regulated by sublethal doses of oxidants to induce neuritogenesis. Various studies have shown an important role for PKC in neuritogenesis (20Fagerstrom S. Pahlman S. Gestblom C. Nanberg E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 775-785PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hundle B.

Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKC is also a unique target for oxidants (23Gopalakrishna, R., and Jaken, S. (200) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 28, 1349-1361Google Scholar). Depending on the type of oxidant, the site of oxidation, and the extent of modification, PKC can be either activated or inactivated by oxidation (24Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The regulatory domain of PKC contains the C1 module with a cysteine-rich region coordinating four atoms of zinc (25Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Selective modification of this autoinhibitory domain is achieved by treatment with a low concentration of oxidants and results in a cofactor-independent activation of PKC (23Gopalakrishna, R., and Jaken, S. (200) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 28, 1349-1361Google Scholar, 24Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Alternatively, modification of the cysteine residues present within the catalytic domain is achieved by treatment with a higher concentration of oxidants and results in the inactivation of PKC. Since PKC is a family of more than 11 phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine protein kinases with variation in structure (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar, 27Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 28Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), there may be a difference in susceptibility to oxidants among the various isoenzymes. The PKC isoenzymes are divided into three categories based upon the cofactors that are required for optimal catalytic activity (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar, 27Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 28Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ) are calcium-dependent and are stimulated by a second messenger, diacylglycerol. Novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, ç, and θ) are also activated by diacylglycerol but are calcium-independent. Atypical PKCs (ζ and λ/ι) require neither calcium nor diacylglycerol for optimal activity. Although most cells express more than one type of PKC, differences among the isoenzymes with respect to activation conditions and subcellular locations suggest that individual PKC isoenzymes mediate distinct cellular processes in a cell type-dependent manner (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar, 27Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 28Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to identify the isoenzymes that are involved in oxidant-induced neuritogenesis, particularly in the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of growth-associated proteins that are intimately involved in this process. The growth-associated protein GAP-43 (also known as neuromodulin or B-50) is abundant in developing and regenerating neurons and is believed to function in neuronal plasticity (29Skene J.H.P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The gene expression of GAP-43 is increased as a compensatory response in corticostriatal neurons after cortical lesion (30Hughes-Davis E.J. Cogen J.P. Jakowec M.W. Cheng H.W. Grenningloh G. Meshul C.K. McNeill T.H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 135: 1231-1239Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, synthesis of GAP-43 is enhanced by stabilization of its mRNA by a PKC-dependent pathway (31Mobarak C.D. Anderson K.D. Morin M. Beckel-Mitchener A. Rogers S.L. Furneaux H. King P. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3191-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). GAP-43 is also a highly specific substrate for PKC (32Coggins P. Zwiers H. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GAP-43 has the ability to directly influence the structure of the actin cytoskeleton within the growth cone (33He Q. Dent E.W. Meiri K.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3515-3524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which PKC-activating oxidants might influence the phosphorylation and function of GAP-43 in neurite outgrowth have not been previously described. In this study, using the PC12 cell model, we show that the model oxidants COCl2 and xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) activate PKC by inducing the oxidative modification of zinc-thiolates present in its regulatory domain. Additionally, we show that oxidant-induced direct regulation of PKC (particularly PKCϵ) induces neuritogenesis through a sustained activation of the MAPK pathway and the phosphorylation of GAP-43 and CREB. Materials—5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), protein kinase A, phosphorylase kinase, xanthine oxidase, xanthine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), aprotinin, leupeptin, dithiothreitol (DTT), pepstatin A, and monoclonal anti-GAP-43 antibodies were from Sigma. Myristoylated polypeptide PKC inhibitor residues 20–28, rottlerin, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), bisindolylmaleimide V (BIM V), and PD98059 were from Alexis Biochemicals. PKCϵ translocation inhibitor and G418 were from Calbiochem. Mouse NGF was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-MAPK ERK1/2 antibodies and Anti-phosphoMAPK ERK1/2 (phospho-Thr202/Tyr204) antibodies were from New England Biolabs. Anti-phospho-Ser41-GAP-43 antibodies were from PhosphoSolutions. Phospho-CREB (Ser133) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-CREB antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). N-Acetyl-d-cysteine was from Research Organics. [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) was from ICN. PKC isoenzymes α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ were partially purified from rat brains (24Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 34Ogita K. Miyamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Koide H. Fujisawa N. Kikkawa U. Sahara S. Fukami Y. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In some cases, a mixture of Ca2+-dependent isoenzymes (α, β, and γ) was used, since these isoenzymes can be purified to homogeneity in higher amounts by Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic chromatography (24Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The catalytic and regulatory domains of PKC isoenzymes (α, β, and γ) were separated by trypsin treatment and chromatographically isolated (36Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Chen Z.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PKC isoenzymes were raised by injecting hemocyanin coupled with sequence-specific peptides from the variable regions in PKC isoenzymes using published procedures (37Kosaka Y. Ogita K. Ase K. Nomura H. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These peptides and a PKC-specific substrate peptide corresponding to a neurogranin amino acid sequence (residues 25–43) were synthesized at the core facility of Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. Cell Culture and Treatments—PC12 cells, originally obtained from Dr. Christine Pike (University of Southern California), were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin. We used CoCl2 (50–150 μm) as a representative transition metal redox catalyst, and the X/XO system, composed of 0.25 mm xanthine and 1–5 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase (Sigma), as a model for the steady state generation of oxidants (10Katoh S. Mitsui Y. Kitani K. Suzuki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inactive analogs of inhibitors were used as controls for inhibitors. When agents were dissolved in organic solvents, appropriate solvent controls were used. Quantitative RT-PCR for Analyzing the Expression of Neuronal Marker Genes—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and chloroform, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, washed with 75% ethanol, and then dissolved in RNase-free water. Isolated RNA was then DNase-treated (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and cleaned using a Qiagen RNeasy kit. RNA was quantified using the BioPhotometer (Eppendorf) and used for quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the mRNA for neurofilament-L, GAP-43, and SCG10 (superior cervical ganglion-10). qRT-PCR analysis was performed with the MyiQ single-color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amplification protocol consisted of one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The dissociation curve protocol was performed at the end of the amplification to confirm a single peak near the calculated melting temperature of each amplicon. All amplifications were run in triplicate. A standard curve of cycle thresholds using serial dilutions of cDNA samples was used to calculate the relative abundance. The difference in the initial amount of total RNA between the samples was normalized in every assay using a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene expression as an internal standard. Forward and reverse PCR primers, synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), consisted of the following: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward primer (5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′), neurofilament-L forward primer (5′-TAGCGCCATGACGGGACACAATC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCTTCCTGGACGTGGCTGGTAT-3′), GAP-43 forward primer (5′-GATGGTGTCAAACCGGAGGAT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTTGTTATGTGTCCACGGAAGC-3′), and SCG-10 forward primer (5′-AGAAAGAGATGAATGGGAAGACAGA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CGGCCCATTAGAAGGTTCAG-3′). Immunofluorescence Staining of β-Tubulin III—PC12 cells were seeded at a low density on polylysine-coated culture slides (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and were grown for 24 h. The cells were then treated with 150 μm CoCl2 or the X/XO system for 2 days. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Cells were blocked in 5% goat serum before incubation with β-tubulin III monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution; Covance, Emeryville, CA) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear staining and viewed on an LSM 510 laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). No fluorescence was detected when the primary antibody was omitted. Quantitation of Neurite Outgrowth—PC12 cells were plated in polylysine-coated 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/ml in a growth medium. After 16–24 h, cells were treated with CoCl2, X/XO, NGF, or other agents either alone or in combination for 4 days. The cells were then scored for the presence of neurites (10Katoh S. Mitsui Y. Kitani K. Suzuki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lazarovici P. Petrovics G. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). For each treatment, 200 cells in each of three separate fields were scored. Cells with outgrowths longer than two diameters of the cell body were scored positive for neurites and were expressed as a percentage of the total cell number. PKC Assay—The assays of PKC as well as other protein kinases were carried out in 96-well plates with fitted filtration discs made of Durapore membrane (38Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, PKC reaction samples containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (3 million cpm), histone H1 (0.1 mg/ml), 40 μm leupeptin, and 25 μl of PKC sample in a total volume of 125 μl were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. After arresting the reaction with trichloroacetic acid and ultrafiltration, the radioactivity associated with the protein retained on the membrane was determined. In certain cases, histone H1 was replaced with 5 μM neurogranin substrate peptide (residues 25–43), and the same reactions were carried out in regular 96-well plates without filtration discs. The reaction was arrested with 10 μl of 1 m phosphoric acid, the samples were applied to Whatman P81 paper (2 × 2 cm), and the papers were washed four times with 75 mm phosphoric acid. Radioactivity retained in the washed paper was counted. PKC activity was expressed in units, where 1 unit of enzyme transfers 1 nmol of phosphate to histone H1 or neurogranin per min at 30 °C. Since a PKC assay using histone H1 as a substrate is relatively simple, it was used for determining the activity of conventional PKC isoenzymes (α, β, and γ). Histone H1, however, is not a good substrate for measuring the activity of novel and atypical isoenzymes. On the other hand, the neurogranin substrate peptide is appropriate for determining the phosphotransferase activity of all PKC isoenzymes even in the presence of protein phosphatases (39Chen S.-J. Klann E. Gower M.C. Powell C.M. Sessoms J.S. Sweatt J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this substrate for determining the activity of all PKC isoenzymes in cell extracts. Furthermore, there is significant homology between the phosphorylation domain of neurogranin and that of GAP-43 (39Chen S.-J. Klann E. Gower M.C. Powell C.M. Sessoms J.S. Sweatt J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, PKC assay using the neurogranin substrate peptide is an appropriate means for determining PKC activity in relation to GAP-43 phosphorylation. Phorbol Ester Binding—Phorbol ester binding to isolated PKC was carried out by a multiwell filtration approach using [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) as a ligand (38Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine phorbol ester binding in intact cells, PC12 cells were grown in polylysine-coated 6-well plates. The medium was changed to a serum-free medium, and then cells were treated with various concentrations of CoCl2 for 90 min. Then 37.5 nm [3H]PDBu (0.25 mCi) was added to the medium. To determine nonspecific binding, 10 μm unlabeled PDBu was included with radiolabel. After incubation for 30 min, cells were washed four times with ice-cold saline and lysed with 0.2 m NaOH. The radioactivity present in the cell extract was then determined. The specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the observed total binding (38Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Isolation of PKC from Cells Treated with CoCl2 or X/XO— Confluent PC12 cells in a serum-free medium were treated with CoCl2 or X/XO oxidase system for 15–120 min. From the oxidant-treated cells, both cytosol and detergent-solubilized membrane fractions were prepared (24Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, mercapto compounds were omitted from all of the buffers used for cell homogenization and chromatographic isolation of PKC. The cell extracts were subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography, as described previously (24Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). PKC isoenzymes were eluted with 0.1 m NaCl (peak 1), and the constitutively active forms of isoenzymes were eluted with 0.25 m NaCl (peak 2). Quantitation of Cysteine Sulfhydryls in CoCl2-modified PKC—We used a mixture of PKC isoenzymes (α, β, and γ), which can be purified in large amounts. Highly purified PKC (0.5 nmol) free from thiol agents was incubated in triplicates with various amounts of CoCl2 (0.25–10 mol/mol of PKC) in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm CaCl2 for 25 min at 30 °C. The excess CoCl2 was removed by centrifuge gel filtration using Bio-Spin 6 (Bio-Rad) columns, and then the samples were transferred to a 96-well plate (40Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Anderson W.B. Colburn N.H. Slaga T.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 246-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Accessible sulfhydryls remaining after oxidation were quantitated by a modified DTNB method (36Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Chen Z.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To each well, 50 μl of 1.2 mm DTNB was added, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. To measure the total titratable sulfhydryls present in PKC, 50 μl of 10% SDS was added to all of these samples, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read again after 5 min. NAC was used as the standard for sulfhydryl quantitation. Western Blotting Analysis of Proteins—Cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with CoCl2. The cell pellet collected by centrifugation was resuspended in a cold lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Igepal CA-630, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μm leupeptin, 150 nm pepstain A, and 0.5 mm sodium vanadate. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants, after adding electrophoresis sample buffer, were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk and subsequently incubated with the indicated primary antibodies, as described below. Specific reactive bands were detected using goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). These bands were analyzed by densitometric scanning using Scion Imaging software. Western Immunoblotting for PKC Isoenzymes—Both cytosol and membrane fractions were subjected to electrophoresis and blotted as described above. PKC isoenzymes in Western blots were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The specificity of the antibody for each PKC isoenz"

https://openalex.org/W2010799818,"We previously identified and characterized a murine BTB domain-containing protein, CIBZ (ZBTB38 in human), that interacts with CtBP and binds to methylated CpGs. However, its physiological function remained unknown. As CtBP is reportedly involved in p53-independent programmed cell death, we examine here whether CIBZ is associated with apoptosis. We found that CIBZ was highly expressed in proliferating C2C12 cells but that its expression levels decreased upon induction of apoptosis by serum starvation. Knockdown of CIBZ by small interfering RNA in C2C12 cells induced apoptosis, as determined by an increase of annexin V/propidium iodide labeling, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. CIBZ inhibition also activated caspase-7 and caspase-9, suggesting that CIBZ-associated apoptosis occurs through the mitochondrial pathway. Notably, knockdown of CIBZ in p53–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast cells also activated caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, indicating that CIBZ-associated apoptosis is mediated by a p53-independent pathway; however, because both common and distinct targets are regulated by CIBZ- and CtBP-associated apoptosis, we conclude that more than one pathway is involved. Finally, using mutagenesis and an in vitro caspase cleavage assay, we show that CIBZ is a novel substrate of caspase-3 and identify two caspase-3 recognition sites. These findings indicate, collectively, that CIBZ plays an important role by participating in the negative regulation of apoptosis in murine cells. We previously identified and characterized a murine BTB domain-containing protein, CIBZ (ZBTB38 in human), that interacts with CtBP and binds to methylated CpGs.

Apoptosis is a genetically controlled form of cell death that plays critical roles during development and tissue homeostasis by ensuring the removal of damaged or unnecessary cells (1Song Z. Steller H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M49-M52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Activation of proteolytic enzymes called caspases is a key step in the apoptotic program. Once the initiator caspase, the best characterized of which is caspase-9, is activated by cellular stress signals, it processes and activates downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7. For caspase-3, the 32-kDa inactive proenzyme is cleaved to 17- and 12-kDa fragments to form an active heterotetramer. This active form can specifically cleave its substrates at a DXXD motif to induce DNA fragmentation and morphological changes typical of cells undergoing apoptosis (1Song Z. Steller H.

Given the complexity of apoptosis and the increasing numbers of regulatory molecules known to be involved, it is likely that more regulators remain to be discovered.

Matsuda, unpublished data. 4N. Sasai, Y. Oikawa, and E. Matsuda, unpublished data. Thus, CIBZ belongs to a novel class of methylated DNA-binding proteins. However, the physiological function of CIBZ remains largely unknown. To determine the biological role of CIBZ, we focused on apoptosis because CtBP (17Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J.

Several reports link CtBP with p53-independent cell death: (i) targeting of CtBP by ARF (alternate open reading frame) results in p53-independent apoptosis (19Paliwal S. Pande S. Kovi R.C. Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Grossman S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2360-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); (ii) HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2) mediates CtBP phosphorylation and degradation in UV-induced cell death (20Zhang Q.

Iordanov M. Zhang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34810-34815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that the CtBP protein plays important roles in regulating p53-independent programmed cell death, although the precise mechanism and signaling pathway by which it does so remain unclear. We show here that CIBZ is down-regulated during apoptosis induced by DM in C2C12 cells. Using a siRNA knockdown strategy, we find that CIBZ plays an anti-apoptotic role in these cells. Our results suggest that CIBZ-associated apoptosis is independent of p53. Moreover, our results support the existence of two overlapping but distinct pathways for CIBZ- and CtBP-associated apoptosis. Finally, we present data indicating that CIBZ is a caspase-3 substrate and identify two caspase-3 cleavage sites in CIBZ. Plasmids—For N-terminally FLAG-tagged CIBZ constructs, full-length CIBZ cDNA was inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with two tandem repeats of the FLAG epitope coding sequence. For GST-CIBZ deletion constructs, BTB (amino acids 1–158), RD2 (repression domain 2) (amino acids 158–339), zinc finger 1–5 (amino acids 335–538), spacer (SP; amino acids 539–1012), and zinc finger 6–10 (amino acids 967–1197) fragments were generated by PCR and inserted in-frame into vector pGEX-5X-2 (GE Healthcare). GST-CIBZ SP2(D618A/D910A) and FLAG-tagged CIBZ(D618A/D910A) mutant constructs were made with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). DNA sequences were verified using BigDye terminator and an automated sequencer (ABI PRISM310). Cells and Cell Conditions—C2C12 mouse cells were cultured in growth medium (GM) comprising Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). p53–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, kindly provided by Dr. Richard Meehan (Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh, UK), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). To induce apoptosis in C2C12 cells, GM was replaced by DM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were carried out with the CellPhect transfection kit (GE Healthcare) as described previously (22Matsuda E. Agata Y. Sugai M. Katakai T. Gonda H. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative RT-PCR—RT-PCR was conducted as described previously (10Sasai N. Matsuda E. Sarashina E. Ishida Y. Kawaichi M. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using a Sepasol®-RNA I Super (Nacalai Tesque) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1–5 μg of total RNA with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and subsequently subjected to PCR using specific primers. The primers listed below were designed and confirmed as unique in the nonredundant NCBI Protein Database. Primers for the mouse genes were as follows: CIBZ, 5′-CCGGATCCCCATAGATCACAGACTCTCCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGTAGCTGATCACAGAGGCCGAG-3′ (reverse); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′ (reverse); p53, 5′-ACTGCATGGACGATCTGTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCATAGTTGCCCTGGTAAG-3′ (reverse); p21, 5′-ACGGTGGAACTTTGACTTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTGCGCTTGGAGTGATAGA-3′ (reverse); and p27, 5′-CGGGATCCAGATGTCAAACGTGAGAGTGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGTCGACTTACGTCTGGCGTCGAAGGC-3′ (reverse). The reaction products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. To confirm the identity of PCR products, single bands of the expected size were excised from the gels and sequenced. The signal intensity in RT-PCRs was quantified densitometrically and normalized for the expression of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. siRNA Suppression Assay—C2C12 and p53–/– MEF cells were adjusted in 3.5- or 6-cm plates to 50–70% confluence in GM 1 day before transfection. The cells were transfected with 5 nm CIBZ-specific Dicer substrate siRNA duplexes or with Dicer substrate scrambled negative control (Integrated DNA Technologies), which does not target any sequence in human and mouse, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. The siRNA-transfected cells were used 24–48 h after transfection for RT-PCR and Western blotting. Dicer substrate 27-mer siRNAs were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The CIBZ siRNA-1 sequences were 5′-phospho-GCGGACCACAUGGUGAAAUUUGUdGdA-3′ (sense) and 5′-UCACAAAUUUCACCAUGUGGUCCGCGU-3′ (antisense). The CIBZ siRNA-2 sequences were 5′-phospho-GCUGAAGAAACCAGUAAGAUUGAdAdA-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUUCAAUCUUACUGGUUUCUUCAGCGU-3′ (antisense). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (10Sasai N. Matsuda E. Sarashina E. Ishida Y. Kawaichi M. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were sonicated and lysed in lysis buffer. Proteins were separated by 8–15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with the following antibodies: anti-CIBZ (10Sasai N. Matsuda E. Sarashina E. Ishida Y. Kawaichi M. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), anti-p21 (catalog no. sc-6246, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p27 (BD Biosciences), anti-FLAG (catalog no. F3165, Sigma), and anti-α-tubulin (clone DM 1A, Sigma). Antibodies against cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-7, caspase-9, and p53 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) was used as a secondary antibody. Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide (PI) Assay—The annexin V kit (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to detect phosphatidylserine translocation from the inner to the outer plasma membrane. Briefly, for each assay, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, diluted in annexin V binding buffer containing annexin V and PI, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD Biosciences) as described previously (23Matsuda E. Shigeoka T. Iida R. Yamanaka S. Kawaichi M. Ishida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4170-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with the acquisition of a total 10,000 events/sample to ensure adequate data. In Vitro Caspase Cleavage and Immunoprecipitation Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) as described previously (24Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with 290 ng of recombinant caspase-3 (Sigma) at 37 °C for 8–12 h in 30 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequently stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To assay immunoprecipitated CIBZ protein cleavage, FLAG-tagged wild-type CIBZ or FLAG-tagged CIBZ(D618A/D910A) constructs were transfected into 293T cells. After 48 h, whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) as described previously (10Sasai N. Matsuda E. Sarashina E. Ishida Y. Kawaichi M. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), followed by an in vitro caspase-3 cleavage assay as described above. CIBZ Is Highly Expressed in Proliferating C2C12 Cells and Down-regulated during Serum Deprivation-induced Apoptosis—To determine whether CIBZ is associated with apoptosis, we first examined its expression in C2C12 cells by RT-PCR and Western blotting. CIBZ was highly expressed in proliferating C2C12 cells cultured in GM (Fig. 1) (data not shown). When GM was replaced with DM, apoptosis was induced within 24 h of serum starvation, as evidenced by the activation of caspase-3 (17/19 kDa) and cleavage of PARP (89 kDa), both of which are hallmarks of cell death. Interestingly, the CIBZ protein level decreased substantially within 8 h, becoming barely detectable at 24 h and undetectable at 48 h after the switch to DM. In contrast, expression of CIBZ mRNA, as monitored by semiquantitative PCR analysis, was relatively stable and had decreased only slightly at 48 h. This result suggests that CIBZ is associated with apoptosis and that CIBZ protein degradation accounts for the observed post-transcriptional regulation. Reduction of CIBZ via RNA Interference Induces Apoptosis in C2C12 Cells—To test whether CIBZ inhibition is sufficient to induce apoptosis, we examined the effect of CIBZ reduction in C2C12 cells by siRNA using transient transfection of C2C12 cells with two Dicer substrate 27-mer siRNA duplexes targeting different regions of the CIBZ gene. siRNAs were used at very a low concentration (5 nm) to avoid unwanted off-target effects. To confirm the specificity of the CIBZ siRNA, we also monitored the levels of Bax and Noxa proteins, which have pro-apoptotic activities and are reported to be targets of apoptosis involving CtBP (17Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J. Zhang Q. Goodman R.H. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4568-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Paliwal S. Pande S. Kovi R.C. Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Grossman S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2360-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). No effects on the expression of these proteins were observed when CIBZ was knocked down (data not shown), further suggesting that the reduction of the CIBZ level was an antisense-specific effect. As shown in Fig. 2A, CIBZ siRNA-1 and siRNA-2 led to effective down-regulation of CIBZ mRNA and protein levels in C2C12 cells, visualized by semiquantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. CIBZ knockdown by siRNA also resulted in caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, indicating that CIBZ inhibition induces apoptosis. Importantly, levels of activated caspase-9 and, to a lesser extent, caspase-7 also increased, suggesting that CIBZ-associated cell death occurs through the mitochondrion-mediated pathway. Additionally, reduction of CIBZ expression up-regulated the expression of p21 and p27 proteins (Fig. 2A). This observation is in accordance with previous reports that serum deprivation-induced apoptosis stimulates the expression of these two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in C2C12 cells (8Shen X. Collier J. Hlaing M. Zhang L. Delshad E. Bristow J. Bernstein H. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Tannu N.S. Rao V.K. Chaudhary R.M. Giorgianni F. Saeed A.E. Gao Y. Raghow R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 1065-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of p21 and caspase-3 activation were both observed when CtBP (17Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J. Zhang Q. Goodman R.H. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4568-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Wang S. Iordanov M. Zhang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34810-34815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or CIBZ was inhibited, suggesting the presence of a common pathway of apoptosis. Similar results were also obtained for two other 21-mer siRNA duplexes targeting different regions of the CIBZ gene (data not shown). To confirm that CIBZ down-regulation induces apoptosis, binding of annexin V, another early indicator of apoptosis, was examined in C2C12 cells. Because annexin V binds to externalized phosphatidylserine on membranes of early apoptotic cells, we used flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V and the necrotic indicator propidium iodide, which binds to nucleic acids when the cell membrane is damaged. As shown in Fig. 2B, reduction of CIBZ by siRNA increased early apoptosis and late apoptosis/secondary necrosis, as determined by annexin V-positive/PI-negative and annexin V-FITC/PI-double positive cells, respectively, again indicating that CIBZ knockdown in C2C12 cells induces apoptosis. Reduction of CIBZ in p53–/– MEF Cells Induces Apoptosis—p53 plays an important role in regulating apoptosis. To determine whether p53 participates in the process of CIBZ-associated apoptosis, we inhibited CIBZ in p53–/– MEF cells and monitored apoptosis. Both CIBZ siRNAs down-regulated the expression of CIBZ efficiently at the mRNA (data not shown) and protein (Fig. 3) levels in these cells; simultaneously, caspase-3 was activated, and PARP was cleaved. These results, together with the observation that CIBZ knockdown in C2C12 cells did not influence the expression of p53 (Fig. 2A), strongly suggest that CIBZ-associated apoptosis is independent of the p53-mediated pathway. CIBZ Is a Substrate of Caspase-3—Inspection of the CIBZ protein sequence revealed five putative caspase recognition sites (DXXD): two in the N-terminal BTB domain and the other three in the spacer (Fig. 4, upper panel). Together with the finding that the down-regulation of CIBZ mediated apoptosis, this suggested that CIBZ might represent a novel caspase-3 substrate. To explore this possibility, CIBZ deletion mutants were fused to GST and subjected to an in vitro caspase-3 cleavage assay. As seen in Fig. 4 (lower panel), degradation and cleavage of GST-BTB, GST-RD2, GST-zinc finger 1–5, and GST-zinc finger 6–10 were not detected by treatment with recombinant caspase-3 at 37 °C for 8 h, conditions that are sufficient for complete digestion of GST-SP. Together, these results demonstrate that CIBZ is indeed a substrate of caspase-3 and that only the SP domain is susceptible to caspase-3 cleavage. Characterization of Caspase-3 Cleavage Sites in CIBZ—We next wished to identify the caspase-3 cleavage sites on CIBZ-SP by means of an in vitro cleavage assay. As noted above, there are three DXXD motifs in the SP domain: DFQD618, DNFD667, and DSTD910. We speculated that DFQD618 and DSTD910 are cleavage sites for caspase-3 because the sizes of the expected products of cleavage at these sites matched the observed cleavage results (Fig. 4) (data not shown). To confirm this, we performed PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis: Asp618 and Asp910 were changed to alanine, referred to as D618A and D910A, respectively. We also constructed a double mutant in which Asp618 and Asp910 were both mutated to alanine (D618A/D910A). The results of in vitro assays showed that neither GST-SP(D618A) nor GST-SP(D910A) abrogated entirely the cleavage by recombinant caspase-3 (data not shown). By contrast, the GST-SP(D618A/D910A) mutation abolished the cleavage (Fig. 5A), indicating that DFQD618 and DSTD910 are the essential sites for cleavage by caspase-3 in vitro. To further ascertain the effect of recombinant caspase-3 on mammalian expressed CIBZ(D618A/D910A), we constructed FLAG-tagged CIBZ(D618A/D910A) and transiently transfected it into 293T cells. Transfected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG affinity gel, subjected to an in vitro caspase-3 cleavage assay, and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-CIBZ antibody. As shown in Fig. 5B, protein degradation was effectively abrogated in FLAG-CIBZ(D618A/D910) but not in wild-type CIBZ, confirming that DFQD618 and DSTD910 in the SP domain are the recognition sites used for caspase-3 cleavage. The development of resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of malignant cells, enabling them to survive despite apoptosis-inducing environmental signals. Mutation of p53 is common in tumor cells that can escape apoptosis, but the mechanism by which mutated p53 facilitates apoptotic escape remains elusive and controversial. The observation that knockdown of CIBZ induces cell death in p53–/– MEFs suggests that, in this case, cell death occurs through a p53-independent pathway and that CIBZ may play an important role by participating in this process. CIBZ down-regulation by siRNA in NIH3T3 fibroblasts does not induce apoptosis directly but sensitizes these cells to apoptosis triggered by UV light or actinomycin D (data not shown), suggesting that CIBZ inhibition-induced apoptosis is cell type-dependent. Together with the result that CIBZ knockdown induces apoptosis in C2C12 and p53–/– MEFs (Figs. 2A and 3), these findings suggest that CIBZ down-regulation may be a common precursor to apoptosis in murine cells. Our previous report that CIBZ interacts with CtBP, a core-pressor that also functions as a p53-independent anti-apoptotic factor, implied that common targets and/or a common pathway might exist for these two proteins. Indeed, activation of caspase-3 and up-regulation of p21 were both observed in CIBZ knockdown (Fig. 2A) and CtBP knock-out cells (17Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J. Zhang Q. Goodman R.H. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4568-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Wang S. Iordanov M. Zhang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34810-34815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting the further possibility that a common or overlapping pathway might exist and that p21 might act as a common target of CIBZ and CtBP. It is noteworthy that apoptotic signaling by these two proteins might also, on the other hand, follow distinct pathways: (i) knockdown/knock-out of CtBP results in up-regulation of several pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Noxa (17Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J. Zhang Q. Goodman R.H. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4568-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas such effects were not evident in CIBZ-depleted cells examined in the course of our present work (data not shown); (ii) it is not clear whether initiator caspases such as caspase-9 and effector caspases such as caspase-7 are also activated in CtBP-depleted cells; and (iii) up-regulation of p21 was observed only at the protein level in CIBZ knockdown cells (Fig. 2A), in contrast to CtBP knock-out cells, in which p21 mRNA was also up-regulated (17Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J. Zhang Q. Goodman R.H. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4568-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The different cell lines used might account for the altered differential expression of apoptosisassociated genes caused by these two proteins. Our results show that CIBZ inhibition resulted in the activation of caspase-9, -3, and -7 (Fig. 2A), but not caspase-8 (data not shown), indicating that CIBZ-associated apoptosis is mitochondrion-dependent. Considering that CIBZ functions as a transcriptional regulator (repressor or activator) when fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (10Sasai N. Matsuda E. Sarashina E. Ishida Y. Kawaichi M. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and can bind to methylated CpGs,4 we speculate that it might repress or activate expression of pro- or anti-apoptotic genes. However, we failed to observe fluctuation of several pro-apoptotic regulators (Bax, Bak, and Noxa) and anti-apoptotic regulators (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL) at both the mRNA and protein levels when CIBZ was inhibited in either C2C12 cells or p53–/– MEFs (data not shown). This suggests the complexity of CIBZ-associated apoptosis. Among regulators responsible for mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis, inhibitors of caspases are reported to block the activating cleavage of caspase-9, -3, and -7 (25Fesik S.W. Shi Y. Science. 2001; 294: 1477-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the activities of these caspases are antagonized by the IAP inhibitors Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2/Omi (25Fesik S.W. Shi Y. Science. 2001; 294: 1477-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Shi Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Experiments are under way to examine expression of the above genes before and after CIBZ inhibition. Our finding that CIBZ down-regulation by siRNA is sufficient to induce apoptosis in C2C12 and p53–/– MEFs suggests strongly that CIBZ functions as an anti-apoptotic regulator and that overexpressed CIBZ may prevent apoptosis induced by a variety of triggers, in a similar fashion to Mirk (27Mercer S.E. Ewton D.Z. Deng X. Lim S. Mazur T.R. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25788-25801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, we found no evidence that ectopic CIBZ expression prevents serum-, UV light-, or staurosporine-induced apoptosis in several cell lines (data not shown). This is probably due to the rapid degradation of CIBZ protein under apoptosis induction (Fig. 1) (data not shown), which is likely to be a consequence of its post-transcriptional modification. This is reminiscent of the failure of ectopically expressed wild-type CtBP to prevent apoptosis, whereas its S422A mutant, which is resistant to phosphorylation, can effectively block cell death triggered by UV light (20Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cleavage of CIBZ by caspase-3 is unlikely to be the major cause either of its proteolysis or apoptotic cell death in C2C12 cells and p53–/– MEFs from the following evidences: (i) no CIBZ cleavage bands were detected, either by anti-CIBZ antibody against wild-type CIBZ or by anti-Myc antibody against N- or C-terminally Myc-tagged CIBZ, at a variety of time points (data not shown); and (ii) overexpression of CIBZ(D618A/D910A), a caspase-3-resistant mutant whose cleavage by active caspase-3 is completely blocked (Fig. 4, A and B), was degraded as quickly as that of wild-type CIBZ under apoptosis induction and displayed no anti-apoptotic effect (data not shown). In fact, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 can efficiently prevent CIBZ degradation under apoptosis induction (data not shown), suggesting that CIBZ proteolysis depends mainly on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We have demonstrated both that CIBZ is a novel substrate for caspase-3 and that the recognition sites are located in the SP domain at DFQD618 and DSTD910. For many of the known caspase-3 substrates, the consequences of their cleavage have only been inferred by extrapolation from the function of the uncleaved protein (29Fischer U. Janicke R. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). In the case of CIBZ, although the biological function of cleavage remains likewise to be proven, the existence of two cleavage sites, both located in the SP domain, is noteworthy. The SP domain also contains two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals, at amino acids 845–865 and 922–940, and the second cleavage site DSTD910 is situated between them. Experiments using the two mutated caspase-3 cleavage sites, in combination with mutated nuclear localization signal sequences, should illuminate the contributions of these motifs to the regulation of apoptosis, transcriptional activation, subcellular localization, DNA-binding activity, and protein-protein interactions. In conclusion, our findings in this study are the first evidence that CIBZ has a physiological function, participating in the negative regulation of apoptosis in murine cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report that down-regulation of a methylated DNA-binding protein activates a member of the caspase family.

https://openalex.org/W2063828583,"In Archaea, acetate formation and ATP synthesis from acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by an unusual ADP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACD) (acetyl-CoA + ADP + P(i) acetate + ATP + HS-CoA) catalyzing the formation of acetate from acetyl-CoA and concomitant ATP synthesis by the mechanism of substrate level phosphorylation. ACD belongs to the protein superfamily of nucleoside diphosphate-forming acyl-CoA synthetases, which also include succinyl-CoA synthetases (SCSs). ACD differs from SCS in domain organization of subunits and in the presence of a second highly conserved histidine residue in the beta-subunit, which is absent in SCS. The influence of these differences on structure and reaction mechanism of ACD was studied with heterotetrameric ACD (alpha(2)beta(2)) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus in comparison with heterotetrameric SCS. A structural model of P. furiosus ACD was constructed suggesting a novel spatial arrangement of the subunits different from SCS, however, maintaining a similar catalytic site. Furthermore, kinetic and molecular properties and enzyme phosphorylation as well as the ability to catalyze arsenolysis of acetyl-CoA were studied in wild type ACD and several mutant enzymes. The data indicate that the formation of enzyme-bound acetyl phosphate and enzyme phosphorylation at His-257alpha, respectively, proceed in analogy to SCS. In contrast to SCS, in ACD the phosphoryl group is transferred from the His-257alpha to ADP via transient phosphorylation of a second conserved histidine residue in the beta-subunit, His-71beta. It is proposed that ACD reaction follows a novel four-step mechanism including transient phosphorylation of two active site histidine residues:"

The molecular mechanisms responsible for the dysregulated innate host response leading to enhanced IL-23 gene expression in IL-10<sup>–/–</sup> mice are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Bcl3 in controlling LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) isolated from IL-10<sup>–/–</sup> mice. We report higher IL-23p19 mRNA accumulation and protein secretion in LPS-stimulated BMDC isolated from IL-10<sup>–/–</sup> compared with WT mice. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced B cell leukemia 3 (Bcl3) expression was strongly impaired (90% decrease) in IL-10<sup>–/–</sup> BMDC compared with WT BMDC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated enhanced RelA binding to the IL-23p19 promoter in IL-10<sup>–/–</sup> compared with WT BMDC. Bcl3 overexpression decreased LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in IL-10<sup>–/–</sup> BMDC, which correlated with enhanced NF-κB p50 binding and decreased RelA binding to the gene promoter. Conversely, Bcl3 knockdown enhanced LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in WT BMDC. Moreover, LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression was significantly enhanced in Bcl3<sup>–/–</sup> BMDC compared with WT BMDC. In conclusion, enhanced LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in IL-10<sup>–/–</sup> mice is due to impaired Bcl3 expression leading to diminished p50 and enhanced RelA recruitment to the IL-23p19 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1973703151,"Sustained nigrostriatal dopamine depletion increases the serine/threonine phosphorylation of multiple striatal proteins that play a role in corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, including Thr286 phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα). Mechanisms underlying these changes are unclear, but protein phosphatases play a critical role in the acute modulation of striatal protein phosphorylation. Here we show that dopamine depletion for periods ranging from 3 weeks to 10 months significantly reduces the total activity of protein phosphatase (PP) 1, but not of PP2A, in whole lysates of rat striatum, as measured using multiple substrates, including Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKIIα. Striatal PP1 activity is partially inhibited by a fragment of the PP1-binding protein neurabin-I, Nb-(146–493), because of the selective inhibition of the PP1γ1 isoform. The fraction of PP1 activity that is insensitive to Nb-(146–493) was unaffected by dopamine depletion, demonstrating that dopamine depletion specifically reduces the activity of PP1 isoforms that are sensitive to Nb-(146–493) (i.e. PP1γ1). However, total striatal levels of PP1γ1 or any other PP1 isoform were unaffected by dopamine depletion, and our previous studies showed that total levels of the PP1 regulatory/targeting proteins DARPP-32, spinophilin, and neurabin were also unchanged. Rather, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that dopamine depletion increases the association of PP1γ1 with spinophilin in striatal extracts.

PP1 selectively dephosphorylates CaMKII that is associated with postsynaptic densities, whereas soluble CaMKII is primarily dephosphorylated by PP2A (2Strack S. Choi S. Lovinger D.M. Colbran R.J. J.

Symptoms of Parkinson disease initially respond to dopamine replacement therapy, but as the disease progresses this approach generates debilitating side effects and/or loses efficacy. Studies of animal models, such as the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat, have provided innumerable insights about terminal consequences of striatal dopamine depletion and the mechanisms underlying striatal deficits in Parkinson disease, resulting in improved therapeutic strategies (reviewed in Ref. 27Cenci M.A. Whishaw I.Q. Schallert T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Dopamine depletion increases Thr286 autophosphorylation of CaMKII, and this increase is reversed by dopamine replacement using levodopa (28Brown A.M. Deutch A.Y. Colbran R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Picconi B. Gardoni F. Centzone D. Mauceri D. Cenci M.A. Bernardi G. Calabresi P. DiLuca M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5283-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, CaMKII inhibitors normalize dopamine depletion-induced alterations in both synaptic plasticity and behavior (29Picconi B. Gardoni F. Centzone D. Mauceri D. Cenci M.A. Bernardi G. Calabresi P. DiLuca M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5283-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Oh J.D. Vaughan C.L. Chase T.N. Brain Res. 1999; 821: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that altered regulation of CaMKII plays a critical role in the parkinsonian phenotype. The enhanced phosphorylation of CaMKII at Thr286 is sustained at similar levels for up to 18 months after inducing dopamine depletion (28Brown A.M. Deutch A.Y. Colbran R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, increased phosphorylation of a downstream CaMKII target, Ser831 in the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate-type glutamate receptor GluR1 subunit, is detected 9–18 months, but not 3–6 weeks, after dopamine depletion (28Brown A.M. Deutch A.Y. Colbran R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These data suggest complex interactions between the effects of long term dopamine depletion and aging that may have additional effects on striatal function. Striatal dopamine depletion could increase CaMKII autophosphorylation by at least two potentially linked mechanisms. First, increased corticostriatal glutamatergic drive (21Meschul C.K. Emre N. Nakamura C.M. Allen C. Donohue M.K. Buckman J.F. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 31Jonkers N. Sarre S. Ebinger G. Michotte Y. Brain Res. 2002; 926: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) might activate N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors or voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, enhancing postsynaptic Ca2+ influx and CaMKII autophosphorylation. Second, reduced protein phosphatase activity(ies) might allow increased phosphorylation of CaMKII and other proteins. Many acute effects of dopamine are thought to require inhibition of striatal PP1 by the Thr34-phosphorylated form of DARPP-32 (32Pisani A. Centonze D. Bernardi G. Calabresi P. Movement Disorders. 2005; 24: 395-402Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33Svenningsson P. Nishi A. Fisone G. Girault J.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Regulation of PP1 localization by spinophilin and neurabin also is critical for normal synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine morphology (9Feng J. Yan Z. Ferreira A. Tomizawa K. Liauw J.A. Zhuo M.

Here we report that chronic striatal dopamine depletion selectively decreases the activity of the PP1γ1 isoform, apparently by enhancing its association with spinophilin. This reduction in PP1 activity may allow enhanced phosphorylation of multiple striatal proteins, including CaMKII, thereby playing a key role in mediating changes in synaptic morphology and/or function following dopamine depletion. 6-OHDA Lesion Surgery—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan; Indianapolis, IN) were housed under a 12:12 light:dark cycle with food and water freely available. Experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health), under the oversight of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats (3 months old) underwent unilateral 6-OHDA lesion surgery, or received sham (vehicle) injections, as detailed previously (28Brown A.M. Deutch A.Y. Colbran R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At the times indicated after surgery, rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated, and the brains removed. Data reported here were obtained from six batches of 6–8 rats sacrificed at times ranging from 3 weeks to 11 months following lesion surgery to assess the long term consequences of dopamine depletion. Rats in which a 6-OHDA lesion induced a >90% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase in the lesioned striatum relative to the intact contralateral striatum were considered to be completely dopamine-depleted. Rats with <90% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase in the lesioned hemisphere were considered to have a partial dopamine depletion, and data obtained from these animals were not included in quantitative analyses. The 6-OHDA lesioned rat is a well established model of essentially complete dopamine depletion and is well suited to the study of long term effects of striatal dopamine depletion. As such, it has proven to be a reliable animal model of Parkinson disease (27Cenci M.A. Whishaw I.Q. Schallert T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting (dilutions indicated) and/or for immunoprecipitation: whole serum and affinity-purified sheep and rabbit anti-PP1γ1 and anti-PP1β (7Strack S.

Secondary antibodies were from Promega (goat anti-mouse HRP, 1:2000; goat anti-rabbit HRP, 1:4000), AlphaQuest (rabbit anti-goat HRP, 1:4000), or Santa Cruz Biotechnology (goat anti-mouse HRP or donkey anti-sheep HRP preadsorbed with human and/or mouse IgG, 1:5000). Immunoblots—Dorsolateral striatum was isolated, processed for immunoblotting, and immunoblotted as described previously (28Brown A.M. Deutch A.Y. Colbran R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Tissue Homogenates for Phosphatase Activity Assays—Punches (1.15-mm inner diameter) of dorsolateral striatum were removed from both hemispheres of 1.0-mm-thick coronal slices, at the level of the crossing of the anterior commissure. Punches were immediately homogenized using a Kontes tissue homogenizer in ice-cold 7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Homogenates were stored at –80 °C and analyzed within 1–2 weeks. Protein Phosphatase Activity Assays—Phosphatase activities were assayed using [32P]phosphorylase a, [32P]casein, or Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKIIα substrates, as described previously (3Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts (10 μl of 0.1–0.2 mg/ml extract) were incubated at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m sodium chloride, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min ([32P]phosphorylase a and [32P]casein) or 45 min (Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKIIα) in a final volume of 50 μl. Caffeine (5 mm) was included with [32P]phosphorylase a, and assay blanks were incubated without extract. Trichloroacetic acid (50 μl of 40% w/v) was added to terminate the reaction and samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min). Supernatants (80-μl aliquots) were analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter to quantify 32P released from the protein substrate. Where indicated, diluted extracts were preincubated with the following inhibitors for ∼10 min on ice prior to initiating assays by addition of substrate. Nb-(146–453) and Nb-(146–493) were prepared as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and were characterized previously (12Carmody L.C. Bauman P.A. Bass M.A. Mavila N. DePaoli-Roach A.A.

FASEB J. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Nb-(146–453) does not contain the PP1 binding domain (residues 457–460) or the PP1γ1 selectivity domain (residues 473–479) that are present in Nb-(146–493). Inhibitor-2 (Calbiochem) and okadaic acid (LC Laboratories) were also used. PP2A activity was defined as the activity inhibited by 2.5 nm okadaic acid. PP1 activity was defined as the difference in activities measured using 2.5 nm and 2.5 μm okadaic acid. PP1γ1 activity was defined as the phosphatase activity inhibited by Nb-(146–493). Immunoprecipitations—For phosphatase activity assays (Fig. 5A), native PP1γ1 and PP1β holoenzymes were isolated from extracts of whole striatum by immunoprecipitation. Briefly, freshly dissected whole striatal tissue was homogenized in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Homogenates were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were diluted to 1 mg/ml in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5% Triton X-100). Samples were precleared using gammabind-G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with sheep antisera to PP1γ1 or PP1β (5 μl each). After addition of gammabind-G-Sepharose (30 μl of a 50:50 slurry), incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were sedimented, washed five times with 1 ml of IP buffer, suspended in homogenization buffer lacking Triton X-100, and immediately assayed. For co-immunoprecipitations, intact (control) and lesioned (dopamine depleted) dorsolateral striatal punches (see above) were homogenized separately in the same buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Aliquots (0.5 ml) of diluted/precleared soluble extracts were immunoprecipitated using rabbit antibodies to PP1γ1 (5 μl of affinity-purified), spinophilin (5 μl of protein A-purified), or control IgG in IP Buffer containing the same phosphatase inhibitors. Washed immunoprecipitates and aliquots of the input and immune supernatants were mixed with sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence detection. X-ray films exposed in the linear range were scanned and quantified using Image J (rsb.info.nih.gov). PP1γ1 and spinophilin signals in immune complexes were normalized to the corresponding input signal and then expressed as a ratio between the dopamine-depleted (lesioned) and intact hemispheres. Statistical Analyses—Statistical comparisons were made by paired or unpaired Student's t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test, as appropriate. Phosphorylation of protein phosphatase catalytic or regulatory subunits can regulate their activity and/or localization. Therefore, we developed conditions that limit dephosphorylation of putative regulatory sites following homogenization of striatal samples but allow for detection of phosphatase activities in diluted extracts. Homogenization in the presence of organic phosphatase inhibitors such as microcystin LR is most effective in blocking protein dephosphorylation, but no phosphatase activity was detected when striatal homogenates containing microcystin LR were diluted (data not shown), presumably because this inhibitor is effectively irreversible. However, inclusion of a mixture of inorganic phosphatase inhibitors in the homogenization buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) allowed the detection of PP1 and PP2A activity if striatal homogenates were diluted 10-fold immediately prior to the assay. Total Phosphatase Activity Is Decreased Following Dopamine Depletion—We measured phosphatase activities in extracts of dorsolateral striatum ipsilateral or contralateral to 6-OHDA lesion of the substantia nigra. Extracts were prepared from different batches of animals 3–4 weeks or 10–11 months after lesion surgery to assess the consequences of long term dopamine depletion. Using [32P]phosphorylase a as a model substrate, activity in the dopamine-depleted striatum was significantly decreased by ≈18% when measured 3–4 weeks after lesion surgery (Fig. 1A) or by ≈14% when measured 10–11 months after surgery (data not shown; n = 13, p = 0.04). In contrast, there was no significant difference in total phosphatase activities at either time point if [32P]casein was used as the model substrate (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Dopamine Depletion Selectively Decreases PP1 Activity—The choice of exogenous protein substrate affects the specific phosphatases that can be detected in assays of whole tissue homogenates. Generally, [32P]phosphorylase a is considered a PP1-selective substrate but also detects PP2A activity, whereas [32P]casein is an effective PP2A substrate (reviewed in Ref. 39Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To more specifically compare PP1 and PP2A activities in control and dopamine-depleted striatal extracts, we measured phosphatase activities toward [32P]phosphorylase a and [32P]casein in the presence of 0, 2.5 nm, or 2.5 μm okadaic acid. Okadaic acid selectively inhibits PP2A-like enzymes at low nanomolar concentrations, but will also inhibit PP1 at micromolar concentrations (39Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Our previous studies defined PP2A activity as the activity inhibited by 2.5 nm okadaic acid and PP1 activity as the difference in activities measured at 2.5 nm and 2.5 μm okadaic acid (3Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). PP1 activity detected using [32P]phosphorylase a was significantly decreased by 22% at 3–4 weeks following lesion surgery (Fig. 2A) and by ≈16% at 10–11 months after surgery (data not shown; n = 13, p = 0.014). However, PP2A activity detected using either [32P]phosphorylase a or [32P]casein substrate was not significantly different between the striatal hemispheres when measured 3–4 weeks (Fig. 2B) or 10–12 months (data not shown; n = 13) after lesion surgery. Dopamine Depletion Inhibits PP1-mediated Dephosphorylation of CaMKIIα—To ascertain whether dopamine depletion affects dephosphorylation of a physiologically relevant substrate, we assayed phosphatase activity toward exogenous Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKIIα in the presence of various concentrations of okadaic acid. As reported previously in whole forebrain extracts (3Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), ∼80% of the total activity could be assigned to PP2A based on the sensitivity to 2.5 nm okadaic acid. However, this PP2A activity was unaffected by dopamine depletion. In contrast, PP1 activity toward [32P-Thr286]CaMKIIα (defined as the difference in activities at 2.5 nm and 2.5 μm okadaic acid) was significantly decreased by ≈19% after dopamine-depletion surgery (Fig. 3). Phosphatase Isoform Levels Are Unchanged by Dopamine Depletion—The decreased phosphatase activity in dopamine-depleted striatum may be due to changes in the levels of specific phosphatase catalytic subunit isoforms, perhaps because of degeneration of dopaminergic terminals and/or the dendritic spines of MSNs. Therefore, aliquots of striatal extracts used in activity assays were immunoblotted for various PP1 catalytic subunit isoforms (α, β, and γ1) and for the PP2A catalytic subunit. These proteins are highly expressed in MSNs but are also present in presynaptic terminals. Despite the substantial degeneration of terminals, as reflected by the loss of >90% of tyrosine hydroxylase, there were no significant differences in levels of PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunit isoforms between intact and lesioned hemispheres (Fig. 4). This may reflect relatively low expression of these proteins in dopaminergic terminals and/or the small contribution of the terminals to total striatal tissue. Nb-(146–493) Is a Novel, Selective Inhibitor of PP1γ1 in Striatal Extracts—Differential subcellular targeting of PP1 isoforms in neurons suggests that these proteins have different biological roles (7Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Bordelon J.R. Smith Y. Nairn A. Colbran R.J. Greengard P. Muly E.C. Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 1928-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We sought to develop an assay that differentiates the contributions of PP1 isoforms to the total PP1 activity in extracts. Nb-(146–493) is a GST fusion protein that inhibits isolated brain PP1γ1 catalytic subunit ≈20-fold more potently than it inhibits isolated brain PP1β catalytic subunit (12Carmody L.C. Bauman P.A.

To determine whether this selectivity might be useful in discriminating PP1 isoform activities in tissue extracts, we investigated the effects of Nb-(146–493) (1 μm) on the activities of striatal PP1γ1 and PP1β holoenzyme complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation. Immunoblots of the isolated complexes confirmed the isoform specificity of the immunoprecipitations (Fig. 5A). Both isoform complexes displayed activity toward [32P]phosphorylase a in the presence of 2.5 nm okadaic acid, which could be completely blocked by 2.5 μm okadaic acid, consistent with the specific immunoprecipitation of active PP1. Significantly, Nb-(146–493) (1 μm) almost completely blocked activity in PP1γ1 immunoprecipitates but had no significant effect on PP1β activity (Fig. 5A). Thus, Nb-(146–493) is a highly selective inhibitor of striatal PP1γ1 holoenzymes over PP1β holoenzymes. We"
https://openalex.org/W2100080174,"Cortactin is a filamentous actin-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in translating environmental signals into coordinated rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. The dynamic reorganization of actin in the cytoskeleton drives processes including changes in cell morphology, cell migration, and phagocytosis. In general, structural proteins of the cytoskeleton bind in the N-terminal region of cortactin and regulatory proteins in the C-terminal region. Previous structural studies have reported an extended conformation for cortactin. It is therefore unclear how cortactin facilitates cross-talk between structural proteins and their regulators. In the study presented here, circular dichroism, chemical cross-linking, and small angle x-ray scattering are used to demonstrate that cortactin adopts a globular conformation, thereby bringing distant parts of the molecule into close proximity. In addition, the actin bundling activity of cortactin is characterized, showing that fully polymerized actin filaments are bundled into sheet-like structures. We present a low resolution structure that suggests how the various domains of cortactin interact to coordinate its array of binding partners at sites of actin branching."
https://openalex.org/W1974835491,"The homeobox gene Cdx1 is involved in anteroposterior patterning in embryos and its expression selectively persists in the intestinal epithelium throughout life. In human colon cancers, Cdx1 is overexpressed in few cases and lost in the majority of adenocarcinomas. We used mouse models of gain and loss-of-function to investigate the role of Cdx1 in intestinal development and cancers. Transgenic mice overexpressing Cdx1 and knockout mice exhibited a morphologically normal intestine. Cell proliferation, specification into the four differentiated lineages and migration along the crypt-villus axis were unchanged compared to wild-type mice. Changing Cdx1 caused an inverse and dose-dependent modification of the expression of the paralogous gene Cdx2, indicating that Cdx1 fine-tunes Cdx2 activity. Transgenenic and knockout mice failed to spontaneously develop tumours. Overexpressing Cdx1 was without incidence on the frequency of intestinal tumours induced chemically by azoxymethane treatment or genetically in ApcΔ14/+ mice. However, it augmented the severity of the tumours in ApcΔ14/+ mice. Inversely, the loss-of-function of Cdx1 in knockout mice was without incidence on the growth of tumours induced by azoxymethane. We conclude that Cdx1 is dispensable for intestinal development and that its overexpression could increase malignancy in early stages of tumourigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2162271201,"CULLIN 2 (CUL2) is a component of the ElonginB/C-CUL2-RBX-1-Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor complex that ubiquitinates and degrades hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha). HIFalpha is a transcription factor that mediates the expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which in turn regulates vasculogenesis. Whereas CUL2 participates in the degradation of HIFalpha, the potential role of CUL2 in the regulation of other cellular processes is less well established. In the present study, suppression of CUL2 expression by Cul2 siRNA inhibited HIFalpha transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene in vitro, indicating that CUL2 plays a role distinct from its known function in HIFalpha degradation. Because ARNT heterodimerizes with HIFalpha, we assessed whether CUL2 influenced ARNT expression. Cul2 siRNA inhibited the expression of endogenous ARNT. Ectopically expressed ARNT reversed the inhibition of HIF activity by Cul2 siRNA in the VEGF promoter, suggesting that CUL2 regulates HIF activation through ARNT. In 786-O cells lacking VHL, Cul2 siRNA suppressed the expression of both ARNT and VEGF, indicating that CUL2 regulates HIF activity independently of VHL. In transgenic zebrafish expressing GFP driven by the Flk promoter (a known HIF target), zCul2 morpholino blocked embryonic vasculogenesis in a manner similar to that caused by inhibition of VEGF-A. In the zebrafish embryos, zCul2 inhibited the expression of CUL2, VEGF, and Flk-GFP protein, indicating that CUL2 is required for expression of other vasculogenic HIF targets. Taken together, CUL2 is required for normal vasculogenesis, at least in part mediated by its regulation of HIF-mediated transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1989415280,"Id-1 (Inhibitor of DNA binding/differential-1) plays a positive role in tumorigenesis through regulation of multiple signaling pathways. Recently, it is suggested that upregulation of Id-1 in cancer cells promotes chromosomal instability. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not known. In this study, we report a novel function of Id-1 in regulation of mitosis through physical interaction with Cdc20 (cell division cycle protein 20) and Cdh1 (Cdc20 homolog 1). During early mitosis, Id-1 interacts with Cdc20 and RASSF1A (Ras association domain family 1A), leading to enhanced APCCdc20 activity, which in turn promotes cyclin B1/securin degradation and premature mitosis. During late mitosis, Id-1 binds to Cdh1 and disrupts the interaction between Cdh1 and APC, resulting in suppression of APCCdh1 activity. On the other hand, overexpression of Cdh1 leads to Id-1 protein degradation, suggesting that Id-1 may also act as a substrate of APCCdh1. The negative effect of Id-1 on APCCdh1 results in suppression of APCCdh1-induced Aurora A and Cdc20 degradation, leading to failure in cytokinesis. As a result, overexpression of Id-1 in human prostate epithelial cells leads to polyploidy in response to microtubule disruption, and this effect is abolished when Id-1 expression is suppressed using antisense technology. These results demonstrate a novel function of Id-1 in promoting chromosomal instability through modification of APC/C activity during mitosis and provide a novel molecular mechanism accounted for the function of Id-1 as an oncogene."

In this study, we investigated the role of Tax in the regulation of the ZNF268 gene, which plays a role in the differentiation of blood cells and the pathogenesis of leukemia. We demonstrated that ZNF268 mRNA was repressed in HTLV-1-infected cells. We also showed that stable and transient expression of HTLV-1 Tax led to repression of ZNF268. In addition, by using reporter constructs that bear the human ZNF268 promoter and its mutants, we showed that Tax repressed ZNF268 promoter in a process dependent on a functional cAMP-responsive element. By using Tax, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-1, CREB-2, and their mutants, we further showed that Tax repressed ZNF268 through the CREB/activating transcription factor pathway. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated the formation of the complex of Tax.CREB-1 directly at the cAMP-responsive element both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest a role for ZNF268 in aberrant T-cell proliferation observed in HTLV-1-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1996624351,"A conformationally altered prelatent form of antithrombin that possesses both anticoagulant and antiangiogenic activities is produced during the conversion of native to latent antithrombin (Larsson, H., Akerud, P., Nordling, K., Raub-Segall, E., Claesson-Welsh, L., and Björk, I. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11996–12002). Here, we show that the previously characterized prelatent antithrombin is a mixture of native antithrombin and a modified, true prelatent antithrombin that are resolvable by heparin-agarose chromatography. Kinetic analyses revealed that prelatent antithrombin is an intermediate in the conversion of native to latent antithrombin whose formation is favored by stabilizing anions of the Hofmeister series. Purified prelatent antithrombin had reduced anticoagulant function compared with native antithrombin, due to a reduced heparin affinity and consequent impaired ability of heparin to either bridge prelatent antithrombin and coagulation proteases in a ternary complex or to induce full conformational activation of the serpin. Significantly, prelatent antithrombin possessed an antiangiogenic activity more potent than that of latent antithrombin, based on the relative abilities of the two forms to inhibit endothelial cell growth. The prelatent form was conformationally altered from native antithrombin as judged from an attenuation of tryptophan fluorescence changes following heparin activation and a reduced thermal stability. The alterations are consistent with the limited structural changes involving strand 1C observed in a prelatent form of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (Dupont, D. M., Blouse, G.

Chem. 281, 36071–36081), since the 1H NMR spectrum, electrophoretic mobility, and proteolytic susceptibility of prelatent antithrombin most resemble those of native rather than those of latent antithrombin. Together, these results demonstrate that limited conformational alterations of antithrombin that modestly reduce anticoagulant activity are sufficient to generate antiangiogenic activity. A conformationally altered prelatent form of antithrombin that possesses both anticoagulant and antiangiogenic activities is produced during the conversion of native to latent antithrombin (Larsson, H., Akerud, P., Nordling, K., Raub-Segall, E., Claesson-Welsh, L., and Björk, I.

Together, these results demonstrate that limited conformational alterations of antithrombin that modestly reduce anticoagulant activity are sufficient to generate antiangiogenic activity. Antithrombin and its glycosaminoglycan activators, heparin and heparan sulfate, are well established anticoagulant regulators of blood clotting proteases (1Olson S.T. Chuang Y.-J. Trends Cardiovasc.

Antithrombin acts as an anticoagulant by irreversibly inhibiting clotting proteases through a conformational trapping mechanism that is unique to the serpin superfamily of proteins of which antithrombin is a member (4Huntington J.A.

Heparin and heparan sulfate are required to activate antithrombin to ensure that clotting proteases are inhibited at a physiologically significant rate. This activating effect is the basis for the widespread clinical use of heparin for anticoagulant therapy. The activation results from heparin binding to antithrombin through a specific pentasaccharide sequence and inducing a conformational change in the serpin (6Choay J. Petitou M. Lormeau J.C. Sinay P.

Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 16Larsson H. Sjoblom T. Dixelius J. Ostman A. Ylinenjärvi K. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6723-6729PubMed Google Scholar). Such conformational alterations transform the native metastable protein to a much more stable but inactive form in which the reactive loop has inserted into the major β-sheet, the A-sheet, of the serpin (17Wardell M.R. Chang W.S.W. Bruce D. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Skinner R. Abrahams J.-P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These conformationally altered forms of antithrombin are produced under physiologic conditions (19Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Carrell R.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 3388-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have antiangiogenic activity comparable with that of other naturally produced angiogenesis inhibitors (20Prox D. Becker C. Pirie-Shepherd S.R. Celik I. Folkman J. Kisker O. World J. Surg. 2003; 68: 47-54Google Scholar). The requirement for conformational change to generate antiangiogenic activity sets antithrombin apart from other serpins, such as pigment epithelium-derived factor, maspin, and kallistatin, which have been shown to also possess antiangiogenic activity but without the need for conformational change (21Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 22Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 23Miao R.Q. Agata J. Chao L. Chao J. Blood. 2002; 100: 3245-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mild heat treatment was also found to produce a distinct form of antithrombin, termed the prelatent form, which possessed antiangiogenic activity (24Larsson H. Akerud P. Nordling K. Raub-Segall E. Claesson-Welsh L. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11996-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, unlike the cleaved and latent forms of antithrombin that have lost their ability to inhibit clotting proteases, prelatent antithrombin was found to retain clotting protease inhibitory activity and to have its reaction with these proteases accelerated by heparin. The only reported difference between the native and prelatent forms of antithrombin was a greater susceptibility of the latter to proteolysis by nontarget proteases. Since these findings suggested that an antiangiogenic epitope may be generated by more limited conformational changes than those having occurred in the cleaved and latent forms of antithrombin, it has been of interest to characterize the nature of these conformational differences between then native and prelatent forms of the serpin. In the present report, we show that prelatent antithrombin generated as in past studies is actually a mixture of a novel antiangiogenically active species of antithrombin, the true prelatent form, and the antiangiogenically inactive native serpin. The purified prelatent antithrombin has a more potent antiangiogenic activity than latent or cleaved antithrombins but retains the anticoagulant functions of the native serpin. It is shown to be generated as an intermediate on the pathway to latent antithrombin in the presence of stabilizing anions of the Hofmeister series (25von Hippel P.H. Schleich T. Acc. Chem. Res. 1969; 2: 257-265Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 26Busby T.F. Atha D.H. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12140-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, only limited conformational alterations are involved in transforming native to prelatent antithrombin, as judged from the modest changes in heparin affinity, heparin-induced conformational activation, thermal stability, electrophoretic mobility, proteolytic susceptibility, and 1H NMR spectrum. Overall, our findings suggest that limited conformational changes, comparable with those recently demonstrated in a prelatent form of the serpin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (27Dupont D.M. Blouse G.E. Hansen M. Mathiasen L. Kjelgaard S. Jensen J.K. Christensen A. Gils A. Declerck P.J. Andreasen P.A. Wind T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36071-36081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), are required to express antiangiogenic activity in antithrombin. Proteins—Human α-antithrombin was purified from blood plasma, as previously described (28Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 29Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The concentration of the protein was determined from the 280 nm absorbance based on a molar absorption of 37,700 m−1 cm−1 (30Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Reactive loop-cleaved antithrombin was prepared by incubating native antithrombin with human neutrophil elastase (Athens Research Technology) as in previous studies (31Zhang W. Swanson R. Izaguirre G. Xiong Y. Lau L.F. Olson S.T. Blood. 2005; 106: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Jordan R.E. Kilpatrick J. Nelson R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Human thrombin was prepared from plasma-purified prothrombin (33Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Majerus P.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 221-228Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) by activating the zymogen and purifying the active protease as described (34Owen W.G. Jackson C.M. Thromb. Res. 1973; 3: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Human factor Xa was purchased from Enzyme Research (South Bend, IN). Concentrations of proteases were assessed from their activities in standard assays with peptidyl-p-nitroanilide chromogenic substrates and were based on calibration of these assays with active site-titrated enzymes (10Izaguirre G. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33609-33622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Heparin—Full-length heparin chains of ∼26 saccharides or ∼50 saccharides with reduced polydispersity and with high affinity or low affinity for antithrombin were isolated from commercial heparin, as described (35Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G.W. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The synthetic pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin binding sequence in high affinity heparin chains was generously provided by Maurice Petitou (Sanofi-Aventis, Toulouse, France). Concentrations of high affinity heparins were determined from stoichiometric titrations of antithrombin with the heparins as described previously (28Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Low affinity heparin concentrations were measured by Azure A dye binding assays (35Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G.W. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Preparation of Prelatent and Latent Forms of Antithrombin— Two slightly different procedures were used for isolating prelatent antithrombin. In the first, antithrombin (∼10 mg at 3 mg/ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 7.4, was incubated at 60 °C for 24 h as in previous studies (24Larsson H. Akerud P. Nordling K. Raub-Segall E. Claesson-Welsh L. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11996-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The protein was then dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.02 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, buffer, and the dialyzed protein was applied to a 5-ml Hi-Trap heparin column at 0.5 ml/min. The column was subsequently washed with buffer with no NaCl at 0.5–2 ml/min until the protein fluorescence, detected continuously with a Shimadzu fluorescence monitor (280-nm excitation and 340-nm emission wavelengths), reached base-line level. A linear salt gradient from 0 to 2 m NaCl in sodium phosphate buffer was then applied over 45 min at 1 ml/min to elute the antithrombin. The low salt-eluting peak (∼0.2 m) comprising latent antithrombin was pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed. The high salt-eluting peak, previously designated as prelatent antithrombin, was subdivided into leading and trailing edge pools (labeled A + B and C, respectively) at the center of the peak (see Fig. 1). The leading edge pool was concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed into sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm NaCl, and rechromatographed as above except that the protein was eluted with a 0–2 m convex NaCl gradient over 50 min at 1 ml/min. The two partly resolved peaks that eluted were separately pooled by subdividing at the trough between the two peaks and designated pools A and B in order of their elution. In the second procedure, later adopted for optimizing the chromatographic separation and yield of prelatent antithrombin, the preparation was done as above except that antithrombin was incubated at 60 °C for 30 h instead of 24 h prior to dialysis and Hi-Trap heparin chromatography. Moreover, after washing of the column, the NaCl concentration was increased to 0.1 m, and the flow rate was increased to 2.5 ml/min to elute latent antithrombin and allow the fluorescence to return to base line. The prelatent antithrombin was then eluted using the following linear gradient program at 2.5 ml/min: 0.1 m NaCl wash for 0–5 min, 0.1–0.88 m NaCl gradient from 5 to 30 min, hold at 0.88 m NaCl for 10 min, and 0.88–3 m NaCl gradient from 40 to 65 min. The shoulder on the high salt-eluting peak was pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into low salt buffer and then rechromatographed using the same program. In some cases, two separate samples were successively processed as above, and the shoulders from both runs were combined prior to the second chromatography step. The peak eluting prior to the major protein peak was pooled to obtain prelatent antithrombin. Kinetics of Prelatent Antithrombin Formation—The kinetics of formation of prelatent and latent antithrombins from native antithrombin were assessed by heating the native serpin in the Tris/citrate buffer at 60 °C as above for varying times and then chromatographing samples on the Hi-Trap heparin column using the convex salt gradient. Corrections for background fluorescence were made by subtracting a buffer blank run from all chromatograms. The fluorescence peaks corresponding to native, prelatent, and latent antithrombins were then integrated using Millenium software (Waters Corp.) to quantitate their relative amounts. Minor fluorescence peaks corresponding to protein that was not bound or weakly bound to the column were integrated and summed to account for a nonbinding fraction. To determine whether prelatent antithrombin was an intermediate in the formation of latent antithrombin, purified prelatent antithrombin (0.16 mg/ml) was dialyzed into the Tris/citrate buffer and incubated under the same conditions used to form the prelatent species. Samples were taken at varying times, dialyzed, and chromatographed on the Hi-Trap heparin column as in the studies with native antithrombin. The kinetic stability of purified latent antithrombin was analyzed similarly. Reaction progress curves were fit by the minimal reaction model of Fig. 4 by numerical integration of the differential equations for the model using Scientist software (Micromath, Inc.). Alternative conditions that were tested for producing prelatent antithrombin involved (i) incubating 3 mg/ml antithrombin samples in 10 mm MES, 2The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; FGF-2, human fibroblast growth factor-2. pH 6, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, or 10 mm TAPS, pH 9, buffers, each containing 0.5 or 1 m sodium citrate, at60 °C for 30 h at pH 6 and 7.4 or 7 h at pH 9; (ii) incubating 0.5 mg/ml antithrombin samples in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 20% glycerol at 60 °C for 24–48 h (19Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Carrell R.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 3388-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) incubating 0.2 mg/ml antithrombin samples at 25 °C for 24 h in Tris/sodium citrate buffer containing 0, 0.5, 1, 3, or 6 m guanidine HCl followed by dialysis into ionic strength (I) 0.15 sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (36Fish W.W. Danielsson Å. Nordling K. Miller S.H. Lam C.F. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); (iv) incubating 1–3 mg/ml antithrombin samples in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 m citrate, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m EDTA, 3 m NaCl, or 100 μm heparin pentasaccharide at 60 °C for 30 h (26Busby T.F. Atha D.H. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12140-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (v) incubating 2 μm antithrombin samples in a physiologic buffer consisting of 9.47 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (37Lewis S.D. Shields P.P. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10192-10199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the absence or presence of 1 μm 50-saccharide high affinity heparin or 15 μg/ml heparan sulfate (bovine kidney; Sigma) at 60 °C for a time yielding ∼50% inactivation of antithrombin. Samples were diluted 50–100-fold into sodium phosphate buffer with no salt before chromatography of 20–50 μg as above except for samples containing heparin. The latter were first chromatographed on the monoQ column to remove heparin (29Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and then, after concentration and dilution, chromatographed on the Hi-Trap heparin column. Experimental Conditions—Experiments were conducted at 25 °C in I 0.15, pH 7.4 buffers consisting of either (i) 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 or (ii) 0.1 m Hepes, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, except where otherwise noted. Some experiments were performed in the sodium phosphate buffer but with no added NaCl or with the addition of 0.25 m NaCl to yield ionic strengths of 0.05 or 0.3, respectively. PAGE—Native PAGE and SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins was done as in past studies using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of different antithrombin forms to proteolysis by nontarget proteases was analyzed essentially according to previous work (24Larsson H. Akerud P. Nordling K. Raub-Segall E. Claesson-Welsh L. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11996-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by incubation of 200 μg/ml serpin with 20 μg/ml chymotrypsin or thermolysin in 10 mm Tris, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, buffer for varying times, followed by quenching with 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for chymotrypsin reactions or 30 mm EDTA for thermolysin reactions. Samples were denatured by the addition of SDS treatment buffer and boiling and were then analyzed for proteolysis by SDS-PAGE. Affinity and Kinetics of Antithrombin-Heparin Interactions— Binding of pentasaccharide or ∼26-saccharide high affinity heparins to antithrombin was analyzed by fluorescence titrations in which the enhancement in protein tryptophan fluorescence accompanying polysaccharide binding was used to monitor the interaction (28Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Titrations were done with 50–200 nm antithrombin in I 0.15 or I 0.3 sodium phosphate buffers for measurements of KD or in I 0.05 sodium phosphate buffer for measurements of binding stoichiometry. Measurements were made on a SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer, at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 340 nm. Titrations were analyzed by computer fitting to the quadratic binding equation with KD, the maximal fluorescence change, and the stoichiometry as the fitted parameters (28Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For measurements of KD, the stoichiometry was fixed at the average fitted value obtained in titrations at low ionic strength. The kinetics of heparin pentasaccharide binding to antithrombin were analyzed under pseudo-first order conditions with an Applied Photophysics SX-17MV stopped-flow fluorometer as in past studies (7Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Variable concentrations of pentasaccharide were mixed with antithrombin at a concentration at least 5-fold lower than that of the saccharide in I 0.3 buffer. Pentasaccharide binding to the protein was monitored from increases in protein fluorescence, and the observed pseudo-first order rate constant (kobs) was determined by computer fitting of the progress curves to a single exponential function. Stoichiometries of Protease Inhibition—Fixed concentrations of protease (50 nm) were incubated with variable concentrations of antithrombin ranging from substoichiometric to approximately equimolar in I 0.15, pH 7.4, sodium phosphate buffer. After incubation for a time sufficient to yield >90% inactivation based on measured inhibition rate constants, residual enzyme activities were determined as in the kinetic assays described below. Plots of residual enzyme activity versus the molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme were fit by linear regression to obtain the inhibition stoichiometry from the abscissa intercept. Kinetics of Protease Inhibition—The kinetics of high affinity heparin and low affinity heparin acceleration of antithrombin-protease reactions were measured under pseudo-first order conditions as in past studies (35Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G.W. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Antithrombin (20 or 50 nm) was reacted at 25 °C with protease at one-tenth (factor Xa reactions) or one-twentieth (thrombin reactions) the concentration of inhibitor in the presence of variable concentrations of heparin. The buffers employed were either I 0.15 sodium phosphate (thrombin reactions) or I 0.15 Hepes/CaCl2 (factor Xa reactions), pH 7.4. Reactions with thrombin and high affinity heparin additionally contained 2 mm p-aminobenzamidine to decrease the rate of the reaction so as to allow accurate kinetic measurements by the discontinuous sampling method. Reaction mixtures (50–100 μl) were incubated for fixed times (2-min reactions with thrombin and high affinity heparin, 5-min reactions with thrombin and low affinity heparin, 30-s reactions with factor Xa and high affinity heparin and 5-min reactions with factor Xa and low affinity heparin) or for variable times to obtain full progress curves (factor Xa reactions with low affinity heparin) in polyethylene glycol-coated polystyrene cuvettes. The reactions were then quenched with substrate (900–950 μl), either 50 μm tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Sigma) for thrombin reactions or 100 μm Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica) for factor Xa reactions. The substrate was in a high salt buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA or 100 mm Hepes, both at pH 7.4, and with 1 m NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 mg/ml Polybrene, to ensure quenching of the heparin-catalyzed reaction. The residual enzyme activity was determined by monitoring for several minutes the initial linear rate of substrate hydrolysis either from the increase in 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin fluorescence at λex 380 nm, λem 440 nm (for thrombin reactions) or the increase in p-nitroaniline absorbance at 405 nm (for factor Xa reactions). Observed pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) were obtained from the fractional decrease of the enzyme activity from the starting activity measured in the absence of inhibitor by assuming an exponential loss of activity with zero end point (28Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Apparent second order rate constants (kapp) were then calculated from kobs by dividing by the functional inhibitor concentration. The latter was determined by multiplying the inhibitor concentration measured from the 280 nm absorbance by the reciprocal of the inhibition stoichiometry (25von Hippel P.H. Schleich T. Acc. Chem. Res. 1969; 2: 257-265Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The functional inhibitor concentration thus obtained agreed with the 0.8–0.9-mol fraction of antithrombin found to be active in binding heparin from stoichiometric heparin binding titrations (Table 2). The dependence of kapp on heparin concentration was fit by the ternary complex bridging model for all reactions (35Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G.W. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) except for the low affinity heparin-catalyzed reaction of antithrombin with factor Xa. The latter was fit by a rectangular hyperbolic function, based on a model in which heparin catalysis results solely from conformational activation of antithrombin with no contribution of bridging (35Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G.W. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Bi"
https://openalex.org/W2058843177,"The human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), gp41 core plays an important role in fusion between viral and target cell membranes. We previously identified an HIV-1 gp41 core-binding motif HXXNPF (where X is any amino acid residue). In this study, we found that Asn, Pro, and Phe were the key residues for gp41 core binding. There are two NPF motifs in Epsin-1-(470-499), a fragment of Epsin, which is an essential accessory factor of endocytosis that can dock to the plasma membrane by interacting with the lipid. Epsin-1-(470-499) bound significantly to the gp41 core formed by the polypeptide N36(L8)C34 and interacted with the recombinant soluble gp41 containing the core structure. A synthetic peptide containing the Epsin-1-(470-499) sequence could effectively block entry of HIV-1 virions into SupT1 T cells via the endocytosis pathway. These results suggest that interaction between Epsin and the gp41 core, which may be present in the target cell membrane, is probably essential for endocytosis of HIV-1, an alternative pathway of HIV-1 entry into the target cell."
https://openalex.org/W2007488843,"We previously showed that agmatine stimulated hepatic ureagenesis. In this study, we sought to determine whether the action of agmatine is mediated via cAMP signaling. A pilot experiment demonstrated that the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), inhibited urea synthesis albeit increased [cAMP]. Thus, we hypothesized that IBMX inhibits hepatic urea synthesis independent of [cAMP]. We further theorized that agmatine would negate the IBMX action and improve ureagenesis. Experiments were carried out with isolated mitochondria and 15NH4Cl to trace [15N]citrulline production or [5-15N]glutamine and a rat liver perfusion system to trace ureagenesis. The results demonstrate that IBMX induced the following: (i) inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and diminished O2 consumption during liver perfusion; (ii) depletion of the phosphorylation potential and overall hepatic energetic capacity; (iii) inhibition of [15N]citrulline synthesis; and (iv) inhibition of urea output in liver perfusion with little effect on [N-acetylglutamate]. The results indicate that IBMX directly and specifically inhibited complex I of the respiratory chain and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I), with an EC50 about 0.6 mm despite a significant elevation of hepatic [cAMP]. Perfusion of agmatine with IBMX stimulated O2 consumption, restored hepatic phosphorylation potential, and significantly stimulated ureagenesis. The action of agmatine may signify a cascade effect initiated by increased oxidative phosphorylation and greater ATP synthesis. In addition, agmatine may prevent IBMX from binding to one or more active site(s) of CPS-I and thus protect against inhibition of CPS-I.

Our data suggest that the agmatine action may be mediated via elevation of cellular [cAMP] (5Nissim I. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Horyn O. Wehhrli S.L. Yudkoff M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8486-8496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Indeed, we subsequently demonstrated that AGM when given orally in drinking water elevated [cAMP] in rat kidney cortex (6Nissim I. Horyn O. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Phillips P.C. Yudkoff M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7824-7831Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In most cells and tissues the level of cAMP depends on the balance between the respective rates of synthesis and hydrolysis. The maximal rate of cAMP synthesis is less than one-tenth the maximal rate of hydrolysis by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (7Dousa T.P. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 29-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cAMP concentration and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling pathways depend in large measure upon the capacity of PDEs. Many studies have utilized 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) to elevate cellular cAMP. The commonly employed concentration of this nonspecific inhibitor of PDEs was between 0.5 and 1 mm (7Dousa T.P. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 29-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to further characterize the effect of AGM on hepatic [cAMP] and thereby ureagenesis with or without concomitant supplementation of IBMX. Pilot experiments indicated that IBMX significantly inhibited ureagenesis during liver perfusion. The down-regulation of ureagenesis despite increased cellular cAMP concentration may represent “an anomaly” in the regulation of hepatic ureagenesis. Therefore, the goal of this work is to explore this unanticipated effect of IBMX, which is widely used as a PDE inhibitor in studies of second messenger systems and signal transduction pathways. A detailed study of IBMX action may shed new light on the regulation of hepatic ureagenesis by cAMP. A major hepatic function is conversion of ammonia to urea (1Meijer A.J. Lamers W.H. Chamuleau R.A.F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 701-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The initial step in urea synthesis is the conversion of NH+4 and HCO–3 into carbamoyl phosphate (CP) via mitochondrial carbamoyl-phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I) (EC 6.3.4.16) (1Meijer A.J. Lamers W.H.

Chem. 1964; 239: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CP is combined with ornithine via the ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) reaction to form citrulline (1Meijer A.J. Lamers W.H. Chamuleau R.A.F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 701-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). It is believed that the main regulatory site of urea synthesis is mitochondrial CPS-I, which requires two ATPs for the synthesis of CP (1Meijer A.J. Lamers W.H. Chamuleau R.A.F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 701-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that IBMX may inhibit CPS-I by lowering hepatic oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and energetic capacity. We further hypothesized that AGM would negate the IBMX-induced inhibition of urea synthesis. Our rationale is based on our prior findings that AGM protects against drug-induced inhibition of complex I and oxidative phosphorylation (6Nissim I. Horyn O. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Phillips P.C. Yudkoff M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7824-7831Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, AGM was found to stimulate the following: (i) FAO; (ii) the incorporation of acetyl-CoA into the tricarboxylic acid cycle; and (iii) oxygen consumption (5Nissim I. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Horyn O. Wehhrli S.L. Yudkoff M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8486-8496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The stimulation of FAO provided more acetyl-CoA for NAG synthesis (5Nissim I. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Horyn O. Wehhrli S.L. Yudkoff M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8486-8496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as well as increased pyruvate carboxylase and thus [oxaloacetate] (14Williams J.R. Browning E.T.

The latter is used for the synthesis of aspartate, which contributes the second nitrogen for urea synthesis (16Nissim I. Horyn O. Luhovyy B. Lazarow A. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Biochem.

We therefore designed experiments to determine the following: (i) the site(s) of IBMX-induced inhibition of urea synthesis; (ii) whether the IBMX action on ureagenesis is coupled with other pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation and/or phosphorylation potential and energetic capacity; and (iii) whether supplementation of AGM with IBMX during liver perfusion will ameliorate the IBMX-induced inhibition of ureagenesis. To address these questions, experiments were carried out with either a liver perfusion system or isolated mitochondria. We used 15N-labeled ammonia or [5-15N]glutamine to assess the production of NAG and CP and thus the rates of urea formation (5Nissim I. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Horyn O. Wehhrli S.L.

Because the process of urea synthesis involves equimolar consumption of NH+4 and aspartate-N, and because glutamine is a major source of ammonia and aspartate-N for urea synthesis (16Nissim I.

Isolated mitochondria and/or mitochondrial extracts were used to determine the synthesis of [15N]citrulline from 15NH4Cl and bicarbonate. The production of [15N]citrulline was used as a proxy for the production of CP, and thus, activity of CPS-I as indicated previously (8McGivan J.D. Bradford N.M. Mendes-Mourao J. Biochem.

Isolated mitochondria were also used to examine the action of IBMX on mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and thus OXPHOS. A separate series of experiments was carried out to determine whether the action of AGM on OXPHOS is coupled with pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) or the tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. Pyruvate is metabolized via the PDH complex to form NADH and acetyl-CoA (5Nissim I. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Horyn O. Wehhrli S.L. Yudkoff M. J. Biol.

The incorporation and metabolism of acetyl-CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle produce more NADH as well as FADH2 for mitochondrial OXPHOS. Materials and Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) were fed ad libitum a standard rat chow diet. Chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma. Enzymes and cofactors for the analysis of adenine nucleotides, urea, lactate, pyruvate, and ammonia were obtained from Sigma. U-13C3-Labeled Pyruvate and -lactate, 15NH4Cl, or [5-15N]glutamine, 99 mol % excess, were from Isotec. Experiments with Liver Perfusion—Livers from overnight fasted male rats were perfused in the non-recirculating mode and antegrade flow at a rate of 3–3.5 ml/g liver/min, as described previously (4Nissim I.

The basic perfusion medium was Krebs saline, pH 7.4, continuously gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and containing lactate (2.1 mm) and pyruvate (0.3 mm) as metabolic fuels. pO2 (in influent and effluent media) was monitored throughout, and oxygen consumption was calculated. After 15 min of conditioning with a basic perfusion medium, the perfusate was replaced with one containing U-13C3-labeled lactate (2.1 mm), -pyruvate (0.3 mm), NH4Cl (0.3 mm), and [5-15N]glutamine (1 mm), with or without 0.5 mm IBMX, dissolved in DMSO or IBMX plus 0.1 mm agmatine. Control perfusion was carried out with DMSO. The perfusion was continued for an additional 45 min. Samples were taken from the influent and effluent media for chemical and isotopic analyses. At the end of perfusion, the liver was freeze-clamped with aluminum tongs pre-cooled in liquid N2. The frozen liver was ground into a fine powder, extracted into perchloric acid, neutralized, and used for determination of metabolite level and 13C or 15N enrichment. Studies with Isolated Mitochondria—Isolated intact mitochondria or freeze-thawed broken mitochondria were used to explore the action of IBMX on the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria were isolated from the liver of overnight fasted rats by differential centrifugation as described previously (5Nissim I. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Horyn O. Wehhrli S.L. Yudkoff M.

In the first series of experiments, we determined the action of IBMX on the synthesis of 15N-citrulline from 15N-labeled ammonia. Synthesis of citrulline has been used as a proxy for CP production (8McGivan J.D. Bradford N.M. Mendes-Mourao J. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Cohen N.S.

Mitochondrial suspensions (≈2 mg of protein·ml–1) were incubated in Erlenmeyer flasks (2 ml final volume) at 30 °C in a shaking water bath for 20 min in a basic incubation medium consisting of the following (in mm): 50 Tris, 2 EDTA, 5 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 15 KHCO3, and 5 KH2PO4, pH 7.4. Incubations were carried out with increasing concentrations of IBMX (dissolved in DMSO), ATP, and various 15N-labeled and unlabeled substrates of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. In separate experiments, a freeze-thawed and sonicated mitochondrial extract served as a source of either OTC or carbamoyl-phosphate synthase-I, as indicated (8McGivan J.D. Bradford N.M. Mendes-Mourao J. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The action of IBMX on the activity of OTC was determined by incubation of a mitochondrial extract with basic medium containing the following (in mm): 10 carbamoyl phosphate, 10 ornithine, 5 ATP, and increasing concentrations (0–5 mm) of IBMX. Parallel experiments were carried out with commercially available (Sigma) OTC. For determination of CPS-I activity, the mitochondrial extract was incubated with the following (in mm): 10 15NH4Cl, 10 ornithine, 5 ATP, 1 N-acetylglutamate, and increasing concentrations (0–5 mm) of IBMX. To examine the effect of IBMX on oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial suspensions in basic medium were supplemented with the following: either 5 mm malate plus 5 mm glutamate, which formed NADH that is oxidized in complex I; 5 mm succinate, which formed FADH2 that is oxidized in complex II; or 0.24 mmN,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) plus 7.2 mm ascorbate that is oxidized in complex IV (6Nissim I.

In a separate series of measurements, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (ClCCP) was used to uncouple respiration from phosphorylation. Following determination of ADP-dependent respiration without the addition of ClCCP, the uncoupled respiration was determined after addition of 10 μm ClCCP. A separate series of experiment was carried out to determine the flux through the PDH or the tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. To examine the action of IBMX on the PDH reaction, mitochondria were incubated with basic medium plus 5 mm [1-13C]pyruvate. To monitor the incorporation of acetyl-CoA into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondria were incubated with basic medium plus 5 mm [U-13C]pyruvate. Isolated mitochondria were incubated for 20 min. 13CO2 was collected and analyzed for 13C enrichment as indicated (5Nissim I. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Horyn O. Wehhrli S.L. Yudkoff M. J. Biol.

At the end of the incubation, an aliquot (100 μl) was taken for protein determination, and the incubation was stopped with 100–150 μl of HClO4 (60%). Metabolite measurements were done in neutralized extracts. Three to five independent experiments were carried out per each series. GC-MS and NMR Methodology—GC-MS measurements of 13C or 15N isotopic enrichment were performed on either a Hewlett Packard 5970 mass selective detector (MSD) and/or 5971 MSD, coupled with a 5890 HP-GC, GC-MS Agilent system (6890 GC-5973 MSD) or Hewlett-Packard HP-5970 MSD, using electron impact ionization with an ionizing voltage of –70 eV and an electron multiplier set to 2000 V.
