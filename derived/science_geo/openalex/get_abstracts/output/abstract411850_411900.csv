https://openalex.org/W2165160576,"Colony-forming units - fibroblast (CFU-Fs), analogous to those giving rise to bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are present in many organs, although the relationship between BM and organ-specific CFU-Fs in homeostasis and tissue repair is unknown. Here we describe a population of adult cardiac-resident CFU-Fs (cCFU-Fs) that occupy a perivascular, adventitial niche and show broad trans-germ layer potency in vitro and in vivo. CRE lineage tracing and embryo analysis demonstrated a proepicardial origin for cCFU-Fs. Furthermore, in BM transplantation chimeras, we found no interchange between BM and cCFU-Fs after aging, myocardial infarction, or BM stem cell mobilization. BM and cardiac and aortic CFU-Fs had distinct CRE lineage signatures, indicating that they arise from different progenitor beds during development. These diverse origins for CFU-Fs suggest an underlying basis for differentiation biases seen in different CFU-F populations, and could also influence their capacity for participating in tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W2085523626,"The authors describe the design of an optetrode, a device that allows for colocalized multi-tetrode electrophysiological recording and optical stimulation in freely moving mice. Recent advances in optogenetics have improved the precision with which defined circuit elements can be controlled optically in freely moving mammals; in particular, recombinase-dependent opsin viruses, used with a growing pool of transgenic mice expressing recombinases, allow manipulation of specific cell types. However, although optogenetic control has allowed neural circuits to be manipulated in increasingly powerful ways, combining optogenetic stimulation with simultaneous multichannel electrophysiological readout of isolated units in freely moving mice remains a challenge. We designed and validated the optetrode, a device that allows for colocalized multi-tetrode electrophysiological recording and optical stimulation in freely moving mice. Optetrode manufacture employs a unique optical fiber-centric coaxial design approach that yields a lightweight (2 g), compact and robust device that is suitable for behaving mice. This low-cost device is easy to construct (2.5 h to build without specialized equipment). We found that the drive design produced stable high-quality recordings and continued to do so for at least 6 weeks following implantation. We validated the optetrode by quantifying, for the first time, the response of cells in the medial prefrontal cortex to local optical excitation and inhibition, probing multiple different genetically defined classes of cells in the mouse during open field exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2116990560,"We compared two genetically highly defined transgenic systems to identify parameters affecting reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state. Our results demonstrate that the level and stoichiometry of reprogramming factors during the reprogramming process strongly influence the resulting pluripotency of iPS cells. High expression of Oct4 and Klf4 combined with lower expression of c-Myc and Sox2 produced iPS cells that efficiently generated ""all-iPSC mice"" by tetraploid (4n) complementation, maintained normal imprinting at the Dlk1-Dio3 locus, and did not create mice with tumors. Loss of imprinting (LOI) at the Dlk1-Dio3 locus did not strictly correlate with reduced pluripotency though the efficiency of generating ""all-iPSC mice"" was diminished. Our data indicate that stoichiometry of reprogramming factors can influence epigenetic and biological properties of iPS cells. This concept complicates efforts to define a ""generic"" epigenetic state of iPSCs and ESCs and should be considered when comparing different iPS and ES cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2111441093,"The key step in bacterial promoter opening is recognition of the -10 promoter element (T(-12)A(-11)T(-10)A(-9)A(-8)T(-7) consensus sequence) by the RNA polymerase σ subunit. We determined crystal structures of σ domain 2 bound to single-stranded DNA bearing-10 element sequences. Extensive interactions occur between the protein and the DNA backbone of every -10 element nucleotide. Base-specific interactions occur primarily with A(-11) and T(-7), which are flipped out of the single-stranded DNA base stack and buried deep in protein pockets. The structures, along with biochemical data, support a model where the recognition of the -10 element sequence drives initial promoter opening as the bases of the nontemplate strand are extruded from the DNA double-helix and captured by σ. These results provide a detailed structural basis for the critical roles of A(-11) and T(-7) in promoter melting and reveal important insights into the initiation of transcription bubble formation."
https://openalex.org/W2121378751,"We spend the majority of our lives indoors where we are constantly exposed to bacteria residing on surfaces. However, the diversity of these surface-associated communities is largely unknown. We explored the biogeographical patterns exhibited by bacteria across ten surfaces within each of twelve public restrooms. Using high-throughput barcoded pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, we identified 19 bacterial phyla across all surfaces. Most sequences belonged to four phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The communities clustered into three general categories: those found on surfaces associated with toilets, those on the restroom floor, and those found on surfaces routinely touched with hands. On toilet surfaces, gut-associated taxa were more prevalent, suggesting fecal contamination of these surfaces. Floor surfaces were the most diverse of all communities and contained several taxa commonly found in soils. Skin-associated bacteria, especially the Propionibacteriaceae, dominated surfaces routinely touched with our hands. Certain taxa were more common in female than in male restrooms as vagina-associated Lactobacillaceae were widely distributed in female restrooms, likely from urine contamination. Use of the SourceTracker algorithm confirmed many of our taxonomic observations as human skin was the primary source of bacteria on restroom surfaces. Overall, these results demonstrate that restroom surfaces host relatively diverse microbial communities dominated by human-associated bacteria with clear linkages between communities on or in different body sites and those communities found on restroom surfaces. More generally, this work is relevant to the public health field as we show that human-associated microbes are commonly found on restroom surfaces suggesting that bacterial pathogens could readily be transmitted between individuals by the touching of surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can use high-throughput analyses of bacterial communities to determine sources of bacteria on indoor surfaces, an approach which could be used to track pathogen transmission and test the efficacy of hygiene practices."
https://openalex.org/W2168925623,"Target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is an evolutionarily conserved master regulator that integrates energy, nutrients, growth factors, and stress signals to promote survival and growth in all eukaryotes. The reported land plant resistance to rapamycin and the embryo lethality of the Arabidopsis tor mutants have hindered functional dissection of TOR signaling in plants. We developed sensitive cellular and seedling assays to monitor endogenous Arabidopsis TOR activity based on its conserved S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation. Surprisingly, rapamycin effectively inhibits Arabidopsis TOR-S6K1 signaling and retards glucose-mediated root and leaf growth, mimicking estradiol-inducible tor mutants. Rapamycin inhibition is relieved in transgenic plants deficient in Arabidopsis FK506-binding protein 12 (FKP12), whereas FKP12 overexpression dramatically enhances rapamycin sensitivity. The role of Arabidopsis FKP12 is highly specific as overexpression of seven closely related FKP proteins fails to increase rapamycin sensitivity. Rapamycin exerts TOR inhibition by inducing direct interaction between the TOR-FRB (FKP-rapamycin binding) domain and FKP12 in plant cells. We suggest that variable endogenous FKP12 protein levels may underlie the molecular explanation for longstanding enigmatic observations on inconsistent rapamycin resistance in plants and in various mammalian cell lines or diverse animal cell types. Integrative analyses with rapamycin and conditional tor and fkp12 mutants also reveal a central role of glucose-TOR signaling in root hair formation. Our studies demonstrate the power of chemical genetic approaches in the discovery of previously unknown and pivotal functions of glucose-TOR signaling in governing the growth of cotyledons, true leaves, petioles, and primary and secondary roots and root hairs."
https://openalex.org/W2152053706,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and an earlier wave of definitive erythroid/myeloid progenitors (EMPs) differentiate from hemogenic endothelial cells in the conceptus. EMPs can be generated in vitro from embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells, but efforts to produce HSCs have largely failed. The formation of both EMPs and HSCs requires the transcription factor Runx1 and its non-DNA binding partner core binding factor β (CBFβ). Here we show that the requirements for CBFβ in EMP and HSC formation in the conceptus are temporally and spatially distinct. Panendothelial expression of CBFβ in Tek-expressing cells was sufficient for EMP formation, but was not adequate for HSC formation. Expression of CBFβ in Ly6a-expressing cells, on the other hand, was sufficient for HSC, but not EMP, formation.

Hemogenic endothelium is located in all sites of EMP and HSC emergence including the ventral aspect of the dorsal aorta, vitelline and umbilical arteries, yolk sac, and placenta. The process by which blood forms from hemogenic endothelium has been most well studied in the dorsal aorta and in ESC cultures, and involves an endothelial to hematopoietic cell transition during which individual cells round up and detach from the endothelial layer (Bertrand et al., 2010Bertrand J.Y.

This rounding up (budding) process can be toward the lumen of an artery (prominent in mammals and birds) (Jaffredo et al., 2005Jaffredo T. Nottingham W. Liddiard K. Bollerot K. Pouget C. de Bruijn M.

Hematol. 2005; 33: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), where many newly formed hematopoietic cells collect in clusters that are presumably released into the circulation. Alternatively, the budding can occur in the opposite direction, into the subaortic mesenchyme, after which single hematopoietic cells enter the circulation through the axial vein by intravasation (zebrafish) (Bertrand et al., 2010Bertrand J.Y.

Hemogenic endothelium is distinguished from all other endothelial cells by the presence of a transcription factor called Runx1 (North et al., 1999North T.E. Gu T.-L. Stacy T. Wang Q. Howard L. Binder M. Marín-Padilla M. Speck N.A. Cbfa2 is required for the formation of intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters.Development. 1999; 126: 2563-2575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Runx1 is expressed in hemogenic endothelial cells in early somite pair stage conceptuses prior to the formation of clusters, in the clusters themselves, and in all functional EMPs and HSCs (North et al., 1999North T.E.

In zebrafish Runx1 morphants, most aortic endothelial cells did not attempt the endothelial to hematopoietic cell transition, and those that did self-destructed by what appeared to be an apoptotic-like process (Kissa and Herbomel, 2010Kissa K. Herbomel P. Blood stem cells emerge from aortic endothelium by a novel type of cell transition.Nature. 2010; 464: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). We showed that deletion of a conditional Runx1 allele in endothelial cells with Cre recombinase driven from Cdh5 (encoding vascular endothelial cadherin) or Tek (encoding the angiopoietin receptor Tie2) regulatory sequences blocked EMP, HSC, and intra-arterial cluster formation, indicating that Runx1 is required in the hemogenic endothelium for the endothelial to hematopoietic cell transition (Chen et al., 2009Chen M.J. Yokomizo T. Zeigler B.M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A.

Stacy T. Speck N.A. Runx1 function in hematopoiesis is required in cells that express Tek.Blood. 2006; 107: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A complementary study (Liakhovitskaia et al., 2009Liakhovitskaia A. Gribi R. Stamateris E. Villain G. Jaffredo T. Wilkie R. Gilchrist D. Yang J. Ure J. Medvinsky A. Restoration of Runx1 expression in the Tie2 cell compartment rescues definitive hematopoietic stem cells and extends life of Runx1 knockout animals until birth.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1616-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) demonstrated that restoring Runx1 function in endothelial cells in Runx1-deficient embryos rescued both EMP and HSC formation. The latter experiment involved reactivating an inactive Runx1 allele with Tek-Cre, allowing Runx1 to be appropriately expressed from its endogenous locus in Tek+ hemogenic endothelial cells, and in all of their progeny throughout the remainder of hematopoietic development. Runx1 function during hematopoiesis requires the activity of a non-DNA binding subunit, core binding factor β (CBFβ), which allosterically regulates DNA binding by Runx1 (Sasaki et al., 1996Sasaki K. Yagi H. Bronson R.T. Tominaga K. Matsunashi T. Deguchi K. Tani Y. Kishimoto T. Komori T.

Biol. 2004; 11: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fetuses lacking CBFβ had dramatically impaired hematopoiesis, although some residual EMPs remained (Wang et al., 1996bWang Q. Stacy T. Miller J.D. Lewis A.F. Gu T.L. Huang X. Bushweller J.H. Bories J.C. Alt F.W. Ryan G. et al.The CBFbeta subunit is essential for CBFalpha2 (AML1) function in vivo.Cell. 1996; 87: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Fetuses with only 15% of wild-type CBFβ levels had functional EMPs and HSCs (Talebian et al., 2007Talebian L. Li Z. Guo Y. Gaudet J. Speck M.E. Sugiyama D. Kaur P. Pear W.S. Maillard I. Speck N.A. T-lymphoid, megakaryocyte, and granulocyte development are sensitive to decreases in CBFbeta dosage.Blood. 2007; 109: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); thus, very low levels of CBFβ are needed to support EMP and HSC formation. We previously showed that restoring CBFβ expression in Tek+ cells would rescue EMP formation in the fetus (Miller et al., 2002Miller J. Horner A. Stacy T. Lowrey C. Lian J.B. Stein G. Nuckolls G.H. Speck N.A. The core-binding factor β subunit is required for bone formation and hematopoietic maturation.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Our rescue strategy was different from that employed by Liakhovitskaia et al., 2009Liakhovitskaia A. Gribi R. Stamateris E. Villain G. Jaffredo T. Wilkie R. Gilchrist D. Yang J. Ure J. Medvinsky A. Restoration of Runx1 expression in the Tie2 cell compartment rescues definitive hematopoietic stem cells and extends life of Runx1 knockout animals until birth.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1616-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, in that we expressed CBFβ (fused to the green fluorescent protein, GFP/CBFβ) as a transgene from Tek regulatory sequences in CBFβ-deficient fetuses (Miller et al., 2002Miller J. Horner A. Stacy T. Lowrey C. Lian J.B. Stein G. Nuckolls G.H. Speck N.A. The core-binding factor β subunit is required for bone formation and hematopoietic maturation.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although GFP/CBFβ was detected in endothelial cells, its level in hematopoietic cells, including Sca1+ or c-Kit+ fetal liver cells, was low (Miller et al., 2002Miller J. Horner A. Stacy T. Lowrey C. Lian J.B. Stein G. Nuckolls G.H. Speck N.A. The core-binding factor β subunit is required for bone formation and hematopoietic maturation.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Fetal liver EMPs were rescued by the Tek-GFP/Cbfb transgene, but GFP/CBFβ was not expressed at later stages of blood cell differentiation, and consequently the terminal differentiation of all hematopoietic cells, with the exception of erythrocytes, was impaired. Another marker of endothelial cells in hematopoietic sites is the HSC cell surface protein Sca1, which is encoded by the Ly6a gene (de Bruijn et al., 2002de Bruijn M.F. Ma X. Robin C. Ottersbach K.

Surface Sca1 is found on only 50% of aorta/gonad/mesonephros (AGM) HSCs (de Bruijn et al., 2002de Bruijn M.F. Ma X. Robin C. Ottersbach K. Sanchez M.-J. Dzierzak E.

However, expression of GFP from the Ly6a regulatory sequences marked all functional HSCs in the dorsal aorta, fetal liver, and placenta (de Bruijn et al., 2002de Bruijn M.F. Ma X. Robin C.

GFP+ cells were found among the endothelial cells of the dorsal aorta, vitelline and umbilical arteries, and placenta, but not all endothelial cells in these sites were GFP+. A recently published live imaging study that utilized the Ly6a-GFP transgene tracked the budding of GFP+ hematopoietic cells into the lumen of the dorsal aorta in slice cultures from 10.5 dpc fetuses (Boisset et al., 2010Boisset J.C. van Cappellen W.

In vivo imaging of haematopoietic cells emerging from the mouse aortic endothelium.Nature. 2010; 464: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Here we show that a GFP/CBFβ fusion protein expressed from the Tek regulatory sequences in CBFβ-deficient mice is sufficient to restore EMPs formation, but insufficient for HSC formation. Conversely, expressing GFP/CBFβ from Ly6a regulatory sequences will rescue HSC formation, but not EMP formation. These data indicate that EMP and HSC formation can be uncoupled, and that Ly6a expression specifically marks a subset of hemogenic endothelial cells that are destined to produce HSCs. We previously showed that a GFP/CBFβ fusion protein, when expressed from a Tek-driven transgene, could rescue EMPs in the fetal liver of 12.5 dpc Cbfb−/− fetuses (Miller et al., 2002Miller J.

The number of EMPs was lower than in wild-type fetuses, but was sufficient for Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb conceptuses to complete gestation (lethality was at postnatal day 1). Cbfb−/− fetuses, on the other hand, died at midgestation with almost no EMPs (Miller et al., 2002Miller J. Horner A. Stacy T. Lowrey C. Lian J.B. Stein G. Nuckolls G.H. Speck N.A.

We also showed that 17.5 dpc Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb fetuses contained both B and T lymphocytes, but in reduced numbers (Miller et al., 2002Miller J. Horner A. Stacy T. Lowrey C. Lian J.B. Stein G. Nuckolls G.H. Speck N.A. The core-binding factor β subunit is required for bone formation and hematopoietic maturation.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We assessed the B and T lymphoid potential of 14.5 dpc Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb fetuses by isolating fetal liver lymphoid progenitors (Lin−c-Kit+Flt3+) and coculturing them with either OP9 stromal cells or Notch-ligand-expressing OP9-DL4 stromal cells. Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb progenitors yielded small numbers of CD19+B220+ B cells in OP9 cultures, and Thy1+CD25+ T cells in OP9-DL4 cultures (Figure 1A ). Limit dilution analysis determined that Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb fetal livers contained approximately 30-fold fewer B cell progenitors and 15-fold fewer T cell progenitors within the Lin−c-Kit+Flt3+ population as compared with Cbfb+/+;Tek-GFP/Cbfb (heretofore referred to as Tek-GFP/Cbfb) fetal livers (Figure 1B). Methylcellulose colony assays using unfractionated fetal liver cells similarly showed that Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb fetuses contained 11-fold fewer B progenitors than Tek-GFP/Cbfb fetuses (not shown). We transplanted 14.5 dpc fetal liver cells from Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb conceptuses into irradiated adult mice to assess HSCs and observed no donor contribution to the peripheral blood or bone marrow (Figure 1C). Thus fetal liver lymphoid progenitors and HSCs are poorly rescued by the Tek-GFP/Cbfb transgene. Examination of the fetal liver revealed that there were lower numbers of cells overall, and even fewer Lin−Sca1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells (Figure 1D). We previously showed by western blot that the amount of GFP/CBFβ fusion protein produced from the Tek-GFP/Cbfb transgene in embryonic skin was equivalent to that of endogenous CBFβ, but was undetectable in CD45+ or c-Kit+ fetal liver cells (Miller et al., 2002Miller J. Horner A. Stacy T. Lowrey C. Lian J.B. Stein G. Nuckolls G.H. Speck N.A. The core-binding factor β subunit is required for bone formation and hematopoietic maturation.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We extended those findings by examining GFP/CBFβ levels in phenotypic HSCs and LT-HSCs by FACS. Fewer than 10% of phenotypic HSCs (LSK) and LT-HSCs (CD48− CD150+ LSK) in the liver of Tek-GFP/Cbfb fetuses were GFP/CBFβ+ (Figure 1E). Thus, GFP/CBFβ expression from the Tek-GFP/Cbfb transgene is not sustained in the majority of newly formed HSCs, which, as discussed later, may contribute to its failure to rescue HSC formation in Cbfb−/− fetuses. We next tried to rescue EMP and HSC formation in Cbfb−/− fetuses using a Ly6a-driven transgene. Three Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb founders were generated, all of which produced GFP/CBFβ at levels similar to that of endogenous CBFβ in unfractionated adult bone marrow cells (Figure 2A ). Essentially 100% of adult bone marrow LSK and CD48− CD150+ LSK cells in Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb mice were GFP/CBFβ+, although the mean fluorescence intensity differed in independent founder lines (line A > B > C) (Figure 2B). Expression from the Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb transgene at 11.5 dpc mirrored that described for Ly6a-GFP (de Bruijn et al., 2002de Bruijn M.F. Ma X. Robin C. Ottersbach K. Sanchez M.-J. Dzierzak E.

GFP/CBFβ+ cells were present in the placental and umbilical vasculature, vitelline artery, and AGM region (including the mesonephric tubules and Wolffian/Mullerian ducts) (Figure 2C). Fetal liver CD48− CD150+ LSK cells were ∼80% GFP/CBFβ+ in the strongest-expressing Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb line (Figure 2D). The three independent Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb transgenes were crossed onto the Cbfb−/− background. Surprisingly, Cbfb−/−;Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb conceptuses died in utero at the same time as Cbfb−/− conceptuses (Figure S1 available online). Cbfb−/−;Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb fetal livers were pale, suggesting that colonization by yolk sac EMPs had not occurred. Hematopoietic assays were performed to examine EMPs in Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb versus Cbfb−/−;Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb versus Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb;Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb conceptuses (Figure 3). Two-way comparisons using Student's t test revealed significantly higher numbers of EMPs in Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb versus Cbfb−/− conceptuses (fetal liver and yolk sac), and in Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb versus Cbfb−/−;Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb conceptuses (fetal liver and placenta) at 11.5 dpc (Figure 3). Although the number of EMPs in Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb fetal livers was initially low, it increased considerably over the next few days, and by 14.5 dpc EMPs were only 33% fewer in number than in Tek-GFP/Cbfb conceptuses (Figure 3). Cbfb−/− fetuses carrying both the Tek-GFP/Cbfb and Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb transgenes had significantly higher numbers of EMPs in all tissues at 11.5 dpc (Figure 3), indicating that the two transgenes complemented each other. In summary, the Tek-GFP/Cbfb transgene rescues EMPs and fetal viability significantly better than the Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb transgene. We conclude that the Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb transgene is not expressed at the correct time, or in the correct cells, to adequately restore EMP formation and rescue the viability of Cbfb−/− fetuses. Since most Cbfb−/−;Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb fetuses died by 13.5 dpc, we assayed hematopoietic tissues at 11.5 dpc for the presence of HSCs. Quite surprisingly, the Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb transgene restored HSC formation in all hematopoietic tissues except for the AGM region and vitelline and umbilical arteries (A+U+V) (Figure 4A ). High-level reconstitution by Cbfb−/−;Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb HSCs was observed in multiple recipients (6 out of 17), with contribution to both lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells (Figure 4B). Cbfb−/− fetuses expressing both the Tek-GFP/Cbfb and Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb transgenes had HSCs in all hematopoietic sites including the A+U+V (Figure 4A); thus, the two transgenes complemented each other in HSC formation. We observed reconstitution of only one recipient by Cbfb−/−;Tek-GFP/Cbfb HSCs that had received 0.9 embryo equivalents of placental cells. These results confirm previous data showing that HSCs are associated with endothelium marked by Ly6a transgene expression (de Bruijn et al., 2002de Bruijn M.F. Ma X. Robin C. Ottersbach K.

Dzierzak E. The murine placenta contains hematopoietic stem cells within the vascular labyrinth region.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and further show that CBFβ function in Ly6a-expressing cells is sufficient for HSC, but not for EMP, formation. Since the Tek-driven transgene selectively rescued EMP formation, and the Ly6a-driven transgene restored only HSC formation, comparison of their expression patterns during embryonic development should reveal when and in what cells CBFβ is required. We first considered why the Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb transgene failed to rescue EMP formation. EMPs are detected in the yolk sac beginning at 8.25 dpc (2–6s) (Palis et al., 1999Palis J. Robertson S. Kennedy M. Wall C. Keller G. Development of erythroid and myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and embryo proper of the mouse.Development. 1999; 126: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as clusters of CD41bright cells at the border between the yolk sac blood islands and the capillary bed leading to the embryo proper (Ferkowicz et al., 2003Ferkowicz M.J.

No GFP/CBFβ+ cells were found anywhere in Ly6a-GFP/Cbfb conceptuses at this time or in slightly older 10–11s conceptuses (Figure 5B ). In contrast, the Tek-GFP/Cbfb transgene, which rescued EMP formation, was highly expressed in endothelial cells throughout 6–7s conceptuses, the yolk sac vascular plexus, dorsal aortae, heart (endocardial tube), allantois, and placenta (Figure 5A). Therefore the Tek-GFP/Cbfb transgene was expressed in endothelial cells at the time of EMP emergence in the yolk"

We also developed a reversible mutagenesis protocol that allows saturated genetic recessive screens and results in homozygous alleles. This system allowed us to generate a knockout cell line for the microRNA processing enzyme Drosha. In a forward genetic screen, we identified Gpr107 as a molecule essential for killing by ricin, a toxin being used as a bioweapon.

Methods Male and female rats were exposed to chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) after which immediate early gene products, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA and peptide, various epigenetic-associated enzymes and DNA methylation of the Crf gene were determined in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), oval (BSTov) and fusiform (BSTfu) parts of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and central amygdala (CeA). Results CVMS induced site-specific changes in Crf gene methylation in all brain centers studied in female rats and in the male BST and CeA, whereas the histone acetyltransferase, CREB-binding protein was increased in the female BST and the histone-deacetylase-5 decreased in the male CeA. These changes were accompanied by an increased amount of c-Fos in the PVN, BSTfu and CeA in males, and of FosB in the PVN of both sexes and in the male BSTov and BSTfu. In the PVN, CVMS increased CRF mRNA in males and CRF peptide decreased in females. Conclusions The data confirm our hypothesis that chronic stress affects gene expression and CRF transcriptional, translational and secretory activities in the PVN, BSTov, BSTfu and CeA, in a brain center-specific and sex-specific manner. Brain region-specific and sex-specific changes in epigenetic activity and neuronal activation may play, too, an important role in the sex specificity of the stress response and the susceptibility to depression."
https://openalex.org/W2153940274,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short cationic peptides that penetrate cells by interacting with the negatively charged plasma membrane; however, the detailed uptake mechanism is not clear. In contrary to the conventional mode of action of CPPs, we show here that a CPP, PepFect14 (PF14), forms negatively charged nanocomplexes with oligonucleotides and their uptake is mediated by class-A scavenger receptors (SCARAs). Specific inhibitory ligands of SCARAs, such as fucoidin, polyinosinic acid, and dextran sulfate, totally inhibit the activity of PF14-oligonucleotide nanocomplexes in the HeLa pLuc705 splice-correction cell model, while nonspecific, chemically related molecules do not. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of SCARA subtypes (SCARA3 and SCARA5) that are expressed in this cell line led to a significant reduction of the activity to < 50%. In line with this, immunostaining shows prevalent colocalization of the nanocomplexes with the receptors, and electron microscopy images show no binding or internalization of the nanocomplexes in the presence of the inhibitory ligands. Interestingly, naked oligonucleotides also colocalize with SCARAs when used at high concentrations. These results demonstrate the involvement of SCARA3 and SCARA5 in the uptake of PF14-oligonucleotide nanocomplexes and suggest for the first time that some CPP-based systems function through scavenger receptors, which could yield novel possibilities to understand and improve the transfection by CPPs.—Ezzat, K., Helmfors, H., Tudoran, O., Juks, C., Lindberg, S., Padari, K., El-Andaloussi, S., Pooga, M., Langel, Ü.

This study aimed to optimize a low cost and broadly sensitive in-house assay in detecting HIVDR mutations in the protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions of pol gene. The overall plasma genotyping sensitivity was 95.8% (N = 96). Compared to the original in-house assay and two commercially available genotyping systems, TRUGENE® and ViroSeq®, the optimized in-house assay showed a nucleotide sequence concordance of 99.3%, 99.6% and 99.1%, respectively. The optimized in-house assay was more sensitive in detecting mixture bases than the original in-house (N = 87, P<0.001) and TRUGENE® and ViroSeq® assays. When the optimized in-house assay was applied to genotype samples collected for HIVDR surveys (N = 230), all 72 (100%) plasma and 69 (95.8%) of the matched dried blood spots (DBS) in the Vietnam transmitted HIVDR survey were genotyped and nucleotide sequence concordance was 98.8%; Testing of treatment-experienced patient plasmas with viral load (VL) ≥ and <3 log10 copies/ml from the Nigeria and Malawi surveys yielded 100% (N = 46) and 78.6% (N = 14) genotyping rates, respectively. Furthermore, all 18 matched DBS stored at room temperature from the Nigeria survey were genotyped. Phylogenetic analysis of the 236 sequences revealed that 43.6% were CRF01_AE, 25.9% subtype C, 13.1% CRF02_AG, 5.1% subtype G, 4.2% subtype B, 2.5% subtype A, 2.1% each subtype F and unclassifiable, 0.4% each CRF06_CPX, CRF07_BC and CRF09_CPX. Conclusions The optimized in-house assay is broadly sensitive in genotyping HIV-1 group M viral strains and more sensitive than the original in-house, TRUGENE® and ViroSeq® in detecting mixed viral populations. The broad sensitivity and substantial reagent cost saving make this assay more accessible for RLS where HIVDR surveillance is recommended to minimize the development and transmission of HIVDR."

The development and organization of these arbors fundamentally determine the potential input and connectivity of a given neuron. The cell-surface receptors that control dendritic branching remain poorly understood. We found that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, a previously uncharacterized transmembrane protein containing extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which we named DMA-1 (dendrite-morphogenesis-abnormal), promotes dendrite branching and growth. Sustained expression of dma-1 was found only in the elaborately branched sensory neurons PVD and FLP. Genetic analysis revealed that the loss of dma-1 resulted in much reduced dendritic arbors, whereas overexpression of dma-1 resulted in excessive branching. Forced expression of dma-1 in neurons with simple dendrites was sufficient to promote ectopic branching. Worms lacking dma-1 were defective in sensing harsh touch. DMA-1 is the first transmembrane LRR protein to be implicated in dendritic branching and expands the breadth of roles of LRR receptors in nervous system development."
https://openalex.org/W2034315625,"Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the primary cell type responsible for cardiac fibrosis during pathological myocardial remodeling. Several studies have illustrated that pirfenidone (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) attenuates cardiac fibrosis in different animal models. However, the effects of pirfenidone on cardiac fibroblast behavior have not been examined. In this study, we investigated whether pirfenidone directly modulates cardiac fibroblast behavior that is important in myocardial remodeling such as proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, migration and cytokine secretion. Fibroblasts were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and bioassays were performed to determine the effects of pirfenidone on fibroblast function. We demonstrated that treatment of CFs with pirfenidone resulted in decreased proliferation, and attenuated fibroblast α-smooth muscle actin expression and collagen contractility. Boyden chamber assay illustrated that pirfenidone inhibited fibroblast migration ability, probably by decreasing the ratio of matrix metalloproteinase-9 to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. Furthermore, pirfenidone attenuated the synthesis and secretion of transforming growth factor-β1 but elevated that of interleukin-10. These direct and pleiotropic effects of pirfenidone on cardiac fibroblasts point to its potential use in the treatment of adverse myocardial remodeling."

In the absence of Pah1p or its activators in yeast, there is a severe decrease in TAG levels and lipid droplets and an expansion of the nuclear envelope, consistent with a decrease in DAG and an increase in phospholipid synthesis caused by the sequestration of the transcriptional regulator Opi1p by PA in the ER membrane (11Loewen C.J.

Lipin also plays a role in nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. Lowering lipin-1 levels inhibits nuclear envelope breakdown, suggesting a role for DAG in this process (30Golden A. Liu J. Cohen-Fix O.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6596-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that human C- terminal Domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1, originally termed “dullard” for its effects on Xenopus neural development (33Satow R. Chan T.C. Asashima M. Molecular cloning and characterization of dullard. A novel gene required for neural development.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) is the ortholog of Nem1p and could functionally replace Nem1p in yeast. CTDNEP1 had no lipin dephosphorylation activity in two of three cultured cell lines tested, suggesting it required a hypothetical human Spo7p as a binding partner. However, a soluble fragment of CTDNEP1 was able to dephosphorylate peptides derived from the lipin-1 sequence with good kinetics, leading the authors to postulate that there was no need for a human Spo7p (34Wu R. Garland M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Homo sapiens dullard protein phosphatase shows a preference for the insulin-dependent phosphorylation site of lipin1.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 3045-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although S. cerevisiae Spo7p was characterized over a decade ago, identification of a Spo7p homolog in higher eukaryotes has proven challenging even with recent advances in bioinformatic search methods. We now report that TMEM188 is the metazoan Spo7p ortholog and have renamed it NEP1-R1 (Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1-Regulatory subunit 1). NEP1-R1 and CTDNEP1 are shown to physically and functionally interact. Knockdown of the two corresponding genes have similar phenotypes in C. elegans and share nearly identical expression profiles with lipin-1 in mouse and human tissues. CTDNEP1 can dephosphorylate lipin-1 isoforms and lipin-2 in cells only in the presence of NEP1-R1. Finally, in the presence of CTDNEP1 and NEP1-R1 together, there is an accumulation of lipin in the nucleus. Servers hosting PROCAIN and HHPRED used to identify animal SPO7 homologs can be found on line. All yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1 (top section). The BY4742 strain was used as wild-type control unless indicated. Cells were grown in SD (yeast nitrogen base + 2% dextrose) medium with appropriate amino acid and base supplements for auxotrophies in a 30 °C shaker-incubator and harvested in late log phase (OD600 1.2–2.0) for observation and analysis, because spo7Δ and nem1Δspo7Δ show the most prominent lipid-related phenotype in late log phase. To generate spo7Δ or nem1Δspo7Δ, the SPO7 allele was replaced with the HIS3 auxotrophic marker by homologous recombination. Yeast strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method (35Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Transformation of intact yeast cells treated with alkali cations.J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Correct integration was verified by PCR of genomic DNA. For the sporulation assay, diploid strains were sporulated (36Sherman F. Getting started with yeast.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar) and observed by light microscopy after 5 days at 26 °C. Asci containing at least two spores were counted as sporulated. All plasmids and oligonucleotides used in yeast are listed in supplemental Tables S1 (bottom section) and S2, respectively. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used. Bacterial strain DH10β (Invitrogen) was used for all bacterial transformations. NEP1-R1 (TMEM188, ID 5266084) and CTDNEP1 (dullard, ID 4123279) cDNA were purchased from Open Biosystems. The open reading frames encoding NEP1-R1 and CTDNEP1 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pRS315-PGK1 and pRS316-PGK1, respectively (37Binns D. Januszewski T. Chen Y. Hill J. Markin V.S. Zhao Y.

For the C-terminally tagged versions, pRS315-PGK1-HA-ProtA was derived from plasmid BG1805 (38Gelperin D.M. White M.A. Wilkinson M.L. Kon Y. Kung L.A. Wise K.J. Lopez-Hoyo N. Jiang L. Piccirillo S.

Biochemical and genetic analysis of the yeast proteome with a movable ORF collection.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and pRS315-PGK1–2×FLAG was generated by inserting oligonucleotides encoding tandem repeated FLAG sequence (KLDYKDDDDKDYKDDDDK, additional amino acid sequence is underlined) to the HindIII/SalI site of pRS316-PGK1. Subsequently, NEP1-R1 and CTDNEP1 ORFs were subcloned into pRS315-PGK1-HA-ProtA and pRS316-PGK1–2×FLAG, yielding pRS315 PGK1-NEP1-R1-HA-ProtA and pRS316-PGK1-CTDNEP1–2×FLAG, respectively. The catalytic inactive version CTDNEP1 D67N-2×FLAG was generated from pRS316-PGK1-CTDNEP1–2×FLAG by rapid PCR site-directed mutagenesis (39Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Rapid PCR site-directed mutagenesis.PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: S131-S136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The open reading frames of SPO7 and NEM1 were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and subcloned into pRS315-PGK1 and pRS316-PGK1, respectively. For an endoplasmic reticulum marker, a Sec63p-CFP fusion construct (40Prinz W.A. Grzyb L. Veenhuis M. Kahana J.A. Silver P.A. Rapoport T.A. Mutants affecting the structure of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J.

Then, using this vector as a PCR template, SEC63 ORF was C-terminally tagged with the CFP-encoding sequence in wild-type yeast as described before (43Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J.

From that strain, Sec63p-CFP fusion gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned first into pRS315-PGK1 and then into the pRS317 vector, yielding pRS317-PGK1-SEC63-CFP. DNA sequences were verified by The McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development (University of Texas Southwestern). To visualize lipid droplets, yeast cells in early or late log phase were stained with BODIPY 493/503 (Invitrogen) as described previously (41Szymanski K.M. Binns D. Bartz R. Grishin N.V. Li W.P. Agarwal A.K. Garg A. Anderson R.G. Goodman J.M. The lipodystrophy protein seipin is found at endoplasmic reticulum lipid droplet junctions and is important for droplet morphology.Proc. Natl. Acad.

All images were acquired with Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, version 4.1.0.3) using a microscope (Axiovert 200 M; Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc) with a 100 × 1.3 NA oil immersion objective lens (plan-NeoFluar) equipped with a digital camera (Sensican, Cooke). BODIPY images were acquired using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter set (excitation 490/20 and emission 528/38), and CFP was imaged with the CFP filter set (excitation 430/25; emission 470/30) (Chroma Technology Corp). Z-stacks were obtained at 0.3-μm spacing, and Slidebook commands of deconvolution (nearest neighbor option) were used to build images through cells. Transmission images were acquired using bright field optics. Micrograph figures were prepared with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Lipid extraction and one-dimensional thin layer chromatography were performed as described previously (37Binns D. Januszewski T. Chen Y. Hill J. Markin V.S. Zhao Y. Gilpin C. Chapman K.D. Anderson R.G. Goodman J.M. An intimate collaboration between peroxisomes and lipid bodies.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Yeast cell pellets were lysed with acid-washed glass beads (Sigma, G8772, 425–600 μm) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma, I-3021, equivalent to Nonidet P-40) in the cold room for 30 min. Extracts were treated with 70 °C hot isopropyl alcohol for 30 min and then extracted as before. Lipid bands were digitally scanned, and their intensities were determined by ImageJ (version 1.41, National Institutes of Health). Concentrations were calculated relative to serial dilutions of lipid standards (Nu-Chek Prep, TLC 18–5C). For examining protein expression, whole lysates were prepared from yeast as described previously (44Kushnirov V.V. Rapid and reliable protein extraction from yeast.Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. For the co-immunoprecipitation experiment, yeast cell pellets were lysed with glass beads in lysis buffer containing 1% (v/v) protease mixture inhibitors (Sigma, P-8215) as described under “Lipid Analysis.” About 1.5 mg of clarified lysates (equal protein in each experiment; protein was determined with protein assay kit (Bio-Rad)) of each sample was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 25 μl of IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast flow bead s(GE Healthcare, 17-0969-01) in 1.5-ml tubes for 2 h at 4 °C and separated into bound or unbound fractions by centrifugation. The beads (bound fraction) were washed at least three times with lysis buffer. Equivalent amounts were saved for total lysates. Subsequently, the equivalent amounts of fractions (corresponding to 10–30 μg of total lysate) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted following standard protocols. Hemagglutinin (HA) and FLAG epitopes were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Applied Science, 12CA5) and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma, F3165) antibody, respectively. Anti-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1p) antibody (Invitrogen, A9521) was used for a loading control. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, G21040) or rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, G21234) was used as secondary antibody. Bound antibody was detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). For C. elegans RNA-mediated interference and embryo imaging, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was prepared as described previously (45Oegema K. Desai A. Rybina S. Kirkham M. Hyman A.A. Functional analysis of kinetochore assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1209-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) from templates by using primers for scpl-2 (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGATGACAACAATCGCACAGTCT-3′; 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACGGAGAAGGTGTAGAAC-3′), T19A6.3 (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGATTCAGGCCAGAAGAATGC-3′; 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGTGGAGCAGAATTACGAACTGC-3′), and lpin-1(5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGGCCATTTGTCCACTCTCAT-3′; 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTTACACACTCGGCGGTTTT-3′) to amplify N2 genomic DNA or N2 cDNA. For depletion of scpl-2 and T19A6.3, L4 hermaphrodites were injected with dsRNA and incubated at 20 °C for 48 h before analysis. For depletion of lpin-1, young adult hermaphrodites were injected with dsRNA and incubated for 12–16 h at 25 °C. For each condition, two different C. elegans strains expressing fluorescent markers had twinned nuclei in the two-cell stage. Embryos were mounted as described previously (45Oegema K. Desai A. Rybina S. Kirkham M. Hyman A.A. Functional analysis of kinetochore assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1209-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and live imaging was conducted at 20 °C using a spinning-disc confocal microscopy head (CSU-10) mounted on either a Nikon TE2000-E inverted microscope or an Andor Revolution spinning disc confocal microscope system controlled by the Andor iQ software (Andor Technology). In all cases a ×60, 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat lens with 2 × 2 binning was used with a charge-coupled device camera (Orca-ER; Hamamatsu). Images were processed using ImageJ software. BALB/cByJ-Lpin1+/fld mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred to generate homozygous wild-type and fld/fld mice. Mouse tissue RNA was isolated with TRIzol, reverse-transcribed (OmniscriptTM, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and quantitated by real time PCR using the iCycler (Bio-Rad) and SensiMix SYBR kit (Bioline USA Inc., Tauton, MA). Mouse gene expression levels were normalized to TATA box-binding protein mRNA. Gene expression studies in human tissues were performed with a panel of normalized first strand cDNA preparations pooled from multiple individuals (Human MTC Panel I and Digestive System MTC Panel, Clontech) and normalized to levels of β2-microglobulin and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA. PCR primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table S3 Mouse myoblast C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). All gene knockdown experiments were carried out in 12-well plates using the BioT transfection reagent (Bioland Scientific LLC, La Palma, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, C2C12 myoblasts were plated to 50–90% confluence and transfected with 200 nm lipin-1 antisense oligonucleotide (Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) or siTMEM188 (ON-TARGETplus SMART pool, Dharmacon Inc., Chicago) (see supplemental Table S3). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% horse serum and then cultured for 48 h. The cells were harvested in 0.6 ml of TRIzol reagent. RNA isolation and real time PCR was then performed as described above. Expression levels were normalized to TATA box-binding protein, β2-microglobulin, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Data were expressed as fold induction or repression by normalizing the data to the control condition. Construction and description of CTDNEP1- and NEP1-R1-encoding plasmids for mammalian expression are listed in supplemental Table S4.

Long-term tracking of individual clones in their natural environment constitutes the ultimate way to validate postembryonic stem cells. We identify retinal stem cells (RSCs) using the spatiotemporal organization of the fish retina and follow the complete offspring of a single cell during the postnatal life. RSCs generate two tissues of the adult fish retina, the neural retina (NR) and the retinal-pigmented epithelium (RPE). Despite their common embryonic origin and tight coordination during continuous organ growth, we prove that NR and RPE are maintained by dedicated RSCs that contribute in a fate-restricted manner to either one or the other tissue. We show that in the NR, RSCs are multipotent and generate all neuron types and glia. The clonal origin of these different cell types from a multipotent NSC has far-reaching implications for cell type and tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2140958498,"Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is crucial for embryonic development, affects cytokine signaling relevant for immune responses and is often significantly overexpressed in solid tumors; but little is known about its role in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we showed that targeted-disruption of HDAC2 resulted in reduction of both tumor cell growth and de novo DNA synthesis in Hep3B cells. We then demonstrated that HDAC2 regulated cell cycle and that disruption of HDAC2 caused G1/S arrest in cell cycle. In G1/S transition, targeted-disruption of HDAC2 selectively induced the expression of p16(INK4A) and p21(WAF1/Cip1), and simultaneously suppressed the expression of cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK2. Consequently, HDAC2 inhibition led to the down-regulation of E2F/DP1 target genes through a reduction in phosphorylation status of pRb protein. In addition, sustained suppression of HDAC2 attenuated in vitro colony formation and in vivo tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Further, we found that HDAC2 suppresses p21(WAF1/Cip1) transcriptional activity via Sp1-binding site enriched proximal region of p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter. In conclusion, we suggest that the aberrant regulation of HDAC2 may play a pivotal role in the development of HCC through its regulation of cell cycle components at the transcription level providing HDAC2 as a relevant target in liver cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2017939382,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common polymicrobial imbalance of the vaginal flora associated with a wide variety of obstetric and gynecologic complications including serious infections and preterm birth. As evidenced by high recurrence rates following treatment, interventions for BV are still lacking. Several hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases and proteases, have been previously correlated with BV and have been hypothesized to degrade host sialoglycoproteins that participate in mucosal immune functions. Sialidase activity is most predictive of BV status and correlates strongly with adverse health outcomes. Here we combine clinical specimens with biochemical approaches to investigate secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) as a substrate of BV-associated glycosidases and proteases. We show that BV clinical specimens hydrolyze sialic acid from SIgA, but not in the presence of the sialidase inhibitor dehydro-deoxy-sialic acid. The collective action of BV-associated glycosidases exposes underlying mannose residues of SIgA, most apparent on the heavily N-glycosylated secretory component of the antibody. Terminal sialic acid residues on SIgA protect underlying carbohydrate residues from exposure and hydrolysis by exoglycosidases (galactosidase and hexosaminidase). It is known that both IgG and SIgA are present in the human reproductive tract. We show that the IgG heavy chain is more susceptible to proteolysis than its IgA counterpart. Gentle partial deglycosylation of the SIgA secretory component enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis. Together, these data support a model of BV in which SIgA is subject to stepwise exodeglycosylation and enhanced proteolysis, likely compromising the ability of the reproductive mucosa to neutralize and eliminate pathogens."

This expression system is activated by doxycycline (dox) via the tet-controlled transactivator (TA). Binding of TA to the transactivator response element (TRE) results in transcription of downstream genes. First, we cloned transgenic founder pigs expressing TA under the control of the CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter (CAG). Then, cells from CAG-TA transgenic founders were nucleofected with TRE-controlled expression vectors for either porcine cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4-Fc domain of immunoglobulin G1 (CTLA-4Ig) or soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), and double-transgenic offspring were cloned. Dox administration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in expression of CTLA-4Ig or RANKL, in nucleofected cells and in transgenic pigs, while in the absence of dox, the levels of both proteins were below the detection limit. Inducible transgene expression was reproduced in double-transgenic offspring generated by cloning or breeding. Our strategy revealed the first two examples of inducible transgene expression in pigs.

This identified 214 differentially expressed genes, of which 40% have been annotated to date. These include genes encoding proteins that are associated with CNS development and modeling, sensory perception, stress response and resistance, and fundamental cellular processes. Our microarray analysis has identified genes whose altered expression may enable locusts of either phase to deal with the different challenges they face. Genes for heat shock proteins and proteins which confer protection from infection were upregulated in gregarious locusts, which may allow them to respond to acute physiological challenges. By contrast the longer-lived solitarious locusts appear to be more strongly protected from the slowly accumulating effects of ageing by an upregulation of genes related to anti-oxidant systems, detoxification and anabolic renewal. Gregarious locusts also had a greater abundance of transcripts for proteins involved in sensory processing and in nervous system development and plasticity. Gregarious locusts live in a more complex sensory environment than solitarious locusts and may require a greater turnover of proteins involved in sensory transduction, and possibly greater neuronal plasticity."

Although the protein was originally found as a tumor suppressor, currently it is receiving considerable attention as a regulator of adipocyte lipolysis. We recently revealed that purified recombinant H-rev107 has phospholipase A1/2 activity, releasing free fatty acids from glycerophospholipids with a preference for esterolysis at the sn-1 position. In the present study, we constitutively expressed H-rev107 in cloned HEK293 cells to examine its biological function in living cells. Initially, the cells accumulated free fatty acids. We also found a remarkable decrease in the levels of ether-type lipids, including plasmalogen and ether-type triglyceride, with a concomitant increase in fatty alcohols, substrates for the biosynthesis of ether-type lipids. Considering that peroxisomes are involved in the ether-type lipid biosynthesis, we next focused on peroxisomes and found that the peroxisomal markers 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein and catalase were abnormally distributed in the transfected cells. These biochemical and morphological abnormalities were not seen in HEK293 cells stably expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of H-rev107. When H-rev107 or its fusion protein with enhanced green fluorescence protein was transiently expressed in mammalian cells, both proteins were associated with peroxisomes in some of the observed cells. These results suggest that H-rev107 interferes with the biosynthesis of ether-type lipids and is responsible for the dysfunction of peroxisomes in H-rev107-expressing cells.

https://openalex.org/W2004722837,"In humans, allelic variants in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) associate with several pathologies. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of this association remain largely unknown. Analysis of the human TLR9 promoter revealed that the C allele of the rs5743836 polymorphism generates several regulatory sites, including an IL-6-responding element. Here, we show that, in mononuclear cells carrying the TC genotype of rs5743836, IL-6 up-regulates TLR9 expression, leading to exacerbated cellular responses to CpG, including IL-6 production and B-cell proliferation. Our study uncovers a role for the rs5743836 polymorphism in B-cell biology with implications on TLR9-mediated diseases and on the therapeutic usage of TLR9 agonists/antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2050784306,"Human cannabinoid type 2 (CB(2)) receptor expressed in Escherichia coli was purified and successfully reconstituted in the functional form into lipid bilayers composed of POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS), and cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS). Reconstitution was performed by detergent removal from the protein/lipid/detergent mixed micelles either on an adsorbent column, or by rapid dilution to below the critical micelle concentration of detergent followed by removal of detergent monomers on a concentrator. Proteoliposomes prepared at a protein/phospholipid/CHS molar ratio of 1/620-650/210-220 are free of detergent as shown by (1)H NMR, have a homogeneous protein/lipid ratio shown by isopycnic gradient ultracentrifugation, and are small in size with a mean diameter of 150-200 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering. Functional integrity of the reconstituted receptor was confirmed by quantitative binding of (2)H-labeled agonist CP-55,940-d(6) measured by (2)H magic angle spinning NMR, as well as by activation of G protein. The efficiency of G protein activation by agonist-bound CB(2) receptor was affected by negative electric surface potentials of proteoliposomes controlled by the content of anionic CHS or POPS. The activation was highest at an anionic lipid content of about 50 mol %. There was no correlation between the efficiency of G protein activation and an increase of hydrocarbon chain order induced by CHS or cholesterol. The results suggest the importance of anionic lipids in regulating signal transduction by CB(2) receptor and other class A GPCR. The successful reconstitution of milligram quantities of pure, functional CB(2) receptor enables a wide variety of structural studies."
https://openalex.org/W1996029988,"An in-depth understanding of the molecular and cellular complexity of angiogenesis continues to advance as new stimulators and inhibitors of blood vessel formation are uncovered. Gaining a more complete understanding of the response of blood vessels to both stimulatory and inhibitory molecules will likely contribute to more effective strategies to control pathological angiogenesis. Here, we provide evidence that endothelial cell interactions with structurally altered collagen type IV may suppress the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4), a well documented inhibitor of the IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling axis. We report for the first time that IGFBP-4 differentially inhibits angiogenesis induced by distinct growth factor signaling pathways as IGFBP-4 inhibited FGF-2- and IGF-1-stimulated angiogenesis but failed to inhibit VEGF-induced angiogenesis. The resistance of VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis to IGFBP-4 inhibition appears to depend on sustained activation of p38 MAPK as blocking its activity restored the anti-angiogenic effects of IGFBP-4 on VEGF-induced blood vessel growth in vivo. These novel findings provide new insight into how blood vessels respond to endogenous inhibitors during angiogenesis stimulated by distinct growth factor signaling pathways."

Gram-negative bacteria harbor a multitude of molecular systems, by which cytosolically synthesized proteins are secreted onto the bacterial surface or into the surrounding medium (1Desvaux M.

Many of these secretion systems are dedicated to a small number of substrate proteins or even to only a single protein. The molecular mechanisms of the secretion machineries largely remain to be deciphered. One such pathway, the so-called type V secretion pathway, secretes proteins such as proteases, adhesins, or toxins that mostly function as virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria. Type V secretion is commonly divided into at least two branches, the autotransporter pathway (reviewed in Ref. 3Dautin N. Bernstein H.D. Protein secretion in Gram-negative bacteria via the autotransporter pathway.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and the two-partner secretion pathway (reviewed in Ref. 4Jacob-Dubuisson F. Fernandez R. Coutte L. Protein secretion through autotransporter and two-partner pathways.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Common characteristics of both pathways are that they secrete unusually large proteins (>100 kDa) that after secretion adopt characteristic β-solenoid structures consisting of multiturn parallel β-helices or β-rolls (5Emsley P.

Autotransporters are two domain proteins consisting of an N-terminal passenger domain and a C-terminal β-domain, which inserts as a β-barrel into the outer membrane and was originally believed to be sufficient for the translocation of the upstream passenger domain (hence the name autotransporters). On the contrary, in two-partner secretion, the passenger domain (TpsA protein) and the β-domain (TpsB protein) are encoded by two separate genes. TpsB proteins are members of the superfamily of Omp85 protein transporters (8Gentle I.E. Burri L. Lithgow T. Molecular architecture and function of the Omp85 family of proteins.Mol.

In contrast, the translocation function of any of these transporters has not been directly demonstrated, and the only complete structure available, that of the TpsB protein FhaC, has revealed an occluded channel (18Clantin B.

FHA 2The abbreviations used are: FHAfilamentous hemagglutininOMPouter membrane proteinsPOTRApolypeptide translocation associated. and FhaC are the TpsA and TpsB proteins of a well studied two-partner secretion system from the whooping cough agent Bordetella pertussis. FHA, the filamentous hemagglutinin, represents the major extracellular protein of B. pertussis (19Locht C. Bertin P. Menozzi F.D. Renauld G. The filamentous haemagglutinin, a multifaceted adhesion produced by virulent Bordetella spp.Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This 230-kDa, ∼50 nm long, rigid β-helical protein mediates the attachment of the bacterium to epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. FHA is initially synthesized as a 367-kDa precursor (termed FhaB) that is transported into the periplasm via its Sec signal sequence (20Chevalier N. Moser M. Koch H.G. Schimz K.L. Willery E. Locht C.

To enable an in-depth biochemical analysis of the two-partner secretion pathway, we set out to establish a cell-free system for studying secretion of FhaB across its cognate outer membrane transporter FhaC embedded in a lipid bilayer. Our studies clearly indicate that FhaC is the sole translocator of the passenger protein FhaB. Plasmid pFJD12 (23Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Mielcarek N. Clément E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. Amino-terminal maturation of the Bordetella pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin.Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) encodes an ∼80-kDa N-terminal fragment of B. pertussis FhaB preceded by a hybrid OmpA-FhaB tandem signal peptide for efficient secretion from E. coli cells. To introduce five methionines for optimized radioactive labeling C-terminally to a suitably sized FhaB truncate, a DNA fragment encoding the OmpA-FhaB hybrid signal peptide and the first 370 amino acids of mature FhaB was amplified from template pFJD12 using the primers OmpBspHCS (5′-CCCTCATGAAAAAGACAGCTATCGCGATTGCAGTGG-3′) and FhaBmetNCS (5′-CGGCTCGAGCATCATCATCATCATGTCGACCCGTCGCGTCGCCGACAGC-3′). The PCR product was ligated into the cloning vector pGEM-T (Promega) to generate pGemt::FhaB45met. The insert was then excised by use of BspHI and XhoI and ligated upstream of a His tag into a pTrc99a derivative to generate pTrc99a::FhaB45met-His. The pTrc99a derivative was obtained by NcoI/XhoI restriction of pTrc99a::espC*, which had been constructed using the primers pETCS (5′-CCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAG-3′) and pEThisNCS (5′-CTGGAAGCTTTCATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTG-3′) and plasmid pFJD149. Plasmid pFJD149 is a pET22b derivative (Novagen) that harbors a 1-kb NdeI-XhoI 5′-fragment of espC obtained by PCR using plasmid pLADC1 as a template. To finally change the His tag to a Strep tag, a section of plasmid pTrc99a::FhaB45met-His immediately downstream of the fhaB-met insert was amplified using the primers ptrcstrepCS (5′-CGCCTCGAGTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAATAATAAGCTTGGCTGTTTTGGCGGATGAGAGAAG-3′) and ptrcstrepNCS (5′-GTGAGTACTCAACCAAGTCATTCTGAGAATAGTGTATG-3′) to generate an amplicon containing an XhoI site, the Strep tag, two stop codons, and part of the pTrc99a vector DNA, including a ScaI site. This PCR product was ligated into pTrc99a::FhaB45met-His following digestion with XhoI and ScaI to give plasmid pTrc99a::FhaB45met-Strep. The N66I mutation was introduced into pTrc99a::FhaB45met-Strep as follows. First, the HindIII site at the 3′ end of the recombinant fhaB gene in pTrc99a::FhaB45met-Strep was removed using a Taq polymerase to fill in the overhanging extremities after partial restriction. Next, a synthetic gene fragment encompassing the HindIII-NotI sequence of fhaB with the N66I point mutation was exchanged for its wild-type counterpart in pTrc99a:FhaBmet-Strep. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. FhaC was expressed in a T7 RNA polymerase-dependent manner from plasmid pFJD118 (24Méli A.C. Hodak H. Clantin B. Locht C. Molle G. Jacob-Dubuisson F.

Plasmid pEC30 encodes FhaC with an OmpA signal peptide for efficient expression in E. coli cells (25Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Evidence that a globular conformation is not compatible with FhaC-mediated secretion of the Bordetella pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3)-omp5 cells containing pFJD118 were grown in LB medium to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8 units/ml. Expression of FhaC was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 2.5–3 h. Cells were collected, and the broken and outer membranes were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation similarly as described (26Moser M. Panahandeh S. Holzapfel E. Müller M. In vitro analysis of the bacterial twin-arginine-dependent protein export.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 390: 63-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To allow for a better separation of inner and outer membranes, the volume of the 0.77 m sucrose cushion was reduced from 12 to 10 ml and that of the 1.44 m sucrose layer increased from 12 to 14 ml. Collected outer membranes were resuspended in inside-out inner membrane vesicle buffer (50 mm triethanolamine acetate buffer, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT) to a concentration of 40 A280 units/ml. Usually six 40-μl aliquots of outer membranes were diluted 10-fold each with solution E (20 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Elugent) and solubilized for 2 h at room temperature by end-over-end rotation. Subsequently, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × gmax for 1 h at 4 °C (Sorvall rotor S100-AT4, 43,000 rpm). The six supernatants were combined and applied to a Mono S® HR 5/5 column equilibrated with solution E. Proteins were eluted at 4 °C by use of a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in solution E, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. FhaC eluted between 220 and 400 mm NaCl. FhaC-containing fractions were combined, desalted on Sephadex G-25 (NAP 5 columns, GE Healthcare) against solution E, and applied at 4 °C to 2 ml of nickel-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with solution E. The column was washed three times with 3 ml of solution E containing 5 mm imidazole, and bound proteins were eluted in 3-ml steps using 200 mm imidazole in solution E. Most FhaC was recovered from the first elution fraction. It was dialyzed three times against 1 liter of solution E and stored at 4 °C. E. coli phospholipids were solubilized with detergent by diluting a sonicated 100 mg/ml aqueous stock solution of Avanti polar lipids 25-fold into 16 mm Na2HPO4, 0.8% Elugent. For reconstitution, 400 μl of solubilized outer membrane proteins obtained from 40 μl of outer membrane vesicles as described above for the purification of FhaC were mixed with 200 μl of Elugent-treated phospholipids, 300 μl of 20 mm Na2HPO4, and 50–65 mg of Biobeads SM-2 Adsorbents (Bio-Rad) that had been pretreated as described (27van der Does C. de Keyzer J. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J. Reconstitution of purified bacterial preprotein translocase in liposomes.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein-free liposomes were obtained in the same way by replacing outer membrane proteins by 400 μl of solution E. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C by end-over-end rotation, Biobeads were removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 × rpm at room temperature. Removal of detergent by Biobeads was repeated twice with one of the two subsequent incubations being performed overnight. The final supernatant was spun at 186,000 × gmax for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA-55 rotor. The pelleted proteoliposomes were resuspended in 100 μl of inside-out inner membrane vesicle buffer by repeated pipetting and brief sonication and then used for translocation studies. For the reconstitution of purified FhaC, the desired amount of FhaC was diluted with solution E to give a final volume of 400 μl and then processed as described for solubilized outer membrane proteins. Spheroplasts were obtained from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pTrc99a::FhaB45met-Strep. Cells were grown overnight in 10 ml of minimal E-medium (28Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. Acetylornithinase of Escherichia coli:. Partial purification and some properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μm each of 18 amino acids, omitting methionine and cysteine, 0.4% glucose, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After measuring the absorbance of the cell suspension at 580 nm, an aliquot that was equivalent to 2 ml of cell culture grown to an absorbance at 580 nm of 1, was spun at 8,000 rpm for 1 min in a table top centrifuge, and the pelleted cells were resuspended in 500 μl of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m sucrose. They were converted to spheroplasts by adding 500 μl of 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme in 8 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, gentle end-over-end mixing, and incubating for 15 min on ice. Spheroplasts were collected at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in a table top centrifuge and resuspended in 500 μl of E-medium supplemented with 100 μm each of 18 amino acids, 2% glycerol, and 0.25 m sucrose. Following a 15-min preincubation period at 37 °C, spheroplasts were induced using 4 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 min for the synthesis of FhaB*, then gently mixed with 4 μl of [35S]methionine/cysteine (11 μCi/μl) and varying amounts of liposomes or proteoliposomes (cf. figure legends), and incubated at 37 °C typically for 15 min. Spheroplasts were removed from the reaction mixture by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 6 min. One-half of each supernatant was precipitated on ice with 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and the other half was digested with 500 μg/ml proteinase K at 25 °C for 25 min and then precipitated with 5% TCA first at 56 °C for 10 min and then on ice for 30 min. TCA pellets were each dissolved in 15 μl of SDS loading buffer (26Moser M. Panahandeh S. Holzapfel E. Müller M. In vitro analysis of the bacterial twin-arginine-dependent protein export.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 390: 63-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and proteins were resolved by SDS-electrophoresis using 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gels. The translocation efficiency was calculated by quantifying the amount of PK-resistant FhaB* relative to the nontreated FhaB* species using ImageQuant 5.2 (GE Healthcare). For post-secretional assays, spheroplasts were induced with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside as described above and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 2 min. After pelleting the spheroplasts, supernatants were mixed with 1 μl each of OMP proteoliposomes and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were divided in halves and treated with TCA and PK as detailed above. Flotation centrifugation was performed as described previously (29Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G.

To set up a cell-free system for studying secretion of the FHA from B. pertussis, we made use of a 37-kDa N-terminal fragment of FhaB, denoted FhaB*. This was possible because even shorter N-terminal fragments were shown to contain all the information necessary for an FhaC-dependent secretion from E. coli cells and subsequent extracellular folding (6Clantin B. Hodak H. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Villeret V. The crystal structure of filamentous hemagglutinin secretion domain and its implications for the two-partner secretion pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6194-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A signal sequence-containing pre-form of FhaB* was expressed and radioactively labeled in E. coli spheroplasts that due to the lack of a continuous outer membrane released FhaB* into the surrounding medium. To follow transport of FhaB* across its TpsB transporter FhaC, we overexpressed FhaC from the T7 promoter in E. coli host cells, isolated FhaC-containing outer membranes, and reconstituted the pool of detergent-solubilized OMP with E. coli phospholipids into proteoliposomes. These OMP proteoliposomes were added to the FhaB*-expressing spheroplasts during pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine. After 15 min, spheroplasts were removed by low speed centrifugation, and the proteoliposome-containing supernatant was divided into halves. One aliquot was directly precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and prepared for SDS-PAGE, and the other one was first digested with 500 μg/ml proteinase K (PK) to remove all soluble proteins. Under the experimental conditions chosen, the 37-kDa FhaB* was the major newly synthesized protein released from the spheroplasts into the supernatant (Fig. 1A, e.g. lane 1). When no vesicles were added, the secreted FhaB* was completely digested by PK (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Virtually the same was true for samples that had received protein-free liposomes (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). If, however, the FhaB*-secreting spheroplasts were incubated with proteoliposomes that had been reconstituted from outer membrane proteins of an FhaC-expressing E. coli strain, a significant fraction of FhaB* became PK-resistant (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). The protease resistance of FhaB* was abolished when the PK treatment was performed in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 to disrupt the OMP proteoliposomes (Fig. 1A, lane 7), suggesting that FhaB* was translocated into a protease-protected environment provided by the membrane vesicles. Quantitation of five independent experiments yielded a mean translocation efficiency of 28% under these experimental conditions. Notably, the acquirement of PK resistance of FhaB* in the presence of the vesicles was strictly dependent on FhaC, because no significant PK resistance was obtained when proteoliposomes had been prepared from outer membrane proteins that were devoid of FhaC (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9). To solubilize outer membrane proteins, various detergents were tested (Fig. 1B). When compared with Triton X-100, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and dodecyl maltoside, Elugent yielded OMP proteoliposomes with the highest translocation activity toward FhaB*. To demonstrate that a functionally active FhaC was required for FhaB* to become protease-resistant, we expressed inactive variants of FhaC in E. coli and reconstituted proteoliposomes from outer membrane proteins of these strains. FhaCΔPOTRA1 lacks the first of its two POTRA domains, and FhaCΔLoop6 lacks the extracellular loop L6 of its β-barrel that folds into a hairpin structure within the barrel interior. Both deletion mutations abolish secretion in vivo (18Clantin B. Delattre A.S. Rucktooa P. Saint N. Méli A.C. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Villeret V. Structure of the membrane protein FhaC. A member of the Omp85-TpsB transporter superfamily.Science. 2007; 317: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1C (lanes 1–6), OMP proteoliposomes containing these two fhaC mutants yielded drastically reduced PK protection when compared with wild-type FhaC. Secreted FHAs, as well as N-terminal fragments such as FhaB*, fold extracellularly into stable β-helical filamentous structures. If the mere interactions with FhaC on the outside of our reconstituted proteoliposomes were sufficient to induce β-helix formation of FhaB*, it was conceivable that such stable structures displayed protease resistance even without being translocated into the lumen of the vesicles. This possibility is, however, not consistent with the finding that FhaB* remained almost completely sensitive to PK, when FhaC lacked its loop L6 (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Because this mutation abolishes transport (18Clantin B. Delattre A.S. Rucktooa P. Saint N. Méli A.C. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Villeret V. Structure of the membrane protein FhaC. A member of the Omp85-TpsB transporter superfamily.Science. 2007; 317: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) but does not affect the two POTRA domains of FhaC required for binding of FhaB, a mere association of FhaB* with FhaC does not seem to be sufficient to induce protease resistance. Furthermore, single amino acid substitutions in FhaB have been described that affect secretion of FhaB without impairing its interaction with FhaC (31Hodak H. Clantin B. Willery E. Villeret V. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Secretion signal of the filamentous haemagglutinin, a model two-partner secretion substrate.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 368-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We also tested one of these translocation-defective mutants of FhaB* carrying the mutation N66I and found it completely digested by PK in the presence of FhaC-containing proteoliposomes (Fig. 1C, lanes 9 and 10). Thus, also in the case of FhaB*(N66I), the expected defect in secretion was paralleled by its sensitivity toward PK. Finally, we examined if FhaB* when in fact folded into a β-helix structure would be resistant to the amount of PK (500 μg/ml) that we routinely used in our protease protection assays. Because FhaB* when secreted from FhaC-expressing E. coli cells was shown to fold into a β-helical structure (6Clantin B. Hodak H. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Villeret V. The crystal structure of filamentous hemagglutinin secretion domain and its implications for the two-partner secretion pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6194-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we recovered FhaB* from the growth medium of E. coli cells and determined its susceptibility toward 500 μg/ml PK. Fig. 1D demonstrates that even 2 h after secretion, FhaB* remained fully protease-sensitive. These results strongly indicate that the PK resistance of FhaB* obtained in the presence of active FhaC-containing OMP proteoliposomes (Fig. 1, A and C) does not stem from folding on the surface of the OMP proteoliposomes but rather from its translocation into the lumen of the vesicles. Another theoretical possibility for FhaB* to become protease-resistant was the formation of aggregates. This was addressed by the flotation analysis shown in Fig. 1E. FhaB* secreted from spheroplasts in the absence or presence of OMP proteoliposomes was subjected to flotation centrifugation using sucrose gradients. Following centrifugation, gradients were fractionated from the top in four equal aliquots, and the pellet was directly dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Under the conditions chosen, membrane vesicles float to the top of these gradients represented by fractions 1 and 2 (29Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. SRP-dependent co-translational targeting and SecA-dependent translocation analyzed as individual steps in the export of a bacterial protein.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In fact, 60% of FhaB* was recovered from the membrane fractions, whereas the equivalent fractions of the proteoliposome-free gradient remained empty. This result indicates that in the presence of OMP proteoliposomes, the majority of FhaB* associated with the membrane vesicles. Even if the nonfloating FhaB*, which accumulated predominantly in fractions 4 and 5 both in the absence or presence of membranes, were to prevail in the form of aggregates, it could be digested by PK as demonstrated for the proteoliposome-free controls in Fig. 1, A and C. The formation of a β-helix by TpsA proteins, such as FhaB*, is a potential driving force of secretion, which is totally independent of nucleotide hydrolysis. Demonstration of some degree of folding of FhaB* inside the OMP proteoliposomes would be another strong indication for the occurrence of a true translocation event. We therefore performed the experiment depicted in Fig"

Hypoxia, a decrease in oxygen availability, can be encountered by cells both in physiological and pathological conditions. A hypoxic microenvironment originates in pathological sites such as wounds, solid tumors, atheromatous plaques, and joints with rheumatoid arthritis (1Caldwell C.C. Kojima H. Lukashev D. Armstrong J.

Mobilization of T lymphocytes is required for mounting a competent immune response and circulating immune cells are subjected to varying degrees of oxygen tension during their maturation life cycle and during their sojourn in the tissues (1Caldwell C.C.

Exposure to hypoxia inhibits differentiation of naive T cells into cytotoxic T cells and decreases the production of cytokines such interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) (1Caldwell C.C.

The reduced immune function associated with hypoxia is particularly troublesome in conditions such as solid tumors when an immune response would be beneficial to fight the disease in hand. Indeed, hypoxia and the tumor microenvironment contribute to the decrease in immune surveillance in solid tumors (3Yotnda P. Wu D. Swanson A.M. Hypoxic tumors and their effect on immune cells and cancer therapy.Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 651: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it is critical to understand the mechanisms responsible for decreased immune function in hypoxia. Cells respond to a hypoxic microenvironment through O2-sensitive pathways associated with hypoxia inducible factors, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and ion channels (1Caldwell C.C. Kojima H. Lukashev D.

Ion channel regulation by chronic hypoxia in models of acute oxygen sensing.Cell Calcium. 2004; 36: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In particular, ion channels have been shown to be the effector proteins that translate the detection of hypoxia into functional responses in many cell types including chemosensitive and immune cells. T lymphocytes express voltage-dependent Kv1.3 channels that are involved in T cell activation and cytokine production (9Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. The functional network of ion channels in T lymphocytes.Immunol. Rev. 2009; 231: 59-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In fact, Kv1.3 channels control the membrane potential of resting and chronically activated human T cells. Inhibition of Kv1.3 channels causes the T cell membrane to depolarize, thus inhibiting Ca2+ signaling and associated downstream functions, such as cytokine release and proliferation, thereby ultimately suppressing T cell activation (9Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. The functional network of ion channels in T lymphocytes.Immunol. Rev. 2009; 231: 59-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that hypoxia inhibits Ca2+ signaling and proliferation in human T lymphocytes and that this effect is due to the down-regulation of Kv1.3 channels (5Conforti L.

Specifically, we showed that chronic hypoxia induced a decrease in Kv1.3 protein levels and functional channels in T cells, which was associated with a decrease in T cell proliferation (5Conforti L.

Although regulation of Kv1.3 expression plays such an important role in hypoxia, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Alterations in Kv1.3 biosynthesis and/or membrane trafficking may be involved in the channel down-regulation by chronic hypoxia.

In general, newly synthesized proteins are subsequently transported to the Golgi and finally to the cell surface along secretory pathways (forward trafficking) (13Kirchhausen T.

Proteins from the plasma membrane are internalized by endocytosis into endosomes from where they are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or are targeted to the lysosome for protein degradation (reverse trafficking) (13Kirchhausen T.

Silencer® Pre-designed siRNA against the γ subunit of AP1 adaptor protein (AP1G1 gene, siRNA ID s1144, catalog number 4392421) and scrambled sequence siRNA (negative control 1, catalog number 4390843) were obtained from Ambion (Life Science Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Predesigned siRNA against Kv1.3 channel was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. 10 × 106 Jurkat cells were transfected using the Amaxa Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). Either 3 μg of plasmids or 100 nm siRNAs were transfected using program T-14 as per the manufacturer's instructions. In experiments where cells were cotransfected with siRNAs and GFP, pMAX GFP supplied in the Amaxa Nucleofector Kit was cotransfected along with the siRNA at a GFP:siRNA ratio of 1:10. The efficiency of transfection was 50%. Total RNA was isolated using the E.Z.N.A. total RNA isolation kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using TaqMan Reverse Transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Predesigned Assay-on-DemandTM Primers for qPCR expression of the γ subunit of AP1 adaptor protein and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were obtained from Applied Biosystems. The RT-qPCR was set up in a 48-well plate by adding 40 ng of cDNA, 1× TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 1 μl of Assay-on-Demand primers. All samples were run in quadruplicates. GAPDH was used as an internal control. RT-qPCR was cycled in Applied Biosystems StepOneTM Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). CT values were measured using StepOne software version 2.1 (Applied Biosystems). CT values for AP1 were normalized against measured CT values for GAPDH and the ΔΔCT values were calculated. Relative quantity values, representing the fold-change in AP1 gene expression as compared with controls, were calculated as the 2−ΔΔCT values. Patch clamp experiments were performed using Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) in whole cell configuration as previously described (5Conforti L. Petrovic M. Mohammad D. Lee S. Ma Q. Barone S. Filipovich A.H. Hypoxia regulates expression and activity of Kv1.3 channels in T lymphocytes. A possible role in T cell proliferation.J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Kv1.3 currents were recorded with an external solution of the following composition (in mm): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The pipette solution was composed of (mm): 134 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The Kv1.3 currents were measured by depolarizing voltage steps to +50 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV every 30s. The digitized signals were stored and analyzed using pClamp 9 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). To calculate the inactivation time constant (τ), the current decay was fitted to a single exponential equation, f(t) = A exp−t/τ + C. Jurkat T cells were incubated in normoxia or hypoxia and plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in a 24-well tissue culture plate. The cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min and blocked for 60 min at room temperature with a blocking buffer containing PBS and 10% FBS. The blocking buffer was removed and cells were incubated overnight with gentle rocking at 4 °C in EC-Kv1.3 antibody diluted with the blocking buffer. The following day, cells were permeabilized by incubation with blocking buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were exposed to β-actin antibody for 60 min at room temperature and subsequently washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T). Coverslips were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the appropriate labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 680 anti-rabbit and IRDye 800CW anti-mouse) diluted in blocking buffer. The cells were washed with PBS-T for 5 min with gentle shaking. The coverslips were imaged by scanning simultaneously at 700 and 800 nm with the LI-COR Odyssey® infrared scanner (Licor Biosciences) at 169 μm resolution. Images were acquired and analyzed using the Odyssey version 3.0 software (Licor Biosciences) as described earlier (11Szigligeti P. Neumeier L. Duke E. Chougnet C. Takimoto K. Lee S.M. Filipovich A.H. Conforti L. Signalling during hypoxia in human T lymphocytes. Critical role of the Src protein-tyrosine kinase p56 Lck in the O2 sensitivity of Kv1.3 channels.J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). EC-Kv1.3 was imaged at 700 nm, whereas actin was visualized at 800 nm. The measured fluorescence for EC-Kv1.3 in each coverslip was normalized to the measured fluorescence for β-actin in the same coverslip. The normalized Kv1.3 intensities were averaged and are represented as a fold-change relative to the normoxic controls for each experiment. The efficacy of the On-Cell Western Assay in measuring Kv1.3 surface expression was confirmed in Jurkat cells transfected with siRNA against Kv1.3 (siKv1.3) (supplemental Fig. S1). Knockdown of Kv1.3 by siKv1.3 induced a 75% decrease in functional Kv1.3 channels (supplemental Fig. S1B). The On-Cell Western Assay measured a 44% reduction in Kv1.3 surface proteins (supplemental Fig. S1A). If we consider that in the On-Cell Western Assay we measure the surface protein levels in the whole population of cells, of which only 50% or less have incorporated the siRNAs, whereas in electrophysiological experiments we record only from transected cells visualized by GFP expression, comparable results were obtained with these techniques. Jurkat cell lysates were prepared as described earlier (5Conforti L. Petrovic M. Mohammad D. Lee S. Ma Q. Barone S. Filipovich A.H. Hypoxia regulates expression and activity of Kv1.3 channels in T lymphocytes. A possible role in T cell proliferation.J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The protein content of the lysates was measured using the BCA Protein Assay. Cell lysates were mixed with 3× SDS sample buffer (New England Biolabs) and an equal amount of protein was loaded onto each lane of a 4–12% Tris glycine gel (Invitrogen) in a X Cell SureLockTM Gel System (Invitrogen). The protein bands were transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad) in a blotting system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Licor Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against AP1 or AP2 along with β-actin. The blot was washed thoroughly with PBS-T and incubated with Alexa Fluor 680 anti-rabbit and IRDye 800CW anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. The blots were then visualized with the LI-COR Odyssey infrared scanner at 169-μm resolution. Densitometric analysis for the protein expression was done by Odyssey version 3.0 software as described earlier (5Conforti L. Petrovic M. Mohammad D. Lee S. Ma Q. Barone S. Filipovich A.H.

Jurkat cells, plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with a solution of PBS and 10% FBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature, and blocked with a solution of PBS containing 10% FBS for 1 h. Cells were probed overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies diluted with the blocking solution: rabbit anti-human Kv1.3 against the intracellular epitope and sheep anti-human TGN-46 or mouse anti-human LAMP-2. The following day, cells were incubated for 60 min with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were washed thoroughly with PBS-T washing solution and coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount G (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ). Cells were visualized by confocal microscopy (Laser Scanning Microscope LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH) using a ×100 oil immersion objective lens at room temperature. Data were obtained using the “Multi Track” option of the microscope to exclude the cross-talk between the channels and analyzed by LSM Image browser (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH). Colocalization was measured by correlation analysis using the LSM Image Browser. Briefly, the z-stack in the focal plane of the trans-Golgi (indicated by the TGN-46 antibody staining) was selected. A circle was drawn around the stained trans-Golgi, which was designated as the region of interest (ROI). For cells stained with LAMP-2 antibody, the entire cell was selected as the ROI. The image threshold and background were adjusted and the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) for the Kv1.3 and TGN-46/LAMP-2 channels was calculated using the image acquisition software. The values for R were between −1 and +1 and were interpreted as described previously (23Zinchuk V. Zinchuk O. Okada T. Quantitative colocalization analysis of multicolor confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images. Pushing pixels to explore biological phenomena.Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 40: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). R of +1 indicated strong colocalization, whereas −1 indicated the absence of colocalization. For cells co-transfected with siRNAs and GFP, only cells demonstrating positive GFP staining were considered for analysis. Jurkat cells were co-transfected with ECFP-GalT and EGFP-Kv1.3 DNA constructs in RPMI medium without phenol red. Twelve h after transfection, cells were incubated in either normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. Cells were then seeded on gelatin-coated glass coverslips and returned to normoxia or hypoxia for 30 min before FRAP experiments. Live cell imaging was done by confocal microscopy (Laser Scanning Microscope LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH) using a ×100 oil immersion objective lens at room temperature. GFP and CFP signals were collected in separate channels using specific band pass filters at wavelengths of 467–499 and 505–550 nm for CFP and GFP, respectively. CFP was excited at 458 nm, whereas GFP was excited at 488 nm. The confocal pinhole was set at ≤1 airy unit. Images were acquired sequentially to minimize the cross-talk between the two channels. The Golgi region was identified by ECFP-GalT staining. This region was selected as the ROI and FRAP studies were performed in this ROI for the EGFP-Kv1.3 channel. Pre-bleach images were taken for the GFP channel at 1% laser intensity. Subsequently, the ROI was bleached at 100% laser intensity using 100 iterations and the fluorescence recovery in the bleached ROI (FROI) was recorded by scanning at 1% laser intensity at 5-s intervals for 6–10 min. Simultaneously, the fluorescence intensity of an u"
https://openalex.org/W2085636962,"The striatum is composed predominantly of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that integrate excitatory, glutamatergic inputs from the cortex and thalamus, and modulatory dopaminergic inputs from the ventral midbrain to influence behavior. Glutamatergic activation of AMPA, NMDA, and metabotropic receptors on MSNs is important for striatal development and function, but the roles of each of these receptor classes remain incompletely understood. Signaling through NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) in the striatum has been implicated in various motor and appetitive learning paradigms. In addition, signaling through NMDARs influences neuronal morphology, which could underlie their role in mediating learned behaviors. To study the role of NMDARs on MSNs in learning and in morphological development, we generated mice lacking the essential NR1 subunit, encoded by the Grin1 gene, selectively in MSNs. Although these knockout mice appear normal and display normal 24-hour locomotion, they have severe deficits in motor learning, operant conditioning and active avoidance. In addition, the MSNs from these knockout mice have smaller cell bodies and decreased dendritic length compared to littermate controls. We conclude that NMDAR signaling in MSNs is critical for normal MSN morphology and many forms of learning."
https://openalex.org/W1971389652,"Background Inflammation is a hallmark of many serious human diseases. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an important human pathogen causing respiratory tract infections in both adults and children. NTHi infections are characterized by inflammation, which is mainly mediated by nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent production of proinflammatory mediators. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to play important roles in regulating diverse biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration. Its role in regulating NF-κB activation and inflammation, however, remains largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we demonstrate that EGFR plays a vital role in NTHi-induced NF-κB activation and the subsequent induction of proinflammatory mediators in human middle ear epithelial cells and other cell types. Importantly, we found that AG1478, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR potently inhibited NTHi-induced inflammatory responses in the middle ears and lungs of mice in vivo. Moreover, we found that MKK3/6-p38 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are required for mediating EGFR-dependent NF-κB activation and inflammatory responses by NTHi. Conclusions/Significance Here, we provide direct evidence that EGFR plays a critical role in mediating NTHi-induced NF-κB activation and inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Given that EGFR inhibitors have been approved in clinical use for the treatment of cancers, current studies will not only provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of inflammation, but may also lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of respiratory inflammatory diseases and other inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2057084985,"Background Neurons are dynamically coupled with each other through neurite-mediated adhesion during development. Understanding the collective behavior of neurons in circuits is important for understanding neural development. While a number of genetic and activity-dependent factors regulating neuronal migration have been discovered on single cell level, systematic study of collective neuronal migration has been lacking. Various biological systems are shown to be self-organized, and it is not known if neural circuit assembly is self-organized. Besides, many of the molecular factors take effect through spatial patterns, and coupled biological systems exhibit emergent property in response to geometric constraints. How geometric constraints of the patterns regulate neuronal migration and circuit assembly of neurons within the patterns remains unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings We established a two-dimensional model for studying collective neuronal migration of a circuit, with hippocampal neurons from embryonic rats on Matrigel-coated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). When the neural circuit is subject to geometric constraints of a critical scale, we found that the collective behavior of neuronal migration is spatiotemporally coordinated. Neuronal somata that are evenly distributed upon adhesion tend to aggregate at the geometric center of the circuit, forming mono-clusters. Clustering formation is geometry-dependent, within a critical scale from 200 µm to approximately 500 µm. Finally, somata clustering is neuron-type specific, and glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons tend to aggregate homo-philically. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate self-organization of neural circuits in response to geometric constraints through spatiotemporally coordinated neuronal migration, possibly via mechanical coupling. We found that such collective neuronal migration leads to somata clustering, and mono-cluster appears when the geometric constraints fall within a critical scale. The discovery of geometry-dependent collective neuronal migration and the formation of somata clustering in vitro shed light on neural development in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2106624478,"Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, neuropathological hallmarks of several neurological diseases, are mainly made of filamentous assemblies of α-synuclein. However, other macromolecules including Tau, ubiquitin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and glycosaminoglycans are routinely found associated with these amyloid deposits. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a glycolytic enzyme that can form fibrillar aggregates in the presence of acidic membranes, but its role in Parkinson disease is still unknown. In this work, the ability of heparin to trigger the amyloid aggregation of this protein at physiological conditions of pH and temperature is demonstrated by infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, small angle x-ray scattering, circular dichroism, and fluorescence microscopy. Aggregation proceeds through the formation of short rod-like oligomers, which elongates in one dimension. Heparan sulfate was also capable of inducing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase aggregation, but chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C together with dextran sulfate had a negligible effect. Aided with molecular docking simulations, a putative binding site on the protein is proposed providing a rational explanation for the structural specificity of heparin and heparan sulfate. Finally, it is demonstrated that in vitro the early oligomers present in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fibrillation pathway promote α-synuclein aggregation. Taking into account the toxicity of α-synuclein prefibrillar species, the heparin-induced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase early oligomers might come in useful as a novel therapeutic strategy in Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2085833371,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) expresses a viral ortholog (CMVIL-10) of human cellular interleukin-10 (cIL-10). Despite only ∼26% amino acid sequence identity, CMVIL-10 exhibits comparable immunosuppressive activity with cIL-10, attenuates HCMV antiviral immune responses, and contributes to lifelong persistence within infected hosts. The low sequence identity between CMVIL-10 and cIL-10 suggests vaccination with CMVIL-10 may generate antibodies that specifically neutralize CMVIL-10 biological activity, but not the cellular cytokine, cIL-10. However, immunization with functional CMVIL-10 might be detrimental to the host because of its immunosuppressive properties.Structural biology was used to engineer biologically inactive mutants of CMVIL-10 that would, upon vaccination, elicit a potent immune response to the wild-type viral cytokine. To test the designed proteins, the mutations were incorporated into the rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) ortholog of CMVIL-10 (RhCMVIL-10) and used to vaccinate RhCMV-infected rhesus macaques. Immunization with the inactive RhCMVIL-10 mutants stimulated antibodies against wild-type RhCMVIL-10 that neutralized its biological activity, but did not cross-react with rhesus cellular IL-10.This study demonstrates an immunization strategy to neutralize RhCMVIL-10 biological activity using non-functional RhCMVIL-10 antigens. The results provide the methodology for targeting CMVIL-10 in vaccine, and therapeutic strategies, to nullify HCMV's ability to (1) skew innate and adaptive immunity, (2) disseminate from the site of primary mucosal infection, and (3) establish a lifelong persistent infection."
https://openalex.org/W1989930636,"Background Spodoptera litura is a noctuid moth that is considered an agricultural pest. The larvae feed on a wide range of plants and have been recorded on plants from 40 plant families (mostly dicotyledons). It is a major pest of many crops. To better understand Spodoptera litura granulovirus (SpliGV), the nucleotide sequence of the SpliGV DNA genome was determined and analyzed. Methodology/Principal Findings The genome of the SpliGV was completely sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the SpliGV genome was 124,121 bp long with 61.2% A+T content and contained 133 putative open reading frames (ORFs) of 150 or more nucleotides. The 133 putative ORFs covered 86.3% of the genome. Among these, 31 ORFs were conserved in most completely sequenced baculovirus genomes, 38 were granulovirus (GV)-specific, and 64 were present in some nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) and/or GVs. We proved that 9 of the ORFs were SpliGV specific. Conclusions/Significance The genome of SpliGV is 124,121 bp in size. One hundred thirty-three ORFs that putatively encode proteins of 50 or more amino acid residues with minimal overlap were determined. No chitinase or cathepsin genes, which are involved in the liquefaction of the infected host, were found in the SpliGV genome, explaining why SpliGV-infected insects do not degrade in a typical manner. The DNA photolyase gene was first found in the genus Granulovirus. When phylogenic relationships were analyzed, the SpliGV was most closely related to Trichoplusia ni granulovirus (TnGV) and Xestia c-nigrum granulovirus (XecnGV), which belong to the Type I-granuloviruses (Type I-GV)."
https://openalex.org/W2044386418,"During development, the growth of the animal body is accompanied by a concomitant elongation of the peripheral nerves, which requires the elongation of integrated nerve fibers and the axons projecting therein. Although this process is of fundamental importance to almost all organisms of the animal kingdom, very little is known about the mechanisms regulating this process. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of novel mutant alleles of GlcAT-P, the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian glucuronyltransferase b3gat1. GlcAT-P mutants reveal shorter larval peripheral nerves and an elongated ventral nerve cord (VNC). We show that GlcAT-P is expressed in a subset of neurons in the central brain hemispheres, in some motoneurons of the ventral nerve cord as well as in central and peripheral nerve glia. We demonstrate that in GlcAT-P mutants the VNC is under tension of shorter peripheral nerves suggesting that the VNC elongates as a consequence of tension imparted by retarded peripheral nerve growth during larval development. We also provide evidence that for growth of peripheral nerve fibers GlcAT-P is critically required in hemocytes; however, glial cells are also important in this process. The glial specific repo gene acts as a modifier of GlcAT-P and loss or reduction of repo function in a GlcAT-P mutant background enhances VNC elongation. We propose a model in which hemocytes are required for aspects of glial cell biology which in turn affects the elongation of peripheral nerves during larval development. Our data also identifies GlcAT-P as a first candidate gene involved in growth of integrated peripheral nerves and therefore establishes Drosophila as an amenable in-vivo model system to study this process at the cellular and molecular level in more detail."
https://openalex.org/W1970777867,"Reproductive functions are regulated by the sophisticated coordination between the neuronal and endocrine systems and are sustained by a proper nutritional environment. Female reproductive function is vulnerable to effects from dietary restrictions, suggesting a transient adaptation that prioritizes individual survival over reproduction until a possible future opportunity for satiation. This adaptation could also partially explain the existence of amenorrhea in women with anorexia nervosa. Because amino acid nutritional conditions other than caloric restriction uniquely alters amino acid metabolism and affect the hormonal levels of organisms, we hypothesized that the supply of essential amino acids in the diet plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of the female reproductive system. To test this hypothesis, we examined ovulatory cyclicity in female rats under diets that were deficient in threonine, lysine, tryptophan, methionine or valine. Ovulatory cyclicity was monitored by daily cytological evaluations of vaginal smears. After continuous feeding of the deficient diet, a persistent diestrus or anovulatory state was induced most quickly by the valine-deficient diet and most slowly by the lysine-deficient diet. A decline in the systemic insulin-like growth factor 1 level was associated with a dietary amino acid deficiency. Furthermore, a paired group of rats that were fed an isocaloric diet with balanced amino acids maintained normal estrous cyclicity. These disturbances of the estrous cycle by amino acid deficiency were quickly reversed by the consumption of a normal diet. The continuous anovulatory state in this study is not attributable to a decrease in caloric intake but to an imbalance in the dietary amino acid composition. With a shortage of well-balanced amino acid sources, reproduction becomes risky for both the mother and the fetus. It could be viewed as an adaptation to the diet, diverting resources away from reproduction and reallocating them to survival until well-balanced amino acid sources are found."
https://openalex.org/W2086833250,"The catalytic loop HRD motif is found in most protein kinases and these amino acids are predicted to perform functions in catalysis, transition to, and stabilization of the active conformation of the kinase domain. We have identified mutations in a Drosophila src gene, src64, that alter the three HRD amino acids. We have analyzed the mutants for both biochemical activity and biological function during development. Mutation of the aspartate to asparagine eliminates biological function in cytoskeletal processes and severely reduces fertility, supporting the amino acid's critical role in enzymatic activity. The arginine to cysteine mutation has little to no effect on kinase activity or cytoskeletal reorganization, suggesting that the HRD arginine may not be critical for coordinating phosphotyrosine in the active conformation. The histidine to leucine mutant retains some kinase activity and biological function, suggesting that this amino acid may have a biochemical function in the active kinase that is independent of its side chain hydrogen bonding interactions in the active site. We also describe the phenotypic effects of other mutations in the SH2 and tyrosine kinase domains of src64, and we compare them to the phenotypic effects of the src64 null allele."

Adults enrolled between January 2005 and December 2009. Four-year rates of all-cause and stavudine-specific toxicity were estimated. Multilevel mixed-effect Poisson and accelerated failure models were used to investigate factors associated with toxicity and timing of diagnosis.A total of 48,785 patients contributed 62,505 person-years of follow-up. Rate of all-cause toxicity was 7.80 (95%CI 7.59-8.03) per 100 person-years, but varied greatly across sites (range 0.41-21.76). Patients treated with stavudine 40 mg had higher rates of toxicity (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 1.18, 95%CI 1.06-1.30 during the first year of ART; and 1.51, 95%CI 1.32-1.71 during the second year). Women, older age, initial advanced clinical stage, and low CD4 count were associated with increased toxicity rate ratios. Timing of lipodystrophy and peripheral neuropathy diagnosis were 12% and 13% shorter, respectively, in patients treated with stavudine 40 mg than in those receiving 30 mg stavudine dose (P = 0.03 and 0.07, respectively). INSTERPRETATION: Higher rates of drug-related toxicity were reported in patients receiving stavudine 40 mg compared with 30 mg, and the time to toxicity diagnosis was shorter in patients treated with the higher dose. Higher rates of toxicity were observed during the first two years of ART."
https://openalex.org/W1968359316,"Hereditary hyperekplexia, or startle disease, is a neuromotor disorder caused mainly by mutations that either prevent the surface expression of, or modify the function of, the human heteromeric α1 β glycine receptor (GlyR) chloride channel. There is as yet no explanation as to why hyperekplexia mutations that modify channel function are almost exclusively located in the α1 to the exclusion of β subunit. The majority of these mutations are identified in the M2–M3 loop of the α1 subunit. Here we demonstrate that α1 β GlyR channel function is less sensitive to hyperekplexia-mimicking mutations introduced into the M2–M3 loop of the β than into the α1 subunit. This suggests that the M2–M3 loop of the α subunit dominates the β subunit in gating the α1 β GlyR channel. A further attempt to determine the possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon by using the voltage-clamp fluorometry technique revealed that agonist-induced conformational changes in the β subunit M2–M3 loop were uncoupled from α1 β GlyR channel gating. This is in contrast to the α subunit, where the M2–M3 loop conformational changes were shown to be directly coupled to α1 β GlyR channel gating. Finally, based on analysis of α1 β chimeric receptors, we demonstrate that the structural components responsible for this are distributed throughout the β subunit, implying that the β subunit has evolved without the functional constraint of a normal gating pathway within it. Our study provides a possible explanation of why hereditary hyperekplexia-causing mutations that modify α1 β GlyR channel function are almost exclusively located in the α1 to the exclusion of the β subunit."

Though we garnered a high response rate (80.9%) by using evidence-based survey design elements, including intensive follow-up and a gift card incentive from Target, non-response bias could exist if there were differences between respondents and non-respondents. We investigated differences between the two groups for seven variables: road distance to the nearest Target store, practice type, previous administration of vaccines, region, urbanicity, size of practice, and Vaccines for Children (VFC) program enrollment. We also examined the effect of non-response bias on survey estimates. Statistically significant differences between respondents and non-respondents were found for four variables: miles to the nearest Target store, type of medical practice, whether the practice routinely administered additional vaccines besides H1N1, and urbanicity. Practices were more likely to respond if they were from a small town or rural area (OR = 7.68, 95% CI = 1.44-40.88), were a non-traditional vaccine provider type (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.06-4.08) or a pediatric provider type (OR = 4.03, 95% CI = 1.36-11.96), or administered additional vaccines besides H1N1 (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.03-3.15). Of particular interest, for each ten mile increase in road distance from the nearest Target store, the likelihood of provider response decreased (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.60-0.89). Of those variables associated with response, only small town or rural practice location was associated with a survey estimate of interest, suggesting that non-response bias had a minimal effect on survey estimates. These findings show that gift card incentives alongside survey design elements and follow-up can achieve high response rates.

Among these, Reichenowia picta, R. ornata and R. parasitica, are currently the only known mutualistic, alphaproteobacterial endosymbionts to inhabit leeches. These bacteria are harbored in the epithelial cells of the mycetomal structures of their freshwater leech hosts, Placobdella spp., and these structures have no other obvious function than housing bacterial symbionts. However, the function of the bacterial symbionts has remained unclear. Here, we focused both on exploring the genomic makeup of R. parasitica and on performing a robust phylogenetic analysis, based on more data than previous hypotheses, to test its position among related bacteria. We sequenced a combined pool of host and symbiont DNA from 36 pairs of mycetomes and performed an in silico separation of the different DNA pools through subtractive scaffolding. The bacterial contigs were compared to 50 annotated bacterial genomes and the genome of the freshwater leech Helobdella robusta using a BLASTn protocol. Further, amino acid sequences inferred from the contigs were used as queries against the 50 bacterial genomes to establish orthology. A total of 358 orthologous genes were used for the phylogenetic analyses. In part, results suggest that R. parasitica possesses genes coding for proteins related to nitrogen fixation, iron/vitamin B translocation and plasmid survival. Our results also indicate that R. parasitica interacts with its host in part by transmembrane signaling and that several of its genes show orthology across Rhizobiaceae. The phylogenetic analyses support the nesting of R. parasitica within the Rhizobiaceae, as sister to a group containing Agrobacterium and Rhizobium species."

Here, we use dynamic imaging approaches, orthogonal cross-seeding, and composition analysis to examine the dynamics and structure of nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of atrophin-1, implicated in dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, a polyQ-based disease with complex clinical features. Our results reveal a large heterogeneity in the dynamics of the nuclear inclusions compared with the compact and immobile cytoplasmic aggregates. At least two types of inclusions of expanded atrophin-1 with different mobility of the molecular species and ability to exchange with the surrounding monomer pool coexist in the nucleus. Intriguingly, the enrichment of nuclear inclusions with slow dynamics parallels changes in the aggregate core architecture that are dominated by the polyQ stretch.

Although some cellular proteins are irreversibly sequestered in the polyQ aggregates, others retain their flexibility, albeit with impaired functionality (19Chai Y. Shao J. Miller V.M. Williams A.

Importantly, the ability to interact with cellular proteins varies among the aggregates composed of different disease proteins, which may explain the disease-specific pattern of the polyQ disorders (19Chai Y. Shao J. Miller V.M. Williams A. Paulson H.L. Live-cell imaging reveals divergent intracellular dynamics of polyglutamine disease proteins and supports a sequestration model of pathogenesis.Proc.

Fluorescent techniques with high time resolution (i.e. fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP)) have revealed that cellular aggregates of ataxin-1 and Htt exon-1 are highly heterogeneous with different mobility of the monomers inside them (19Chai Y. Shao J. Miller V.M. Williams A. Paulson H.L. Live-cell imaging reveals divergent intracellular dynamics of polyglutamine disease proteins and supports a sequestration model of pathogenesis.Proc.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These various aggregate types may expose different parts of the primary protein sequences, thus providing different surfaces for biophysical interactions with the cellular proteins. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the aggregation process and the molecular architecture of the different aggregate species formed in the cell is critical for understanding the variations in the mechanisms underlying polyQ pathologies. In an effort to address this question, we sought to characterize the dynamics and structure of the aggregates of atrophin-1 (ATN1), which is implicated in DRPLA pathology. ATN1 contains putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and nuclear export (NES) sequence at the N- and C terminus, respectively, and localizes in the nucleus and cytoplasm (27Yazawa I. Nukina N. Hashida H. Goto J. Yamada M. Kanazawa I. Abnormal gene product identified in hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) brain.Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The role of the aggregate formation in the cellular dysgenesis is still elusive. Whereas ATN1 with a normal and expanded polyQ length show no difference in cellular toxicity in a neuroblastoma cell model, preferential accumulation in the nucleus by removal of the NES sequence confers cellular toxicity (28Nucifora Jr., F.C. Ellerby L.M. Wellington C.L. Wood J.D. Herring W.J. Sawa A. Hayden M.R. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A.

The cellular dysfunction and toxic effect might be due to an altered distribution pattern of promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies by intranuclear aggregates of ATN1 with an expanded polyQ stretch (29Yamada M.

Pathol. 2001; 159: 1785-1795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, some nuclear aggregates of ATN1 with an expanded polyQ tract can sequester the transcriptional coactivator, the cAMP response element-binding protein (30Yamada M. Wood J.D. Shimohata T. Hayashi S. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Widespread occurrence of intranuclear atrophin-1 accumulation in the central nervous system neurons of patients with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) through interactions with its short polyQ stretch (23Nucifora Jr., F.C. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Interference by huntingtin and atrophin-1 with cbp-mediated transcription leading to cellular toxicity.Science. 2001; 291: 2423-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). ETO/MTG8, a component of the nuclear receptor corepressor complexes, cofractionates in nuclear matrix preparations from brains of DRPLA patients and colocalizes with nuclear aggregates in a cellular model system (5Wood J.D. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Duan K. Zhang C. Wang J. Kim Y. Schilling G. Sacchi N. Liu J.M. Ross C.A. Atrophin-1, the dentato-rubral and pallido-luysian atrophy gene product, interacts with ETO/MTG8 in the nuclear matrix and represses transcription.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sequences flanking the polyglutamine region are involved in interactions with the cellular proteins. SH3 domain of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate protein interacts with the proline-rich region cognate to the polyQ tract in the ATN1 (31Okamura-Oho Y. Miyashita T. Ohmi K. Yamada M. Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy protein interacts through a proline-rich region near polyglutamine with the SH3 domain of an insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The variety of cellular interaction partners raises the intriguing hypotheses of whether different parts of the parental protein are involved, transiently or irreversibly, in the aggregate core, which may suggest an explanation for the observed variety in the clinical features of DRPLA, i.e. epilepsy versus dementia. Here, we show that the expansion of the polyQ stretch over the pathological threshold changes the dynamics and biophysical properties of nuclear ATN1 aggregates. The polyQ flanking sequences associated independently of the polyQ-length and sequestered ATN1 in highly mobile nuclear inclusions. In a second step, polyQ expansion over the threshold induced the conversion into amyloid-like aggregates with reduced mobility and a core composed of the polyQ stretch. Our findings provide a mechanistic insight into the complexity of ATN1 aggregation to explain the heterogeneity in pathogenesis of DRPLA and other polyQ disorders. Full-length ATN1 (FL-ATN1) and truncated variant lacking the first 75 amino acids (ΔN-ATN1) with 19Q or 71Q, respectively (FL19Q, FL71Q, ΔNLS19Q, ΔNLS71Q) were kindly provided by Dr. T.

The promoter of pEGFP-C2 was exchanged with pTREhCMV-1 promoter from pTRE2hyg plasmid (Clontech) using a combined restriction with AflII and NotI. AflII restriction site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. To enable controlled protein expression under the Tet-off promoter, we used neuroblastoma N2a cells stably transfected with pTet-Off plasmid (N2a/Tet-Off cells) which were a kind gift from Dr. P Breuer. pLac-DsRed inducible mammalian expression vector was obtained by subcloning the DsRed coding sequence from the pDsRed2 plasmid (Clontech) into the KpnI/BglII restriction sites of the pLac/MCS plasmid (33Matsumoto G.

The pLac/MCS plasmid is an engineered pORSVI/MCS plasmid for isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression in mammalian cells and was kindly provided by Dr. R. Morimoto (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). The ATN1 fragments comprising different parts of the FL-ATN1 were subcloned in-frame downstream of the DsRed moiety using the BglII/XbaI restriction sites. The stable cell line N2a/Tet-Off/LacI for coexpression of proteins under the Tet-Off was created by transfection of pCMV-LacI-NLS plasmid in N2a/Tet-Off cells. Stably transfected cells were selected with 0.7 mg/ml hygromycin B. N2a/Tet-Off cells were used for expression of FL-ATN1 or ΔN-ATN1 variants. For in vivo cross-seeding experiments, N2a/Tet-Off/LacI cells were transiently cotransfected with the FL and ATN1 fragments at a stoichiometric 1:1 ratio. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) or JetPrime reagent (PeqLab) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown in DMEM (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% Tet system-approved FBS (Clontech), 0.3 mg/ml L-Glu (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For maintenance of stably transfected N2a/Tet-Off cells, the medium was supplemented with 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). In the case of N2a/Tet-Off/LacI cells, 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin B (Clontech) was added. The expression of pTREhCMV-1-controlled constructs (FL and ΔN-ATN1) was switched off by addition of 0.3 μg/ml doxycycline (Clontech). The ATN1 fragments that were controlled under the Lac Switch expression system were induced by addition of 15 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the medium. Transfected N2a/Tet-Off cells were grown on poly-L-lysine-precoated cover slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) at room temperature and mounted using an anti-fade mounting kit (Invitrogen). DNA was counterstained using DAPI (Sigma). Cells were imaged on an LSM710 Axiovert confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with the ×63 oil objective lens, and images were taken at 488 nm, 405 nm, and 561 nm laser wavelengths for GFP, DAPI, and DsRed, respectively. For life-cell imaging, FRAP and iFRAP analyses, transfected N2a/Tet-Off or N2a/Tet-Off/LacI cells were grown in poly-L-lysine-precoated 8-well microslides (Ibidi). For FRAP experiments, an area of 2.98 μm2 was photobleached for 1 s (120 iterations) with a 488-nm laser wavelength at 100% power, and single images were collected before and every 1.5 s after photobleaching within an interval of 8.5 min. For the iFRAP experiments the area of interest was defined using Zen software, and the whole cell outside the defined area was photobleached for 4.5 s (90 iterations) with a 488-nm laser wavelength at 100% power. 300 or 500 z-stacks, each consisting of five slices in 0.7 μm intervals and seven slices in 0.9 μm intervals, were collected for each single image in the FRAP and iFRAP experiments, respectively. The intensity of the images recorded in FRAP was normalized to the relative intensity (RI) as established for in-cell FRAP analysis (22Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I.

RIt = i = (Ii/Inbi)/(I0/Ipb), where Ii and Inbi are the integrated intensities of the bleached and non-bleached area at any given time point and I0 and Ipb are the integrated intensities before photobleaching of the bleached and non-bleached area, respectively. The images recorded in the iFRAP experiments were normalized to the relative intensity values RIt = i = (Ii/Inbi). The constitutive photobleaching was measured by collecting control images of at least 10 non-bleached cells. The half-life time was determined as described elsewhere (26Stenoien D.L. Mielke M. Mancini M.A. Intranuclear ataxin1 inclusions contain both fast- and slow-exchanging components.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the standard deviation was calculated from three independent cells. Cells were washed twice in PBS harvested in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)), lysed on ice at the lowest blender-homogenizer power, and subsequently treated with BenzonaseTM (Sigma) for 20 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at low speed (80 × g) at 4 °C, and the pellet fraction was resuspended in the lysis buffer. The supernatant was further separated into five fractions by sucrose density centrifugation (50,000 × g, Ti65-Beckman-Coulter rotor) for 45 min at 4 °C in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and protease inhibitor mixture. For fractionation into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, cells were washed twice in PBS, harvested in PBS buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and protease inhibitor mixture, centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture). After swelling for 10 min, the cells were dounce-homogenized on ice, centrifuged for 10 min at 80 × g at 4 °C to separate the non-disrupted cells and the largest cytoplasmatic, SDS-insoluble inclusions (without precipitating the nuclei), and the nuclear fraction was further pelleted at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Both the pellet after the first, slow-centrifugation step and the nuclei fraction were resuspended in the hypotonic buffer containing 100 mm MgCl2 to a volume equal to that of the supernatant, subjected to an additional mechanical disruption, and incubated for 15 min with benzonase on ice. Samples were analyzed by immunoblot analysis on a nitrocellulose membrane or filter retardation assay (35Wanker E.E. Scherzinger E. Heiser V. Sittler A. Eickhoff H. Lehrach H. Membrane filter assay for detection of amyloid-like polyglutamine-containing protein aggregates.Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) on cellulose acetate membrane (0.2 μm pore size) and detected using anti-GFP (1:1000, Roche) as primary antibodies. We monitored the in vivo dynamics of full-length ATN1-GFP fusions with a polyQ tract of a non-pathological (FLQ19) or pathological (FLQ71) length in neuroblastoma N2a/Tet-Off cells under the control of a Tet-Off promoter. The pathological variant, FL71Q, localized readily into hyperfluorescent loci in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, even 24 h post-transfection (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1). A fraction of it, however, remained diffusely distributed throughout the cell, even at later times of expression, thus recapitulating the expression pattern of ATN1 with an expanded polyQ tract previously observed in degenerated neurons (28Nucifora Jr., F.C. Ellerby L.M. Wellington C.L."

https://openalex.org/W2095021409,"The regulation of complex cellular activities in palmitate treated HepG2 cells, and the ensuing cytotoxic phenotype, involves cooperative interactions between genes. While previous approaches have largely focused on identifying individual target genes, elucidating interacting genes has thus far remained elusive. We applied the concept of information synergy to reconstruct a ""gene-cooperativity"" network for palmititate-induced cytotoxicity in liver cells. Our approach integrated gene expression data with metabolic profiles to select a subset of genes for network reconstruction. Subsequent analysis of the network revealed insulin signaling as the most significantly enriched pathway, and desmoplakin (DSP) as its top neighbor. We determined that palmitate significantly reduces DSP expression, and treatment with insulin restores the lost expression of DSP. Insulin resistance is a common pathological feature of fatty liver and related ailments, whereas loss of DSP has been noted in liver carcinoma. Reduced DSP expression can lead to loss of cell-cell adhesion via desmosomes, and disrupt the keratin intermediate filament network. Our findings suggest that DSP expression may be perturbed by palmitate and, along with insulin resistance, may play a role in palmitate induced cytotoxicity, and serve as potential targets for further studies on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)."
