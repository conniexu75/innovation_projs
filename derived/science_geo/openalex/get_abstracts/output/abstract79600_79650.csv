These malformations consisted of a specific effect on the face and upper jaw, ranging from a simple mid-line cleft to almost complete obliteration of normal facial architecture. A few other malformations apparently also induced by cadmium in this dose were occasionally found. These consisted of anophthakmia, digital and other limb defects, rib fusions and exencephaly. The simultaneous administration of 2 mg/kg zinc sulphate almost completely inhibited this marked teratogenic effect of cadmium. The particular susceptibility of the germinal epithelium of the testis and the rodent placenta to the toxic effects of cadmium has been described1,2. This toxic effect of cadmium has been attributed to alterations in the endothelium of the vascular beds in these affected organs2,3."

The elevated frequencies of the allele for dry cerumen, found in Indians of pure ancestry, support the theory of the mongoloid origin of the American Indian. Potential application of cerumen quality as a marker for genetic and anthropological studies is discussed."

They are similar to the material joining nuclear lobes of segmented granulocytes. Smith5 has demonstrated nuclear pockets in non-leukaemic lymphocytes."

There is, however, a need to devise similar methods which may be even more appropriate in particular cases. One such method which is similar to, but simpler than, the “booby-trapping” method of Morgan1 was suggested as a result of experiments with the Australian sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina. Female flies, resistant to dieldrin, which survived 0.5 µl. of 2 per cent dieldrin dissolved in kerosene and di-isobutyl ketone (1 : 1) applied topically to the thorax, were exposed to males from a susceptible strain (LD50< 0.005 per cent dieldrin). Each female killed up to one hundred males through contact during attempted mating. Treated resistant males were capable of killing susceptible females, but the effect was of a lower order of magnitude."

Recently, measurement of testosterone in urine after β-glucuronidase hydrolysis has been proposed as a satisfactory means of evaluating testicular function2 and testosterone production3 in male subjects."
