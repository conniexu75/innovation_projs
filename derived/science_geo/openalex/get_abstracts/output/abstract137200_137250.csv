The transcription factors that are involved in the transcriptional activation of the IFNB gene have been extensively studied. However, the molecular mechanism by which virus activates the expression of the IFNA gene remains to be defined. Recently, we have identified a new IRF-7 isoform, denoted as IRF-7H, which encodes a protein of 514 amino acids and is most closely related to the IRF-3. The expression of IRF-7 is restricted to the lymphoid cell types and is inducible by virus, lipopolysaccharide, and IFNA. The functional characterization of IRF-7H reveals a presence of transactivation domain located carboxyl-terminal to its DNA binding domain. Overexpression of IRF-7H results in an activation of IFNA promoter in transient transfection assay and a strong enhancement of virus-mediated activation of this promoter. Whereas in uninfected cells, overexpressed IRF-7H is present mainly in the cytoplasm, viral infection facilitates the transfer of IRF-7H to the nucleus; overexpression of IRF-3 interferes with the virus-induced translocation of IRF-7H. Thus, IRF-7 exhibits functional similarity to IRF-3; however, the preferential expression of IRF-7 in lymphoid cells (the cell type that expresses IFNA) suggests that IRF-7 may play a critical role in regulating the IFNA gene expression.

Although the virus-induced signaling that leads to the activation of IFNA genes has not been well characterized, it was shown that the transcriptional activation of IFNA genes does not require de novo protein synthesis, and it is sensitive to several kinase inhibitors (2Au W.C.

These observations suggested that a posttranscriptional modification, such as phosphorylation, of latent transcription factors, constitutes a vital part of virus-induced signaling pathway.The cis-acting elements involved in the regulation of IFNA are located within 110 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site (4Raj N.B. Au W.C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11360-11365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to IFNB gene promoter, the cis regulatory region of IFNA promoters (inducible element (IE)) does not contain the NF-kB binding site (4Raj N.B. Au W.C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11360-11365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the virus response element of IFNA promoter was shown to bind multiple transcription factors (2Au W.C. Su Y. Raj N.B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24032-24040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The study of transcriptional activation of murine IFNA4 promoter revealed that the binding of both AF-1-specific protein (p68 and p96) and of a member of the IRF family is required, because a point mutation in either IRF-E or AF-1 binding site abolished the virus-mediated induction of IFNA4 IE (2Au W.C. Su Y. Raj N.B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24032-24040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a virus-induced complex/factor binding to a sequence outside IFNA4 IE as well to positive regulatory domain I was detected (5Braganca J. Genin P. Bandu M.T. Darracq N. Vignal M. Casse C.

Although the experimental evidence indicates that IRF-E in IFNA4 promoter is essential for its transcriptional activity in infected cells, it has been less clear which one of the IRF family members plays a critical role in the transcriptional activation of IFNA promoters.The IRF family consists of a growing number of transcriptional factors that share homology in the amino-terminal 115 amino acids. This homologous region comprises the DNA binding domain (DBD) that is structurally related to Myb (6Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Altogether, nine cellular IRFs have been identified. IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, and p48 (interferon-stimulated gene F3) are expressed in a variety of cell types (7Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha M.P. Cytokine and Growth Factor Reviews. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), whereas interferon consensus sequence binding protein, IRF-4 (PU.1 interacting protein), and IRF-7 are expressed predominantly in lymphoid cells (8Nonkwelo C.

IRF-5 and IRF-6 have not yet been characterized. Studies using the IRF-expressing cell lines and knockout mice reveal that each IRF family member exerts a distinct role in diverse biological processes, such as response to pathogens, cytokine signaling, cell growth regulation, or hematopoietic development (10Holtschke T.

Although IRF-1 was first identified by its ability to bind the hexamer (AAGTGA) repeats in the IFNB promoter (15Fujita T. Shibuya J. Hotta H. Yamanishi K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1987; 49: 357-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and overexpression of IRF-1 is able to activate IFNA4 promoter in transient assay (16Au W.C. Raj N.B. Pine R. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the role of IRF-1 in virus-induced expression of type I IFN genes has been controversial, because virus-infected IRF-1-deficient mice or cells, expressed normal levels of IFNA and IFNB (17Reis L.F. Ruffner H. Stark G. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4798-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Ruffner H. Reis L.F. Naf D. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11503-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mice with homozygous deletion of thep48 gene have shown a cell type-specific defect in type I IFN induction (19Kimura T. Kadokawa Y. Harada H. Matsumoto M. Sato M. Kashiwazaki Y. Tarutani M. Tan R.S. Takasugi T. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Noguchi S. Taniguchi T.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, the role of p48 as a primary activator of type I IFN genes has also been questioned. In fact, mutant cells (U4A), defective in p48, are able to express IFN genes after virus infection. Therefore, we have searched the ETS data base for a new IRF family members that may function as transcriptional activators of type I IFN genes and have identified IRF-3 (21Au W.C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and, recently, a new variant of IRF-7, IRF-7H. In a transient expression assay, IRF-3 strongly synergizes with virus-mediated activation of IFNA and IFNB promoters (21Au W.C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 22Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Recent studies from several groups have shown that IRF-3 is phosphorylated at the carboxyl-terminal serine cluster in infected cells and translocated to nucleus, whereby it interacts with the transcriptional coactivator, CBP/p300 (22Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 23Weaver B.K. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell.

Overexpression of E1A that targets CBP/p300 inhibited IRF-3-mediated transactivation of IFNA promoter, thus providing additional evidence for the biological role of IRF-3-CBP/p300 interaction (25Juang Y.-T. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.-C. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9837-9842Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).IRF-7 was first isolated as a protein binding to the QRE-2 present in the promoter region of (Qp) the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen 1, and the cDNAs corresponding to three spliced variants of IRF-7 (A, B, and C) were identified (9Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The levels of IRF-7 mRNA in various Epstein-Barr virus infected cells showed an inverse correlation with the activity of Qp promoter, and it was, therefore, suggested that IRF-7 may be a repressor of transcriptional activity of Qp. Whether IRF-7 indeed mediates repression of Qp activity remains controversial. Nonkwelo et al. (8Nonkwelo C. Ruf I.K. Sample J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6887-6897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have identified IRF-1 and IRF-2 as a positive regulators of Qp, whereas IRF-7 alone had little effect on the activity of Qp promoter. In contrast, Zhang and Pagano (9Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IRF-7 suppressed Qp activity and competed the binding with IRF-1 to the interferon-sensitive response elementin vitro (9Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).The purpose of this study was to characterize the spliced variant IRF-7H and establish its role in the activation of IFN gene expression. We have analyzed the IRF-7H-mediated modulation of IFNA promoter activity. The expression of IRF-7, similar to the expression of IFNA genes, is limited to the cells of lymphoid origin. Overexpression of IRF-7H activates IFNA promoter and enhances virus-mediated stimulation of this promoter. Using deletion analysis, we have identified the presence of a transactivation domain located downstream of the DBD of IRF-7H. In addition, we have found that viral infection facilitates transfer of IRF-7H from cytoplasm to nucleus. Thus, the IRF-7H shares some of its functions with both IRF-1 and IRF-3 but shows a restricted expression.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have isolated a new, spliced variant of IRF-7, IRF-7H, and analyzed its potential role in the transcriptional activation of IFNA genes. Expression of IRF-7 can be stimulated by both viral infection and IFNA in the absence of protein synthesis, indicating that IRF-7 is the immediate early gene responding to these signals. The specific induction of IRF-7 gene expression by type I IFN, but not by IFN-Î³, is of interest in view of the fact that IRF-1 is induced much more efficiently by IFN-Î³ than by IFNA and expression of IRF-3 is not stimulated by IFNs or virus. These data indicate that in the context of viral infection, the expression of these IRFs shows distinct specificity.The data presented in this study identified IRF-7 as a transcriptional activator, which is in concurrence with the recent results of Wathletet al. (28Wathlet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Using the Gal4-IRF-7H fusion protein and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of IRF-7H, we have identified the transactivation domain of IRF-7 to be located between amino acids 120 and 237. The transactivation potential of IRF-7 is apparently independent of the target gene because a similar degree of activation was obtained with both Gal4 and IFNA reporter plasmids.Using deletion analysis and in vivo competition assay, we have identified an additional regulatory domain in the carboxyl-terminal end of IRF-7H protein (amino acids 428â514) that acts as a dominant negative mutant capable of suppressing the IRF-7H-mediated transactivation. This domain, which is present in the IRF-7A and IRF-7B, but missing in IRF-7C, contains a serine-rich region (Fig. 1 A) and a few imperfect NES-like motifs. Despite the fact that exon skipping of IRF-1 mRNA was suggested as one of the mechanisms by which the IRF-1 gene is inactivated in human leukemia (30Harada H. Kondo T. Ogawa T. Tamura T. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Lamphier M.S. Tanaguchi T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3313-3320PubMed Google Scholar), the identification of multiple variants of IRF-7 (possibly derived from the differential splicing) is unique to the IRF-7 gene and has not yet been demonstrated in the other IRFs. It is likely that some of these IRF-7 spliced variants may function as dominant negative mutants; as such, an unbalanced expression of these variants may be of biological importance.We have previously shown that virus-stimulated phosphorylation of IRF-3 on serines (396, 398, 402, and 405) and tyrosine (404) is critical for the translocation of IRF-3 into the nucleus and its interaction with a transcriptional cofactor, CBP/p300 (24Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha M.P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In contrast, Yoneyama et al. (22Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) attributed a critical role to serines 385 and 386 (22Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Although the serine-rich region of IRF-7H could potentially be phosphorylated, the observation that IRF-7H mutants (IRF-7 349 and 237) that had this region deleted were still able to stimulate transcription of IFNA promoter in a transient transfection assay suggests that phosphorylation of this cluster does not play a limiting role in the transactivating ability of IRF-7H. These phosphorylation sites, however, seem to be required for the observed synergy between virus and IRF-7H in the activation of the IFNA promoter, which was observed only with the full-length IRF-7H but not with its carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants. Similar to the observation with IRF-3, the transport of IRF-7H into the nucleus was facilitated by viral infection, but when overexpressed, IRF-7H could also be found in the nucleus of uninfected cells. Because both IRF-7 and IRF-3 were found as components of the VAF complex binding to the interferon-stimulated response element, it was suggested that IRF-3 and IRF-7 are associated in cells (28Wathlet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). We expected, therefore, that the translocation of IRF-7H into the nucleus might be facilitated in the presence of IRF-3. Surprisingly, however, we found that overexpression of IRF-3 blocked translocation of IRF-7H in infected cells, indicating that these two factors are not transported to the nucleus as a heterodimer complex. These results rather suggest that, when overexpressed, IRF-3 may serve as a competitor for the virus-induced modifications and thus inhibit nuclear translocation of IRF-7H. This assumption is further supported by the finding that the mutant, IRF-3(5A) is not inhibitory.The interaction of transcriptional factors assembled on the IFNB promoter with CBP/p300, including IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7, was suggested to be required for inducible expression of the IFNB gene (28Wathlet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Although the direct binding of IRF-7 to CBP/p300 has not been demonstrated, the presence of IRF-3, IRF-7, and CBP/p300 was detected in the VAF complex associated with the interferon-stimulated response element (28Wathlet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The fact that the IRF-7-mediated transactivation of IFNA promoter region is inhibited by 12SE1A but not by its mutant that is unable to bind CBP/p300 suggests that interaction of IRF-7H with CBP/p300 is required for its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, whereas the activation of IFNA promoter by all these three IRFs is inhibited by 12S/E1A, 13S/E1A only inhibits IRF-1 and IRF-3-mediated activation but stimulates the IRF-7 activation. Both of these forms of E1A can bind CBP/p300, but only 13SE1A contains the CR3 domain that interacts with TBP and TAF (29Parker S.F. Felzien L.K. Perkins N.D. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the distinct repression and activation of IRF-3 and IRF-7, respectively, by 13S/E1A may reflect a subtle difference in transcriptional cofactors with which IRF-7 and IRF-3 interact. Differential modulation of HIV-LTR activity by 13S and 12SE1A has previously been reported, and it was shown that activation and repression of HIV-LTR activity by 12S and 13SE1A, respectively, is mediated by different sets of transcriptional factors (29Parker S.F. Felzien L.K. Perkins N.D. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although the transcriptional complex-enhanceosome that binds to the promoter of IFNA genes has not yet been identified, several observations indicate that IRF-7 plays a critical role in the induction of IFNA genes. First, inducibility of the IFNA genes and expression of IRF-7 show the same cell type specificity, both being preferentially expressed in cells of the lymphoid origin. Second, overexpression of IRF-7 exhibits the same specificity in the transcriptional induction of IFNA4 and IFNA6 promoters as virus infection. Third, IRF-7 specifically binds the IE of IFNA4 promoter in vitro. Because many of the functional characteristics of IRF-7 are similar to those of IRF-3, it may be possible that a cooperative interaction of both of these factors is necessary for the induction of IFNA gene transcriptions. Indeed, while this manuscript was being prepared, IRF-3 and IRF-7, but not IRF-1, were found to be components of the enhanceosome associating with the promoter of IFNB gene (29Parker S.F. Felzien L.K. Perkins N.D. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are in progress to determine whether the expression of IFNA genes is determined by the cell-specific interaction between the members of the IRF family or by their interaction with lymphoid cell-specific transcription factors. The expression of IFNA1genes in infected cells is regulated at the transcriptional level (1Hisamaru H. Bisat F. Raj N.B. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6067-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the virus-induced signaling that leads to the activation of IFNA genes has not been well characterized, it was shown that the transcriptional activation of IFNA genes does not require de novo protein synthesis, and it is sensitive to several kinase inhibitors (2Au W.C.

Although IRF-1 was first identified by its ability to bind the hexamer (AAGTGA) repeats in the IFNB promoter (15Fujita T. Shibuya J. Hotta H. Yamanishi K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1987; 49: 357-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and overexpression of IRF-1 is able to activate IFNA4 promoter in transient assay (16Au W.C. Raj N.B. Pine R. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the role of IRF-1 in virus-induced expression of type I IFN genes has been controversial, because virus-infected IRF-1-deficient mice or cells, expressed normal levels of IFNA and IFNB (17Reis L.F.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, the role of p48 as a primary activator of type I IFN genes has also been questioned. In fact, mutant cells (U4A), defective in p48, are able to express IFN genes after virus infection. Therefore, we have searched the ETS data base for a new IRF family members that may function as transcriptional activators of type I IFN genes and have identified IRF-3 (21Au W.C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and, recently, a new variant of IRF-7, IRF-7H. In a transient expression assay, IRF-3 strongly synergizes with virus-mediated activation of IFNA and IFNB promoters (21Au W.C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Recent studies from several groups have shown that IRF-3 is phosphorylated at the carboxyl-terminal serine cluster in infected cells and translocated to nucleus, whereby it interacts with the transcriptional coactivator, CBP/p300 (22Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 23Weaver B.K. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell.

Overexpression of E1A that targets CBP/p300 inhibited IRF-3-mediated transactivation of IFNA promoter, thus providing additional evidence for the biological role of IRF-3-CBP/p300 interaction (25Juang Y.-T. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.-C. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9837-9842Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). IRF-7 was first isolated as a protein binding to the QRE-2 present in the promoter region of (Qp) the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen 1, and the cDNAs corresponding to three spliced variants of IRF-7 (A, B, and C) were identified (9Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The levels of IRF-7 mRNA in various Epstein-Barr virus infected cells showed an inverse correlation with the activity of Qp promoter, and it was, therefore, suggested that IRF-7 may be a repressor of transcriptional activity of Qp. Whether IRF-7 indeed mediates repression of Qp activity remains controversial. Nonkwelo et al. (8Nonkwelo C. Ruf I.K. Sample J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6887-6897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have identified IRF-1 and IRF-2 as a positive regulators of Qp, whereas IRF-7 alone had little effect on the activity of Qp promoter. In contrast, Zhang and Pagano (9Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IRF-7 suppressed Qp activity and competed the binding with IRF-1 to the interferon-sensitive response elementin vitro (9Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to characterize the spliced variant IRF-7H and establish its role in the activation of IFN gene expression. We have analyzed the IRF-7H-mediated modulation of IFNA promoter activity. The expression of IRF-7, similar to the expression of IFNA genes, is limited to the cells of lymphoid origin. Overexpression of IRF-7H activates IFNA promoter and enhances virus-mediated stimulation of this promoter. Using deletion analysis, we have identified the presence of a transactivation domain located downstream of the DBD of IRF-7H. In addition, we have found that viral infection facilitates transfer of IRF-7H from cytoplasm to nucleus. Thus, the IRF-7H shares some of its functions with both IRF-1 and IRF-3 but shows a restricted expression. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have isolated a new, spliced variant of IRF-7, IRF-7H, and analyzed its potential role in the transcriptional activation of IFNA genes. Expression of IRF-7 can be stimulated by both viral infection and IFNA in the absence of protein synthesis, indicating that IRF-7 is the immediate early gene responding to these signals. The specific induction of IRF-7 gene expression by type I IFN, but not by IFN-Î³, is of interest in view of the fact that IRF-1 is induced much more efficiently by IFN-Î³ than by IFNA and expression of IRF-3 is not stimulated by IFNs or virus. These data indicate that in the context of viral infection, the expression of these IRFs shows distinct specificity.The data presented in this study identified IRF-7 as a transcriptional activator, which is in concurrence with the recent results of Wathletet al. (28Wathlet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Using the Gal4-IRF-7H fusion protein and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of IRF-7H, we have identified the transactivation domain of IRF-7 to be located between amino acids 120 and 237. The transactivation potential of IRF-7 is apparently independent of the target gene because a similar degree of activation was obtained with both Gal4 and IFNA reporter plasmids.Using deletion analysis and in vivo competition assay, we have identified an additional regulatory domain in the carboxyl-terminal end of IRF-7H protein (amino acids 428â514) that acts as a dominant negative mutant capable of suppressing the IRF-7H-mediated transactivation. This domain, which is present in the IRF-7A and IRF-7B, but missing in IRF-7C, contains a serine-rich region (Fig. 1 A) and a few imperfect NES-like motifs. Despite the fact that exon skipping of IRF-1 mRNA was suggested as one of the mechanisms by which the IRF-1 gene is inactivated in human leukemia (30Harada H. Kondo T. Ogawa T. Tamura T. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Lamphier M.S. Tanaguchi T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3313-3320PubMed Google Scholar), the identification of multiple variants of IRF-7 (possibly derived from the differential splicing) is unique to the IRF-7 gene and has not yet been demonstrated in the other IRFs. It is likely that some of these IRF-7 spliced variants may function as dominant negative mutants; as such, an unbalanced expression of these variants may be of biological importance.We have previously shown that virus-stimulated phosphorylation of IRF-3 on serines (396, 398, 402, and 405) and tyrosine (404) is critical for the translocation of IRF-3 into the nucleus and its interaction with a transcriptional cofactor, CBP/p300 (24Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha M.P. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In contrast, Yoneyama et al. (22Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) attributed a critical role to serines 385 and 386 (22Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Although the serine-rich region of IRF-7H could potentially be phosphorylated, the observation that IRF-7H mutants (IRF-7 349 and 237) that had this region deleted were still able to stimulate transcription of IFNA promoter in a transient transfection assay suggests that phosphorylation of this cluster does not play a limiting role in the transactivating ability of IRF-7H. These phosphorylation sites, however, seem to be required for the observed synergy between virus and IRF-7H in the activation of the IFNA promoter, which was observed only with the full-length IRF-7H but not with its carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants. Similar to the observation with IRF-3, the transport of IRF-7H into the nucleus was facilitated by viral infection, but when overexpressed, IRF-7H could also be found in the nucleus of uninfected cells. Because both IRF-7 and IRF-3 were found as components of the VAF complex binding to the interferon-stimulated response element, it was suggested that IRF-3 and IRF-7 are associated in cells (28Wathlet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). We expected, therefore, that the translocation of IRF-7H into the nucleus might be facilitated in the presence of IRF-3. Surprisingly, however, we found that overexpression of IRF-3 blocked translocation of IRF-7H in infected cells, indicating that these two factors are not transported to the nucleus as a heterodimer complex. These results rather suggest that, when overexpressed, IRF-3 may serve as a competitor for the virus-induced modifications and thus inhibit nuclear translocation of IRF-7H. This assumption is further supported by the finding that the mutant, IRF-3(5A) is not inhibitory.The interaction of transcriptional factors assembled on the IFNB promoter with CBP/p300, including IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7, was suggested to be required for inducible expression of the IFNB gene (28Wathlet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Although the direct binding of IRF-7 to CBP/p300 has not been demonstrated, the presence of IRF-3, IRF-7, and CBP/p300 was detected in the VAF complex associated with the interferon-stimulated response element (28Wathlet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The fact that the IRF-7-mediated transactivation of IFNA promoter region is inhibited by 12SE1A but not by its mutant that is unable to bind CBP/p300 suggests that interaction of IRF-7H with CBP/p300 is required for its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, whereas the activation of IFNA promoter by all these three IRFs is inhibited by 12S/E1A, 13S/E1A only inhibits IRF-1 and IRF-3-mediated activation but stimulates the IRF-7 activation. Both of these forms of E1A can bind CBP/p300, but only 13SE1A contains the CR3 domain that interacts with TBP and TAF (29Parker S.F. Felzien L.K. Perkins N.D. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the distinct repression and activation of IRF-3 and IRF-7, respectively, by 13S/E1A may reflect a subtle difference in transcriptional cofactors with which IRF-7 and IRF-3 interact. Differential modulation of HIV-LTR activity by 13S and 12SE1A has previously been reported, and it was shown that activation and repression of HIV-LTR activity by 12S and 13SE1A, respectively, is mediated by different sets of transcriptional factors (29Parker S.F. Felzien L.K. Perkins N.D. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although the transcriptional complex-enhanceosome that binds to the promoter of IFNA genes has not yet been identified, several observations indicate that IRF-7 plays a critical role in the induction of IFNA genes. First, inducibility of the IFNA genes and expression of IRF-7 show the same cell type specificity, both being preferentially expressed in cells of the lymphoid origin. Second, overexpression of IRF-7 exhibits the same specificity in the transcriptional induction of IFNA4 and IFNA6 promoters as virus infection. Third, IRF-7 specifically binds the IE of IFNA4 promoter in vitro. Because many of the functional characteristics of IRF-7 are similar to those of IRF-3, it may be possible that a cooperative interaction of both of these factors is necessary for the induction of IFNA gene transcriptions. Indeed, while this manuscript was being prepared, IRF-3 and IRF-7, but not IRF-1, were found to be components of the enhanceosome associating with the promoter of IFNB gene (29Parker S.F. Felzien L.K. Perkins N.D. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are in progress to determine whether the expression of IFNA genes is determined by the cell-specific interaction between the members of the IRF family or by their interaction with lymphoid cell-specific transcription factors. In the present study, we have isolated a new, spliced variant of IRF-7, IRF-7H, and analyzed its potential role in the transcriptional activation of IFNA genes. Expression of IRF-7 can be stimulated by both viral infection and IFNA in the absence of protein synthesis, indicating that IRF-7 is the immediate early gene responding to these signals.

We have generated transgenic potato plants that synthesize human insulin, a major insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus autoantigen, at levels up to 0.05% of total soluble protein. To direct delivery of plant-synthesized insulin to the gut-associated lymphoid tissues, insulin was linked to the C-terminus of the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB). Transgenic potato tubers produced 0.1% of total soluble protein as the pentameric CTB-insulin fusion, which retained GM1-ganglioside binding affinity and native antigenicity of both CTB and insulin. Nonobese diabetic mice fed transformed potato tuber tissues containing microgram amounts of the CTB-insulin fusion protein showed a substantial reduction in pancreatic islet inflammation (insulitis), and a delay in the progression of clinical diabetes. Feeding transgenic potato tissues producing insulin or CTB protein alone did not provide a significant reduction in insulitis or diabetic symptoms. The experimental results indicate that food plants are feasible production and delivery systems for immunotolerization against this T cell-mediated autoimmune disease."

Recently, Smad6 and Smad7 were identified, which antagonize TGF-Î² family signaling by preventing the activation of signal-transducing Smad complexes. Here we report that Smad7, but not Smad6, inhibits TGF-Î²1-induced growth inhibition and the expression of immediate early response genes, including Smad7. Interestingly, in the absence of ligand, Smad7 was found to be predominantly localized in the nucleus, whereas Smad7 accumulated in the cytoplasm upon TGF-Î² receptor activation. The latter is in accordance with the physical association of Smad7 with the ligand-activated TGF-Î² receptor complex in the cell membrane. Whereas the ectopically expressed C-terminal domain of Smad7 was also exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon TGF-Î² challenge, a Smad7 mutant with a small deletion at the C terminus or only the N-terminal domain of Smad7 was localized mainly in the cytoplasm in the absence or presence of ligand. This suggests that an intact Mad homology 2 domain is important for nuclear localization of Smad7. The nuclear localization of Smad7 suggests a functional role distinct from its antagonistic effect in receptor-mediated Smad activation."

The aim of our study was to determine the presence of alterations in the main putative components of the TGF-beta inhibitory signaling pathways (p15, Smad4, Smad2, TGFbeta-RII, CDC25A). A panel of human carcinomas of the exocrine pancreas orthotopically implanted and perpetuated in nude mice and pancreatic cancer cell lines were studied. p15 gene alterations, mainly homozygous deletions that involved exons 1 and/or 2, were found in the 62.5% (5 of 8) of pancreatic xenografts whereas Smad4 gene aberrations were found in one of eight xenografts and in two of seven cell lines. Additional aberrations in these genes were acquired during in vivo perpetuation and distal dissemination. Paradoxically, TGFbeta-RII overexpression and a decrease in CDC25A protein levels were found in all tumors and cell lines. In one cell line, resistance to TGF-beta1 occurred in the absence of alterations in the genes analysed so far. We conclude that all human pancreatic tumor cells analysed herein have non-functional TGF-beta pathways. The majority of cells harbor alterations in at least one of the putative components of TGF-beta pathways, mainly in p15 and Smad4 genes. These results suggest that inactivation of TGF-beta signaling pathways plays an important role in human pancreatic tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2045965322,"Members of the bcl-2 gene family encode proteins that function either to promote or to inhibit apoptosis. Despite numerous efforts, the mechanism of action of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, is still not clear. In particular, the relation between Bcl-2 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium store is not well-understood. In the present work, we examined the effect of Bcl-2 on the ER store. We demonstrate that overexpression of Bcl-2 in breast epithelial cells modulates ER store by upregulating calcium pump (SERCA) expression without affecting the release channel (IP3R). The steady state levels of SERCA2 mRNA and protein were both increased in Bcl-2 expression clones. The increase in SERCA2 protein leads to accelerated calcium uptake and enhanced Ca2+ loading. In addition, we also show the detection of intracellular interaction between Bcl-2 and SERCA molecules by co-immunoprecipitation. Since high lumenal Ca2+ concentration of ER is essential for normal cell functions, the results suggest that Bcl-2 preserves the ER Ca2+ store by upregulating SERCA gene expression as well as by a possible interaction with the pump."

https://openalex.org/W2022731838,"The role, if any, that mitochondrial (mt) DNA alterations play in the carcinogenic process remains unclear. To determine whether mtDNA instability occurs in cancers, nine microsatellite sequences in the mtDNA were examined in 45 sporadic colorectal carcinomas. Alteration in a polycytidine (C)n tract within a non-coding displacement-loop (D-loop) region was detected in 20 carcinomas (44%), three of which also exhibited frameshift mutations in a polyadenosine (A)8 or polycytidine (C)6 tract within NADH dehydrogenase (ND) genes. Interestingly, all three mutant genes were predicted to encode truncated ND proteins, which lacked a large portion of the C-terminus. These results suggested that certain repair systems, like the mismatch repair systems in the nuclear genome, are required for mtDNA maintenance and that defects in these systems can lead to target mitochondrial gene mutations in colorectal carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2094101574,"The binding and uptake of phosphatidylserine (PS)-expressing cells appears to involve multiple receptor-mediated systems that recognize the lipid either directly or indirectly through intermediate proteins that form a molecular bridge between the cells. Here we show that Î²2-glycoprotein I (Î²2GPI), a 50-kDa serum glycoprotein, binds PS-containing vesicles and serves as an intermediate for the interaction of these vesicles with macrophages. Chemical modification of lysines and cysteines abolished Î²2GPI-dependent PS uptake by inhibiting the binding of PS to Î²2GPI and the binding of PSÂ·Î²2GPI complex to macrophages, respectively. Recognition was mediated by Î²2GPI and not by the lipid because antibodies to Î²2GPI inhibited binding of the complex to macrophages. These results indicate that human (THP-1-derived) macrophages bind Î²2GPI only after it is bound to its lipid ligand. Competition experiments with monosaccharides that inhibit lectin-dependent interactions, and PSÂ·Î²2GPI binding experiments using deglycosylated Î²2GPI, suggested that carbohydrate residues were not required for macrophage recognition of the complex. Antibodies to putative macrophage PS receptors (CD36, CD68, and CD14) did not inhibit uptake of the complex. These data suggest that Î²2GPI can bind cells that fail to maintain membrane lipid asymmetry and generate a specific bridging moiety that is recognized for clearance by a phagocyte receptor that is distinct from CD36, CD68, and CD14.

These observations raise the possibility that, in addition to regulating thrombosis (19Brighton T.A. Hogg P.J. Dai Y.-P. Murray B.H. Choing B.H. Chesterman C.N. Br. J. Hematol. 1996; 93: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), Î²2GPI plays an important physiologic role by mediating the recognition of cells that fail to preserve membrane lipid asymmetry.Although the binding of Î²2GPI to PS-containing surfaces has been well characterized (15Wurm H.J.

Here we report on the nature of Î²2GPI/phagocyte interactions using human THP-1-derived macrophages as a model system. We show that human Î²2GPI binds macrophages only after it is complexed to its lipid ligand. Our results suggest that PS binding by Î²2GPI induces a lipid-dependent conformational change that exposes a specific epitope that is recognized by a macrophage receptor that is distinct from other previously described lipid receptors.DISCUSSIONÎ²2GPI is a well characterized plasma glycoprotein that binds negatively charged phospholipids. This property is responsible for regulating thrombosis by competing with clotting factors for PS expressed on the surface of activated platelets (19Brighton T.A. Hogg P.J. Dai Y.-P. Murray B.H. Choing B.H. Chesterman C.N. Br. J. Hematol. 1996; 93: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similar PS binding activities have also been shown to occur with synthetic negatively charged phospholipid vesicles (15Wurm H.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31113-31117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Formation of these PSÂ·Î²2GPI complexes is associated with rapid clearance of the PS-expressing particle from the peripheral circulation (16Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25845-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and phagocytosis of PS-expressing cells in vitro (18Balasubramanian K. Chandra J. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31113-31117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of Î²2GPI to PS has been shown to result in a major change in the proteins conformation (29Matsuura E. Igarashi Y. Yasuda T. Triplett D.A. Koike T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 30Borchman D. Harris E.N. Pierangeli S.S. Lamba O.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 102: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that might result in the expression of a new epitope (31Hagihara Y. Goto Y. Kato H. Yoshimura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which, in certain individuals, generates an autoimmune response. While the mechanism for the generation of these immune responses is not known, this new epitope could be responsible for the recognition and removal of PS-expressing apoptotic and senescent cells from the host.Using an in vitro model for macrophage binding, we showed that the uptake of PS liposomes by macrophages was greatly enhanced by the addition of Î²2GPI that saturated at â¼2 Î¼m. Since the average concentration of Î²2GPI in normal human plasma is about 4 Î¼m(13Cohnen G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1969; 75: 212-216Google Scholar), these data raise the possibility that this property could be the principal function of Î²2GPI in vivo. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 2, ligand-free Î²2GPI did not bind macrophages. However, once Î²2GPI bound PS, the complex became rapidly associated with the macrophage membrane. The requirement for ligand binding was further shown by the inability of macrophages to bind diketene-treated (lysine-blocked) Î²2GPI even in the presence of PS.PSÂ·Î²2GPI complex binding to macrophages was shown to be inhibited by lysine and arginine as well as negatively charged ions including organic acids and phosphate (Table I). These compounds did not affect Î²2GPI binding to its ligand since they did not inhibit precipitation of the complex in a gel diffusion assay. This suggests that the binding of the complex to the macrophage membrane requires specific electrostatic interactions that are unlike those involved in the binding of Î²2GPI to its ligand.Amino acid analysis showed that Î²2GPI consists of five characteristic sushi domains (32Kato H. Enjyoji K-I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11687-11694Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with domain V being principally responsible for the lipid binding properties of the protein (28Hunt J. Krilis S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar). While the lysines present on domain V are known to be critical for lipid binding (28Hunt J. Krilis S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar), the experiments described here cannot exclude the possibility that these or other lysines are also required for ligand-dependent macrophage binding. Acylation of sulfhydryls with NEM, on the other hand, inhibited PS-dependent macrophage binding but not PS binding to Î²2GPI (Fig. 4). Because human Î²2GPI might contain a free sulfhydryl (Cys102 and/or Cys169) (33Lozier J. Takahashi N. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 34Steinkasserer A. Estaller C. Weiss E. Sim R.B. Day A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), it is possible that acylation of one or both these moieties inhibits the putative conformational change required to promote macrophage binding of the PSÂ·Î²2GPI complex. This raises the possibility that domains II and/or III, harbor a hidden moiety critical to macrophage binding. Additional support for the involvement of these domains in macrophage binding can be obtained from results which showed that removal of the carbohydrate moieties (33Lozier J. Takahashi N. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) resulted in >3-fold enhancement in Î²2GPI-dependent uptake (Fig. 6).Several studies have suggested that the redistribution of PS from the cells inner to outer leaflet signals for removal of these cells by the reticuloendothelial system (1Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pradhan D. Krahling S. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25845-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although several mechanisms might be responsible for phagocyte recognition of PS expressing apoptotic cells, Price et al. (17Price B.E. Rauch J. Shia M.A. Walsh M.T. Lieberthal W. Gilligan H.M. O'Laughlin T. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2201-2208PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the interaction of circulating Î²2GPI with redistributed anionic phospholipid may, by itself, generate a novel ligand by which apoptotic cells are recognized. Indeed, other studies have indicated that Î²2GPI could play a central role in this recognition process (16Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25845-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Combined with these previous studies, the data presented here provide evidence for the existence of a receptor on the macrophage membrane that specifically binds Î²2GPI in a ligand-dependent manner. Although the motif on the protein responsible for the macrophage membrane interaction is not known, it could result from a lipid-dependent conformational change (29Matsuura E. Igarashi Y. Yasuda T. Triplett D.A. Koike T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 30Borchman D. Harris E.N. Pierangeli S.S. Lamba O.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 102: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that is specifically bound to a cell surface receptor, a process that can be inhibited with anti-Î²2GPI F(abâ²)2 (Fig. 5). Several reports have suggested the involvement of macrosialin (CD68) (4Ramprasad M.P. Fischer W. Witztum J.L. Sambrano G.R. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Raykundalia C. Capra J.D. Simons D.L. Gregory C.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) in the recognition of PS on apoptotic cells. Antibodies directed against these cell surface moieties, however, did not significantly inhibit Î²2GPI-dependent PS uptake. The inability to obtain more than 20% inhibition raises the possibility that either more than one cell surface component is involved in Î²2GPI-dependent recognition or that recognition is inhibited because of steric hindrance by antibody bound to an unrelated proximal site. Although further studies will be required to identify the putative PSÂ·Î²2GPI-dependent macrophage receptor, the data presented here argue for the existence of such a receptor. Because of the relative abundance of Î²2GPI in plasma, it could play an important physiologic role by bridging PS-expressing cells to phagocytes for their ultimate disposal. The emergence of phosphatidylserine (PS)1 in the cells outer leaflet results in the expression of altered cell surface properties that regulates their recognition by phagocytes (1Fadok V.A.

Formation of these PSÂ·Î²2GPI complexes is associated with rapid clearance of the PS-expressing particle from the peripheral circulation (16Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the binding of Î²2GPI to PS has been shown to result in a major change in the proteins conformation (29Matsuura E. Igarashi Y. Yasuda T. Triplett D.A. Koike T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 30Borchman D. Harris E.N. Pierangeli S.S. Lamba O.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 102: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that might result in the expression of a new epitope (31Hagihara Y. Goto Y. Kato H. Yoshimura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which, in certain individuals, generates an autoimmune response. While the mechanism for the generation of these immune responses is not known, this new epitope could be responsible for the recognition and removal of PS-expressing apoptotic and senescent cells from the host.Using an in vitro model for macrophage binding, we showed that the uptake of PS liposomes by macrophages was greatly enhanced by the addition of Î²2GPI that saturated at â¼2 Î¼m. Since the average concentration of Î²2GPI in normal human plasma is about 4 Î¼m(13Cohnen G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1969; 75: 212-216Google Scholar), these data raise the possibility that this property could be the principal function of Î²2GPI in vivo. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 2, ligand-free Î²2GPI did not bind macrophages. However, once Î²2GPI bound PS, the complex became rapidly associated with the macrophage membrane. The requirement for ligand binding was further shown by the inability of macrophages to bind diketene-treated (lysine-blocked) Î²2GPI even in the presence of PS.PSÂ·Î²2GPI complex binding to macrophages was shown to be inhibited by lysine and arginine as well as negatively charged ions including organic acids and phosphate (Table I). These compounds did not affect Î²2GPI binding to its ligand since they did not inhibit precipitation of the complex in a gel diffusion assay. This suggests that the binding of the complex to the macrophage membrane requires specific electrostatic interactions that are unlike those involved in the binding of Î²2GPI to its ligand.Amino acid analysis showed that Î²2GPI consists of five characteristic sushi domains (32Kato H. Enjyoji K-I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11687-11694Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with domain V being principally responsible for the lipid binding properties of the protein (28Hunt J. Krilis S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar). While the lysines present on domain V are known to be critical for lipid binding (28Hunt J. Krilis S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar), the experiments described here cannot exclude the possibility that these or other lysines are also required for ligand-dependent macrophage binding. Acylation of sulfhydryls with NEM, on the other hand, inhibited PS-dependent macrophage binding but not PS binding to Î²2GPI (Fig. 4). Because human Î²2GPI might contain a free sulfhydryl (Cys102 and/or Cys169) (33Lozier J. Takahashi N. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 34Steinkasserer A. Estaller C. Weiss E. Sim R.B. Day A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), it is possible that acylation of one or both these moieties inhibits the putative conformational change required to promote macrophage binding of the PSÂ·Î²2GPI complex. This raises the possibility that domains II and/or III, harbor a hidden moiety critical to macrophage binding. Additional support for the involvement of these domains in macrophage binding can be obtained from results which showed that removal of the carbohydrate moieties (33Lozier J. Takahashi N. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) resulted in >3-fold enhancement in Î²2GPI-dependent uptake (Fig. 6).Several studies have suggested that the redistribution of PS from the cells inner to outer leaflet signals for removal of these cells by the reticuloendothelial system (1Fadok V.A.

Although several mechanisms might be responsible for phagocyte recognition of PS expressing apoptotic cells, Price et al. (17Price B.E. Rauch J. Shia M.A. Walsh M.T. Lieberthal W. Gilligan H.M. O'Laughlin T. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2201-2208PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the interaction of circulating Î²2GPI with redistributed anionic phospholipid may, by itself, generate a novel ligand by which apoptotic cells are recognized. Indeed, other studies have indicated that Î²2GPI could play a central role in this recognition process (16Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25845-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Combined with these previous studies, the data presented here provide evidence for the existence of a receptor on the macrophage membrane that specifically binds Î²2GPI in a ligand-dependent manner. Although the motif on the protein responsible for the macrophage membrane interaction is not known, it could result from a lipid-dependent conformational change (29Matsuura E. Igarashi Y. Yasuda T. Triplett D.A. Koike T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 30Borchman D. Harris E.N. Pierangeli S.S. Lamba O.P. Clin. Exp.

Several reports have suggested the involvement of macrosialin (CD68) (4Ramprasad M.P. Fischer W. Witztum J.L. Sambrano G.R. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Raykundalia C. Capra J.D. Simons D.L. Gregory C.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) in the recognition of PS on apoptotic cells. Antibodies directed against these cell surface moieties, however, did not significantly inhibit Î²2GPI-dependent PS uptake. The inability to obtain more than 20% inhibition raises the possibility that either more than one cell surface component is involved in Î²2GPI-dependent recognition or that recognition is inhibited because of steric hindrance by antibody bound to an unrelated proximal site. Although further studies will be required to identify the putative PSÂ·Î²2GPI-dependent macrophage receptor, the data presented here argue for the existence of such a receptor. Because of the relative abundance of Î²2GPI in plasma, it could play an important physiologic role by bridging PS-expressing cells to phagocytes for their ultimate disposal. Î²2GPI is a well characterized plasma glycoprotein that binds negatively charged phospholipids. This property is responsible for regulating thrombosis by competing with clotting factors for PS expressed on the surface of activated platelets (19Brighton T.A. Hogg P.J. Dai Y.-P. Murray B.H.

In contrast, no mitogenic effects were seen with arachidonic acid, other cP450 arachidonate metabolites (12R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HETE), 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DHET), or 20-HETE), or lipoxygenase metabolites (5S-HETE, leukotriene B4, or lipoxin A4). We found that their metabolically more stable sulfonimide (SI) analogs (11,12-EET-SI and 14,15-EET-SI) were also potent mitogens. In addition 14,15-EET-SI also increased cell proliferation as well as expression of both c-fos and egr-1 mRNA. The protein kinase C and A inhibitors, H-7 and H-8, or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, had no effect upon 14,15-EET-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation, but the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, significantly inhibited it. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting demonstrated increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3-kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) within 1 min of EET administration. EETs also stimulated association of PI3-kinase with EGFR. PI3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY 294002, markedly inhibited 14,15-EET-SI-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation. In addition, 14,15-EET-SI administration stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of src homologous and collagen-like protein (SHC) and association of SHC with both growth factor receptor-binding protein (GRB2) and EGFR. Mitogen-activated protein kinase was also activated within 5 min. Pretreatment of the cells with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited the 14,15-EET-SI-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation. Moreover, immunoblotting indicated that 14,15-EET stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the specific pp60c-src substrate p120 and c-Src association with EGFR. 14,15-EET increased src kinase activity within 1 min. Our data indicate that EETs are potent mitogens for renal epithelial cells, and the mitogenic effects of the EETs are mediated, at least in part, by the activation of Src kinase and initiation of a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation cascade.

The EETs are produced predominantly by epoxygenases of the 2C family of cP450s, which have been localized in the kidney to the mammalian proximal tubule.

Escalante B. Schwartzman M.L. Abraham N.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). EETs have also been proposed as second messengers for hormones and growth factors in the proximal tubule. We have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates EET production in rat proximal tubule suspensions and primary cultured rabbit proximal tubule cells, and EETs may mediate both EGF-stimulated calcium influx and mitogenesis in proximal tubules (11Burns K.D. Capdevila J. Wei S. Breyer M.D. Homma T. Harris R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C831-C840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Omata et al. also demonstrated EET production upon stimulation with angiotensin II (12Omata K. Abraham N.G. Schwartzman M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F591-F599PubMed Google Scholar). EETs may mediate the effect of high (>10â7m) angiotensin II to increase cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) and decrease Na+/H+ exchange activity in cultured rabbit proximal tubule cells and isolated rat proximal tubules (13Madhun Z.T.

We determined the mitogenic effects of all four EET regioisomers and utilized metabolically more stable sulfonimide analogs to determine potential intracellular signaling mechanisms mediating mitogenic effects. We demonstrate here that EETs activate pp60c-src and initiate a tyrosine kinase cascade that mediates their mitogenic effects. This is the first evidence that cP450-mediated arachidonic acid metabolites can signal through such pathways. A 1:1 bicarbonate-buffered mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient medium was purchased from Sigma. (Â±)-11,12-EET, (Â±)-14,15-EET (16Falck J.R. Yadagiri P. Capdevila J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and their sulfonimide analogs (see Fig. 1) were synthesized as follows: EET (94 mg, 0.29 mmol) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (37 mg, 0.32 mmol) were azeotropically dried with benzene (3 Ã 20 ml), then dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (5 ml) and cooled to 0 Â°C. To this was added dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (66 mg) all at once with vigorous stirring. After 12 h at room temperature, the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the crude product was purified by SiO2column chromatography using ethyl acetate (30:70) to give the corresponding N-hydroxysuccinimide ester as a gum (92 mg, 75%). TLC (SiO2): 30% ethyl acetate in hexane, Rf â 0.2; 1H NMR (250 MHz, CDCl3): Î´ 0.92 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 3H), 1.32â1.60 (m, 8H), 1.82â193 (m, 2H), 2.02â2.45 (m, 6H), 2.65 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 2H), 2.80â2.88 (m, 6H), 2.92â3.00 (m, 2H), 5.34â5.52 (m, 6H). The above active ester (92 mg), methanesulfonimide (209 mg), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (29.5 mg) were dried in vacuo (0.1 mm Hz) for 2 h, mixed with anhydrous hexamethylphosphoramide (0.25 ml), and heated at 90 Â°C under an argon atmosphere. After 1.5 h, the reaction mixture was cooled and partitioned between water and ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was extracted twice more with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4 and evaporated in vacuo, and the reside was purified via preparative TLC using ethyl acetate/hexane (l:1) to afford (Â±) EET-SI (51 mg, 58%) or a colorless oil.

EGF (receptor grade) was purchased from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). [3H]Thymidine, [Î±-32P]dCTP, and [Î³-32P]ATP (specific activity: 3000 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. Genistein, H-7, PD98059, H-8, wortmannin, and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem. Rabbit muscle enolase was from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Polyclonal and monoclonal PY-20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3)-kinase antibodies and polyclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (UBI, Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-Src antibody 327, a mouse mAb that specifically recognizes mammalian pp60c-src, was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Polyclonal anti-Src (sc-018, which recognizes pp60c-src, pp62yes, and pp59fyn), polyclonal anti-ERK antibodies, and protein A-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-SHC, monoclonal anti-EGFR, and monoclonal anti-GRB2 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). LLCPKcl4, an established proximal tubule epithelial cell line derived from pig kidney (17Amsler K. Cook J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C94-C101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2 cell culture incubator. The medium was changed every 2â3 days. For studies of [3H]thymidine incorporation, cells were seeded into 24-well plates. For cellular RNA isolation and immunoprecipitation, cells were grown in 100- and 60-mm plates, respectively. Confluent cells in 100-mm dishes were detached by trypsinization, resuspended in growth medium, seeded at a density of 3 Ã 104/well in 24-well plates, and incubated for 2â3 days until they were 80% confluent. The medium was then changed to serum-free medium and incubated for an additional 3 days. EETs and/or the indicated drugs in the corresponding data were routinely added to the quiescent cells in triplicate and incubated for 19 h, followed by the addition of 2 Î¼Ci/ml [3H]thymidine to pulse the cells for an additional 2 h. Cells were then washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, precipitated twice (30 min each time on ice) with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, briefly washed once with ice-cold ethanol, lysed with 0.2 n NaOH, 0.5% SDS and incubated at 37 Â°C for at least 30 min, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Beckman Instruments). Results were plotted as the number of counts/min/well. Each experimental data point represents triplicate or duplicate wells from at least four different experiments. For determination of the effect of the 14,15-EET-SI on cell number, 1 Ã 104/well LLCPKcl4 cells were seeded into 24-well plates. After 48 h of growth, the medium was changed to serum-free medium and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were then exposed to 20 Î¼m 14,15-EET-SI or vehicle for the indicated times. Confluent LLCPKcl4 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were made quiescent for 3 days, exposed to vehicle (Me2SO), 14,15-EET-SI, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or EGF for the indicated times and concentrations, then total cellular RNA was isolated by the single-step acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). 15 Î¼g of total RNA was size-fractionated by formaldehyde-agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Nytran nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). [Î±-32P]cDNA probes were labeled to a specific activity of >2 Ã 108 dpm/Î¼g by random priming (Megaprime DNA Labeling System; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After overnight hybridization, membranes were washed twice with 2Ã SSC (0.3 m NaCl and 0.03 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and 0.2Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 Â°C for 30 min. Autoradiography was performed at â70 Â°C by exposing the washed membranes to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with intensifying screens. To assess the uniformity of RNA loading, blots were stripped and reprobed with a cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase labeled with [Î±-32P]dCTP. Quiescent cultures of LLCPKcl4 cells were treated with agonists for the indicated times, washed twice with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 Î¼mNa3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were clarified at 10,000 Ã gfor 15 min at 4 Â°C, and protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Target proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 Â°C for 2 h with appropriate antibodies. In some experiments, immobilized antibodies were used to minimize recovery of immunoglobulin heavy chains. Immune complexes were then captured with 50 Î¼l of protein A-agarose beads and washed four times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 100 Î¼mNa3VO4). Immunoprecipitation samples were resuspended and boiled in sample buffer before separation on 5â15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature, blots were probed with the indicated primary antibody overnight at 4 Â°C. The blots were washed 3 times at room temperature with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with biotin, washed with TBS-Tween, incubated with preformed avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex using a commercially available kit (ABC kit; Pierce), and detected by a peroxidase-catalyzed enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Src immunoprecipitates were prepared as described above and washed twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 Î¼m Na3VO4). Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP and 1 mg/ml enolase as a substrate and allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 Î¼l of acetic acid. The amount of enolase phosphorylation was then determined by spotting an aliquot (25 Î¼l) of the reaction mix onto P81 cation exchange paper (Whatman), washing three times in 0.5% phosphoric acid, and measuring radioactivity in a scintillation counter. Data are presented as means Â±S.E. for at least four separate experiments (each in triplicate or duplicate). Unpaired Student's t test was used for statistical analysis and for multiple group comparisons; analysis of variance and Bonferronit tests were used. A value of p < 0.05 compared with control was considered statistically significant. We have previously shown that EGF increased EET production in rat or rabbit renal proximal tubule cells (1Endou H.C.P. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 33: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Burns K.D. Capdevila J. Wei S. Breyer M.D. Homma T. Harris R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C831-C840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies we utilized a nontransformed cell line, LLCPKcl4, cloned from the parental LLC-PK1 cell line and selected for its expression of high levels of proximal tubule markers (17Amsler K. Cook J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C94-C101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to EGF, with ECmax â¼ 256 nm and an EC50 of â¼8 nm (Fig. 2 A). Arachidonic acid in concentrations from 1 to 40 Î¼m failed to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation in LLCPKcl4 (n = 14). Administration of the product of P450 arachidonic acid Ï-hydroxylation, 20-HETE, did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation in LLCPKcl4 (n = 7). Similarly, no mitogenic effects were seen with the cP450 arachidonate metabolite, 12R-HETE (n = 6). The lipoxygenase metabolites, 5S-HETE, LTB4, and lipoxin A4, also failed to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation in LLCPKcl4 (n = 4â6). However, as indicated in Fig. 2 B, all four EET regioisomers (5,6-EET, 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 14,15-EET) increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in LLCPKcl4 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with 14,15-EET being the most potent. In contrast, the hydration product of 14,15-EET, 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DHET), produced only minimal increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation (not shown). EETs are susceptible to oxidative degradation; to block acetyl CoA-dependent activation and lysophospholipid acylation, the EET carboxylate was blocked by condensation with methanesulfonimide to generate the corresponding sulfonimide derivatives (11,12-EET-SI and 14,15-EET-SI). Shown in Fig. 1 are structures of 14,15-EET and its sulfonimide derivative, 14,15-EET-SI. These sulfonimide analogs were also found to be potent mitogens for LLCPKcl4 cells, as determined by increased [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2 C). As with the parent compound, 14,15-EET-SI was found to be relatively more potent than 11,12-EET-SI. Therefore, 14,15-EET-SI was utilized for further investigation of the mitogenic signaling pathways. In addition to [3H]thymidine incorporation, 14,15-EET-SI increased cell proliferation in the absence of fetal calf serum (Fig. 2 D). Quiescent LLCPKcl4 cells were exposed to 20 Î¼m 14,15-EET-SI for the indicated times, the cells were lysed, total cellular RNA was isolated, and levels of mRNA expression were determined by Northern blot hybridization. 14,15-EET-SI increased steady state levels of both c-fos and egr-1mRNA within 15 min, with maximal increases at 30 min. The message levels rapidly declined in the subsequent 3 h (Fig. 3). In contrast, 14,15-EET-SI did not induce any significant increases in COX-2 mRNA levels, nor did it induce expression of acyl CoA oxidase mRNA, a marker of peroxisomal proliferator activator receptor activation (not shown). To investigate signaling mechanisms of the mitogenic effects of 14,15-EET, we tested a range of inhibitors. The isoquinoline sulfonimides, H-7 and H-8, are potent inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases and of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. Although neither is specific, H-7 has relative specificity for PKC, whereas H-8 is most effective for protein kinase A and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (19Hidaka H. Inagake M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar, 20Hidaka H. Hagiwara M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1987; 8: 162-164Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). No inhibition of 14,15-EET-SI-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of LLCPKcl4 cells was seen with either H-7 or H-8. In addition, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, did not alter 14,15-EET-SI-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation. However, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, blocked [3H]thymidine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of â¼10 Î¼m (Fig. 4 A). Similar inhibitory effects were seen for 11,12-EET-SI-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation (not shown). After treatment with 20 Î¼m 14,15-EET-SI, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY), then immunoprobed with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20). We found that administration of 14,15-EET-SI led to increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of several LLCPKcl4 proteins, including bands of of molecular mass â¼175, â¼120, â¼85, and â¼60 kDa (Fig. 4 B). To characterize the 85-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, cell lysates were subjected to either immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine and immunoblotting with an anti-PI3-kinase antibody or immunoprecipitation with anti-PI3-kinase and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. The results indicated in Fig. 5 A confirmed that 14,15-EET-SI administration induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was detectable within 1 min of 14,15-EET-SI addition and remained elevated for up to 30 min (the longest time period tested). The PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, was found to inhibit 14,15-EET-SI-stimulated DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of the cells with 1 nm wortmannin for 30 min inhibited 21% of the stimulation, and 10 nmwortmannin almost totally (95%) abolished the stimulatory effect of 20 Î¼m 14,15-EET-SI, with IC50 â¼ 5 nm (Fig. 5 B). At the concentrations used in the present studies, wortmannin has been shown to inhibit PI3-kinase specifically and to have no inhibitory effect upon phospholipase C, phospholipase D, phospholipase A2, or adenylate cyclase (21Straub S.G. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1660-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, similar effects were shown by another structurally and mechanistically distinct, highly specific PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (22Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with an IC50 value of â¼5 Î¼m (Fig. 5 C). Wortmannin and LY294002 administration resulted in similar inhibition of 11,12-EET-SI-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation (not shown). Immunoblotting with an anti-EGF receptor antibody identified the â¼175-kDa protein that was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to 14,15-EET-SI (Fig. 6 A). Increases in EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation were noted within the first 5 min of 14,15-EET-SI addition. Moreover, immunoprecipitation with a PI3-kinase antibody and immunoblotting with an anti-EGFR antibody indicated that 14,15-EET-SI induced the association of PI3-kinase with EGF receptors (Fig. 6 B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SHC has been reported to occur in response to activation of both tyrosine kinase receptors and nontyrosine kinase receptors. To determine if 14,15-EET-SI stimulates SHC tyrosine phosphorylation, we probed anti-PY immunoprecipitates with SHC antibody and determined that 14,15-EET-SI stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the three SHC isoforms: 66 kDa, 52 kDa, and 46 kDa. Initial increases in tyrosine phosphorylation were detected in 52-kDa and 66-kDa SHC, with subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of 46-kDa SHC (Fig. 7 A). Phosphorylated SHC is known to bind to SH2 domains of tyrosine kinase receptors and to recruit the adaptor protein, GRB2, to the plasma membrane. By immunoprecipitating with anti-SHC and then immunoblotting with antibodies against GRB2 or EGF receptors, we further corroborated that 14,15-EET-SI-activated SHC simultaneously co-immunoprecipitated both GRB2 and EGF receptors (Fig. 7, B and C),i.e. 14,15-EET-SI induced association of SHC not only with GRB2 but also with EGF receptors. GRB2 has been shown to bind to the guanine nucleotide exchanging factor, SOS, leading to Ras activation and Ras-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. In this regard, we determined that 14,15-EET-SI induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2. As shown in Fig. 8 A, both ERK1 and ERK2 were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after treatment with 20 Î¼m 14,15-EET-SI. To determine whether there was a role for the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in EET-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation, we utilized the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059 (23Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar,24Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.J. Guan K.L.

Pretreatment of the cells with PD98059 dose-dependently inhibited the 14,15-EET-SI-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation, with IC50 â¼5 Î¼m (Fig. 8 B). In other experiments, PD98059 also inhibited 11,12-EET-SI-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation (not shown). Further studies were undertaken to determine the mechanism by which 14,15-EET-SI increased tyrosine phosphorylation in LLCPKcl4 cells. Immunoblotting with antibodies against the specific pp60c-srcsubstrate, p120, indicated increased tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein within 1 min after 14,15-EET-SI addition (Fig. 9 A). In additional experiments, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody and immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the kinase catalytic region highly conserved in c-Src, c-Fyn, and c-Yes members of the Src kinase family. Immunoreactive c-Src, or Src-like kinases, were found to be associated with the EGF receptor within 1 min of 14,15-EET-SI administration to LLCPKcl4 cells (Fig. 9 B). In contrast, there was minimal, if any, association of Src-like kinases with the EGF receptor in the first 5 min after EGF addition (Fig. 9 B). To demonstrate 14,15-EET-SI stimulation of Src-like kinase activity and to further define the identity of the kinase involved, we utilized a specific monoclonal antibody to immunoprecipitate pp60c-src for an in vitro Src kinase activity assay. Within 1 min, 14,15-EET-SI increased Src kinase activity (Fig. 9 C). The stimulated enzymatic activity peaked at 45 min and was elevated for up to 1.5 h, confirming that pp60c-src kinase was activated in LLCPKcl4 cells by 14,15-EET-SI. Previous studies suggested that cP450 arachidonic acid metabolites were mitogens for both mesenchymal and epithelial cells (4Harris R.C. Homma T. Jacobson H.R. Capdevila J. J. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2323068097,We examined c-erbB3 and c-erbB4 mRNA expression in 47 primary breast cancer samples by simultaneous RTâPCR and have investigated correlations between these parameters and the expression of both ER and EGFR mRNA and protein as measured by RTâPCR and ICA and with Ki67 immunostaining. A direct association was found between c-erbB3 and c-erbB4 mRNA and ER marker status measured by either RTâPCR (c-erbB3 P=0.0003; c-erbB4 P=0.02) or ICA (c-erbB-3 P=0.002; c-erbB4 P=0.01). Inverse associations were seen between c-erbB3 and c-erbB4 mRNA marker status and EGFR membrane protein (c-erbB3: P=0.003; c-erbB4: P=0.003) and mRNA (c-erbB4: P=0.009) status. These associations were reinforced by Spearman Rank Correlation Tests. A significant relationship was seen between Ki67 and c-erbB4 mRNA status and level. Measurements of c-erbB3 protein levels in tumour samples removed from a further 89 patients of known response to endocrine therapy: (i) confirmed the relationship between c-erbB3 and ER and (ii) identified that patients whose ER positive tumours expressed high levels of c-erbB3 were most likely to benefit from endocrine measures. A non-significant trend was recorded between c-erbB3 levels and Ki67 immunostaining. These results clearly demonstrate that increased c-erbB3 and c-erbB4 expression appears to be associated with the prognostically-favourable ER phenotype.

Studying the role of TRAIL in apoptosis of keratinocytes, we detected TRAIL transcripts and protein in both normal human keratinocytes and transformed keratinocyte cell lines HaCaT and KB. Although normal keratinocytes were resistant to TRAIL, HaCaT and KB cells underwent apoptosis following TRAIL exposure. When HaCaT and KB cells were pretreated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), cells became resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. IL-1 significantly induced activation of the transcription factor NFÎºB in transformed keratinocytes. Moreover, the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which inhibits IL-1-induced NFÎºB activation, completely prevented the protective effect of IL-1. Thus, IL-1 appears to protect transformed keratinocytes from the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL via activation of NFÎºB. These data suggest that NFÎºB activation may protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis and indicate a TRAIL receptor-independent pathway, which allows cells to escape the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL. Because IL-1 is secreted by a variety of tumor cells and is also released by inflammatory cells participating in the tumor-host immune response, tumors under these conditions could become resistant to TRAIL.

The third receptor, designated DcR1 (decoy receptor 1), TRAIL-R3, or TRID (TRAIL receptor without an intracellular domain), binds TRAIL, but because of the lack of the intracellular death domain does not transduce the apoptotic signal. Thus, it was even proposed that DcR1 acts as an antagonizing decoy receptor inhibiting TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (8MacFarlane M. Ahmand M. Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Cohen G.M. Alnemri E.S.

DcR1 transcripts were detected in many normal human tissues but not in most cancer lines examined, it was, therefore, suggested that DcR1 expression may determine whether cells are susceptible or resistant to TRAIL (9Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M Gurney A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D. Ramakrishnan L. Gray C.L. Baker K. Wood W.I. Goddard A.D. Godowski P. Ashkenazi A.

However, the system appears to be more complex because recently a fourth member of the TRAIL receptor family was cloned, designated TRAIL-R4, DcR2, or TRUND (15Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1997; 7: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 16Pan G. Ni J., Yu, G. Wei Y-F. Dixit V.M.

Ashkenazi A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1003-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Although TRAIL-R4 binds TRAIL, it does not transmit the death signal, because it carries a cytoplasmic region lacking most of the death domain, which is crucial for the induction of apoptosis. Overexpression of TRAIL-R4 was even found to confer resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (15Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1997; 7: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 16Pan G. Ni J., Yu, G. Wei Y-F. Dixit V.M.

Ashkenazi A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1003-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Because of the existence of at least four different receptors with different signaling capacities, the TRAIL receptor family appears to represent a complex system that may contribute to whether a cell reacts to TRAIL with apoptosis or not (18Golstein P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 750-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the biological relevance of the complex TRAIL receptor system is not well understood and conflicting data exist (15Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1997; 7: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because of its preferential cytotoxicity for cancer cells, TRAIL is regarded as a promising anti-cancer drug that might be highly effective in vivo with few side effects as it has little or no lethal effect on normal cells.Apoptosis of keratinocytes has recently been identified as a crucial event during the development of skin cancer (19Kraemer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in studying whether TRAIL is involved in apoptosis of keratinocytes. Here, we show that both normal human keratinocytes (HNK) and transformed keratinocyte cell lines express TRAIL transcripts and synthesize TRAIL protein. Although normal keratinocytes were resistant to TRAIL, transformed keratinocytes underwent apoptosis following TRAIL exposure. Both HNK and transformed keratinocytes express transcripts for DR4, DR5, and TRAIL-R4, whereas DcR1 transcripts were only detected in normal but not in transformed keratinocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate that TRAIL-induced apoptosis of transformed keratinocytes can be blocked by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1). This inhibition appears to be mediated via nuclear factor-ÎºB (NFÎºB). Therefore, our data suggest that NFÎºB activation can protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis and indicate a TRAIL receptor-independent pathway that allows cells to escape the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL.DISCUSSIONAlthough a variety of tissues have been screened and were found to be positive for TRAIL expression (1Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1995; 3: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar), no data exist as to whether TRAIL is expressed in skin. Here, we show that both HNK and transformed keratinocyte cell lines express TRAIL at the mRNA and the protein levels. However, in their response to TRAIL, HNK and transformed keratinocytes differ significantly. In contrast to HNK, both KB and HaCaT cells undergo apoptosis following exposure to TRAIL. The reason why HNK do not respond to TRAIL remains to be determined. Detection of transcripts of the apoptosis preventing decoy receptor DcR1 in HNK but not in transformed keratinocytes might imply that the expression of DcR1 is responsible for the TRAIL resistance of HNK. Furthermore, transcripts of the antagonizing receptor TRAIL-R4 were found in HNK as well as in transformed keratinocytes, but the levels expressed were much higher in HNK as determined by semiquantitative PCR. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that TRAIL resistance of HNK is because of expression of the antagonizing receptors DcR1 and TRAIL-R4. However, one has to be cautious when predicting cell surface expression of receptor proteins from message levels (15Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1997; 7: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). At this point, it is only possible to detect surface expression of DR4 and DR5, because specific antibodies against DcR1 and TRAIL-R4, to the best of our knowledge, are not yet available. In addition, it seems that several cell lines expressing DcR1 appear to be susceptible to TRAIL (15Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1997; 7: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 33Griffith, T. S., Kubin, M. Z., Gliniak, B., Smith, C. A., Goodwin, R. G., Lynch, D. H., and Degli-Esposti, M. A. (1998) J. Immunol., in pressGoogle Scholar).To gain further insights into whether DcR1 is responsible for the TRAIL resistance of HNK, we treated HNK with phospholipase C. Phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol anchors, should remove DcR1 from the cell surface and render HNK susceptible to TRAIL if DcR1 is critical for TRAIL resistance, because DcR1 is a GPI-linked surface molecule. When evaluated in an apoptosis ELISA, both untreated and phospholipase C-pretreated HNK were equally resistant to TRAIL (data not shown). Thus, one could conclude that DcR1 is not important for the TRAIL resistance of HNK. However, these data must be interpreted with caution; we cannot formally prove if all DcR1 molecules were cleaved because of the lack of specific antibodies. Moreover, under these conditions, TRAIL-R4 could still protect HNK from TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, we observed that inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide renders HNK susceptible to TRAIL (data not shown). This might suggest that the production of anti-apoptotic molecules like Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or FLIP (34Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L. Schroter M. Burns K.

Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar) could be responsible for TRAIL resistance. The importance of protein synthesis for TRAIL resistance has also been found in other cell lines (33Griffith, T. S., Kubin, M. Z., Gliniak, B., Smith, C. A., Goodwin, R. G., Lynch, D. H., and Degli-Esposti, M. A. (1998) J. Immunol., in pressGoogle Scholar). However, this does not necessarily imply that TRAIL resistance is TRAIL receptor independent in general, as one cannot exclude much higher turnover rates of the antagonizing receptors, which would then require their constant production to confer resistance.The transcription factor NFÎºB was recently found to prevent TNF-induced apoptosis (28Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 29Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar, 30Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Therefore, the question arose whether NFÎºB activation can protect transformed keratinocytes from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. To address this issue, KB and HaCaT cells were stimulated with IL-1 which is a potent inducer of NFÎºB (30Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Indeed, pretreatment with IL-1Î² and IL-1Î±, respectively, rendered both KB and HaCaT cells resistant to TRAIL. The inhibitory effect of IL-1 was demonstrated by using several apoptosis read-out systems including annexin V staining (Fig. 6), cleavage of caspase 3 (Fig. 8), and apoptosis ELISA (data not shown).IL-1-induced protection against TRAIL appears to be mediated by NFÎºB. First, IL-1 activates NFÎºB in KB cells, as demonstrated by EMSA and IÎºB Western blots; second, the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which inhibits the activation of NFÎºB (32Traencker E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), prevents the protective effect of IL-1. Although we cannot exclude that MG132 may also affect some pathways other than NFÎºB, similar dose response studies for the inhibition of IL-1-induced NFÎºB activation (data not shown) and the inhibition of IL-1-induced TRAIL resistance by MG132 (Fig. 10) support the assumption that IL-1 induces TRAIL resistance via NFÎºB. This is also confirmed by the observation that phorbol myristate acetate, another potent inducer of NFÎºB (32Traencker E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), reduces TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of KB cells (data not shown). To provide full protection, NFÎºB needs to be activated before initiation of the apoptosis program by TRAIL. This was shown by kinetic studies in which addition of IL-1 to KB cells, which had already been exposed to TRAIL for 2 h or longer, could not induce resistance.Conflicting data exist as to whether triggering of the TRAIL receptors activates NFÎºB. Because transfection of DR4 in MCF7 cells did not lead to NFÎºB activation, Pan et al. (7Pan G. OâRourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1996; 276: 111-113Crossref Scopus (1546) Google Scholar) suggested that DR4 is not linked to NFÎºB. On the other hand, others have observed that transfecting cells with DR4 and DR5, respectively, induced NFÎºB activation (9Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M Gurney A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D.

Holler N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In addition, TRAIL-R4 was found to be capable of signaling NFÎºB activation, and it was proposed that it protects cells against the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL by this mechanism (15Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1997; 7: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Therefore we performed EMSA with KB cells that had been exposed to TRAIL. Although nuclear extracts were obtained at different time points after TRAIL stimulation ranging from 30 min to 16 h, none of the samples exhibited binding active NFÎºB (data not shown). These data suggest that TRAIL, in contrast to the findings with other cell types (9Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M Gurney A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D. Ramakrishnan L. Gray C.L. Baker K. Wood W.I. Goddard A.D. Godowski P. Ashkenazi A. Science. 1997; 277: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 37Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), does not activate NFÎºB in KB cells. Moreover, it is tempting to speculate that the failure to respond to TRAIL with NFÎºB activation might explain why KB cells are so sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL. Accordingly, Jeremias et al. (39Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Baumann B. Herr I. Wirth T. Debatin K.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 4624-4631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that inhibition of NFÎºB enhances sensitivity for induction of apoptosis of lymphoid cells by TRAIL.In summary, this study demonstrates that IL-1 can protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings may have important practical implications for the use of TRAIL as an anti-cancer drug. Because of the unique ability of inducing apoptosis preferentially in cancer but not in normal cells, TRAIL may be highly efficient in eradicating tumor cells in vivo. In contrast to conventional cytostatic drugs, TRAIL may exert only minimal side effects, because it has little lethal effect on normal cells. The reason for this selectivity of TRAIL remains unclear, however, differential expression of its multiple receptors by the respective cells may be of relevance but still needs to be formally proven. The present observation that transformed keratinocytes become resistant to TRAIL following IL-1 exposure is the first indication of a TRAIL receptor-independent pathway that allows cells to escape the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL. In addition, it suggests that IL-1-mediated activation of NFÎºB can protect cells from TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity. Tumors under these conditions could become resistant to TRAIL, because the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 is secreted by a variety of tumor cells (40Luger T.A. Schwarz T. Mukhtar H. Pharmacology of the Skin. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida1992: 283-313Google Scholar) and is also released by inflammatory cells participating in the tumor-host immune response (41Durum S.K. Oppenheim J.J. Neta R. Oppenheim J.J. Shevach E.M. Immunophysiology. The Role of Cells and Cytokines in Immunity and Inflammation. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 210-225Google Scholar). However, this effect may well be encountered when other cytokines or signals activate NFÎºB within this scenario; therefore, this pathway should be considered when applying TRAIL in vivo. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL),1 also called APO-2 ligand, is a recently identified member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family that was originally characterized by its ability to induce apoptosis (1Wiley S.R.

The third receptor, designated DcR1 (decoy receptor 1), TRAIL-R3, or TRID (TRAIL receptor without an intracellular domain), binds TRAIL, but because of the lack of the intracellular death domain does not transduce the apoptotic signal. Thus, it was even proposed that DcR1 acts as an antagonizing decoy receptor inhibiting TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (8MacFarlane M. Ahmand M. Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Cohen G.M. Alnemri E.S.

DcR1 transcripts were detected in many normal human tissues but not in most cancer lines examined, it was, therefore, suggested that DcR1 expression may determine whether cells are susceptible or resistant to TRAIL (9Sheridan J.P.

However, the system appears to be more complex because recently a fourth member of the TRAIL receptor family was cloned, designated TRAIL-R4, DcR2, or TRUND (15Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C.

Although TRAIL-R4 binds TRAIL, it does not transmit the death signal, because it carries a cytoplasmic region lacking most of the death domain, which is crucial for the induction of apoptosis. Overexpression of TRAIL-R4 was even found to confer resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (15Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh"
https://openalex.org/W2152945758,"The p53-null human lung cancer cell line H1299 was used in order to generate clones with ecdysone-inducible p53 as well as ecdysone-inducible p21waf1. Induced expression of p53 resulted in irreversible cell growth arrest with characteristics of replicative senescence, suggesting that p53 can prevent immortalization by activating a senescence program. The effect of induced p53 and p21waf1 expression on the cytotoxic action of the anti-cancer drugs etoposide and cisplatin was also analysed. Whereas p21waf1 overexpression conferred increased resistance to killing by either drug, p53 overexpression enhanced the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin but protected against etoposide cytotoxicity. These results imply that the impact of p53 on susceptibility to chemotherapy may depend greatly on the particular drug and type of DNA damage. Moreover, these data demonstrate the importance of using isogenic cell lines to address this issue."

The present study demonstrates that the ability of IL-4 to inhibit interferon Î³ (IFNÎ³)-dependent gene transcription is dependent upon STAT6. IL-4 suppressed IFNÎ³-induced expression of the MIG (monokine induced by IFNÎ³) gene, a C-X-C chemokine, in mouse macrophages. IFNÎ³-induced expression of MIG mRNA was abolished in peritoneal macrophages fromStat1â/â mice, and the suppression of MIG mRNA by IL-4 was abolished in macrophages from Stat6â/â mice. Transient transfection assays using a reporter gene containing the MIG gene promoter or the IFNÎ³-responsive element (Î³RE) from the MIG gene revealed that the IFNÎ³-dependent transcription was suppressed by IL-4, although IL-4 alone had no transactivating function. IFNÎ³ and IL-4 activated STAT1 and STAT6, respectively, and both proteins were able to bind the Î³RE motif. Furthermore, STAT6 was associated with the co-activator CREB-binding protein in RAW264.7 cells. These observations indicate that STAT6 is necessary for the IL-4-mediated suppression of IFNÎ³-induced, STAT1-dependent transcription and suggest that STAT6 may directly suppress the STAT1-dependent transcription by competing with STAT1 for occupancy of the Î³RE motif and/or by competing with limiting quantities of the transcriptional coactivator.

We have previously observed that IFNÎ³-mediated induction and IL-4-mediated suppression utilize the same regulatory sequences (the ISRE in the IP-10 gene and the GAS motif in the IRF-1 gene) (16Deng W. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2130-2136PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 157: 2058-2065Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-4 does not inhibit the activation of STAT1 by IFNÎ³ and IL-4-induced STAT6 is able to bind the IFNÎ³-responsive site without transactivation (40Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 157: 2058-2065Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that STAT1-dependent transcription requires transcriptional coactivators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), which may be present in limiting amounts (41Horvai A.E. Wu L. Korzus E. Brand G. Kalafus D. Mullen T. Rose D.W. Gosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 42Zhang J. Vinkemeier U.

On the basis of these lines of evidence, we postulated that the inhibitory effect of IL-4 may result, at least in part, from the direct action of IL-4-induced STAT6 on IFNÎ³-induced STAT1-dependent transcription. The present study was undertaken to determine if IL-4-induced STAT6 is required for the suppressive action of IL-4 on IFNÎ³-induced gene transcription and to extend our analysis to include the IFNÎ³-responsive element (Î³RE), which controls expression of the MIG chemokine gene (43Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 44Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), a third form of IFNÎ³-sensitive nucleotide regulatory motif. The results demonstrate that IL-4-dependent suppression of IFNÎ³-induced MIG gene expression is abolished in peritoneal macrophages from mice in which the STAT6 gene has been deleted (45Shimoda K. Deursen J.V. Sangster M.Y. Sarawar S.R. Carson R.T. Tripp R.A. Chu C. Quelle F.W. Nosaka T. Vignali D.A.A. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G. Paul W.E. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Both the MIG gene promoter and the Î³RE from the MIG promoter are sensitive to the stimulatory action of IFNÎ³ and the inhibitory effects of IL-4. Furthermore, we find that STAT6 as well as STAT1 can interact with the coactivator CBP. These results suggest that these two factors may compete for coactivator and/or occupancy of the Î³RE site with opposite functional consequences. Recombinant mouse IFNÎ³ and IL-4 were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), respectively.

Lowercase letters represent the mutant sequence, and the underlined sequence is the 5â²-half-site of the Î³RE. One copy of the Î³RE motif (sense strand: 5â²-gATCCCTTACTATAAACTCCCCGTTTATGTGAAATGGA-3â²) was placed in front of a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter (55McKnight S.L. Gavis E.R. Kingsbury R. Cell. 1981; 25: 385-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) linked to the luciferase gene (pTK-81Luc). The luciferase control plasmid under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was provided by Dr. G. Sen (Dept. of Molecular Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation). Luciferase reporter gene plasmids were transiently transfected into RAW264.7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (20Ohmori Y. Smith Jr., M.F. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2065-2958Google Scholar, 56Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6677-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 Î¼g of reporter plasmid DNA and 3 Î¼g of reference plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega) were transfected in the presence of DEAE-dextran (300 Î¼g/ml). To standardize transfection efficiencies, the transfected cells were harvested, pooled, and seeded in four 60-mm culture dishes. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with IFNÎ³ and/or IL-4 for 8 h prior to analysis of luciferase activity. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using reagents provided by Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty Î¼g of extract protein were utilized in each assay. Cultures of 6 Ã 107 RAW264.7 cells in 150-mm Petri dishes were treated as indicated in the text. After stimulation, RAW264.7 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and resuspended in Lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin) for 10 min on ice. After pre-clearing the lysate with normal rabbit IgG (Sigma) and Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), whole cell lysate (â¼500 Î¼g of protein) were incubated with anti-CBP (1 Î¼g) or normal rabbit IgG and protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) for 16 h at 4 Â°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot as descried previously (40Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 157: 2058-2065Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously using a modified method of Dignam et al. (20Ohmori Y. Smith Jr., M.F.

The following oligonucleotides were used in EMSA: Î³RE: 5â²-GATCCCTTACTATAAACTCCCCGTTTATGTGAAATGGA-3â²; mut5â²Î³RE: 5â²-GATCCCggAggATccACTCCCCGTTTATGTGAAATGGA-3â²; 5â²-half-site: 5â²-ATCCCTTACTATAAACTCCC-3â²; 3â²-half-site: 5â²-CCCCGTTTATGTGAAATGGA-3. For binding reactions, nuclear extracts (5 Î¼g of protein) were incubated in 12.5 Î¼l of total volume containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 200 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.25 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min at room temperature.32P-Labeled oligonucleotide (0.5 ng, 5 Ã 105 cpm) was then added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel with 0.25Ã TBE buffer (22.3 mm Tris, 22.2 mm borate, 0.5 mm EDTA). In some experiments, rabbit antibody to NFÎºB1 (p50), RelA (p65), STAT1, and STAT6 were added prior to electrophoresis. The dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography and by phosphorescence detection. IL-4 is known to suppress IFNÎ³-induced gene expression in mononuclear phagocytes (14Larner A.C. Petricoin E.F.

The MIG gene encodes a C-X-C Chemokine known to be transcriptionally regulated by IFNÎ³ (43Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine whether IL-4 can suppress MIG expression, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 15 min, followed by stimulation with different doses of IFNÎ³ for 4 h prior to preparation of total RNA and Northern hybridization analysis. IFNÎ³ induced and IL-4 suppressed levels of MIG mRNA (Fig. 1 A). IL-4 did not alter the kinetics of IFNÎ³-induced MIG mRNA expression but reduced the steady state mRNA levels over the entire time course (Fig. 1 B). Quantitatively and qualitatively similar effects of IFNÎ³ and IL-4 on MIG mRNA were seen in the macrophage-like cell lines RAW264.7 (Fig. 1 C) and ANA-1 (Fig. 1 D). The suppression by IL-4 was mediated predominantly by inhibiting transcription as assessed by nuclear run-on assay in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2).Figure 2IL-4 suppresses rate of the IFNÎ³-induced MIG transcription. RAW264.7 cells were untreated (UT) or pretreated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 15 min, followed by followed by stimulation with or without IFNÎ³ (100 units/ml) for 90 min prior to isolate nuclei.

To examine the role of IFNÎ³-induced STAT1 and IL-4-activated STAT6 in control of MIG expression, macrophages from Stat1â/â and Stat6â/â mice were used to measure each response (45Shimoda K.

As expected, IFNÎ³-induced MIG mRNA expression was completely abolished in peritoneal macrophages from Stat1â/â mice (Fig. 3 A) but remained intact in macrophages from Stat6â/â (Fig. 3 B). Whereas IFNÎ³-induced MIG mRNA was inhibited by IL-4 in wild type macrophages, the suppressive effect of IL-4 was entirely lost in macrophages from the Stat6â/â mice (Fig. 3, Band C). IFNÎ³-induced transcription of the MIG gene has been shown to depend upon the Î³RE motif located at positions â198 to â171 in the MIG promoter (44Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To determine whether the suppression of IFNÎ³-induced MIG gene expression by IL-4 is dependent upon the Î³RE motif, 328 nt of the 5â²-flanking sequence of the MIG gene were linked to the luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected into RAW264.7 cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cultures were stimulated with IFNÎ³ alone or in the presence of IL-4 for 8 h prior to analysis of luciferase activity. Although IL-4 alone had no effect on luciferase activity, reporter gene expression was markedly elevated in cells stimulated with IFNÎ³ (Fig. 4 A). IL-4 added along with IFNÎ³ suppressed the induced luciferase activity by approximately 50%. IL-4 did not modulate the luciferase activity from the cells transfected with cytomegalovirus promoter-driven luciferase construct (data not shown). To determine if the Î³RE motif of the MIG gene was the target site for IL-4, one copy of this motif was placed in front of the TK promoter (TK-81) linked to the luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4 B). As was observed for the natural MIG promoter, IFNÎ³ stimulated luciferase expression. IL-4 alone had no effect but suppressed the response to IFNÎ³ by approximately 50%. Luciferase activity from TK-81 alone was not affected by IFNÎ³ and/or IL-4 (data not shown). The promoter analysis of the MIG gene indicates that the Î³RE motif is essential for both the IFNÎ³-induced transcriptional activation of the MIG promoter and the suppressive effect of IL-4. Furthermore, STAT6 is required for the suppressive activity of IL-4. Since STAT1-dependent transcription has been demonstrated to require the presence of the coactivator p300 or CBP (41Horvai A.E. Wu L. Korzus E. Brand G. Kalafus D. Mullen T. Rose D.W. Gosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 42Zhang J.

A. 1996; 93: 15092-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that suppression might involve competition between STAT1 and STAT6 for limiting quantities of the coactivator. To explore this possibility, we assessed whether STAT6 can interact with CBP in vivo using a co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 5). Consistent with previous results (41Horvai A.E. Wu L. Korzus E. Brand G. Kalafus D. Mullen T. Rose D.W. Gosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar,42Zhang J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W.

The same CBP immunoprecipitates also contained STAT6 (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that STAT6 as well as STAT1 binds CBP and are consistent with the possibility that STAT6 may compete for coactivator CBP. An alternative possibility is that IL-4-induced STAT6 might compete for binding of STAT1 to the Î³RE motif. Since STAT6 can bind to a number of sequence motifs without transactivating function (20Ohmori Y. Smith Jr., M.F. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2065-2958Google Scholar, 38Seidel H.M."

In its active GTP-bound form, the Rap1 GTPase may act as a negative regulator of Ras-mediated signaling by sequestering Ras effectors (e.g., Raf-1) and preventing their activation. In this report, we show that BCR engagement activates Rap1 and that this is dependent on production of diacylglycerol (DAG) by phospholipase C-Î³. Activation of Rap1 by the BCR was greatly reduced in phospholipase C-Î³-deficient B cells, whereas both a synthetic DAG and phorbol dibutyrate could activate Rap1 in B cells. We had previously shown that C3G, an activator of Rap1, associates with the Crk adaptor proteins in B cells and that BCR engagement causes Crk to bind to the Cas and Cbl docking proteins. However, the DAG-dependent pathway by which the BCR activates Rap1 apparently does not involve Crk signaling complexes since phorbol dibutyrate could activate Rap1 without inducing the formation of these complexes. Thus, the BCR activates Rap1 via a novel DAG-dependent pathway.

The binding of antigens to the B cell antigen receptor (BCR)1 is essential for the generation of an antibody (Ab) response. BCR signaling activates resting B lymphocytes and, in the presence of T cell-derived costimulatory factors, drives B cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells (1Gold M. Matsuuchi L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 157: 181-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The BCR activates multiple signaling pathways, including those regulated by Ras, phospholipase C-Î³ (PLC-Î³), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase, Vav, and HS-1 (2DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Ras is a low molecular weight GTPase that acts as a molecular switch, cycling between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. GTP-bound Ras binds to and activates the Raf-1 kinase (3Avruch J. Zhang X.-f. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Raf-1 then initiates a kinase cascade that leads to activation of the ERK family of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Activated ERKs migrate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and activate transcription factors that belong to the TCF and ETS families (4Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The Ras/Raf-1/ERK pathway is also directly involved in cell cycle progression and has been shown to up-regulate the expression of cyclins D and E1 while down-regulating the expression of the p27Kip1 cell cycle inhibitor (5Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Other downstream effectors of activated Ras include PtdIns 3-kinase, RalA, and p120 RasGAP (6Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Clark R. Conroy L. Polakis P. Brown A.M. McCormick F. Science. 1992; 255: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Lipid second messengers produced by PtdIns 3-kinase activate Akt, a kinase involved in preventing apoptosis (9Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). The RalA GTPase may also be an important target of Ras since dominant-negative forms of RalA can suppress the ability of activated Ras to transform cells (7Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, Ras controls multiple pathways that promote cell growth and survival. Consistent with this idea, mutated forms of Ras that are constitutively active are potent transforming agents. These activated forms of Ras are found in a large fraction of human tumors (10Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar) and may be responsible for the uncontrolled proliferation of these cells.Given the importance of Ras as a mediator of proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis, it is crucial to understand how Ras-mediated signaling is regulated. The Rap1 GTPases may be negative regulators of Ras-mediated signaling. The two mammalian Rap1 proteins, Rap1A and Rap1B, are 97% identical at the level of their amino acid sequence and are closely related to Ras. Rap1A (also known as Krev-1) was first identified by its ability to reverse the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by an activated form of Ki-Ras (11Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Expression of activated Rap1 proteins also blocks the actions of Ras in Drosophila eye development and in the maturation of Xenopus oocytes (12Hariharan I.K. Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 717-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Campa M.J. Chang K.J. Molina V. Rep B.R. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results suggest that activation of the endogenous Rap1 proteins may be a way in which the magnitude or duration of Ras-mediated signaling is limited. However, little is known about the regulation of the endogenous Rap1 proteins. It is also not clear whether Rap1A and Rap1B have different functions; therefore, we will refer to them collectively as Rap1.Although the regulation of Rap1 is not well understood, there is considerable structural information indicating how Rap1 opposes the actions of Ras (14Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The effector binding domain of Rap1 is identical to that of Ras, suggesting that Rap1-GTP competes with Ras-GTP for downstream effectors. In vitro experiments have shown that Rap1-GTP binds to Raf-1 and other targets of Ras but does not activate them (7Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 14Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A.

Science. 1990; 249: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In vivo, Rap1 may also keep Ras effectors physically separated from Ras since Rap1 is located primarily on the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi apparatus (17Beranger F. Goud B. Tavitian A. de Gunzburg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1606-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), whereas Ras is at the inner face of the plasma membrane. Consistent with the idea that Rap1-GTP sequesters Ras effectors in inactive complexes, expressing constitutively active Rap1A in fibroblasts inhibits Ras-dependent activation of the ERK kinases (18Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).In addition to opposing the ability of Ras to stimulate proliferation, Rap1 may also activate a distinct signaling pathway that inhibits proliferation. Genetic analysis in Drosophila has shown that the dacapo gene product is a target of Rap1 (19de Nooij J.C. Letendre M.A. Hariharan I.K. Cell. 1996; 87: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Dacapo is a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor similar to p27Kip1 and blocks cell cycle progression duringDrosophila eye development.Previous work by our group and others suggested that the Rap1 proteins may be a target of BCR signaling. C3G, an exchange factor that activates Rap1A and Rap1B (20Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell.

In response to BCR engagement, the membrane-associated docking proteins p130Cas and p120Cbl are tyrosine phosphorylated, and the Crk proteins then use their SH2 domains to bind to them (22Ingham R.J.

Thus, BCR signaling may recruit CrkÂ·C3G complexes to the cellular membranes where Rap1 is located, allowing C3G to activate Rap1. In this report, we show that the BCR does indeed activate Rap1 but that this occurs via a novel PLC-Î³-dependent pathway, which may be independent of Crk and C3G.RESULTSRap1 opposes the actions of Ras and may therefore be a key regulator of cell growth. To determine whether the BCR activates Rap1, we used a novel assay for Rap1 activation developed by Franke et al. (29Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the observation that the RalGDS protein has high affinity for active Rap1-GTP but does not bind the inactive GDP-bound form of Rap1 (30Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, we used a GST fusion protein containing the RBD of RalGDS to selectively precipitate activated Rap1. The recovery of activated Rap1 was monitored by immunoblotting with an anti-Rap1 Ab, which recognizes both Rap1A and Rap1B.Using this assay, we found that initiating BCR signaling with anti-IgM Abs increased the amount of activated Rap1 in WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells (Fig. 1 A). An increase in the amount of activated Rap1 was seen at 15 s after adding anti-IgM to the cells. This BCR-induced Rap1 activation was maximal at 2â15 min and persisted for at least 60 min. Several controls were done to confirm that the 23-kDa band detected by anti-Rap1 immunoblotting was activated Rap1 and not an artifact (Fig. 1 B). First, the band detected in WEHI-231 cell lysates had the same electrophoretic mobility as activated Rap1 precipitated from thrombin-stimulated platelets. Rap1 is highly expressed in platelets, and thrombin causes strong activation of Rap1 in these cells (29Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Second, the protein detected by the anti-Rap1 Ab was not precipitated by an irrelevant GST fusion protein containing the Crk SH2 domain. Finally, adding anti-IgM to WEHI-231 cells after they had been solubilized with Nonidet P-40 did not increase the intensity of the band detected in this assay. This shows that intact cells were necessary for this response and that the band detected by anti-Rap1 immunoblotting was not the 25-kDa Ig light chain of either the cells' BCR or the stimulating Ab. Together, these controls support the conclusion that BCR engagement activates Rap1.BCR signaling regulates multiple steps in B cell development and differentiation, influencing the survival and activation of pre-B cells, immature B cells, mature B cells, and memory B cells (1Gold M. Matsuuchi L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 157: 181-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether BCR ligation activates Rap1 in cell lines corresponding to different stages of B cell development (Fig. 1 C). BCR ligation increased the amount of activated Rap1 in the immature IgM+ WEHI-231 murine B cell line, the mature IgM+ BAL17 murine B cell line, and the IgG+ A20 murine cell line. A20 is thought to resemble a memory B cell. BCR-induced Rap1 activation was also observed in mature resting B cells isolated from mouse spleen (Fig. 2 A), indicating that this response is not restricted to transformed B cell lines. Finally, we showed that BCR ligation-activated Rap1 not only in mouse cells but also in the DT40 chicken B cell line (Fig. 2 C) and the RAMOS human B cell line (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, BCR-induced activation of Rap1 is a consistent feature of B cells.Figure 2Rap1 is activated in B cells by PdBu and diC8 but not by ionomycin. Rap1 activation assays were performed on the indicated cell lysates. A, murine splenic B cells were left untreated (â) or incubated for 5 min with 50 Î¼g/ml anti-IgM Abs, 30 Î¼g/ml anti-Îº light chain Abs, 100 nmPdBu, or 500 nm ionomycin. B, WEHI-231 cells were left untreated (â) or incubated for 5 min with 100 Î¼g/ml anti-IgM, 10 or 100 nm PdBu, 500 nm ionomycin, or a combination of 100 nm PdBu and 500 nmionomycin. C, DT40 cells were left untreated (â) or incubated for 5 min with 50 Î¼g/ml anti-IgM, 100 nm PdBu, or the indicated concentrations of ionomycin.

Our previous work had suggested that CrkÂ·C3G complexes might be involved in this process. In B cells, we showed that the Crk adaptor proteins constitutively bind C3G (22Ingham R.J. Krebs D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32306-32314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a nucleotide exchange factor that can activate Rap1 (20Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). BCR ligation causes Crk to bind via its SH2 domain to two membrane-associated docking proteins, p130Cas and p120Cbl, both of which are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to BCR engagement (22Ingham R.J. Krebs D.L. Barbazuk S.M. Turck C.W. Hirai H. Matsuda M. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32306-32314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, BCR ligation may recruit CrkÂ·C3G complexes to cellular membranes where Rap1 is located, allowing C3G to activate Rap1. Recently, Franke et al. (29Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) showed that there is another mechanism for receptor-induced activation of Rap1. They found that increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+concentrations could activate Rap1 in platelets and that this was required for activation of Rap1 by thrombin in these cells. Since the BCR activates PLC-Î³, which results in the production of IP3 and subsequent increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, the BCR could activate Rap1 either via a Ca2+-dependent pathway or via the binding of CrkÂ·C3G complexes to tyrosine-phosphorylated docking proteins.To distinguish between these two possibilities, we first asked whether the Ca2+-dependent pathway for Rap1 activation is present in B cells. We used the Ca2+-selective ionophore ionomycin to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels in murine splenic B cells and in B cell lines. We found that ionomycin concentrations (250â500 nm) that cause similar increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels as do BCR stimulation (31Page D.M. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3717-3726PubMed Google Scholar) did not activate Rap1 to a significant extent (Fig. 2, AâD). Summed over eight experiments, the amount of activated Rap1 in unstimulated cells was 19.9 Â± 13.9% of that in anti-IgM-stimulated cells, whereas the amount of activated Rap1 in cells stimulated with 500 nm ionomycin was 14.4 Â± 8.1% of that in anti-IgM-stimulated cells. Thus, in most experiments the amount of activated Rap1 in ionomycin-treated cells was not significantly different than that in untreated cells. Higher concentrations of ionomycin (1 Î¼m), which cause larger increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, also failed to activate Rap1 in B cells. 2S. J. McLeod and M. R. Gold, unpublished observations.Although the Ca2+-dependent pathway for Rap1 activation seems not to be significant in B cells, we found that the other PLC-Î³-derived second messenger, diacylglycerol (DAG), could activate Rap1 in B cells. PdBu, a phorbol ester that mimics the action of DAG, caused strong activation of Rap1 in murine splenic B cells, the WEHI-231 murine B cell line, the DT40 chicken B cell line, and the RAMOS human B cell line (Fig. 2, AâF). The kinetics of PdBu-induced Rap1 activation (Fig. 2 G) were similar to that for anti-IgM-induced Rap1 activation (Fig. 1A). A synthetic DAG, diC8, also caused strong activation of Rap1 in WEHI-231 cells,2 RAMOS cells (Fig. 2 E), and DT40 cells (Fig. 2 F). Thus, a DAG-dependent pathway for Rap1 activation is present in B cells. This, together with the rapid kinetics of PdBu-induced Rap1 activation, suggested that the BCR may activate Rap1 via this DAG-dependent pathway.To test whether the BCR activated Rap1 via this DAG-dependent pathway, we made use of several variants of the DT40 chicken B cell line. To determine whether activation of Rap1 by the BCR is dependent on the generation of PLC-derived second messengers, we asked whether the BCR could activate Rap1 in a variant of the DT40 chicken B cell line in which the genes encoding PLC-Î³2 have been disrupted (25Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Since these cells do not express PLC-Î³1, they are unable to produce IP3 or DAG in response to BCR ligation (25Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We found that BCR-induced activation of Rap1 was dramatically reduced in the PLC-Î³-deficient DT40 cells as compared with wild-type DT40 cells (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, PdBu caused strong activation of Rap1 in both the wild-type and PLC-Î³-deficient DT40 cells, indicating that Rap1 could still be activated in the PLC-Î³-deficient DT40 cells. Thus, PLC-Î³ expression, and presumably activation, is required for the BCR to activate Rap1.Figure 3Activation of Rap1 by the BCR requires PLC-Î³ but does not involve IP3 receptor-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+. Rap1 activation assays were performed on cell lysates. A, wild-type (wt) and PLC-Î³-deficient DT40 B cells were left untreated (â) or incubated for 5 min with 50 Î¼g/ml anti-IgM or 100 nm PdBu.B, Wild-type (wt) and IP3 receptor-deficient (IP3R â/â) DT40 B cells were left untreated (â) or incubated for 5 min with 50 Î¼g/ml anti-IgM or 100 nmPdBu. Molecular mass standards (in kDa) are indicated to theleft of each panel. The experiments shown in each panel were performed three times, and similar results were obtained each time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since activation of PLC-Î³ is necessary for the majority of BCR-induced Rap1 activation (Fig. 3 A) and both PdBu and diC8 can activate Rap1 (Fig. 2), it strongly suggests that the BCR activates Rap1 via a DAG-dependent pathway. To confirm that activation of Rap1 by the BCR does not require increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in addition to DAG production, we asked whether the BCR could activate Rap1 in a variant of the DT40 cell line in which the genes encoding all three IP3 receptors have been disrupted (26Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The IP3receptors are responsible for the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores in response to IP3, and in these IP3 receptor-deficient DT40 cells, there is no increase in intracellular Ca2+ following BCR engagement (26Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We found that BCR ligation caused strong activation of Rap1 in the IP3 receptor-deficient DT40 cells (Fig. 3 B) and that the extent of Rap1 activation in these cells was similar to that caused by engaging the BCR on wild-type DT40 cells. This suggests that DAG production is sufficient to induce maximal activation of Rap1. Consistent with this idea, we found that increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations with ionomycin did not potentiate the ability of PdBu to activate Rap1 (Fig. 2 B). In sum, these data argue that increases in intracellular Ca2+ are neither necessary nor sufficient for activation of Rap1 by the BCR.The ability of PdBu and diC8 to activate Rap1 indicates that a novel DAG-dependent pathway for Rap1 activation exists in B cells. Our previous work had suggested that the BCR might activate Rap1 by recruiting CrkÂ·C3G complexes to cellular membranes where Rap1 is located. In this model, translocation of CrkÂ·C3G complexes to cellular membranes was mediated by the binding of the Crk SH2 domain to membrane-associated docking proteins (e.g., p120Cbl, p130Cas) that are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to BCR ligation. To determine whether the formation of these Crk complexes is involved in the DAG-dependent activation of Rap1, we investigated whether PdBu induced CrkL, the most abundant form of Crk in B cells, to associate with Cbl or Cas. Fig. 4 A shows that BCR ligation caused CrkL to associate with 120- to 130-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in RAMOS cells but that PdBu treatment did not. Immunoblotting with specific Abs confirmed that PdBu treatment did not cause CrkL to associate with Cas (Fig. 4 B) or Cbl (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the binding of CrkÂ·C3G complexes to tyrosine-phosphorylated docking proteins is not necessary for PdBu-induced activation of Rap1. Moreover, the formation of these Cbl/CasÂ·CrkÂ·C3G complexes is not sufficient for BCR-induced Rap1 activation. There was very little BCR-induced Rap1 activation in PLC-Î³-deficient DT40 cells (Fig. 3 A), even though BCR ligation caused CrkL to associate with 120â130-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in these cells to the same degree as in wild-type DT40 cells (Fig. 4 D). Thus, the BCR seems to activate Rap1 primarily via a DAG-dependent pathway that does not require the interaction of Crk proteins with membrane-associated docking proteins.Figure 4Association of Crk complexes with Cas and Cbl is not necessary for activation of Rap1 by the BCR. AâC, RAMOS cells were left untreated (â) or incubated for 2 min with 100 Î¼g/ml anti-IgM or 100 nm PdBu. Cell lysates were precipitated with an anti-CrkL Ab, and precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-P-Tyr) monoclonal Ab (A), anti-Cas Abs (B), or anti-Cbl Abs (C). D, Wild-type (wt) and PLC-Î³-deficient (PLC-Î³ â/â) DT40 cells were left untreated (â) or incubated for 2 min with 50 Î¼g/ml anti-IgM. Cell lysates were precipitated with an anti-CrkL Ab, and precipitated proteins were analyzed by anti-P-Tyr immunoblotting. Molecular mass standards (in kDa) are indicated to the left of each panel.

Using an assay that allows us to selectively precipitate the activated GTP-bound form of Rap1, we have shown that engaging the BCR activates Rap1 in normal B cells and in a variety of B cell lines. Moreover, our data suggest that BCR-induced Rap1 activation proceeds via a novel DAG-dependent pathway.At present, the only other example of receptor-induced activation of Rap1 is in platelets, where various platelet agonists including thrombin can activate Rap1 (29Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In this system, increases in intracellular free Ca2+ levels are both necessary and sufficient for activation of Rap1. Although BCR-induced Rap1 activation required PLC-Î³, experiments using IP3 receptor-deficient DT40 cells showed that increases in intracellular free Ca2+were not required for the BCR to activate Rap1. Moreover, Ca2+ ionophores could not stimulate Rap1 activation to the same extent as anti-IgM Abs, indicating that increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations cannot account for BCR-induced Rap1 activation. This suggested that the other PLC-Î³-derived second messenger, DAG, might be involved in activation of Rap1 by the BCR. Indeed, the synthetic DAG diC8 as well as PdBu, which mimics the action of DAG, caused strong activation of Rap1 in murine, human, and chicken B cells. These results are consistent with the idea that the BCR activates Rap1 via a DAG-dependent pathway.The components of this novel signaling pathway that link DAG to Rap1 activation in B cells are not known. We are currently addressing whether activation of protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes by DAG is involved in this process. In preliminary experiments, we found that BCR-induced Rap1 activation was significantly inhibited by one PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine chloride, whereas another PKC inhibitor Ro31â8220 had only marginal effects.2 Further work is needed to determine whether these results reflect nonspecific effects of chelerythrine chloride or the involvement of a PKC isoform that is inhibited to a greater degree by chelerythrine chloride than by Ro31â8220. Down-regulating PKC by treating B cells overnight with PdBu resulted in a higher basal level of activated Rap1 in the cells but abolished any further increase in Rap1 activation due to BCR ligation.2Although this supports the idea that PKC enzymes are involved in BCR-induced activation of Rap1, additional studies are necessary.We also do not know whether the ultimate target of this DAG-dependent Rap1 activation pathway is a Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor or a Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP). An increase in the amount of activated Rap1 could be due to an increase in the rate at which exchange factors activate Rap1 or to a decrease in the rate at which Rap1 GAPs stimulate hydrolysis of the GTP bound to Rap1. There are likely to be multiple Rap1 exchange factors and Rap1 GAPs. In addition to C3G, Bos and colleagues have recently identified several novel Rap1 exchange proteins. 3J. L. Bos, unpublished observations. Similarly, three Rap1-GAPs have been identified, SPA-1, RapGAP1, and tuberin (32Kurachi H. Wada Y. Tsukamoto N. Maeda M. Kubota H. Hattori M. Iwai K. Minato N. J. Biol.

LR1 was first identified as an activity that binds duplex sites in the immunoglobulin heavy chain switch regions (1Williams M. Maizels N.

These polypeptides derive from mRNAs that are related by alternative splicing of two coding exons, exon 2 and exon 7 (16Kajita Y. Nakayama J. Aizawa M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol.

These domains are typical of proteins that bind RNA, not duplex DNA. Nonetheless, LR1 binds with high affinity (K D = 1.8 nm) and clear sequence specificity to duplex DNA. Our results therefore demonstrate that two RBD proteins can interact to form a factor that interacts tightly and specifically with duplex DNA. The SÎ³1 duplex was formed by annealing top strand synthetic oligonucleotide, d(GATCCTCCTGGGTCAAGGCTGAATAGACGCAGGGGA), with bottom strand oligonucleotide, d(GATCTCCCCTGCGTCTATTCAGCCTTGACCCAGGAG), and labeled by filling with Klenow polymerase, as described previously (1Williams M.

Mutant duplexes were synthesized in which A, I, or 2-aminopurine was substituted at the underlined Gs in the top strand; the underlined G nearest the 5â² end is referred to as G8 and the other as G14. Mutant top strands containing inosine or 2-aminopurine substitutions were annealed to the bottom strand shown above, and mutant top strands containing substitutions of A were annealed to bottom strands carrying T at the complementary position.

Dissociation constants were determined by gel mobility shift assays carried out in the absence of competitor DNA and in the presence of highly purified LR1 at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 nm. Protein-DNA complex formation was quantitated by phosphoimager analysis of the dried gels, and K Dvalues were calculated by plotting the fraction of bound DNA at each protein concentration and extrapolating to 50% binding. ReportedK D values are averages from at least three separate experiments. Apparent K D values were unaffected by changes in DNA concentration. LR1 was purified from 40 liters of PD31 murine pre-B cells (60 Ã 1010 cells) cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 Î¼mÎ²-mercaptoethanol. During purification, LR1 binding to two diagnostic duplex sites was assayed, the wild-type SÎ³1 duplex and the G14A mutant duplex. Binding to G14A is reduced about 13-fold relative to SÎ³1 binding (Ref. 1Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). All purification steps were carried out at 4 Â°C, and extracts and fractions were stored at â70 Â°C. All buffer solutions contained 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin to inhibit proteases. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (1Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), except that cells were lysed at 4 Â°C in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmDTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm EGTA (22Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Nuclei were pelleted, and extraction was carried out in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 m KCl, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol (3 ml/109 cells for extraction) by gentle rocking at 4 Â°C for 45 min. Pilot experiments showed that inclusion of chelating agents increased recovery of LR1 binding activity from 2- to 4-fold. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 45 min (17,400 Ãg). Nuclear extract was dialyzed in buffer S (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.1 m KCl, then fractionated on a heparin Hi-Trap FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted using a linear 0.1â1.0m KCl gradient, and fractions containing LR1 DNA binding activity (0.22â0.30 m KCl) were pooled and diluted in buffer S to a final salt concentration of 0.15 m KCl. LR1 was then enriched by oligonucleotide capture affinity chromatography (23HagenbuÌchle O. Wellauer P.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3555-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein was incubated with 5 Î¼g/ml biotinylated SÎ³1 duplex oligonucleotide and 15 Î¼g/ml poly(dI-dC) competitor DNA for 1 h at 4 Â°C, the reaction was loaded onto a 3-ml streptavidin-agarose column pre-equilibrated with buffer S containing 0.15 m KCl, and the column was then washed sequentially with 5 column volumes of buffer S, 0.15 m KCl, and 15 Î¼g/ml poly(dI-dC), 5 volumes of buffer S containing 0.15m KCl and no DNA, and 3 volumes of buffer S containing 0.25m KCl. After these washes, LR1 binding activity was eluted in 2 volumes buffer S containing 0.6 m NaCl. Active binding fractions were diluted to 50 mm NaCl in buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q FPLC-column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Mono Q flow-through was collected, then the column was washed in buffer C containing 50 mm NaCl and eluted using a 25-ml 0.05â1.0 mNaCl gradient in the same buffer. Most LR1 binding activity (80%) flowed through Mono Q; about 20% bound the column and eluted at 0.2â0.3 m NaCl. By immunoblotting and assays of binding inhibition and specificity, the Mono Q bound, and flow-through fractions appeared to contain identical polypeptides, and we suspect that differential modification may account for the apparent bifurcation of binding activity. LR1 was further purified from the Mono Q flow-through fractions by Mono S chromatography, carried out just as described above for Mono Q chromatography. The majority of LR1 activity eluted from Mono S at 0.26â0.4 m NaCl. Fractions that were active in DNA binding activity were pooled and fractionated by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the 45-kDa band was submitted for sequence analysis at the Keck Biotechnology Resources Center, Yale University School of Medicine. Starting with 600 mg of nuclear extract (as determined by Bradford protein microassay), we obtained approximately 50 Î¼g of purified protein (as determined by mass spectroscopy). The overall purification achieved was therefore estimated to be approximately 12,000-fold. His6-tagged recombinant hnRNP D was produced by cloning a murine Hnrpd cDNANcoI-NotI fragment from the pBluescript vector (17Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. DePace A. Bray-Ward P. Maizels N. Genomics. 1998; 49: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) into the pET30A(+) (Novagen) bacterial expression vector. This fusion deleted a 31-residue N-terminal region rich in alanine (9/31 residues) and glycine (6/31 residues), leaving the 2 RBD domains and C-terminal RGG motifs intact. His6-tagged hnRNP D was expressed and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography (Novagen). The yield of recombinant protein recovered was typically 2â5% total bacterial protein. Concentration of purified recombinant protein was determined by Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad). The N terminus of nucleolin contains long acid regions interspersed with clusters of basic amino acids and cannot be expressed in E. coli. A truncated version of nucleolin lacking amino acids 1â283 but containing all 4 RBDs and the RGG repeats was expressed from the pMalNuc construct as a chimera fused at its N terminus to E. coli maltose binding protein (MBP). The MBP-nucleolin chimera was then purified as described previously (10Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Anti-hnRNP D antibodies were raised against peptide CYGKVSRRGGHQNSYKPY, which corresponds to the C terminus of hnRNP D, and peptides CSPRHSEAATAQRE and CGPSQNWNQGYSN, which correspond to sequences encoded by hnRNP D alternative exons 2 and 7, respectively (17Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. DePace A. Bray-Ward P. Maizels N. Genomics. 1998; 49: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized at the W. H. Keck facility (Yale University School of Medicine) and coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions; coupling efficiency was greater than 85% as estimated by measuring the free sulfhydryl concentration with Ellman's reagent (Pierce). The keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.9 m NaCl. Rabbits were immunized, boosted once 3 weeks later and at 2 week intervals thereafter with 100 Î¼g/injection. The anti-hnRNP D exon 2 and exon 7 antibodies were affinity-purified on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and passed over poly(G)-agarose (Sigma) to remove nonspecific DNA binding activities. Anti-C-terminal antibodies were passed over poly(G)-agarose but not protein A-purified. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against amino acids 284â709 of nucleolin have been previously described (10Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For immunoblots, 50 ng of purified recombinant hnRNP D (each isoform) was resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. Blots were blocked in 3% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), washed with TBST 4 times, 15 min/wash, and probed with anti-hnRNP D antisera at 1:2000 dilution. Antibody was detected with Amersham ECL kits using a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit-Ig antibody in TBST. LR1 was purified 12,000-fold from nuclear extract of PD31 pre-B cells by four chromatographic steps: heparin agarose, oligonucleotide capture, Mono Q, and Mono S. Using the highly purified LR1 preparation, we determined the specificity of the LR1/DNA interaction by measuring the dissociation constants of LR1 binding to a panel of DNA duplexes containing single base substitutions. Mutations at most positions in the LR1 SÎ³1 site, GGTCAAGGCTGAATA, do not affect LR1 binding, but mutation of either of the two underlined G residues to A diminishes binding significantly (1Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). By substitution of inosine and 2-aminopurine for critical guanines, it is possible to distinguish major groove contacts (identical for guanine and inosine) and minor groove contacts (identical for guanine and 2-aminopurine). The underlined G residues were therefore replaced with inosine or 2-aminopurine, and dissociation constants of LR1 binding to labeled synthetic duplexes were analyzed by gel mobility shift. An example of a set of binding reactions used in this analysis is shown in Fig. 2 A. Dissociation constants were calculated as described under âExperimental Procedures,â assuming that the stoichiometry of binding was 1:1 (LR1 heterodimer:DNA). The results of these experiments showed that LR1 bound the SÎ³1 duplex site with K D = 1.8 nm (Fig. 2 B). Binding was not affected by substitution of inosine at G8 or 2-aminopurine at G14. Binding was diminished 4-fold by substitution of 2-aminopurine at G8 and 7.5-fold by substitution of inosine at G14. LR1 therefore contacts the major groove at G8, where it interacts with the O6 of guanine, and the minor groove at G14, where it interacts with the N2 of guanine. The minor groove interaction would also be available if a C-G pair replaced a G-C pair, consistent with the presence of C at this position in one LR1 site in the Epstein-Barr virus F promoter (3Bulfone-Paus S. Dempsey L.A. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8293-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As the major and minor groove contacts are separated by 6 base pairs, the critical DNA contacts for LR1 appear to lie on a single face of the DNA duplex (Fig. 2 C). The 45-kDa polypeptide of LR1 was submitted to the W. H. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center for sequence analysis, and two tryptic peptides were sequenced. The molecular mass of the larger was 1494 daltons, and its sequence was IFVGGLSPDTPEEK. The molecular mass of the smaller was 1335 daltons, and its sequence was XGGHQNSYKPY. The identification of this subunit of LR1 as hnRNP D is consistent with the size of hnRNP D, approximately 45 kDa (11PinÌol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 12Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3519-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The first position of the latter peptide (indicated as X) could not be determined unambiguously, but if dimethylated arginine were present at this position, the predicted molecular mass of the polypeptide, 1335 daltons, would be identical to the experimentally determined molecular mass. The hnRNP proteins contain dimethylarginine (21Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and (m,mR)GGHQNSYKPY is therefore predicted to be the N-terminal residue of this peptide. To verify that hnRNP D is a component of LR1, we asked if anti-hnRNP D antibodies recognized purified LR1. The monoclonal anti-hnRNP D antibody 5B9 (generously provided by Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss, University of Pennsylvania) recognized the 42â45-kDa polypeptides in the highly purified LR1 preparation, as assayed by immunoblotting (data not shown). We raised antibodies against a synthetic peptide bearing the C-terminal sequence of hnRNP D, demonstrated that these antibodies were active in immunoblots (not shown), and then assayed the ability of these antibodies to recognize LR1 DNA binding activity. Gel mobility shift analysis showed that the anti-hnRNP D C-terminal immune serum recognized the LR1Â·DNA complex and retarded the mobility of the shifted band (Fig. 3). Pre-immune serum had no effect nor did pre-immune or immune serum alter the mobility of DNA in the absence of LR1. Three distinct classes of hnRNP D cDNA clones can be found in a murine pre-B cell library, and they result from alternative splicing (16Kajita Y. Nakayama J. Aizawa M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22167-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. DePace A. Bray-Ward P. Maizels N. Genomics. 1998; 49: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One class of cDNA contains exon 2, another contains exon 7, and the third class contains both alternative exons. These three different cDNA classes correspond to three alternatively processed mRNAs that could encode distinct protein isoforms (Fig. 1). To determine which isoform or isoforms of hnRNP D is present in LR1, we raised antibodies against synthetic peptides representing sequences from exon 2 and exon 7 of hnRNP D. We verified the specificity of these antibodies by immunoblotting all three isoforms of recombinant hnRNP D, hnRNP D-M20, hnRNP D-M27, and hnRNP D-M07. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the anti-exon 2 antibodies recognize isoforms hnRNP D-M20 and hnRNP D-M27, which contain sequences encoded by exon 2, but they do not recognize hnRNP D-M07. Furthermore, the anti-exon 7 antibodies recognize isoforms hnRNP D-M27 and hnRNP D-M07, which contain sequences encoded by exon 7, but they do not recognize hnRNP D-M20. The antibodies are therefore specific. The exon-specific antibodies were then tested for recognition of LR1 duplex DNA binding activity. Anti-exon 2 pre-immune serum did not affect the bound complex nor did the immune serum react with DNA in the absence of protein, but the anti-exon 2 antibodies completely inhibited LR1 DNA binding (Fig. 4 B). The inhibition of binding observed with anti-exon 2 antibodies contrasted with the supershift evident when LR1 was treated with anti-hnRNP D C-terminal antibodies, suggesting that sequences encoded by exon 2 may be in or near the duplex DNA binding domain. We have previously reported that treatment of LR1 with anti-nucleolin antibodies neither inhibited binding nor resulted in a supershift; instead, the antibodies produced a characteristic âsubshiftedâ band (10Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We initially interpreted the subshift as resulting from specific depletion of one component, nucleolin, from the binding complex, leaving the other component in contact with the DNA. We established that hnRNP D is indeed in the subshifted complex by treating purified LR1 with anti-nucleolin antibodies alone or with both anti-nucleolin antibodies and antibodies raised against exon 2 sequences. The anti-nucleolin antibodies produced the characteristic subshift, as previously reported (10Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the anti-exon 2 antibodies disrupted the subshift (Fig. 4 B). These results provide further evidence that the isoform of hnRNP D in LR1 contains sequences encoded by alternative exon 2. Analogous experiments were carried out to test the effect of the anti-exon 7 antibodies on LR1 duplex DNA binding activity. These antibodies had no effect on LR1 DNA binding activity, either alone or in the presence of the anti-nucleolin antibody (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, the results in Fig. 4 show that the 45-kDa component of the LR1 heterodimer is a specific isoform of hnRNP D, which contains sequences encoded by exon 2. These results also strongly suggest that the isoform of hnRNP D in LR1 does not contain sequences encoded by exon 7. Although it is in principle possible that exon 7 sequences may be present in the LR1 heterodimer but not accessible to or reactive with the antibody, additional experiments described below argue against this possibility. We tested the ability of each of the isoforms of hnRNP D to combine with recombinant MBP-nucleolin and reconstitute LR1 duplex DNA binding activity. We found that LR1 binding activity could not be reconstituted from recombinant protein expressed in E. coli (Fig. 5 A). This may reflect a requirement for phosphorylation that has been documented in previous experiments (1Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), for other modifications, including dimethylarginylation (20Lischwe M.A. Cook R.G. Ahn Y.S. Yeoman L.C. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6025-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and/or for the presence of the N-terminal region of nucleolin, which cannot be expressed in E. coliand was therefore not included in the MBP-nucleolin expression construct. Surprisingly, however, when we tested the effect of adding each of the three isoforms of recombinant hnRNP D to highly purified preparations of LR1, we found that either hnRNP D-M07 or hnRNP D-M27 diminished LR1 duplex binding activity (Fig. 5 B). Essentially complete inhibition of binding was observed in reactions containing 200 nm recombinant hnRNP D-M07 or hnRNP D-M27 (approximately 10-fold molar excess relative to purified LR1). Control experiments (not shown) established that these recombinant protein preparations were all able to bind to the mammalian telomeric repeat sequence d(TTAGGG)4 (16Kajita Y. Nakayama J. Aizawa M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22167-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), ruling out trivial explanations for inhibition of binding by hnRNP D-M07 or M27. The observed inhibition of LR1 duplex binding activity is specific for hnRNP D isoforms containing the tyrosine-rich 49-amino acid domain encoded by exon 7. The region encoded by hnRNP D exon 7 therefore exerts a dominant negative effect on LR1 duplex DNA binding activity. These results further establish that the 45-kDa subunit of LR1 is the specific isoform of hnRNP D, which contains exon 2 but not exon 7 sequences. They also raise the possibility that LR1 DNA binding activity in vivo may be controlled not only by cell type-specific modification of the polypeptide components of LR1 but also by regulation of the relative levels of the hnRNP D isoforms. LR1 is a sequence-specific duplex DNA-binding protein with an unusual composition. It is a heterodimer of nucleolin and hnRNP D. Both nucleolin and hnRNP D contain structural and sequence motifs frequently found in eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins, including RBD structural domains and RGG sequence repeats, but neither contains motifs common to duplex DNA-binding proteins. Nonetheless, LR1 binds duplex DNA tightly. The dissociation constant of LR1 binding to one of its sites in the SÎ³1 switch region is 1.8 nm. This represents a high affinity interaction between a eukaryotic DNA-binding protein and its duplex DNA site. Like other sequence-specific duplex DNA-binding proteins, LR1 probes the DNA sequence to recognize its binding sites. LR1 recognizes specific functional groups at two positions in the DNA duplex, a guanine O6 in the major groove, and an N2 provided by either G or C in the minor groove. These major and minor groove contacts are separated by 6 base pairs, and LR1 interaction therefore involves a single face of the DNA duplex. We have previously shown that treatment of an LR1 binding reaction with anti-nucleolin antibodies neither inhibited binding nor resulted in a supershifted complex upon gel electrophoresis but produced an unusual subshifted complex of increased mobility (10Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A subshift was also observed upon treatment of the small nuclear RNA promoter proximal sequence element bound to a complex called SNAPc with anti-TBP antibodies (24Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When the LR1 subshift was initially observed, we interpreted it to result from DNA binding by the other polypeptide in the LR1 heterodimer. We have now shown that the subshift does indeed represent a complex of hnRNP D with DNA. The fact that a stable hnRNP DÂ·DNA complex can persist following treatment with anti-nucleolin antibodies shows that the presence of nucleolin in the LR1 heterodimer is not essential for stable interaction with DNA. This raises the possibility that nucleolin may function as a chaperone to load hnRNP D onto the duplex binding site. We do not yet know whether hnRNP D can interact with duplex DNA on its own or requires nucleolin as a chaperone. Recombinant hnRNP D does not bind duplex DNA, nor could DNA binding activity be reconstituted by combining recombinant hnRNP D and recombinant nucleolin (Fig. 5 A). However, the recombinant proteins we have assayed were expressed in bacteria and were therefore not posttranslationally modified. In particular, phosphorylation appears to be necessary for LR1 duplex DNA binding activity (1Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and recombinant protein expressed in E. coli would lack this modification. Moreover, bacterial expression of full-length nucleolin has thus far proved impossible, and the longest nucleolin derivative assayed in reconstitution experiments contained only the four RBDs and the RGG-rich C terminus (residues 284â709) and lacked a considerable region of N-terminal sequence that may be important for DNA binding. Nucleolin and hnRNP D are ubiquitous polypeptides, but LR1 duplex DNA binding activity is restricted to pre-B and B cells. About 1 Î¼g of LR1 is recovered from about 109 PD31 cells, suggesting that the abundance of this factor is comparable with that of many transcription factors, and LR1 DNA binding activity therefore represents only a small fraction of the total hnRNP D and nucleolin in a mammalian nucleus. These observations suggest that there must be cell type-specific mechanisms that regulate LR1 duplex DNA binding activity. Our data identify at least two distinct mechanisms that may regulate cell type specificity of LR1 duplex binding activity: post translational modification and alternative processing of the hnRNP D transcript. Consistent with the observation that LR1 duplex DNA binding activity is dependent upon phosphorylation (1Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), activity could not be reconstituted by bacterially expressed recombinant hnRNP D and nucleolin. Consistent with the importance of alternative processing of the hnRNP D transcript, the isoform of hnRNP D in the LR1 heterodimer appears to contain sequences encoded by alternative exon 2 but not by alternative exon 7. However, alternative splicing alone does not appear to account for cell type specificity of binding activity. Isoforms containing sequences encoded by exon 7 (M07 and M27) exert a dominant negative effect on LR1 duplex DNA binding activity, so alternative processing may regulate DNA binding activity not only by determining the amount of exon 2-containing isoforms that are present but also by regulating the relative levels of the different hnRNP D isoforms. The dominant negative effect of the isoforms of hnRNP D that contain sequences encoded by exon 7 may also reflect tighter interactions of these isoforms with nucleolin. LR1 has a very unusual composition for a sequence-specific duplex DNA-binding protein, as both nucleolin and hnRNP D contain RBDs and RGG motifs typically found in proteins that interact with RNA, not duplex DNA. We note that these domains in LR1 do provide a structural basis for possible function in recombination. Crystallographic analysis has shown that an RBD forms a platform upon which a nucleic acid can be bound in an open structure (25Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.-H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 26Shamoo Y. Krueger U. Rice L.M. Williams K.R. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The RBD platforms in LR1 may therefore display a region of DNA so that it is available to interact with other nucleic acids or with enzymes involved in recombination. The RBD and RGG motifs also suggest that LR1 might interact with other nucleic acid substrates in addition to duplex DNA, and future experiments will explore this possibility. We are grateful to our colleagues and friends for many interesting and useful discussions, particularly to W. P. Russ for his help in displaying the nucleic acid structural model."

Mutational analysis of Cdc42 has revealed that actin reorganization and transcriptional activation are induced through independent signaling pathways.

Microinjection of CdGAP into serum-starved fibroblasts inhibits both platelet-derived growth factor-induced lamellipodia and bradykinin-induced filopodia mediated by Rac and Cdc42, respectively. CdGAP does not show in vitro activity toward Rho, and it has no effect on lysophosphatidic acid-induced stress fiber formation when microinjected into fibroblasts. The carboxyl terminus of CdGAP reveals potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and five SH3 binding motifs.

Members of the Rho family of small GTPases have been implicated in diverse cellular functions, including the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell growth control, transcriptional regulation, and membrane trafficking (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). Like all GTPases, they act as molecular switches to control downstream cellular events. The interconversion of the inactive GDP-bound form into the active GTP-bound form is regulated by members of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (2Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr . Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), whereas inactivation of the GTP-bound form is stimulated by the RhoGAP family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 (3Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho GTPases interact with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, whose precise function is unclear (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). Three members of the Rho family, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, have been shown to play a crucial role in regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular stimuli (4Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5219) Google Scholar). Activation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts induces the assembly of filamentous actin into stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively (5Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar, 6Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). In addition to these effects on the actin cytoskeleton, Rho GTPases are important regulators of signaling pathways leading to transcriptional activation. Several groups have demonstrated that Rac and Cdc42 (and in some cells Rho) can activate the c-jun amino-terminal/stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase and the p38/HOG mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (9Bagrodia S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All three GTPases are also able to stimulate serum response factor- and NF-ÎºB-dependent transcription (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 16Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Finally, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have each been implicated in cell cycle control; when introduced into quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, all three GTPases induce G1 cell cycle progression and subsequent DNA synthesis, whereas inhibition of Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 prevents serum-induced DNA synthesis (18Yamamoto M.

Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Although the signals mediating the effects of Rho GTPases on cell cycle progression are not known, their ability to stimulate G1 progression correlates well with actin polymerization and not with c-jun amino-terminal kinase activation (19Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the biochemical mechanisms underlying the various cellular effects induced by these GTPases, there has been much interest in identifying and characterizing target (effector) proteins. To date, around 10 distinct targets for each of the three Rho GTPases have been identified (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). A mutational analysis of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 that selectively disrupted their binding with downstream effectors has given some insight into which interactions are essential for specific downstream cellular effects induced by these GTPases (19Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 20Joneson T.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 22Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Among the multiple Rac and Rho targets, the mutational analysis of Rac has revealed that the only interaction with POR1 or p160ROCK correlates well with actin reorganization (20Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 5250: 810-812Crossref Scopus (358) Google Scholar,19Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). On the other hand, stress fiber formation induced by Rho likely involves interaction with both p160ROCK and a second unknown effector (22Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). An effector site mutation, Y40C, in Cdc42 prevents its interaction with two known targets, p65PAK and WASP, yet this mutant can still induce filopodia formation (19Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). It can be concluded from these experiments that the interaction of Cdc42 with p65PAK or WASP is not essential for actin reorganization, although the experiments do not exclude the possibility that p65PAK or WASP are involved in filopodia formation. More recently, a WASP-related protein, N-WASP, has been identified (23Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). N-WASP still interacts with the Y40C mutant of Cdc42, and when expressed in cells, appears to synergize with Cdc42 in the formation of filopodia (24Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify Cdc42 targets that might be involved in actin rearrangement, we have used the Y40C mutant of Cdc42 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We report here the identification of a novel serine- and proline-rich GTPase-activating protein, CdGAP (Cdc42 GTPase-activatingprotein). CdGAP is active on both Cdc42 and Rac but not Rho. The full-length protein has a predicted molecular mass of 89,610 Da and is rich in both charged amino acids and serine residues, and it has potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and SH3 binding motifs. A Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the pGAD10 vector (a kind gift of Dr. C. C. Kumar, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) was screened using as a bait Cdc42L61C40 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the pYTH6 vector. The bait was stably integrated into the genome of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190, as described previously (25Aspenstrom P. Olson M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Approximately 107 yeast colonies were screened for their ability to grow on selective medium containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The 49 fastest growing clones were replated, and plasmids were rescued using the Wizard clean-up kit (Promega) and retransformed into the Cdc42L61C40 yeast strain. Five clones were positive in the plate lift assay for expression of the LacZ reporter gene after the second round of transformation. The 1.9-kilobase pair insert of clone 2 was sequenced and found to be a novel cDNA potentially encoding a 72-kDa protein. Sequencing was performed using Sequenase sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A full-length sequence corresponding to clone 2 was isolated using theCLONTECH Marathon RACE polymerase chain reaction kit (mouse whole embryo cDNA library) with Advantage Klentaq polymerase. To perform a 5â² RACE, a primer was generated corresponding to the minus strand of bp 507â529 of the original yeast clone (5â²-GGAGGTTTGGGGCCCACACCAGG-3â²). This primer was used with theCLONTECH adaptor primer AP2 in the standard touchdown polymerase chain reaction protocol as described in theCLONTECH manual. Analysis of the 5â²-RACE reaction by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a major product at 620 bp. The product was ligated into pGEX4T-3 afterBglII/NotI digestion and sequenced. To perform a 3â²-RACE, a primer corresponding to bp 1631â1657 of the original clone (5â²-GGACACCAAGCCAGAACCTGAAGTCCC-3â²) was used with theCLONTECH adaptor primer AP2 following the same procedure used to perform 5â²-RACE. Analysis of the 3â²-RACE reaction by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a major product at 842 bp. The polymerase chain reaction product was directly ligated into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and sequence analysis provided the completed open reading frame. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot fromCLONTECH was incubated with a radioactive DNA probe corresponding to a HindIII fragment (bp 870â1303) of the original clone following the procedures detailed by the manufacturer. The HindIII fragment of clone 2 was labeled with [Î±32P]dCTP using the multiprime DNA labeling systems from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Standard DNA protocols were used (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pGEX-4T3-CdGAP (amino acids 3â662) and pRK5mycCdGAP (amino acids 3â662) were generated by digestion of pGAD10-clone 2 withBamHI and EcoRV followed by ligation of clone 2 cDNA into pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pRK5myc (19Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) digested with BamHI and SmaI. DNAs were purified by CsCl gradient. Rho (RhoA isotype), Rac (Rac1 isotype), Cdc42 (G25K isotype), CdGAP (amino acids 3â662), and p50RhoGAP (amino acids 198â439) were produced in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (27Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The recombinant GTPases were released from the beads by cleavage with human thrombin (Calbiochem) and thrombin removed by adding 10 Î¼l of p-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 Â°C. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon-10 (Amicon). Active protein concentrations were determined by the filter binding assay using [3H]GTP as described previously (6Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3830) Google Scholar). GST-CdGAP (amino acids 3â662) and GST-p50RhoGAP (amino acids 198â439) were eluted from the beads with 5 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon-10. Protein concentration was assayed following the method of Bradford, and purity of protein preparations was visualized on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Recombinant Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (5 Î¼g) were preloaded with [Î³-32P]GTP (10 Î¼Ci, 6000 Ci/mmol) in 20 Î¼l of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA for 10 min at 30 Â°C. After the addition of MgCl2 (final concentration of 20 mm), proteins could be kept on ice up to 1 h. 3 Î¼l (0.75 Î¼g) of the preloaded GTPases (to give a final concentration of 1.3 Î¼m) were diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm GTP, 0.86 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 Î¼m of GST-CdGAP (amino acids 3â662) or GST-p50RhoGAP (amino acids 198â439) or without GAP protein. The mixture was incubated at room temperature, and 5 Î¼l samples were removed at 0, 5, 10, and 15 min, diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2), and filtered through nitrocellulose filters (prewetted with buffer A). Filters were washed with 10 ml of cold buffer A, dried, and counted. Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and maintained at an atmosphere of 10% CO2. For the preparation of subconfluent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells, cells were plated at a density of 1 Ã 105 into 60-mm dishes. After 7 to 10 days, cells were serum-starved for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 g/liter NaHCO3, trypsinized for 1 min, and resuspended in serum-free medium containing 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The cells were pelleted and resuspended in serum-free medium before replating at a density of 6 Ã 104 onto glass coverslips treated overnight with fibronectin (50 Î¼g/ml). Cells were allowed to attach and spread for 1â2 h before microinjection. Cells treated with bradykinin were plated as described previously (8Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 1 Ã 105 onto glass coverslips, and the following day, cells were serum-starved for 2 days before microinjection. Eukaryotic expression vector pRK5myc encoding the region of CdGAP encompassing the GAP domain (amino acids 3â662) was microinjected at 0.1 mg/ml into the nucleus of â¼50 cells over a period of 10 min. Cells were returned to the incubator for a further 2 h before treatment with extracellular factors. During microinjection, cells were maintained at 37 Â°C with an atmosphere of 10% CO2. 2 h after microinjection of pRK5myc-CdGAP (amino acids 3â662) into subconfluent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells, cells were stimulated with 3 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor for 12 min, 200 ng/ml lysophosphatidic acid for 30 min, or 100 ng/ml bradykinin for 5 min at 37 Â°C and fixed for 10 min in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. All steps were carried out at room temperature, and coverslips were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline between each of the steps. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and free aldehyde groups were reduced with 0.5 mg/ml NaBH4 for 10 min. Cells were incubated in the presence of the primary monoclonal antibody anti-Myc diluted in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min. Coverslips were transferred to a second fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted by inverting them onto 8 Î¼l of mowiol 4â88 (Calbiochem) mountant containing p-phenylenediamine (Sigma) as an antibleach agent. After 2 h at room temperature, cells were examined on a Zeiss axiophot microscope using Zeiss 63 Ã 1.4 oil immersion objective. Fluorescence images were recorded on Kodak T-MAX 400 ASA film. To identify target proteins of Cdc42 potentially involved in the control of actin assembly, a yeast two-hybrid mouse cDNA library was screened using the Y40C effector mutant of constitutively activated Cdc42L61 as bait. This Cdc42 effector mutant is no longer able to interact with at least two known Cdc42 targets, p65PAK and WASP, yet can still induce filopodia when introduced into fibroblasts. Approximately 107 clones were screened as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ and the 49 fastest growing clones picked from the selection plates. Five clones tested positive upon rescreening and were negative in the absence of the Cdc42L61C40 bait. Fig. 1 A shows the interaction of one of the five clones (clone 2) with Cdc42L61C40 mutant. Clone 2 interacts with another effector mutant (F37A) of Cdc42L61, which is also still able to induce the formation of filopodia. Clone 2 binds to Cdc42L61 (i.e. without effector mutations) and to RacL61 but not RhoL63 (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of the five positive clones (1.9-kilobase pair insert) revealed an identical DNA sequence with an incomplete open reading frame, since no stop codon was present either at the 3â² end or the 5â² end of the insert. Using two primers derived either from a region close to the 5â² or the 3â² ends of clone 2, additional upstream and downstream sequences were isolated by performing 5â²-RACE and 3â²-RACE protocols. A 5â²-RACE product was obtained (620 bp), and sequence analysis of this confirmed that the amino terminus was missing from the original clone 2; the first methionine of the now-extended open reading frame is preceded by an in-frame stop codon. A major 3â²-RACE product was also obtained (842 bp), and sequence analysis of this provided a complete open reading frame. The full open reading frame encodes a protein of 820 amino acids, and the predicted molecular mass is 89,610 Da (Fig. 2 A). Sequence analysis of clone 2 corresponded to the Stratagene mouse heart partial clone 919612 in the GenBank Expressed Sequence Tag. The amino terminus of clone 2 revealed a striking homology with several GAPs for Rho-like proteins. Fig. 2 B shows that the RhoGAP homology domain extends over 146 amino acids, and there is 32% identity between CdGAP and human n-chimerin. Searching through a GenBank data base revealed no additional recognizable domains. However, the region comprising amino acids 229 to 385 of CdGAP reveals 33% identity to a serine-rich, 54.2-kDa protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Indeed, CdGAP has multiple stretches of 2 serine residues extending from the end of the RhoGAP domain to the carboxyl terminus of the protein. In addition, the region extending from amino acids 515 to 615 shows 30% identity with the glutamic acid/lysine-rich carboxyl terminus of neurofilament triplet H protein. In neurofilament proteins, this region is thought to form a charged scaffolding structure suitable for interaction with other neuronal components. The carboxyl-terminal region of CdGAP also contained five proline-rich sequences, potential SH3 binding motifs (28Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). Using a commercial mouse tissue Northern blot, a single mRNA at â¼7.5 kilobases can be seen in all tissues, although heart and lung (lanes 1 and 4, respectively) appear to have much higher levels compared with other tissues (Fig. 3). Spleen and liver (lanes 3and 5, respectively) reveal little detectable signal; however, at longer exposure low levels of mRNA were observed (data not shown). We conclude that CdGAP is expressed in most organs and tissues but at different levels of expression. To determine whether CdGAP encodes a functional GAP activity toward Rho GTPases, amino acids 3â662 of CdGAP were subcloned into the pGEX-4T3 E. coli expression vector as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The GST fusion protein was eluted from glutathione-agarose beads and migrated at the expected molecular mass of â¼99 kDa after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows that the GAP domain of CdGAP is as efficient as p50RhoGAP in stimulating the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42. CdGAP was also active on Rac, but unlike p50RhoGAP, CdGAP showed no activity toward Rho. To confirm that the loss of filter-associated counts resulted from the stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by CdGAP and not from trivial effects such as proteolysis of the GTPases, metal chelation, or nucleotide release, we have incubated the GAP domain of CdGAP with Cdc42 bound to [8-3H]GTP. Under the same conditions used for the GAP assay, no loss of filter-associated counts was observed (data not shown). Therefore, CdGAP reveals in vitro GAP activity toward Cdc42 and Rac but not Rho, and it seems unlikely that it has some guanine nucleotide exchange factors activity for Cdc42 and Rac. Ridley et al. (29Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kashmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) showed that p50RhoGAP can stimulate the GTPase activity of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho in vitro, but after microinjection into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, p50RhoGAP inhibited Rho-mediated stress fiber formation but not Rac-induced membrane ruffling. It is likely that p50RhoGAP is specific in vivo for Cdc42 and Rho. To assess the specificity of the GAP domain of CdGAP in vivo, a eukaryotic expression vector pRK5 encoding Myc-tagged CdGAP (amino acids 3â662) was microinjected into serum-starved, subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells, and its effects on actin changes induced by the addition of extracellular agonists was examined. Fig. 5 shows that Rac-dependent, platelet-derived growth factor-induced membrane ruffling and Cdc42-dependent, bradykinin-induced filopodia were completely abolished by microinjection of CdGAP before stimulation. Microinjection of CdGAP had, however, no effect on Rho-dependent, lysophosphatidic acid-induced stress fiber formation. These results demonstrate that CdGAP is able to down-regulate both Cdc42 and Rac in vivo. As shown in Fig. 5 E, microinjection of CdGAP into serum-starved cells disrupts the residual cortical actin and, after a longer period of time, cells round up and completely detach from the plate. It appears that basal Cdc42 and/or Rac activity is required to maintain spread and attached cells. We have identified a cDNA encoding a novel protein, CdGAP, that interacts in vitro with Cdc42 and Rac but not Rho. The full-length cDNA encodes a protein of 820 amino acids with an expected molecular weight of 89,610 Da. According to Northern blot analysis, CdGAP is ubiquitously expressed, although it is relatively higher in heart and lung tissues. The amino-terminal sequence of CdGAP contains three consensus sequence boxes found in several GAP proteins active on Rho family GTPases (30Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant CdGAP reveals in vitro GAP activity toward Cdc42 and Rac but not Rho, and this is reflected in the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay. To date, more than 13 proteins containing a RhoGAP domain have been identified in mammalian cells, although one of them, the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3â²-kinase, does not exhibit any GAP activity (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). Several RhoGAP-containing proteins have also been discovered in other eukaryotic organisms such as S. cerevisiae, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans (31Agnel M. Roder L. Vola C. Griffin S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5111-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Chen W. Blanc J. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 820-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zheng Y.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2949-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These proteins all share a related GAP domain that spans 140 amino acids, and their substrate specificity varies, although in vitro at least most display GAP activity toward more than one Rho GTPase. Overexpression of CdGAP in fibroblasts can down-regulate Cdc42 and Rac but not Rho, in agreement with its in vitroactivity. Most proteins in the RhoGAP family contain additional domains and motifs suggesting that they are multifunctional. In addition to the GAP domain, p190, for example, contains an amino-terminal GTP binding domain (35Foster R. Hu K.Q. Shaywitz D.A. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas Bcr contains a Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors domain. 9 of the 13 known mammalian RhoGAP proteins contain proline-rich sequences and are, therefore, likely SH3 binding proteins. p50rhoGAP has been shown to interact with the SH3 domains of c-Src and p85, whereas 3-BP1 interacts with the SH3 domain of the Abl-tyrosine kinase (36Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26059-26062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Cicchetti P. Ridley A.R. Zheng Y. Cerione R.A. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of CdGAP reveals five proline-rich sequences containing the potential SH3 binding motif pXPpXP (p, proline-preferred;X, nonconserved residues) (28Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the proline-rich sequence at amino acids 550 to 557 corresponds to the class II consensus sequence XPpXPXR found in various proteins such as dynamin, p47phox or Sos1 (38Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Peptide and mutational analysis have revealed that P2, P5, and R7 all contribute to SH3 binding affinity. Whether the SH3-containing protein(s) binds to CdGAP and participates in Rho GTPase-signaling pathways remains to be assessed. The mechanisms by which GAP proteins are recruited to and interact with Rho GTPase-signaling pathways is unknown. One possibility, however, is that the interaction of RhoGAPs with SH3-containing proteins is a mechanism to recruit GAP activity to specific protein complexes. Bem2p, a protein exhibiting GAP activity toward Rho1p in S. cerevisiae, has been shown to interact with Bem1p, a scaffold-like SH3-containing protein needed for bud emergence and mating projection formation, two processes that require asymmetric reorganizations of the cortical cytoskeleton in S. cerevisiae (39Peterson J. Zheng Y. Bender L. Myers A. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition to accelerating the intrinsic GTPase activity of GTP-binding proteins, it has been proposed that GAPs may also mediate downstream signals. This has been clearly established for phospholipase C Î², which in addition to being the target of the Î± subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, Gq, is also a GAP for Î±q (42Berstein G. Blank J.L. Deok-Young J. Exton J.M. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Others have reported that p120RasGAP, in addition to regulating the GTPase activity of Ras, acts as a signaling molecule in its own right (40Cales C. Hancock J.F. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Nature. 1988; 332: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). There has been one report to date suggesting a signaling function for a member of the RhoGAP family. n-chimerin has GAP activity toward Rac and to a lesser extent Cdc42, and microinjection of its GAP domain into fibroblasts prevents both Rac- and Cdc42-induced cytoskeletal changes (41Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5069-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, microinjection of full-lengthn-chimerin or a chimerin mutant lacking GAP activity resulted in the induction of lamellipodia and filopodia (41Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5069-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The formation of these cytoskeletal structures was inhibited by coinjection of dominant negative N17Rac or N17Cdc42, suggesting thatn-chimerin acts synergistically with endogenous Rac and Cdc42 activity to promote actin reorganization. So far, CdGAP has been shown to act as a negative regulator of both Rac and Cdc42. Attempts to identify Cdc42 downstream effectors specifically involved in actin rearrangements using the Y40C mutant of Cdc42 as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen has not been of particular significance in the case of CdGAP. It will be, however, of great interest to determine whether full-length CdGAP shows any morphological function in addition to down-regulation of Rac and Cdc42 in fibroblasts. A CdGAP mutant with no GAP activity and impaired binding to Rac and Cdc42 or a mutant lacking GAP activity alone might also provide further clues to its cellular role.

In eukaryotes, conjugation to ubiquitin polymers often targets a protein for destruction. This process is regulated by deubiquitinating enzymes, which can disassemble ubiquitin polymers or ubiquitin-substrate conjugates. We find that a deubiquitinating enzyme, UbpA, is required for Dictyostelium development.ubpA cells have normal protein profiles on gels, grow normally, and show normal responses to starvation such as differentiation and secretion of conditioned medium factor. However,ubpA cells have defective aggregation, chemotaxis, cAMP relay, and cell adhesion. These defects result from low expression of cAMP pulse-induced genes such as those encoding the cAR1 cAMP receptor, phosphodiesterase, and the gp80 adhesion protein. Treatment of ubpA cells with pulses of exogenous cAMP allows them to aggregate and express these genes like wild-type cells, but they still fail to develop fruiting bodies. Unlike wild type, ubpAcells accumulate ubiquitin-containing species that comigrate with ubiquitin polymers, suggesting a defect in polyubiquitin metabolism. UbpA has sequence similarity with yeast Ubp14, which disassembles free ubiquitin chains. Yeast ubp14 cells have a defect in proteolysis, due to excess ubiquitin chains competing for substrate binding to proteasomes. Cross-species complementation and enzyme specificity assays indicate that UbpA and Ubp14 are functional homologs. We suggest that specific developmental transitions in Dictyostelium require the degradation of specific proteins and that this process in turn requires the disassembly of polyubiquitin chains by UbpA.

Modification of proteins by ubiquitin is involved in many cellular processes including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, ligand-inducible endocytosis of cell-surface proteins, mating type switching in yeast, and elimination of damaged proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar and 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Attachment of polyubiquitin chain(s) to a protein frequently serves to target the modified protein for proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome. The ubiquitin molecules in these chains are most often linked to one another by isopeptide bonds between the C terminus of one ubiquitin and the Îµ-amino group of lysine 48 of the next ubiquitin. Protein ubiquitination is reversible. Deubiquitination is catalyzed by specialized thiol proteases, called deubiquitinating or DUB1 enzymes, which hydrolyze the amide bond between the C-terminal Gly of ubiquitin and primary amino groups of the substrate protein (3Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. Peters J.M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell Cycle. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 99-125Google Scholar). One of the two known classes of DUB enzymes is the ubiquitin-specific processing protease or UBP class. All members of the UBP family contain two short consensus sequences, the Cys and His boxes, which are likely to help form the active site (4Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Several additional short sequences are also moderately well conserved (3Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. Peters J.M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell Cycle. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 99-125Google Scholar). The DUB family is large. For example, 17 genes encode DUB enzymes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, of which 16 are in the UBP class (2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). However, little is known about their physiological functions. One role of DUBs is the regulation of protein degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Mammalian 26 S proteasomes contain a DUB enzyme that specifically removes ubiquitin molecules from the distal ends of polyubiquitin chains attached to protein substrates (6Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 3852: 737-740Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It may function to rescue inappropriately ubiquitinated proteins from degradation or may facilitate movement of substrates within the protease complex. Two UBP enzymes from yeast have been shown to have general roles in proteasome-mediated proteolysis in vivo. The Doa4 enzyme appears to cleave ubiquitin chains from proteins already committed to degradation by the proteasome (5Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ubp14 has recently been found to be the major yeast DUB that disassembles free ubiquitin chains (7Amerik A.Y. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Both Doa4 and Ubp14 may function by preventing competition between products generated (at least in part) by the proteasome (ubiquitinated protein remnants and unanchored ubiquitin chains, respectively) and polyubiquitinated protein substrates of the protease. Other DUBs may have more specialized functions. The one demonstrated example of a DUB enzyme that is crucial for the development of a multicellular eukaryote is the Drosophila fat facets UBP enzyme (5Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In addition to having a maternal effect lethal phenotype, mutant fat facets (faf) flies have a specific defect in eye development characterized by extranumerary photoreceptor cells. Interestingly, partial loss-of-function alleles of a proteasome subunit gene suppress the faf developmental defect, suggesting that the Faf protein normally functions to antagonize the degradation of one or more key regulators of eye development (8Huang Y. Baker R. Fischer-Vize J.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The simple eukaryote D. discoideum is an excellent model system because its growth is independent of development. As the vegetative amoebae starve, they enter an initial stage of development wherein they stop dividing and begin secreting the cell density sensing factor, CMF (9Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jain R. Gomer R.H. Murtagh Jr., J.J. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 58-59PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yuen I.S. Gomer R.H. J. Theor.

When there is a high concentration of starving cells, as indicated by high levels of CMF, the cells enter another stage of development where relayed pulses of cAMP cause an increase, from a basal level, of the transcription of genes encoding proteins such as the cAMP receptor, cAR1, and a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that causes extracellular cAMP levels to return to a base-line level in the interval between the pulses of cAMP (see Refs. 14Firtel R.A. van Haastert P.J.M.

Biochem. 1991; 195: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar for review). The pulses of cAMP also function as a chemoattractant that causes the cells to aggregate (reviewed in Ref. 18Robertson A.D.J. Grutsch J.F. Cell. 1981; 24: 603-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The aggregate, which is held together by adhesion proteins such as gp80, subsequently develops into a fruiting body consisting of a mass of spore cells supported on a column of stalk cells (see Refs. 19Schaap P. Dworkin M. Intercellular Interactions during Dictyostelium Development. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1991: 147-178Google Scholar, 20Loomis W.F.

The entire developmental process takes only 24 h. InDictyostelium, ubiquitin genes have been identified, and ubiquitin mRNA species were shown to be developmentally regulated, suggesting a role for ubiquitin in development (25Muller-Taubenberger A. Westphal M. Jaeger E. Noegel A. Gerisch G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Ohmachi T. Giorda R. Shaw D.R. Ennis H.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5226-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UBC1, has been implicated in Dictyostelium development (27Clark A. Nomura A. Mohanty S. Firtel R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1989-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the D. discoideum UbpA protein is a deubiquitinating enzyme, that it is a functional homolog of yeast Ubp14 and shares the highly restricted substrate specificity found previously for Ubp14 (7Amerik A.Y. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and mammalian isopeptidase T (1Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and that the UbpA enzyme is crucial for development. We used a random mutagenesis protocol (30Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8803-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and isolated ubpA as a mutant with defective aggregation. Mutants lacking UbpA grow and enter the CMF secretion stage of development normally, but these cells fail to reach the stage where pulses of cAMP normally increase the transcription of genes required for further development, such as those encoding cAR1, PDE, and gp80. It is intriguing that such a specific developmental defect results from the loss of a DUB enzyme with a very general but nonessential function in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These findings suggest that there is a central role for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in setting the proper expression level of specific regulatory factors controlling progression between stages of Dictyostelium development. D. discoideum Ax4 cells were grown as described previously (31Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The uracil-lacking strain DH1 (a gift of Peter Devreotes, Johns Hopkins University. Baltimore), apyr5-6 derivative of Ax4, was grown in HL5 medium (32Sussman M. Spudich J.A. Cultivation and Synchronous Morphogenesis of Dictyostelium Under Controlled Experimental Conditions. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 9-29Google Scholar) supplemented with 20 Î¼g/ml uracil. Cells were developed on filters (31Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or starved in shaking cultures as described (13Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Shaking cultures that were pulsed with cAMP received pulses to 30 nm every 6 min between 1 and 6 h of starvation. Low cell-density assays for prestalk and prespore cells were carried out as described by Clayet al. (33Clay J.L. Ammann R.A. Gomer R.H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Time lapse videomicroscopy, motility assays, and trypan blue exclusion were done as described in Yuen et al. (13Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The yeast strains used in this work were MHY501 (MATÎ± his-Î200 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 lys2-801 trp1-1) and MHY840 (MATÎ± his-Î200 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 lys2-801 trp1-1 ubp14-Î1::HIS3i). Yeast-rich and minimal media were prepared as described, and standard yeast genetic methods were used (34Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). E. coli strains used were JM101 and SURE (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and standard procedures for recombinant DNA work were used (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.in: Chandra V.B. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) was carried out following Kuspa and Loomis (30Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8803-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) by electroporating EcoRI-linearized DIV2 (an insertion vector carrying the Dictyostelium pyr5-6 gene, see Fig. 1 A) into DH1 (pyr5-6 â) cells along with the restriction enzyme MunI and selecting for uracil prototrophs. In a screen of 230 transformants, 6 had defective developmental morphology. Two of these, M7 and M11, showed defective aggregation. Plasmids pM7E and pM7N, which contained DNA flanking the DIV2 insertion site in the M7 transformant, were prepared from M7 genomic DNA that had been cut with EcoRI and NsiI, respectively. A 250-bpPvuII-EcoRI fragment from pM7E, which contains the genomic MunI-EcoRI region that flanks the insertion site plus 46 bp from the vector, was used as a probe to screen a Î»gt11 library of Dictyostelium cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) following Jain et al. (31Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts of positive clones were amplified by 35 cycles of PCR (1 min at 94 Â°C, 1 min at 40 Â°C, 4 min at 74 Â°C) using Pfu enzyme (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Î»gt11 forward and reverse primer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). PCR products were purified using the Wizard PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and desalted/concentrated using a Microcon-100 microconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). DNA sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems sequencer at the Microbiology Department core sequencing facility, University of Texas Medical School, Houston. The largest cDNA clone was 3 kb in length and contained an open reading frame from one end through to a poly(dA) region at the other end. RACE-PCR was used to obtain additional sequence at the 5â²-end (10Jain R. Gomer R.H. Murtagh Jr., J.J. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 58-59PubMed Google Scholar,36Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. RACE: Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 28-38Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis from 5 Î¼g of total RNA was carried out using the gene-specific antisense primer 5â²-GATTCTGCATTCCAACTGACG-3â² with the Life Technologies, Inc. SuperScript preamplification system following the manufacturer's protocol. Primers and dNTPs were removed by using a Microcon-100 microconcentrator. A poly(dC) tail was added to the cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The dC-tailed cDNA was amplified by PCR, carried out for 30 cycles (1 min at 94 Â°C, 1 min at 48 Â°C, 2 min at 72 Â°C), with the 5â²-RACE Anchor Primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a nested gene-specific primer, 5â²-ACTTTATCTCTTCATCC-3â², using the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer). Product (0.1 Î¼l) from this PCR was used as template for nested amplification, carried out for 17 cycles (1 min at 94 Â°C, 1 min at 49 Â°C, 1 min at 72 Â°C), with the Universal Amplification Primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the antisense primer, 5â²-CCACCATTCTCTATAGTTGG-3â². The 5â²-RACE fragment extended the cDNA sequence an additional 135 bp, which included the first 4 bp of the open reading frame. The cDNA sequence matched the sequence obtained from the genomic clones except for the 5â²-end of the cDNA (exon 1; Fig. 1 A), which was not present on the genomic fragment of pM7E, suggesting that a deletion occurred during the cloning of this plasmid. This was confirmed by PCR of genomic DNA from wild-type cells using a primer specific for a region upstream of the presumptive deletion and a gene-specific (exon 2) antisense primer. The sequence of the genomic fragment obtained by PCR matched the cDNA and 5â²-RACE sequence. Plasmid pM7E thus contains a deletion of 350 bp including exon 1. For ubpA cloning, the ubpA coding sequence was amplified by PCR from a Î»gt11 cDNA clone that contained the entire ubpA open reading frame. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles (45 s at 95 Â°C, 45 s at 45 Â°C, 3 min at 72 Â°C) using a AmpliTaq (Perkin Elmer, Branchburh, NJ)/Pfu enzyme (Stratagene) mix (37Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and the primers 5â²-CGGATCCAATGGAATTATTCCCAGAATTAAAAAATATTAAAGTACC-3â² and 5â²-GCTCTAGAAATTAAAATTTAATTTAGTTGTC-3â², which correspond to the 5â²- and 3â²-ends of the ubpA coding region, respectively. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XbaI (restriction sites which were built into the 5â²- and 3â²-primers) and subcloned into BamHI, XbaI-cut pYES2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a yeast expression vector, to generate pYEU1. TheubpA insert of pYEU1 was removed by digestion withBamHI, blunt-ended using Klenow, and digested withXbaI, and then subcloned into similarly cut pDXA-3H, aDictyostelium expression vector (38Manstein D.. Schuster H. Morandini P. Hunt D. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For expression in E. coli, the complete ubpA coding sequence, contained on a Î»gt11 cDNA clone, was amplified by 30 PCR cycles (45 s at 95 Â°C, 45 s at 55 Â°C, 3 min at 74 Â°C) using PrimeZyme (Biometra, Tampa, FL) and the primers 5â²-CGGGATCCTAATGGAATTATTCCCAGAATTAAAAAATATTAAAGTACC-3â² and 5â²-CGGGGTACCTAAATTAAAATTTAATTTAGTTGTC-3â². The PCR product was blunt-ended using Klenow, digested with BamHI, and cloned into pGEX-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was cut withEcoRI, blunt-ended using Klenow, and digested withBamHI to generate pGEX-ubpA. To express the yeastubp14 in Dictyostelium, the ubp14cDNA obtained by digesting pGEX-UBP14 (7Amerik A.Y. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with XhoI, blunt-ended using Klenow, followed by digesting with BamHI, was cloned into similarly cut pDXA-3H. To induce expression of GST-Ubp14 and GST-UbpA, JM101 bacterial cells transformed with pGEX-UBP14 and pGEX-ubpA plasmid DNAs, respectively, were grown to an A 600 of 0.7 in LB + 100 Î¼g/ml ampicillin at 30 Â°C. After addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside and incubation at 30 Â°C for 3 h, cells (100 ml) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The suspension was sonicated with a microtip attachment until clarified; 1/20 volume of 10% Triton X-100 was added, and the suspension was gently mixed by inversions of the tube. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 Ã g for 10 min, and the extracts were adjusted to 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 5 Î¼g/ml pepstatin A. Expression of fusion proteins was checked by PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Isopeptidase activity was assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 2 mmdithiothreitol in a total volume of 20 Î¼l following Amerik (7Amerik A.Y. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 2 Î¼l of bacterial extracts and 0.5 Î¼g of Ub-Ub or Ub-UbÎGG. After 1 h at 37 Â°C, aliquots were removed and analyzed by anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting. RNA isolation, electrophoresis, and transfer to Duralon UV membrane (Stratagene) were performed as described (31Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A 250-bp PvuII-EcoRI fragment (described above) and a 400-bp BspDI fragment from genomic DNA clones pM7E and pM7N, respectively, were used to prepare ubpA-specific DNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP by random hexamer-primed DNA synthesis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Additional probes were prepared using the inserts of the following genomic or cDNA clones. Jakob Franke (Columbia University, New York) provided plasmid pDE-0.9, containing the 0.9-kb BstBI-EcoRI fragment of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase cDNA (39Wu L. Franke J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chi-Hung Siu (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada) provided the gp80 clone which carried a 1.0-kb EcoRI cDNA insert (40Wong L.M. Siu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4248-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Alan Kimmel (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) provided the cAR1 clone which carried a 1.3-kb EcoRI cDNA insert. Hybridization was performed at 60 Â°C in 0.125 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, 0.25 m NaCl, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10% PEG (M r 8,000). Blots were washed with 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, 0.5% SDS twice at room temperature for 30 min each and then at 60 Â°C for 30 min. Molecular size standards were from the Life Technologies, Inc., 0.24â9.5-kb RNA ladder. An anti-UbpA polyclonal serum was prepared using a bacterially expressed UbpA fusion protein. The primer 5â²-CGGGATCCACCAACAGAAAAATCACG-3â² and the antisense primer 5â²-CGGGATCCAAGATGGACGAG-3â² were used in a PCR to amplify cDNA encoding a 438-residue segment of UbpA (residues 13â450; Fig. 1). PCR was carried out with Pfu enzyme for 35 cycles (1 min at 94 Â°C, 1 min at 45 Â°C, 4 min at 74 Â°C). The primers addedBamHI sites at the ends of the amplified region. Following digestion with BamHI, the 1.3-kb PCR product was cloned in frame into the BamHI site of the expression vector pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI). After the construct was verified by DNA sequencing, protein was expressed in the bacterial strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) and purified on His-Bind resin (Novagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The recombinant protein was isolated further by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by electroelution of the excised protein-containing gel slice and lyophilization (33Clay J.L. Ammann R.A. Gomer R.H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A rabbit was then immunized by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA) with 30 Î¼g of fusion protein in complete Freund's adjuvant injected into the popliteal lymph nodes followed 30 days later with 150 Î¼g in incomplete Freund's adjuvant injected subcutaneously. Serum was collected 10 days after the boost, and antibodies were purified with an EZ Sep kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monospecific antibodies against the recombinant UbpA protein were obtained from the crude antibody preparation by blot affinity purification essentially as described by Talian et al. (41Talian J.C. Olsted J.B. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); elution of the antibody bound to the antigen/polyvinylidene difluoride strip was done by use of low pH shock. Affinity purified antibody was immediately neutralized, diluted 4-fold with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% NaN3 (buffer A), then concentrated and stored at 4 Â°C at a 1:10 dilution relative to the starting antiserum volume. Dictyostelium cells harvested at various developmental time points were directly solubilized with 2% SDS sample buffer and heated at 100 Â°C for 5 min. For all Western blots, the protein from 3 Ã 105 cells per lane was resolved on 15 or 17.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane following Towbin et al.(42Towbin H. Staehelin R. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44635) Google Scholar). For the analysis of crude fractionated subcellular samples, 109 vegetative Ax4 cells were first collected by centrifugation and resuspended to 3 Ã 108 cells/ml in ice-cold MESES buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1 mmEDTA, 0.25 m sucrose). Cells were then homogenized with a tight-fitting Dounce and centrifuged at 3,000 Ã g for 5 min to pellet nuclei. Post-nuclear supernatants (5 ml) were centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was spun again at 200,000 Ã gfor 30 min. Blots were blocked with 5% low-fat powdered milk in PBS (8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.14 m NaCl, 3 mm KCl) for 30 min, washed 3 min with buffer A, and then incubated for 1.5 h with affinity purified UbpA antibody diluted 1:50 in buffer A at 25 Â°C. After a brief wash with buffer A, blots were incubated with 0.230 Î¼Ci/ml 125I-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% NaN3(buffer B) for 2.5 h at 25 Â°C and then washed with buffer B five times (10 min each). Autoradiography was done using a Cronex lightning plus amplifying screen (NEN Life Science Products) and Kodak XAR-5 film. To detect ubiquitin, Western blots were blocked for 1 h in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-ubiquitin antibodies in PBS, 1% Tween 20, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS for 1 h. To enhance resolution of low molecular mass proteins, a Tricine gel system (43SchaÌgger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10405) Google Scholar) was used. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore); the filters were then boiled in water and incubated with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. All blots used anti-ubiquitin antibodies that had been affinity purified on a ubiquitin affinity resin and were provided by C. Pickart or S. Swaminathan. Bound antibody was detected with the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following Pampori et al.(44Pampori N.A. Pampori M.K. Shapiro B.H. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 588-589PubMed Google Scholar) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Molecular size standards were from the Life Technologies, Inc., 10-kDa protein ladder or ubiquitin chain standards. Overnight cultures of ubp14Î cells transformed with pUBP14 or pYEU1 plasmids were centrifuged and resuspended in 3 volumes of disruption buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mammonium sulfate, 200 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 100 Î¼g/ml pepstatin). Cells were mixed with 4 volumes of chilled glass beads and vortexed five times for 45 s each, leaving cells on ice for 1 min between vortexings (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Tetranectin (TN)1 is a 68-kDa plasminogen-binding protein occurring in plasma at an approximate concentration of 10 mg/liter (1Clemmensen I. Petersen L.C. Kluft C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and is also found to be deposited extracellularly in various tissues. In particular, TN is deposited in the tumor-surrounding stroma of breast (2Christensen L. Clemmensen I. Histochemistry. 1991; 95: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), colon (3Wewer U.M. Albrechtsen R. Lab. Investig. 1992; 67: 253-262PubMed Google Scholar), and ovarian (4HÃ¸gdall C.K.

TN has also been inferred to play a role in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (6Kamper E.F. Kopeikina L.T. Koutsoukos V. Stavridis J. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 262-268PubMed Google Scholar) and in bone mineralization during osteogenesis (7Wewer U.M. Ibaraki K. SchjÃ¸rring P. Durkin M.E. Young M.F. Albrechtsen R. J.

It is not known whether TN deposited in tumor stroma is recruited from plasma or is expressed locally. TN appears to be expressed by a variety of cells, including fibroblasts (9Clemmensen I. Lund L.R. Christensen L. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), monocytes (10Nielsen H. Clemmensen I. Kharazmi A. Scand. J.

TN mRNA has been detected in the placenta, heart, spleen, and lung and, in low amounts, also in the liver and kidney (12Berglund L. Petersen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). TN is a trimeric protein (13Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Clemmensen I. ThÃ¸gersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) assembled from three identical polypeptide chains of 181 amino acid residues (14Fuhlendorff J. Clemmensen I. Magnusson S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6757-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The molecular architecture of TN reflects the genomic organization (12Berglund L. Petersen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in that the three exons correspond to three functional domains: (i) an NH2-terminal domain of about 20 amino acid residues; (ii) a triple Î±-helix coiled coil-forming domain of approximately 30 amino acid residues; and (iii) a long-form carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) characteristic of the C-type lectin protein superfamily of approximately 130 amino acid residues. TN binds to plasminogen (Plg) by a specific and lysine-sensitive interaction with the kringle 4 domain (Plg K4), and binding facilitates the proteolytic activation of Plg to plasmin by the tissue-type plasminogen activator (1Clemmensen I. Petersen L.C. Kluft C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition to Plg, TN has been reported to bind apolipoprotein(a) and fibrin (15Kluft C. Jie A.F.H. Los P. de Wit E. Havekes L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Kluft C. Los P. Clemmensen I. Thromb. Res. 1989; 55: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TN is also known to bind calcium as well as a number of complex sulfated polysaccharides including heparin/heparan sulfate, chondroitin, and fucoidan (17Clemmensen I. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1989; 49: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of tetranectin has been determined by x-ray crystallographic analysis of crystals of full-length recombinant tetranectin, rTN (18Nielsen B.B. Kastrup J.S. Rasmussen H. Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Etzerodt M. ThÃ¸gersen H.C. Larsen I.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), 2Protein Data Bank number 1HTN. and the long-form CRD, rTN3 (19Kastrup, J. S., Nielsen, B. B., Rasmussen, H., Holtet, T. L., Graversen, J. H., Etzerodt, M., ThÃ¸gersen, H. C., and Larsen, I. K. Acta Crystallogr. D54,757â766Google Scholar). 3Protein Data Bank number 1TN3. The structural analyses revealed a highly conserved fold shared between TN and the neck region and CRD of the human and rat mannose-binding proteins (MBPs) of the collectin protein family. Many secondary structural elements as well as the number and location of calcium ion binding sites are conserved among all three proteins. Calcium binding site 1 is highly conserved. Although two of the five coordinating residues in rat MBP are substituted in TN (i.e.Asp-188 to Gly-147 and Asp-194 to Asn-151, respectively), both the coordination geometry and position of calcium ion 1 are very similar. Coordination geometry at calcium binding site 2 in TN differs from those of the MBPs because three of the five calcium-coordinating residues in MBP, i.e. Glu-185, Asn-187, and Asn-205, are replaced with TN residues Gln-143, Asp-145, and Phe-164, respectively. TN residues Gln-143 and Asp-145 coordinate calcium directly, whereas the side chain of Phe-164 is rotated away from the calcium ion, thereby allowing the accommodation of a fixed water molecule, which serves a role as calcium coordinator in place of the Asn-205 side chain of the MBPs (19Kastrup, J. S., Nielsen, B. B., Rasmussen, H., Holtet, T. L., Graversen, J. H., Etzerodt, M., ThÃ¸gersen, H. C., and Larsen, I. K. Acta Crystallogr. D54,757â766Google Scholar). Calcium binding site 2 is involved in carbohydrate binding in all C-type lectins known to exhibit calcium-dependent interaction with terminal sugar residues (reviewed in Ref. 20Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). At the present stage, no carbohydrate ligand to the TN CRD has been identified. However, the presence of the calcium-coordinating residues Gln-143 and Asp-145 and the Pro-144, which is structurally conserved in the cis conformation, in addition to the presence of a surface-exposed aromatic residue (Phe-164) adjacent to the calcium binding site, may be taken as suggestive of a galactose-type specificity of the TN CRD. Apart from calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding, CRDs of other C-type lectins have been reported to bind noncarbohydrate ligands, including proteins, lipids (21Sano H. Kuroki Y. Honma T.

In the present work, the Plg K4 binding site of TN is reported to be sensitive to calcium ions, to involve at least two of the calcium-coordinating residues in the CRD, and to be located at a site overlapping the putative carbohydrate binding site. All single-residue mutations were performed using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pT7H6FX-rTN123 (13Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Clemmensen I. ThÃ¸gersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was used as a template for the mutagenesis. Mutagenesis primers were from DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark). The initial melting temperature of all primer pairs used for mutagenesis was designed to be at least 62 Â°C, and mutation sites were located in the central region of the primers. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing using the Thermo Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Expression in Escherichia coli, refolding, and purification of rTN, rTN3, and the single-amino acid mutations of rTN were performed as described previously (13Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Clemmensen I. ThÃ¸gersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). rPlg K4 was produced essentially as described previously (26Nielsen P.R. Einer-Jensen K. Holtet T.L. Andersen B.D. Poulsen F.M. ThÃ¸gersen H.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13019-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). rPlg K4 (12 mg) dissolved in 2.5 ml of 0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 7.5, was immobilized on 5 ml of Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which was activated as described previously (27Hearn M.T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 135: 102-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by the addition of 0.3 g of 1,1â²-carbonyldiimidazole in dry acetone. In preparation for binding analysis, the rPlg K4 column was washed with 1 column volume of 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA; Buffer B); 1 column volume of 0.5 m NaCl and 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0); and 4 column volumes of 0.1 m NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8; Buffer A) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. One ml of the protein sample at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml (i.e. rTN, rTN single-residue mutants, or rTN3) was applied, and the column was washed with 3â4 column volumes of Buffer A before the elution of bound protein with Buffer B. Aliquots of the run-through, wash, and elution fractions were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Calcium sensitivity of rTN binding was analyzed by equilibrating the rPlg K4 column with Buffer A containing either 1 mmCaCl2 or 1 mm calcium lactate before loading rTN, or by the application of rTN in Buffer A, without calcium, and applying a gradient from 0 to 1 mm of either CaCl2 or calcium lactate over 10 column volumes. The SPR binding assays were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore). rPlg K4 or Plg [human Glu-plasminogen was a gift from Dr. Lars Sottrup-Jensen, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark (28Sottrup-Jensen L.

After chip activation, rPlg K4 dissolved in 0.1m sodium phosphate (pH 4.5) at a concentration of 0.32 mg/ml or Plg dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) at a concentration of 0.51 mg/ml was passed through the flow cells at a rate of 5 Î¼l/min. In this way, 0.065 pmol rPlg K4/mm2 and 0.130 pmol Plg/mm2 were immobilized on the chip. The chip was capped by exposure to 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). Binding analysis was performed at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l/min. Before loading of the protein sample, the chip was equilibrated in 0.1m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.005% Surfactant P20. Aliquots (25 Î¼l) of rTN or single-residue mutants at a concentration of the trimeric molecules of 0.5 Î¼m were injected using the KINJECT option. Five min of dissociation were allowed before the chip was regenerated with 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm 6-AHA, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P20. Binding of rTN was tested at eight different protein concentrations, ranging from 0.067 to 1.33 Î¼m. Binding analysis of rTN3 was performed with 25 Î¼l of the protein at a concentration of 1.5 Î¼m. The calcium sensitivity of the interaction was analyzed according to a similar protocol. Protein samples were dissolved in buffers containing defined calcium ion concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 Î¼m CaCl2 for rTN and from 0 to 40 mm CaCl2 for rTN D116A, rTN E120A, rTN Q143A, rTN D145A, and rTN N151A, respectively. Proteins were injected using the COINJECT option, injecting 25 Î¼l of buffer with the appropriate CaCl2 concentration before the injection of the protein sample. The lysine sensitivity of rTN binding to rPlg K4 was analyzed by substitution of CaCl2 with 6-AHA at defined concentration levels between 0 and 10 mm. Binding data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation program version 3.0 (BIAcore). Titrations were all conducted on a MCS ITC instrument from MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, MA) at 25 Â°C (29Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). Titrations of the binding of rTN (concentration, 2.385 Ã 10â5m) and rTN3 (concentration, 5.27 Ã 10â5m), respectively, with rPlg K4 were performed in a cell with a volume of 1.3187 ml with 20 injections of 13.01131 Î¼l of rPlg K4 (79.3 Ã 10â5m) while stirring at 400 rpm. All protein samples were dissolved in a buffer containing 0.1m NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and degassed by stirring under a vacuum. A blank titration of rPlg K4 injected into the buffer was used as a control. The collected data were analyzed using the ORIGIN version 4.10 package from Microcal Software Inc. The blank titration was subtracted before fitting the data. Initial mapping of the Plg K4 binding site on TN was carried out using the rPlg K4 affinity column for the detection of lysine-sensitive binding of rTN deletion variants. Results from these experiments showed that rTN deletion constructs containing the Î±-helical trimerization region as well as the CRD bound to immobilized rPlg K4, whereas free CRD (rTN3) exhibited no apparent binding (data not shown). However, the observation that bound rTN could be eluted from the rPlg K4 column by either CaCl2 or calcium lactate (at approximately 0.2 mm calcium) prompted us to focus the single-residue mutational analysis on the CRD domain. The calcium sensitivity of the interaction was further analyzed in a series of SPR experiments in which the binding of rTN to either immobilized rPlg K4 or immobilized Plg was analyzed with various concentrations of calcium in the buffer (Fig. 1). The shapes and positions of the two binding curves are virtually identical, substantiating that TN binds exclusively to the Plg K4 domain in Plg. Half-maximal binding was found to occur at approximately 0.2 mm calcium. Binding affinities of rTN and rTN3 to rPlg K4 in solution were determined by ITC. The data fitted well to a one-binding site model for rTN3 and a one-binding site/subunit model for rTN (Fig. 2), yielding dissociation constants of 53 and 52 Î¼m, respectively, for this strongly enthalpy-driven association (Table I).Table IBinding parameters obtained from the microcalorimetric titration of rTN and rTN3 with rPlg K4rTN3rTNStoichiometry0.95 Â± 0.083.2 Â± 0.1KD (Î¼m)51.8 Â± 5.652.9 Â± 3.1ÎG (kJ/mol)â24.5 Â± 0.3â24.4 Â± 0.1ÎH (kJ/mol)â137 Â± 14â113 Â± 4âTÎS (kJ/mol)113 Â± 1489 Â± 4 Open table in a new tab To determine the location of the Plg K4 binding site on the CRD in greater detail, a series of single-residue substitutions in rTN was generated on the basis of inspection of the published CRD structure (19Kastrup, J.

Firstly, each of the surface-exposed lysine residues in the CRD region of rTN was replaced by alanine residues (K134A, K148A, K162A, and K166A). Secondly, several of the calcium-coordinating residues, in particular those involved in coordination at calcium site 2, were substituted by alanine residues (D116A, E120A, Q143A, D145A, E150A, N151A, and D165A). Finally, additional surface-exposed residues in the vicinity of calcium site 2 were substituted by alanine or other residues (I140A, F164L, R167A, and R169A).

Open table in a new tab Expression levels of the single-residue mutants of rTN were similar to the wild-type level. However, refolding efficiency differed by up to 50% relative to that of the wild type. One mutant, rTN F164A, failed to refold (data not shown). Purified protein preparations appeared to be homogeneous, correctly refolded, and free from contaminating disulfide-linked oligomer species as judged by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). On the basis of the light absorption at 280 nm and amino acid analysis, A(1%)280 values for rTN and rTN3 were determined to be 2.0 and 2.8 gLâ1 cmâ1, respectively. SDS-PAGE staining intensities for rTN and the single residue mutants confirmed that the use of the rTN A(1%)280 value for the mutant proteins was justifiable, and that the mutants exhibited a hypochrome effect similar to that of rTN. The mutants were grouped into three classes with respect to their affinity for rPlg K4-Sepharose (Table II), namely: (i) mutants binding essentially as strongly as the wild-type protein rTN (E120A, K134A, Q143A, D145A, N151A, K162A, F164L, and R169A); (ii) mutants that were retarded on the column and eluted during the washing step (D116A, I140A, K166A, and R167A); and (iii) mutants that appeared not to bind to immobilized rPlg K4 at all and hence eluted in the flow-through fractions (K148A, E150A, and D165A). Representative sensorgrams from the SPR analysis of rPlg K4 and Plg binding corresponding to the same concentration of each TN derivative are shown in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively. All experiments consistently showed the occurrence of a fast association and a biphasic dissociation phase with a fast and a slow component, an observation reminiscent of observations for similar protein systems (30MacKenzie C.R.

For the group of poorly binding mutants, the binding component with slow dissociation was found to be especially pronounced relative to the fast component of dissociation. Both components of the dissociation phase reflect specific interactions, because they can be efficiently competed by 5 mm 6-AHA (data not shown). rTN and each of the rTN mutants are all homotrimeric proteins with three potential binding sites. Therefore, a simple kinetic analysis may not be applied within this system. We have therefore chosen to evaluate the SPR binding data using a semiquantitative analytical method similar to that of MacKenzie et al. (30MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Deng S. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this approach, binding is assumed to be defined by a simple Langmuir relationship described by the following equation.Rpl=Rmax[L][L]+KD(Eq. 1) R pl denotes the measured response at the plateau, R max is the maximum response at binding site saturation, [L] is the ligand concentration, and K D is the dissociation constant. Firstly, estimates of R max and the apparent dissociation constant Kâ² D were determined by measuring the R pl at different concentrations of rTN ligand. The data from both the rPlg K4 chip and the Plg chip were then plotted versus ligand concentration according to the rearranged equation, which is as follows.RmaxRpl=1+KDâ²[L](Eq. 2) R max and Kâ² D were estimated by linear regression analysis (Fig. 5). R max for the rPlg K4 chip was found to be 598 Â± 52 RU, and Kâ² D was 0.50 Â± 0.05 Î¼m. For the Plg chip, R max was found to be 1159 Â± 34 RU, and Kâ² D was 0.17 Â± 0.01 Î¼m(Table III).Table IIIData obtained from the fit of the SPR binding data to the Langmuir expression for rTNrPlg K4Plgr20.990.99Rmax(RU)598 Â± 521159 Â± 34Kâ²D (Î¼m)0.50 Â± 0.050.17 Â± 0.01 Open table in a new tab Secondly, the binding of each single-residue mutant was analyzed in a series of experiments in which ligand (rTNi) was injected over the rPlg K4 and Plg chips at equal conditions (i.e.concentration, flow, and buffer), and the Kâ² Di was estimated from the R pl level (Table II). Three mutants (rTN K148A, rTN E150A, and rTN D165A) showed very low binding to both rPlg K4 and Plg. Each of these mutants was also identified as a nonbinder on rPlg K4-Sepharose. Both rTN E150A and rTN D165A represent mutations of calcium-coordinating residues at calcium site 2. The rest of the single-residue mutations only exhibited little effect on binding. Three single-residue substitutions, rTN K166A, rTN R167A, and I140A, all showed a lower affinity for rPlg K4 and Plg. These three mutants were also retarded on the rPlg K4 column. The calcium sensitivity of binding was further studied by characterization of mutants rTN D116A, rTN E120A, rTN Q143A, rTN D145A, and rTN N151A, which are all known calcium-coordinating residues. The SPR responses at the plateau levels were measured using both the rPlg K4 chip (Fig. 6) and the Plg chip (data not shown) at different calcium concentrations. Not only did these mutations affect the calcium sensitivity of rPlg K4 and Plg binding, but the transition from binding to nonbinding was found to be less sharp for this group of mutants, with mutation E120A exhibiting the slowest transition. The present study demonstrates that Plg K4 binds to TN by interacting with the CRDs. ITC analysis showed that the interaction between the kringle domain and the CRD is identical whether the CRD is free and monomeric or is an integral part of the TN trimer. Hence, there is no cooperative contribution to binding among the three CRDs in the TN trimer structure. The dissociation constant of the CRD-Plg K4 complex is approximately 50 Î¼m, as measured in solution, which probably explains why binding of the free monomeric CRD (rTN3) to Plg K4 was only detectable by ITC. As would be anticipated (30MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Deng S. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Rheinnecker M. Hardt C. Ilag L.L. Kufer P. Gruber R. Hoess A. Lupas A. Rottenberger C. PluÌckthun A. Pack P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2989-2997PubMed Google Scholar) from the presence of three independent K4 binding sites in each TN homotrimer, the interaction between TN and Plg K4 was found to be significantly stronger and allowed the demonstration of binding to immobilized Plg K4 or Plg and the estimation of binding constants by SPR (Kâ² D, 0.5 and 0.2 Î¼m, respectively). Thus, our detailed understanding of the interaction warrants the use of SPR analysis for characterization of mutant TN homotrimers as representative of the interaction between the mutant CRDs and Plg K4. The mutational analysis maps the Plg K4 binding site to a localized region defined by two of the calcium-coordinating residues in CRD calcium site 2 (Glu-150 and Asp-165) and to a surface-exposed lysine residue located close to (Lys-148). Other surface-exposed residues in the region appear to contribute little to the affinity. The observation that Plg K4 binding can be titrated by calcium and the decreased sensitivity exhibited by the calcium-coordinating mutants indicate that binding of Plg K4 only occurs when calcium site 2 is not occupied by a calcium ion. The calcium level corresponding to half-maximal binding, which was found to be 0.2 mm for both rPlg K4 and Plg, is in agreement with this hypothesis and also corroborates the original observation that only the Plg K4 domain in Plg interacts with TN. Notably, one of the mutants, TN D116A, involving one of the calcium-coordinating residues of site 1 that is located on the distal side of calcium site 1 in relation to site 2 exhibits slightly decreased affinity toward Plg K4 and a significantly decreased sensitivity to calcium. This finding, together with the observation that Glu-150, like Glu-193 in rat MBP, coordinates both to the calcium ion in site 1 with the backbone carbonyl oxygen and to the calcium ion in site 2 with the side chain (19Kastrup, J. S., Nielsen, B. B., Rasmussen, H., Holtet, T. L., Graversen, J. H., Etzerodt, M., ThÃ¸gersen, H. C., and Larsen, I. K. Acta Crystallogr. D54,757â766Google Scholar), may be taken as indication of a general cooperativity in calcium binding of the C-type lectin CRDs with two bound calcium ions. Interpretation of the results of the mutational analysis is limited by the fact that structural information is only available for the TN CRD with bound calcium ions, and that crystals of the CRD and Plg K4 in complex have not yet been obtained. However, we predict that the interacting areas in TN and Plg K4 are essentially restricted to the characterized binding site on the CRD and the lysine binding pocket on Plg K4, because the dissociation constant for the interaction between TN and immobilized rPlg K4 of around 50 Î¼m (at 0.1m NaCl) matches the dissociation constant in the binding of 6-AHA to the binding pocket of Plg K4 in solution, which has been reported to lie within the range of 20â80 Î¼m at 0â0.5m NaCl, respectively (26Nielsen P.R. Einer-Jensen K. Holtet T.L. Andersen B.D. Poulsen F.M. ThÃ¸gersen H.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13019-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Substantial additional interactions between the Plg K4 and the CRD would be expected to contribute to a significantly lower dissociation constant. Calcium-dependent binding of the TN CRD to ligands other than Plg K4 has not been demonstrated. The binding of complex sulfated oligosaccharides (i.e. fucoidan and heparin) to TN is calcium-independent, does not involve the CRD, and has recently been show to involve residues within the NH2-terminal domain of approximately 20 amino acid residues of TN. 4J. H. Graversen and R. H. Lorentsen, unpublished observations. The present finding may guide more specific and clarifying biological investigations of the physiological role of TN. In particular, the sensitivity to calcium ions of the weak interaction between TN and Plg may provide a means for a tissue to recruit Plg from plasma, thus requiring only the initiation of a process, which may provide its own regulation by calcium-modulated binding and release of Plg or Plg-derived products at TN-rich regions in the tissue. To our knowledge, the interaction between TN and Plg represents the first example of a calcium-sensitive protein-protein interaction directly involving the putative carbohydrate binding site of a C-type lectin CRD. Other C-type lectin CRDs have been reported to bind proteins (23Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Koizumi M. Kano H. Atoda H. Morita T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Bettler B. Texido G. Raggini S. RuÌegg D. Hofstetter H. J. Biol.

The number of proteins containing C-type lectin CRDs is large and is still growing. C-type CRDs have been reported to bind such diverse compounds as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and even ice. We anticipate that the Plg K4 binding site on TN, together with the mannose-binding site of MBP and possibly the ice-binding site of herring antifreeze protein, offers unique protein engineering based-opportunities to study the requirements of surface topology and chemistry for grafting new binding sites for very diverse compounds on an essentially conserved single-chain structural unit."

Three D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) were first identified in the context of the delayed early response to growth factor stimulation (1Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar), and their synthesis and assembly with their catalytic partners, cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)1and CDK6, depend upon mitogenic stimulation (reviewed in Ref. 2Sherr C.J.

Cyclin D-CDK holoenzymes play two established roles in facilitating progression through the G1 phase of the cell division cycle: (a) they catalyze the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb; Refs. 3Kato J.-Y.

Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3208) Google Scholar). The cyclin D- and E-dependent kinases collaborate in phosphorylating pRb, releasing E2F family transcription factors from pRb constraint and, in turn, enabling the E2Fs to coordinately activate a series of genes required for S-phase entry (5Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4308) Google Scholar, 6Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3208) Google Scholar, 7Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). Once activated, cyclin E-CDK2 phosphorylates p27Kip1 to target its proteasomal degradation as cells approach the G1-S-phase transition (8Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar,9Won K.-A. Reed S.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4182-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and it likely plays a role in activating cyclin A transcription at the G1-S-phase boundary (7Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). The DMP1 transcription factor was isolated by virtue of its physical interaction with cyclin D2 in a yeast two-hybrid screen (10Hirai H. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). DMP1 contains three tandem Myb-like repeats in its central portion that are flanked by acidic transactivating domains at both termini. The Myb-like motifs are required for DNA binding, but unlike other Myb family members, DMP1 binds to nonameric consensus sequences containing core GGA/T residues, a subset of which are also bound by Ets family proteins (11Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Physical interactions between any of the three D-type cyclins and DMP1 interfere with its binding to DNA, thereby abrogating DMP1-mediated gene expression (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, this inhibitory activity of D-type cyclins on DMP1 does not depend upon CDK4 or CDK6 or require their associated kinase activity. Conditional expression of DMP1 in fibroblasts blocks them from entering S phase. This ability of DMP1 to inhibit cell proliferation depends upon its DNA binding and transactivation functions, because mutants disrupted in either of these domains are biologically inert. Transient expression of D-type cyclins, but not that of cyclins A or B, can reverse this blockade in a manner that depends on the structural integrity of the cyclin D-DMP1 interface. In contrast, cyclin D point mutants that are deficient in binding CDK4 retain their ability to override G1-phase arrest by DMP1, emphasizing the dispensability of CDK4 in mediating DMP1-regulated transcription. Thus, one function of DMP1 may be to transactivate genes that inhibit S-phase entry in a manner that depends upon neither pRb phosphorylation nor cyclin D-dependent CDK activity (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). DMP1-regulated genes have not yet been identified, and here we show that CD13 (encoding aminopeptidase N; EC 3.4.11.2) represents such a target. The CD13 protein was originally characterized as an anonymous, highly type-specific cell surface marker of the myeloid lineage within the hematopoietic compartment (13Hogg N. Horton M.J. McMichael A.J. Leukocyte Typing III: Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, New York1987: 576-621Google Scholar).

The protein is now thought to play diverse tissue-specific roles in amino acid scavenging and the degradation of regulatory peptides (15Turner A.J. Hooper H.M. Kenny A.J. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J.

Secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) expression vectors driven by the Î²-actin promoter, SV40 early promoter, glucokinase promoter, or the Rous sarcoma virus promoter were kind gifts from Dr. Mike Coleman (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC).

Expression vectors encoding murine c-Myb (pCMV-c-Myb), murine Ets-1 (pEVRFO-Ets-1), and murine DMP1 (pFLEX-DMP1) were described previously (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8763-8771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed by a calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 8: 2745-2752Crossref Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) in serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells to minimize the influence of endogenous D-type cyclins that are not synthesized in quiescent cells (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of total cellular protein from lysates representing each transfection condition were tested for luciferase activity, and the resulting values were normalized to Î²-actin promoter-driven SEAP activity as described previously (29Hegde S.P. Kumar A. Kurschner C. Shapiro L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The DMP1 transcription factor binds specifically to an Ets-like consensus sequence, CCCG(G/T)ATGT, and its binding to an artificial reporter plasmid containing reiterated consensus sites fused upstream of a minimal promoter positively regulates gene expression (10Hirai H. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To investigate the activity of DMP1 in a more physiologically relevant context, we tested its ability to transactivate a series of naturally occurring promoters that contain potential DMP1 consensus binding sites. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were transiently cotransfected with a DMP1 expression plasmid together with a series of reporter plasmids, each driven by a different promoter. Two of the 10 promoters tested,CD13/APN and the long terminal repeat of the murine sarcoma virus (MSV), were transactivated to levels that were equal to the artificial reporter plasmid (BS2) used as the positive control (Fig. 1). The CD13/APNpromoter is coordinately regulated by the Ets-1 and Myb transcription factors in myeloid cells (28Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8763-8771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that DMP1 may bind to the CD13/APN Ets consensus sites and functionally interact with Myb to regulate gene transcription. Sequence analysis of the CD13/APN promoter identified three closely spaced Ets consensus sequences (GGAW, base pairs â354 through â328 from the transcriptional initiation site; Fig. 2 A) that are included within a region previously determined to be necessary for gene expression in myeloid cells (â411 through â291); a c-Myb binding site is located closely upstream (â381 through â376; Ref. 28Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8763-8771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA probes containing the Ets sites physically interact with the DNA-binding domain of bacterially expressed Ets-1. Importantly, this recombinant Ets-1 protein formed several distinct complexes with the DNA, suggesting that it binds to the individual Ets consensus sites (28Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8763-8771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One of the Ets sites in the CD13/APN promoter (Ets C in Fig. 2 A) is identical to the DMP1 consensus DNA binding sequence at all critical residues. To test whether the DMP1 protein interacts with the CD13/APN promoter through this site, we incubated lysates of insect Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus encoding FLAG-tagged recombinant DMP1 with an end-labeled 129-base pair genomic fragment encompassing all three Ets binding sites (â433 through â305). Sf9 lysates containing recombinant DMP1, but not control lysates of cells infected with vector alone, specifically retarded the migration of the probe in an EMSA (Fig. 3, lane 2 versus lane 1). Slower mobility (supershifted) complexes were generated upon the addition of antiserum directed to the FLAG epitope tag, confirming the specificity of DNA binding by baculovirus-derived DMP1 protein (lane 15). The binding of DMP1 to the probe was inhibited by the addition of excess unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, lane 3) as well as that of BS2 oligomers containing tandem DMP1 consensus sites (lanes 8 and 13). In contrast, competition by the non-DMP1-interacting Ets-specific M3 oligomer (see Fig. 2 B) was not observed (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 12) as expected (10Hirai H. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Notably, competition analysis with unlabeled oligomers containing sequences representing each of the threeCD13/APN Ets consensus sites (Ets A, Ets B, and Ets C;lanes 4â6 and lanes 9â11) indicated that DMP1 interacts solely with the Ets C site. Thus, DMP1 likely binds to the Ets C site to transactivate the CD13/APN promoter. We next wished to determine if endogenous DMP1 expressed at low levels in mammalian cells would also interact specifically with Ets C sequences within the CD13/APN promoter. To avoid interference from proteins that bind to sequences irrelevant to this study, we designed an oligonucleotide probe to specifically examine nuclear protein binding to the Ets C site (Fig. 2 B). BecauseCD13/APN transcription levels are highest in early myeloid cells (29Hegde S.P. Kumar A. Kurschner C. Shapiro L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of endogenous DMP1 in nuclear lysates of the KG1a myeloblastic cell line to bind to the C-site probe in an EMSA. The incubation of KG1a nuclear extracts with the end-labeled oligonucleotide C-site probe resulted in the formation of three complexes (Fig. 4 A, lane 1), one of which migrated at a position corresponding to that of the recombinant DMP1-DNA complex (lane 9). The formation of the two slower-migrating complexes was efficiently inhibited by the addition of an excess of unlabeled C-site probe (lane 2), implying that the faster complex may not depend on the presence of sequence-specific-binding proteins. The addition of either a Myb consensus site oligomer or one containing a scrambled Ets site (M1) did not affect complex formation (lanes 3 and 6). An excess of the BS2 oligomer containing DMP1 consensus binding sites efficiently abolished the formation of only the intermediate mobility complex (lane 4), whereas competition with the M3 Ets-specific oligonucleotide completely inhibited the formation of the slower-mobility complex (lane 5), leaving the complex with intermediate mobility intact. These data suggested that the complex with intermediate mobility contained DMP1, whereas the slower-migrating complex contained an Ets family member. We next added antibodies directed against the DMP1 carboxyl terminus to the binding reactions. Supershift of the intermediate mobility complex with anti-DMP1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 8), but not with normal rabbit serum (lane 7), helped to confirm the presence of endogenous DMP1 in complexes with radiolabeled C-site sequences. Thus, although present at low physiologic levels and added together with many other nuclear proteins, endogenous DMP1 can physically interact with the Ets C site of the CD13/APN promoter, reinforcing the likelihood that such interactions can also occur in intact myeloid cells. Although both DMP1 and an Ets factor are able to bind to theCD13/APN Ets C site in myeloid cell lysates, the binding of one protein might be preferred over the other. To address this issue, we determined the relative stabilities of the DMP1-DNA and Ets-DNA complexes by measuring the dissociation rates of preformed complexes in the presence of a vast excess of unlabeled competitor DNA (Fig. 4 B). EMSA studies using the Ets C site oligonucleotide probe, KG1a nuclear lysates, and a fixed amount of Ets C site competitor oligonucleotide indicated that the half-life of the DMP1-DNA complexes was between 20 and 40 min as compared with less than 1 min for the Ets-DNA complexes (Fig. 4 B). These data are consistent with a more prominent role of DMP1 in regulatingCD13/APN gene expression in myeloid cells. If the protein generated from the DMP1 expression vector directly binds to the Ets C site, mutation of this site should profoundly alter the protein's ability to transactivate the CD13/APN promoter. We therefore created a reporter plasmid containing four altered nucleotides of the single Ets C site in the context of the â411lucCD13/APN wild-type promoter plasmid (Fig. 2 B). Transient transactivation assays of the C-site mutant plasmid (â411 luc Ets C mut) with DMP1 expression plasmid revealed no significant increase in reporter gene activity, whereas the wild-type promoter plasmid, â411luc, was activated to levels that were approximately fivefold above background (Fig. 5). A DMP1 point mutant (M11) that is unable to bind DNA (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was unable to activate the wild-type promoter-reporter. Thus, it appears that DMP1 must bind to the C site before it can transactivate CD13/APNexpression. Different classes of transcription factors generally interact combinatorially with each other and with coactivating accessory proteins to achieve optimal gene expression. The ability of DMP1 to transactivate the CD13/APN promoter through its binding to one of the Myb-cooperative Ets consensus sites prompted us to investigate whether DMP1 acts in concert with other transcription factors as well. Transient transfection of incremental doses of either DMP1, Ets-1, or c-Myb expression plasmids with â411luc each resulted in dose-dependent increases in reporter gene activity (Fig. 6, AâC). Cotransfection of the c-Myb and Ets-1 plasmids with the CD13/APN reporter resulted in higher-than-additive promoter activity (Fig. 6 D), thereby demonstrating the cooperative interaction between these proteins. In parallel experiments, coexpression of the DMP1 and Ets-1 plasmids produced values of reporter gene expression that were lower than those obtained with the separate proteins (Fig. 6 E). This is consistent with the idea that DMP1 and Ets compete for binding at the Ets C site and do not functionally interact with one another. In contrast, cotransfection of c-Myb and DMP1 plasmids led to a synergistic response greater than that seen with either transcription factor alone (Fig. 6 F). Like Ets-1, then, DMP1 can cooperatively interact with c-Myb to activate gene expression. We next assessed the transregulatory functions of the DMP1 protein required for its cooperative interaction with c-Myb. Expression plasmids encoding a mutant DMP1 protein (designated M10) that retained only its DNA-binding domain but lacked transactivating activity (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) failed to complement Myb-dependent transactivation of theCD13/APN promoter in NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 7). Similarly, a DMP1 mutant (M11) harboring a point mutation that blocks its interaction with DNA failed to potentiate c-Myb activity. Thus, the ability of DMP1 to bind to DNA is necessary for both the transactivation of target genes and the functional interaction with c-Myb. However, DNA binding alone is not sufficient, because the interaction with c-Myb depends on the integrity of DMP1's transactivating domains (missing in M10). DMP1 was originally isolated by virtue of its binding to D-type cyclins (10Hirai H. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and physical interactions of D-type cyclins with DMP1 prevent its binding to DNA (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cotransfection of plasmids expressing D-type cyclins inhibits DMP1-driven transactivation of artificial reporter plasmids. Importantly, this function of D-type cyclins is entirely independent of their ability to bind to their catalytic partners, CDK4 and CDK6 (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To test whether D-type cyclins would similarly inhibit DMP1-dependent CD13/APNtranscription in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, we cotransfected the cells with expression plasmids containing sequences encoding various cyclin family members together with a constant amount of the DMP1-encoding expression plasmid and the â411luc reporter plasmid (Fig. 8). Although DMP1 alone increased reporter gene activity by nearly fivefold, the addition of plasmids encoding any of the D-type cyclins completely abrogated transactivation of the promoter. A cyclin D1 mutant (K114) that does not bind to CDK4 retained its ability to interfere with DMP1-induced gene expression. By contrast, cyclins A, B, C, and H, which do not physically interact with DMP1, did not significantly affect the DMP1 transactivation of CD13/APN. The addition of a plasmid expressing the p27Kip1 CDK inhibitor protein increased reporter gene levels twofold, presumably by sequestering endogenous D-type cyclin proteins expressed in the cells and thereby relieving inhibition. These data corroborate earlier results obtained with artificial promoters (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and reinforce the link between transcriptional regulation by DMP1 and D-type cyclins. Artificial promoter-reporter constructs engineered to contain consensus DNA binding sites for individual transcription factors are useful in assessing gene expression, but they often fail to simulate cooperative activities triggered by combinations of different transcription factors assembled on native promoters (33Ptashne M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). For example, c-Myb and Ets-1 activate transcription when tested alone on artificial reporter plasmids, but in combination, their transregulatory effects can be additive (35Melotti P. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25303-25309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), synergistic (28Shapiro L.H. J. Biol.

Med. 1994; 180: 2309-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), depending on the context of binding sites within a promoter. With this in mind, we initiated a search for naturally occurring promoters that could be transactivated by the DMP1 transcription factor; in a survey of 10 promoters, we observed that the distal CD13/APNmyeloid promoter was transactivated to the same extent as an artificial promoter construct containing six concatamerized DMP1 binding sites. Our previous characterization of transcription factors that control expression of the CD13/APN promoter in myeloid cells (28Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8763-8771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,29Hegde S.P. Kumar A. Kurschner C. Shapiro L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) helped to facilitate investigations of DMP1 interactions with Ets family members and with c-Myb. Three closely spaced sites (designated Ets A, Ets B, and Ets C) are critical for transactivation of the CD13/APN promoter by both the Ets-1 and Ets-2 transcription factors in myeloid cells (28Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8763-8771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,29Hegde S.P. Kumar A. Kurschner C. Shapiro L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but only the Ets C site is a DMP1 binding consensus sequence. Electrophoretic mobility shift and competition analyses of a segment of the promoter that included the Ets binding sites indicated that baculovirus-derived recombinant DMP1 protein interacted specifically with the Ets C motif. Conversely, mutation of this site severely impaired the ability of DMP1 to transactivate the promoter in fibroblasts. The analysis of nuclear lysates from KGla early myeloid cells using an oligonucleotide probe containing only the Ets C (DMP1) site indicated that both endogenous DMP1 and a putative Ets family member are able to bind to this element in extracts containing other nuclear proteins. Although both types of interactions might well occur in myeloid cells, competition analysis indicated that DMP1 binds with a significantly longer half-life than does the Ets factor, strengthening the idea that at the myeloblast stage represented by KGla cells, DMP1 binds to the Ets C site to control CD13/APN gene expression. The CD13/APN promoter is transactivated by cooperative interaction between c-Myb bound to its cognate site and Ets-1 tethered to at least one of the three GGA-core containing sites located between 30 and 50 base pairs downstream (28Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8763-8771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DMP1 substituted for Ets-1 in this assay and synergized even more strongly with c-Myb to produce higher-than-additive reporter gene expression. The fact that DMP1, Ets-1, and Ets-2 bind within a 30-base pair region on theCD13/APN promoter and that each of these factors can cooperate with Myb to activate transcription is intriguing and raises the question of the specificity of transcription factor cooperativity with Myb. There are several constraints that affect gene expression even on this single promoter: (a) Ets-1 binding to the Ets C site interfered with DMP1 transactivation, suggesting that the ability of Ets-1 to cooperate with c-Myb may require its binding to the Ets A or Ets B sites. Consistent with this interpretation, DMP1 bound more stably than Ets-1 to the Ets C site, but it cannot bind to Ets A or Ets B at all; and (b) although Ets-1 and Ets-2 can collaborate with c-Myb, four other Ets family proteins, including Fli-1, Pu.1, Erg, and Elf-1, were unable to synergize with Myb on the CD13/APNpromoter (28Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8763-8771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 2L. H. Shapiro, unpublished data. However, the Erg protein binds specifically to the Ets B site in gel shift analyses performed with KGla cell lysates, 2L. H. Shapiro, unpublished data. suggesting that it might potentially compete with Ets-1 and Ets-2. These observations reveal that simple binding of a functional transcription factor to the Ets sites of the CD13/APN promoter is not sufficient to yield cooperation with c-Myb, and in this light, DMP1 interaction with c-Myb assumes greater significance. D-type cyclins were recently shown to interact with the v-Myb oncoprotein in a CDK-independent fashion (39Ganter B. Fu S.-L. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). v-Myb is a virally derived, truncated transcription factor containing two prototypic Myb-like repeats in lieu of the three repeats in c-Myb (40Boyle W.J. Lampert M.A. Lipsick J.S. Baluda M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4265-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Biedenkapp H.U. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer H. Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Similar to DMP1, D-type cyclins physically interact with the oncogenic v-Myb protein and functionally inhibit its transregulatory activity. However, in distinct contrast to DMP1 inhibition by D-type cyclin, in which their physical interaction abrogates DNA binding (12Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the interaction of v-Myb with D-type cyclins was reported not to affect its ability to bind DNA (39Ganter B. Fu S.-L. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, physical interactions with D-type cyclins inhibit transactivation by two proteins containing similar structural motifs, but apparently through distinct mechanisms. Pertinent to CD13/APN expression, D-type cyclins have no effect on the transcriptional activity of c-Myb (39Ganter B. Fu S.-L. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and thus would affect the DMP1 but not c-Myb transregulation of this gene. Regulation of transcription factors by D-type cyclins in a CDK-independent fashion is not unprecedented. Cyclin D binding to the estrogen receptor activates the transcription of responsive genes in a hormone-independent manner (42Zwijsen R.M.L. Wientijens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J.A.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 43Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. Direnzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W.

What is the physiological relevance of the cooperative interaction between Myb and DMP1 for the regulation of APN expression? DMP1 is ubiquitously expressed, but c-Myb is thought to be primarily restricted to the hematopoietic compartment in which CD13/APN is exclusively found on cells of the myeloid lineage. It seems reasonable to conclude that cooperative activity between DMP1 and c-Myb could regulate CD13/APN expression in myeloid cells; indeed, our EMSA experiments indicate that endogenous DMP1 interacts with theCD13/APN myeloid promoter in KG1a extracts. However, both c-Myb and APN are also coexpressed in several nonhematopoietic cell types (44Thompson M.A. Ramsay R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2000531621,"We detected in the brain and then cloned two novel, short forms of human and mouse fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-5 mRNA, which were designated human FGF-5S (hFGF-5S) and mouse FGF-5S (mFGF-5S), respectively. Genomic analysis indicated that mFGF-5S and authentic mFGF-5 mRNAs were transcribed from a single gene; hFGF-5S and mFGF-5S mRNAs were generated by excluding the second exon of the respective FGF-5 genes, and the alternatively spliced mRNAs encoded for 123- and 121-amino acid proteins, respectively. Indeed, a neuron-like cell line expressing mFGF-5S mRNA secreted a protein of the expected size and with FGF-5 antigenicity. In PC12 cells, expression of hFGF-5 or exposure to hFGF-5 protein induced differentiation. Neither expression of hFGF-5S, alone, nor co-expression of hFGF-5S with hFGF-5 induced significant differentiation. At high concentrations, hFGF-5S protein partially antagonized FGF-5 activity, whereas by itself, hFGF-5S exerted very weak neurotrophic activity. hFGF-5S protein binds to FGF receptor (FGFR)-1 on PC12 transfectants and partially inhibits hFGF-5-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR-1 and an FGFR substrate, but it also induces phosphorylation by itself. These results suggest that FGF-5S is a naturally expressed partial agonist/antagonist of FGF-5 neurotrophic activity in the brain and that its effects are exerted in part at the level of the receptor."

A higher rate of germline mutations at human hypervariable minisatellite loci was reported in children born from parents exposed to radiation after Chernobyl, implicating genome destabilization as a possible mechanism responsible for late radiation effects in humans. To test if radiation-induced carcinogenesis in the thyroid gland may be associated with somatic minisatellite instability or microsatellite instability, we utilized a PCR-based approach to study normal and tumor DNA from 17 pediatric post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas for mutations at three different minisatellite loci (D1S80, D17S30, ApoB), and 27 microsatellite loci of di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide repeats. Minisatellite instability was found in three (18%) tumors, with one of them exhibiting mutations in all three minisatellite loci, whereas two others showed mutations in one of two informative markers. By contrast, none of 20 sporadic thyroid cancers from patients with no history of radiation exposure was positive for minisatellite instability. Microsatellite analysis of post-Chernobyl tumors revealed a mutation in one (6%) tumor only at the locus of D10S1412, whereas all other 26 microsatellite markers showed identical patterns in each normal/tumor pair. Our results suggest that somatic cell microsatellite instability does not contribute to radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis. However, somatic minisatellite mutation events are present in a subset of radiation-induced, but not sporadic, thyroid cancers, suggesting that this type of genomic instability may play a role in radiation-induced tumorigenesis in the thyroid gland."

Here we report the isolation of genomic and cDNA clones encoding the Drosophila homologue of AP-2, designated DAP-2. The predicted amino acid sequence exhibits 42-45% overall identity with the vertebrate AP-2 proteins. A sequence of 107 amino acids within the DNA binding and dimerization domain of the vertebrate AP-2 proteins is highly conserved (90-92%) with the DAP-2 homologue. An in vitro translation product of DAP-2 cDNA binds specifically to AP-2 consensus binding sites. DAP-2 was also shown to be functionally conserved in vivo because transient transfection of a DAP-2 expression plasmid activated transcription through AP-2 binding sites in both mammalian and Drosophila cell lines. DAP-2 is expressed during early embryogenesis and DAP-2 transcripts are also detected in the adult. Whole-mount in situ hybridizations demonstrated that DAP-2 is expressed initially at stage 9 of Drosophila embryonic development and that DAP-2 transcripts are detected in regions of the brain, eye-antennal disc, optical lobe, antenno-maxillary complex, and in a subset of cells of the ventral nerve cord. The cloning of DAP-2 and the identification of the DAP-2 expression pattern during embryogenesis provides a starting point to address the function of AP-2 during differentiation and development in a well understood model system."

Despite considerable progress that has been made in describing the expression pattern of BGN under normal and various pathological conditions, little is known of how the information conveyed by extracellular stimuli leads to changes in BGN gene activity.

As expected for a protein with a constitutive and specific spatial and temporal expression pattern, multiple consensus sequences for known DNA-binding proteins were identified that when bound to their cognate trans-acting factors may support basal transcriptional activity or relay information from cytokine and hormone stimulation into changes of gene activity. For instance, the presence of several interleukin-6 response elements correlated with transcriptional activation by interleukin-6 in the breast cancer cell line T47D (19Ungefroren H. Krull N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15787-15795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, a short region was identified in the BGN promoter that was differentially regulated in individuals with sex chromosome anomalies and that bound to the transcription factor c-Krox in vitro (20Heegaard A.M.

Clustered in the proximal BGN promoter are putative binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factors Sp1 and AP2, both of which can function as enhancer-binding proteins and can stimulate basal transcription through direct interaction with components of the basal transcription machinery. Both proteins are also targeted by certain signaling pathways through protein-protein interactions or post-translational modifications. For instance, AP2 activity is stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (21Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), and both AP2 and Sp1 have been shown to increase transcription in response to the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) (21Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 22Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).In the course of studies that investigated the role of cAMP in the regulation of the prolactin (PRL) gene in myometrial smooth muscle cells (mSMC) (23Bohnhoff A. Gellersen B. Endocr. J. 1996; 5: 241-246Crossref Google Scholar), it was discovered that BGN mRNA expression was strongly induced in long term cultures of myometrial tissue explants; since after several days in culture mSMC spontaneously increase the formation of cAMP (23Bohnhoff A. Gellersen B. Endocr. J. 1996; 5: 241-246Crossref Google Scholar), it was conceivable that up-regulation of the BGN gene occurred in response to cAMP in one or more myometrial cell types. Prompted by this observation in conjunction with recent results from our laboratory showing that the human BGN gene is transcriptionally regulated by cAMP in osteosarcoma cells (24Ungefroren H. Cikos T. Krull N.B. Kalthoff H. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate in greater detail the molecular basis of basal and cAMP-regulated transcription in myometrial cells. By using the leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-UT-1, we demonstrate that 1) BGN mRNA expression is strongly up-regulated by forskolin and that this up-regulation is, at least in part, transcriptional, 2) induction of BGN gene expression by cAMP involves activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and 3) basal and cAMP-induced transcription from the BGN gene is partially mediated through Sp1-like/Sp3 proteins binding to a pyrimidine-rich cis-element in the proximal promoter region. This study is thus the first one to provide an identification of a trans-acting factor(s) involved in BGN gene expression in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have analyzed the molecular components involved in basal and cAMP-dependent transcription of the BGN gene in the human leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-UT-1. The increase in BGN mRNA levels observed upon treatment of these cells with 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin was primarily transcriptional as judged from up-regulation of transiently transfected BGN promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and was mediated by PKA. Partial mapping of the cAMP-responsive regions in a homologous and a heterologous promoter context in combination with DNA-nuclear protein binding, competition, and supershift studies led to the identification of a short pyrimidine-rich sequence in the proximal promoter (nts â59 to â49) that served as a binding site for Sp1-like and Sp3 transcription factors. A mutation of this element that disrupted binding of the Sp1-like/Sp3 proteins dramatically decreased both basal and cAMP-stimulated transcription from transfected human BGN promoter-reporter constructs.Transcriptional regulation by cAMP typically involves nuclear translocation of the free catalytic subunits of PKA which then phosphorylate and thereby increase the transactivation potential of CRE-binding proteins (38Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). However, since no CRE-like sequences are present in the proximal BGN promoter, a participation of this class of transcription factors seems unlikely. Nevertheless, the rapid rise in cAMP-induced promoter activity and the fact that we could not observe any qualitative differences in specific protein binding to the â78 to â35 region between 8-Br-cAMP/forskolin-treated and untreated cells favors a direct mode of regulation (see below).Interestingly, we found that PKI decreased BGN transcriptional activity in the absence of activators of PKA suggesting that SK-UT-1 cells contain a significant level of free PKA catalytic subunits that contribute to a basal level of transcription. The close functional connection between basal and cAMP-mediated BGN transcription in SK-UT-1 cells is also reflected at the sequence level; 5â²-deletion analysis and transfection studies with wt and mutant sequences showed that all or part of the sequence centered around â56 in the BGN promoter accounted not only for a significant portion of basal activity but also for cAMP responsiveness. Of note, this sequence retained some of these functions when present in the reverse orientation and in a heterologous promoter context and may thus constitute an enhancer. An examination of the promoter sequence revealed an Sp1-like site (CCCTCCCC) at â59/â52, and subsequent supershift and competition analysis demonstrated binding of both an Sp1-like and an Sp3-like protein at this element. More rigorous mutagenesis then showed that additional nucleotides at the 3â² end were required for effective binding of Sp1-like/Sp3 proteins and that the C residues at positions â58/â57 and â55/â54 were critical for this interaction. Identical or very similar pyrimidine-rich sequences (also referred to as CT elements) have been found to bind Sp1-related proteins in the promoters of several other genes,e.g. the rat ornithine decarboxylase gene (35Kumar A.P. Butler A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the c-myc gene (39DesJardins E. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5710-5724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the hepatocyte growth factor gene (40Jiang J.G. Chen Q. Bell A. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the human Î±2(I) collagen gene (41Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the protein from complex I that reacted with the Sp1 antibody was likely not to be Sp1 as recombinant Sp1 failed to bind to the CT element in the proximal BGN promoter. Since this protein was not recognized by antibodies to Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 in supershift experiments, it could represent a novel member of this class of transcriptional regulators. This was given support by results from immunoblots with SK-UT-1 nuclear proteins showing that the same Sp1 antibody detected several specific bands of which only two (106 and 95 kDa) are known to represent Sp1 itself. Studies are now underway to purify, characterize, and clone this Sp1-related factor. The protein from complex II was identified as Sp3 (42Hagen G. MuÌller S. Beato G. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 43Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) by antibody supershift and subsequent Western blot analysis. This was not surprising as Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the same or very similar DNA-binding sites in gene promoters (44Lania L. Majello B. Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) eventually resulting in a gel shift pattern of striking similarity to that in the BGN promoter (45Schanke J.T. Durning M. Johnson K.J. Bennett L.K. Golos T.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 405-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, in vitro binding studies with various mutant versions of the â59/â49 sequence resulted in a simultaneous disappearance of both proteins suggesting a competition between them for binding to the CT element.The precise functional role of each of these factors upon interaction with the proximal BGN promoter remains speculative at this stage. Whereas Sp1 in most cellular systems stimulates transcription, Sp3 has been shown to be a bifunctional regulator that can act either as a transcriptional repressor or activator of Sp1-mediated transactivation depending on cell type and promoter context (reviewed in Ref. 44Lania L. Majello B. Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Repression may occur in an active fashion due to the presence of a putative repressor domain in the Sp3 protein (44Lania L. Majello B. Luca P. Int. J. Biochem.

Recently, Kennett and co-workers (37Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) found that the 78â80-kDa isoforms of Sp3 that arise via internal translational initiation function as potent inhibitors of Sp1/Sp3-mediated transcription. Strikingly, we detected this doublet in immunoblots of SK-UT-1 nuclear proteins at an equal intensity as the full-length protein. However, it remains to be tested which of these different Sp3 isoforms bind to the CT element in the BGN promoter in vivo.The mutation of the Sp1/Sp3-binding site in BGN-78-Luc reduced cAMP inducibility to the level seen with BGN-46-Luc, whereas basal promoter activity, although strongly diminished, was still significantly higher than in BGN-46-Luc. This indicates that additional cis-acting sequences within the â78 to â46 region contribute to basal transcription. A likely candidate is the Sp1 consensus sequence at â78 which was shown to bind an Sp1(-like) factor, most likely Sp1 itself. In fibroblasts, Sp1 binding has recently also been detected at an Sp1 consensus site located further upstream (â216) (20Heegaard A.M. Gehron Robey P. Vogel W. Just W. Widom R.L. Scholler J. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2050-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors (others than Sp1) play a role in the transcriptional regulation of a large and diverse array of genes, among which are other extracellular matrix genes. In the mouse syndecan-1 gene whose promoter shares several features with the BGN gene (TATA-less, GC-rich 5â²-flanking region with several putative Sp1 sites), Sp1-like factors were shown to be responsible for the constitutive expression in epithelial cells (46Vihinen T.

In the human Î±2(I) collagen gene an Sp1/Sp3-binding site (TCCTCC) mediates both basal transcriptional activity and oncostatin M stimulation (41Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Whereas the involvement of Sp1-like proteins in conferring high levels of constitutive and cytokine/hormone-stimulated transcriptional activity to many genes is well established, their participation in cAMP-regulation is less well documented and has so far only been clearly demonstrated for the bovine CYP11A gene (22Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the rhesus monkey growth hormone-variant gene (45Schanke J.T. Durning M. Johnson K.J. Bennett L.K. Golos T.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 405-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If one postulates a direct mode of regulation for the cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway in inducing BGN gene expression (see above), then the question arises how it is mechanistically linked to the Sp1-like/Sp3 proteins. Rather than recruitment of new proteins to DNA-binding sites, the effects of cAMP may involve modulation of protein-protein interactions, transcriptional complex assembly, or post-translational modifications of a trans-acting protein. Post-translational modifications by the protein kinase A pathway have been described (47Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 48Lamph W.W. Dwarki V.J. Ofir R. Montminy M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Specifically, Sp1 can be phosphorylated (53Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), but it does not have a PKA phosphorylation site. However, this may not be true for the Sp1-like protein binding to the BGN promoter, and it is thus conceivable that its transactivation function is increased upon phosphorylation by PKA. Alternatively, the Sp1-like/Sp3 factors bound to the BGN promoter in SK-UT-1 cells may interact with a cell-specific coactivator that itself is not a DNA-binding protein but can serve as a target for PKA and subsequently activate the Sp1-like/Sp3 proteins.Preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that cAMP regulation of BGN gene expression is also operating in mSMC, the predominant cell type in myometrial tissue. What could be the physiological significance of cAMP-mediated up-regulation of BGN expression in myometrial cells? Adenylate cyclase activity has been reported to increase in the human myometrium during pregnancy (54Europe-Finner G.N. Phaneuf S. Watson S.P. Bernal A.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2484-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), reflecting stimulation by hormones like gonadotropins, PGE2, relaxin, and/or corticotropin-releasing factor that act through elevation of intracellular cAMP. This could result in chronic activation of BGN synthesis and may indicate a greater need for BGN for uterine growth during pregnancy and/or the preparation process of the uterus for parturition. A relevant reproduction-associated participation is well documented in the uterine cervix, a tissue that undergoes a profound connective tissue turnover in preparation for parturition. Interestingly, PGE2 has been reported to increase BGN expression markedly in final cervical ripening during labor (55Norman M. Ekman G. MalmstroÌm A. Obstet. Gynecol. 1993; 81: 217-223PubMed Google Scholar,56Norman M. Ekman G. MalmstroÌm A. Obstet. Gynecol. 1993; 82: 1013-1020PubMed Google Scholar).We have demonstrated previously that the human BGN gene is transcriptionally induced by cAMP in bone cells (24Ungefroren H. Cikos T. Krull N.B. Kalthoff H. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and as shown in this study, this also applies to cells of myometrial origin. This would suggest that the cAMP/PKA signal transduction pathway is of more general importance for BGN regulation. This assumption may facilitate the identification of physiological modulators of BGN gene expression and may ultimately help to unravel the biological functions of this PG. Biglycan (BGN)1 (1Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a prototype member of a growing family of proteoglycans (PGs), the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) (reviewed in Refs. 2Kresse H.

In most tissues BGN exists as a classical PG in which the core protein is substituted with two chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains. As an extracellular PG, BGN is involved in the regulation of matrix assembly and growth factor activity due to its ability to bind collagen type I (5SchoÌnherr E. Witsch-Prehm P. Harrach B.
