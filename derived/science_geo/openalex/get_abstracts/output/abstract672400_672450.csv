https://openalex.org/W3153732845,"Abstract Analysis of human blood immune cells provides insights into the coordinated response to viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We performed single-cell transcriptome, surface proteome and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor analyses of over 780,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cross-sectional cohort of 130 patients with varying severities of COVID-19. We identified expansion of nonclassical monocytes expressing complement transcripts ( CD16 + C1QA/B/C + ) that sequester platelets and were predicted to replenish the alveolar macrophage pool in COVID-19. Early, uncommitted CD34 + hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were primed toward megakaryopoiesis, accompanied by expanded megakaryocyte-committed progenitors and increased platelet activation. Clonally expanded CD8 + T cells and an increased ratio of CD8 + effector T cells to effector memory T cells characterized severe disease, while circulating follicular helper T cells accompanied mild disease. We observed a relative loss of IgA2 in symptomatic disease despite an overall expansion of plasmablasts and plasma cells. Our study highlights the coordinated immune response that contributes to COVID-19 pathogenesis and reveals discrete cellular components that can be targeted for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3156171608,"The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is a function of contact rates among individuals, transmission probability, and duration of infectiousness. We sought to determine the association between population density and R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 across U.S. counties. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using linear mixed models with random intercept and fixed slopes to assess the association of population density and R 0 , and controlled for state-level effects using random intercepts. We also assessed whether the association was differential across county-level main mode of transportation percentage as a proxy for transportation accessibility, and adjusted for median household income. The median R 0 among the United States counties was 1.66 (IQR: 1.35–2.11). A population density threshold of 22 people/km 2 was needed to sustain an outbreak. Counties with greater population density have greater rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely due to increased contact rates in areas with greater density. An increase in one unit of log population density increased R 0 by 0.16 (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.19). This association remained when adjusted for main mode of transportation and household income. The effect of population density on R 0 was not modified by transportation mode. Our findings suggest that dense areas increase contact rates necessary for disease transmission. SARS-CoV-2 R 0 estimates need to consider this geographic variability for proper planning and resource allocation, particularly as epidemics newly emerge and old outbreaks resurge."
https://openalex.org/W3153235290,"Metastasis has been considered as the terminal step of tumor progression. However, recent genomic studies suggest that many metastases are initiated by further spread of other metastases. Nevertheless, the corresponding pre-clinical models are lacking, and underlying mechanisms are elusive. Using several approaches, including parabiosis and an evolving barcode system, we demonstrated that the bone microenvironment facilitates breast and prostate cancer cells to further metastasize and establish multi-organ secondary metastases. We uncovered that this metastasis-promoting effect is driven by epigenetic reprogramming that confers stem cell-like properties on cancer cells disseminated from bone lesions. Furthermore, we discovered that enhanced EZH2 activity mediates the increased stemness and metastasis capacity. The same findings also apply to single cell-derived populations, indicating mechanisms distinct from clonal selection. Taken together, our work revealed an unappreciated role of the bone microenvironment in metastasis evolution and elucidated an epigenomic reprogramming process driving terminal-stage, multi-organ metastases."
https://openalex.org/W3156888814,"Fast and wide field-of-view imaging with single-cell resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio, and no optical aberrations have the potential to inspire new avenues of investigations in biology. However, such imaging is challenging because of the inevitable tradeoffs among these parameters. Here, we overcome these tradeoffs by combining a resonant scanning system, a large objective with low magnification and high numerical aperture, and highly sensitive large-aperture photodetectors. The result is a practically aberration-free, fast-scanning high optical invariant two-photon microscopy (FASHIO-2PM) that enables calcium imaging from a large network composed of ∼16,000 neurons at 7.5 Hz from a 9 mm2 contiguous image plane, including more than 10 sensory-motor and higher-order areas of the cerebral cortex in awake mice. Network analysis based on single-cell activities revealed that the brain exhibits small-world rather than scale-free behavior. The FASHIO-2PM is expected to enable studies on biological dynamics by simultaneously monitoring macroscopic activities and their compositional elements."
https://openalex.org/W3156657821,"In attempts to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus, many governments have resorted to imposing national lockdowns on their citizens. Previous research has demonstrated the passage of time becomes distorted for many people during these lockdowns. To date, research has only examined how time was experienced early in initial lockdowns. The current study examined whether distortions to the passage of time were also present later into the global pandemic. An online questionnaire was used to collect passage of time judgments for the day, week and 8 month period since the first UK lockdown. In addition, measures of affect, social satisfaction, task-load, compliance and health status were also recorded. The results show that over 80% of people reported experiencing distortion to the passage of time during the second English lockdown in comparison with normal. Depression, satisfaction with social interaction and shielding status were found to be significant predictors of temporal distortion. A slower passage of time was associated with greater depression, shielding and greater dissatisfaction with social interactions. Feeling like it was longer than 8 months since the UK’s first lockdown was associated with greater depression, increased dissatisfaction with social interaction and greater change of life as a result of lockdown. The results suggest that distortions to the passage of time are an enduring feature of lockdown life and that different factors predict temporal experience during different points in lockdown."
https://openalex.org/W3156360893,"Background Efficient and early triage of hospitalized Covid-19 patients to detect those with higher risk of severe disease is essential for appropriate case management. Methods We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Results A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression. Conclusions This machine-learning model, applied at hospital admission, predicts risk of severe disease progression in Covid-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3153835329,"Background Keeping up motivation to learn when socially isolated during a pandemic can be challenging. In medical schools, the COVID-19 pandemic required a complete switch to e-learning without any direct patient contact despite early reports showing that medical students preferred face-to-face teaching in clinical setting. We designed close to real-life patient e-learning modules to transmit competency-based learning contents to medical students and evaluated their responses about their experience. Methods Weekly e-learning cases covering a 10-week leading symptom-based curriculum were designed by a team of medical students and physicians. The internal medicine curriculum (HeiCuMed) at the Heidelberg University Medical School is a mandatory part of clinical medical education in the 6 th or 7 th semester. Case-design was based on routine patient encounters and covered different clinical settings: preclinical emergency medicine, in-patient and out-patient care and follow-up. Individual cases were evaluated online immediately after finishing the respective case. The whole module was assessed at the end of the semester. Free-text answers were analyzed with MaxQDa following Mayring`s principles of qualitative content analyses. Results N = 198 students (57.6% female, 42.4% male) participated and 1252 individual case evaluations (between 49.5% and 82.5% per case) and 51 end-of-term evaluations (25.8% of students) were collected. Students highly appreciated the offer to apply their clinical knowledge in presented patient cases. Aspects of clinical context, interactivity, game-like interface and embedded learning opportunities of the cases motivated students to engage with the asynchronously presented learning materials and work through the cases. Conclusions Solving and interpreting e-learning cases close to real-life settings promoted students’ motivation during the COVID-19 pandemic and may partially have compensated for missing bedside teaching opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W3153162760,"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is spreading across the globe. By 30 Sep 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the number of cases worldwide had reached 34 million with more than one million deaths. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) registered the first case of COVID-19 on 2 Mar 2020. Since then, the number of infections has been increasing gradually on a daily basis. On 20 Sep 2020, the KSA reported 334,605 cases, with 319,154 recoveries and 4,768 deaths. The KSA has taken several measures to control the spread of COVID-19, especially during the Umrah and Hajj events of 1441, including stopping Umrah and performing this year’s Hajj in reduced numbers from within the Kingdom, and imposing a curfew on the cities of the Kingdom from 23 Mar to 28 May 2020. In this article, two statistical models were used to measure the impact of the curfew on the spread of COVID-19 in KSA. The two models are Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Spatial Time-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) model. We used the data obtained from 31 May to 11 October 2020 to assess the model of STARIMA for the COVID-19 confirmation cases in (Makkah, Jeddah, and Taif) in KSA. The results show that STARIMA models are more reliable in forecasting future epidemics of COVID-19 than ARIMA models. We demonstrated the preference of STARIMA models over ARIMA models during the period in which the curfew was lifted."
https://openalex.org/W3154813194,"Objectives Nomophobia, an abbreviation of “No mobile phone phobia”, is characterized by the illogical fear of being detached from the mobile phone or unable to use it. Research have provided evidence of an association between increased cellular phone use and multiple health issues, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and others. To our knowledge, there are no Lebanese studies about nomophobia, despite the high incorporation rate of mobile phones in Lebanon and the likelihood of suffering from anxiety, depression, and other conditions due to nomophobic attitudes. The study objectives were to validate and confirm psychometric properties of the Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) and examine the associations between particular psychological conditions (anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia and impulsivity) and nomophobia among a representative sample of Lebanese people. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out between January and July 2019. It enrolled 2260 residents of the community randomly selected from Lebanon’s Mohafazat. Two villages per sub-district and households from each village were chosen using a random sampling technique. A questionnaire was distributed randomly to the households. SPSS version 25 was used to perform the statistical analysis. A multinomial regression was computed taking the nomophobia categories as the dependent variable (and taking the absence of nomophobia as the reference category) and all variables that showed a significant association in the bivariate analysis as independent variables. Results A total of 2260 (80.71%) out of 2800 questionnaires distributed was collected back. The mean age of the participants was 27.98 ± 9.66 years (58.8% females). Moreover, the mean nomophobia score was 71.56 ± 26.92 (median = 71; minimum = 14; maximum = 140). The results showed that 46 (2.0%) had no nomophobia, 769 (34.1%) mild nomophobia [95% CI 0.322–0.361], 1089 (48.3%) moderate nomophobia [95% CI 0.463–0.504] and 349 (15.5%) severe nomophobia [95% CI 0.140–0.170]. Items of the nomophobia scale converged over a solution of three factors that had an Eigenvalue over 1 (Factor 1 = emotions associated to losing connectedness, Factor 2 = not being able to communicate, Factor 3 = not being able to access information; total variance explained = 66.65%, and Cronbach’s alpha = 0.948). The results of a multinomial regression, taking the nomophobia score as the dependent variable, showed that higher age was significantly associated with lower odds of having mild (aOR = 0.97), moderate (aOR = 0.93) and severe (aOR = 0.97) nomophobia respectively. Higher anxiety (aOR = 1.09) and higher insomnia (aOR = 1.04) were significantly associated with higher odds of having severe nomophobia. Conclusion The results suggest a positive correlation between nomophobia and psychological conditions. There is a need for longitudinal and prospective studies that furnish information with regards of the impact of time on the variables measured, in order to better understand the nature, causes, and attributes of nomophobia."
https://openalex.org/W3152904694,"Introduction Hemorrhoidal disease is a very common benign anorectal disease. It affects millions of people around the world, and represent a major medical and socioeconomic problem. However, studies that determine the magnitude and risk factors are limited. Therefore, the aim this study is to assess the prevalence and associated factors of hemorrhoid among adult patients visiting the surgical outpatient department at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (UoGCSH) Northwest Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2020. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select a total of 403 participants. The data were collected then entered using EPI DATA version 3.1 and exported to the STATA 14 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval was used as a measure of association. Variables having P-value &lt; 0.05 from the multivariable analysis were considered to have a significant association with the outcome. Result Out of the 403 study participants, 13.1% (95%CI; 10.1, 16.8) had hemorrhoids. Constipation (AOR = 4.32, 95% CI; 2.20, 8.48) and BMI ≥25kg/m 2 (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI; 1.08, 6.23) had a statistically significant association with hemorrhoid. Conclusion The overall prevalence of hemorrhoid was high and its prevalence was higher in male subjects. Constipation and being overweight were found to increase the odds of having hemorrhoids. Screening for early identification and intervention of hemorrhoids, especially for risk groups is better to be practiced by health professionals."
https://openalex.org/W3155368009,"Artificial intelligence algorithms are ubiquitous in daily life, and this is motivating the development of some institutional initiatives to ensure trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there is not enough research on how these algorithms can influence people’s decisions and attitudes. The present research examines whether algorithms can persuade people, explicitly or covertly, on whom to vote and date, or whether, by contrast, people would reject their influence in an attempt to confirm their personal freedom and independence. In four experiments, we found that persuasion was possible and that different styles of persuasion (e.g., explicit, covert) were more effective depending on the decision context (e.g., political and dating). We conclude that it is important to educate people against trusting and following the advice of algorithms blindly. A discussion on who owns and can use the data that makes these algorithms work efficiently is also necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3155958761,"Preservation of cognitive function is one of the major concerns in contemporary ageing societies. At the same time, overweight and obesity, which have been identified as risk factors for poor health development, have been increasing in many countries all over the world. This study examines the relationship between bodyweight change and cognitive decline in old age and it aims to determine whether and how changes in body mass index (BMI) affect the development of cognitive functioning in old age. Using longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), covering four waves between 2006 and 2016 with 58,389 participants from 15 countries aged 50+, we estimated asymmetric fixed effects models by gender, adding possible confounding variables such as age, grip strength, health conditions, and physical activity. Additionally, we investigated possible heterogeneity in the BMI-cognition relation. We found a positive association between BMI change and change in cognitive performance, which was dominantly driven by BMI decrease. Weight loss was typically negatively related to cognition, particularly at low levels of BMI and mainly due to health conditions affecting both bodyweight and cognitive performance. Weight gain was, on average, not significantly related to cognitive performance; only respondents with preceding weight loss profited from small increases in BMI. Our analyses provide no support for an “obesity paradox” in cognition, according to which higher weight preserves cognition in old age. The association between weight change and cognitive performance in older age is based on weight changes being related to illness and recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3156827691,"The arid zone of central Asia secluded inland and has the typical features of the atmosphere. Human activities have had a significant impact on the air quality in this region. Urumqi is a key city in the core area of the Silk Road and an important economic center in Northwestern China. The urban environment is playing an increasingly important role in regional development. To study the characteristics and influencing factors of the main atmospheric pollutants in Urumqi, this study selected Urumqi's daily air quality index (AQI) data and observation data of six major pollutants including fine particulate matter (PM2.5), breathable particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3_8h) from 2014 to 2018 in conjunction with meteorological data to use a backward trajectory analysis method to study the main characteristics of atmospheric pollutants and their sources in Urumqi from 2014 to 2018. The results showed that: (1) From 2014 to 2018, the annual average of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO concentrations showed a downward trend, and O3_8h concentrations first increased, then decreased, and then increased, reaching the highest value in 2018 (82.15 μg·m-3); The seasonal changes of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO concentrations were characterized by low values in summer and fall seasons and high values in winter and spring seasons. The concentration of O3_8h, however, was in the opposite trend, showing the high values in summer and fall seasons, and low values in winter and spring seasons. From 2014 to 2018, with the exception of O3_8h, the concentration changes of the other five major air pollutants were high in December, January, and February, and low in May, June, and July; the daily changes showed a ""U-shaped"" change during the year. The high-value areas of the ""U-shaped"" mode formed around the 50th day and the 350th day. (2) The high-value area of AQI was from the end of fall (November) to the beginning of the following spring (March), and the low-value area was from April to October. It showed a U-shaped change trend during the year and the value was mainly distributed between 50 and 100. (3) The concentrations of major air pollutants in Urumqi were significantly negatively correlated with precipitation, temperature, and humidity (P<0.01), and had the highest correlation coefficients with temperature. (4) Based on the above analysis results, this study analyzed two severe pollution events from late November to early December. Analysis showed that the PM2.5/PM10 ratio in two events remained at about 0.1 when the pollution occurred, but was higher before and after the pollution (up to 1.46). It was shown that the pollution was a simple sandstorm process. Backward trajectory analysis clustered the airflow trajectories reaching Urumqi into 4 categories, and the trajectories from central Asia contributed the maximum values of average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W3155436607,"SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic and currently becomes a serious cause of death worldwide. It is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 belonging to a family known as corona virus. The aim of this study is to assess the community knowledge, attitude and practice strategy implementation on SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). A cross-sectional survey study was done from July to October, 2020 in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia. Interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 404 respondents. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square test with a 95% confidence interval to know the association of socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. From a total of 404 responses collected (64.1%, n = 259/404), (50.7%, n = 205/404) and (39.6%, n = 160/404) of the respondents were between ages 18–39 years, males and were diploma and above, respectively. The majority of the respondents had good knowledge about the transmission mode and symptoms of COVID-19 and they obtained information mainly through mass media. The knowledge of the respondents about the transmission mode of COVID-I9 through coughing and sneezing, direct contact with infected person and touching contaminated materials was statistically associated with education and occupation (p &lt;0.001). Among the total respondents (53.7%, n = 217/404) had a negative attitude that COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled. The attitude of the respondents towards successfully controlling of COVID-I9 was statistically associated in terms of age, marital status, education and occupation (p &lt; 0.001). Most of the respondents (63.1%, n = 255/404), (58.9%, n = 238/404), (66.8%, n = 270/404) and (63.9%, n = 258/404) did not wash hands with soap, avoidance of touching the nose and mouth, practicing social distancing and wearing of face masks in public or crowded places, respectively. The practices of the respondents towards COVID-19 were statistically associated with sex, marital status, education and occupation (p &lt; 0.01). COVID-19 is currently the cause of death and it has a great impact on the economy, politics and social interactions in the study area. The government should strength the health system by increasing surveillance activities in detecting cases. Our findings suggest that the community should practice the WHO and EMoH recommendations to minimize the spread of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W3153473931,"Residues of persistent insecticides may be present in the substrates on which insects are reared for food and feed, which may affect insect growth or survival. In addition, insecticidal substances may bio-accumulate in reared insects. The objective of this study was to assess potential effects of selected insecticides on the growth and survival of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL, Hermetia illucens ) and on their safety when used as animal feed. Six insecticides (chlorpyrifos, propoxur, cypermethrin, imidacloprid, spinosad, tebufenozide) with different modes of action were tested in two sequential experiments. Cypermethrin was also tested with the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Standard BSFL substrate was spiked to the respective maximum residue level (MRL) of each insecticide allowed by the European Union to occur in feed; and BSFL were reared on these substrates. Depending on the observed effects in the first experiment, spiked concentrations tested in the second experiment were increased or reduced. At the concentrations applied (1 and 10 times MRL), three of the six tested substances (chlorpyrifos, propoxur, tebufenozide) did not affect the survival or biomass growth of BSFL, compared to the control (non-spiked) treatments. At MRL, imidacloprid stimulated the growth of BSFL compared to the controls. Spinosad and cypermethrin at the MRL level negatively affected growth and survival. The effects of cypermethrin appeared to be augmented by addition of PBO. A mean bio-accumulation factor of ≤0.01 was found in both experiments for all substances–except for cypermethrin, which was comparatively high, but still below 1 (0.79 at 0.1 mg/kg). The lack of accumulation of insecticides in the larvae suggests that there is no risk of larval products being uncompliant with feed MRLs. However, we conclude that insecticides present in substrates may affect growth and survival of BSFL. More research on a larger variety of substances and insect species is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3155182581,"The intake of carcinogenic and chemopreventive compounds are important nutritional factors related to the development of malignant tumorous diseases. Repetitive long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) DNA methylation pattern plays a key role in both carcinogenesis and chemoprevention. In our present in vivo animal model, we examined LINE-1 DNA methylation pattern as potential biomarker in the liver, spleen and kidney of mice consuming green tea ( Camellia sinensis ) extract (catechins 80%), a chinese bayberry ( Morella rubra ) extract (myricetin 80%), a flavonoid extract (with added resveratrol) and coffee ( Coffee arabica ) extract. In the organs examined, carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced hypomethylation was prevented by all test materials except chinese bayberry extract in the kidneys. Moreover, the flavonoid extract caused significant hypermethylation in the liver compared to untreated controls and to other test materials. The tested chemopreventive substances have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties and regulate molecular biological signaling pathways. They increase glutathione levels, induce antioxidant enzymes, which decrease free radical damage caused by DMBA, and ultimately, they are able to increase the activity of DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Furthermore, flavonoids in the liver may inhibit the procarcinogen to carcinogen activation of DMBA through the inhibition of CYP1A1 enzyme. At the same time, paradoxically, myricetin can act as a prooxidant as a result of free radical damage, which can explain that it did not prevent hypomethylation in the kidneys. Our results demonstrated that LINE-1 DNA methylation pattern is a useful potential biomarker for detecting and monitoring carcinogenic and chemopreventive effects of dietary compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3154548510,"The effects of hormonal contraceptives on structural features of the hypothalamus and pituitary are incompletely understood. One prior study reported microstructural changes in the hypothalamus with oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use. However, effects on hypothalamic volume have not been reported. One prior study reported volumetric changes in the pituitary. However, this study was limited by including participants evaluated for neurological symptoms. We sought to determine if OCP use is associated with alteration of hypothalamic or pituitary volume. High-resolution 3T MRI was performed for a prospective cohort of 50 healthy women from 2016 to 2018, which comprised 21 OCP users (age, 19–29) and 29 naturally cycling women (age, 18–36). Participants were excluded if they were pregnant or had significant medical conditions including neurological, psychiatric, and endocrine disorders. After confirming reliability of the image analysis techniques, 5 raters independently performed manual segmentation of the hypothalamus and semi-automated intensity threshold-based segmentation of the pituitary using ITK-SNAP. Total intracranial volume was estimated using FreeSurfer. A general linear model tested the association of OCP use with hypothalamic and pituitary volumes. Hypothalamic (B = -81.2 ± 24.9, p = 0.002) and pituitary (B = -81.2 ± 38.7, p = 0.04) volumes in OCP users were smaller than in naturally cycling women. These findings may be related to interference with known trophic effects of sex hormones and suggest a structural correlate of central OCP effects."
https://openalex.org/W3156252199,"Introduction To investigate weight status, insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR, and their interaction on liver function in non-diabetic Chinese adults. Methods and results A total of 7066 subjects were included, and divided into normal weight (n = 3447), overweight (n = 2801), and obese (n = 818) groups. Data including weight, height, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, y-glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were acquired. In multi-linear regression analysis for liver enzymes as dependent variables, insulin resistance emerged as a determinant of ALT (β = 0.165, P &lt;0.001), AST (β = 0.040, P &lt;0.001) and GGT (β = 0.170, P &lt;0.001) after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, triglyceride, and cholesterol. Interactions between insulin resistance and weight status by body mass index were observed in ALT ( P &lt;0.001), AST ( P &lt;0.001) and GGT ( P = 0.0418). Conclusion Insulin resistance had significant associations with greater risk of elevated ALT, AST and GGT level in non-diabetic Chinese adults, especially among those who were overweight/ obese."
https://openalex.org/W3154689066,"Background Midwifery continuity of care models for women at low and mixed risk of complications have been shown to improve women’s experiences of care. However, there is limited research on care experiences among women at increased risk of preterm birth. We aimed to explore the experiences of care among women with risk factors for preterm birth participating in a pilot trial (POPPIE) of a midwifery continuity of care model which included a specialist obstetric clinic. Methods A total of 334 pregnant women identified at increased risk of preterm birth were randomly allocated to either midwifery continuity of care (POPPIE group) or standard maternity care. Women in both groups were followed up at six-to-eight weeks postpartum and were invited to complete a postnatal survey either online or by post. An equal status exploratory sequential mixed method design was chosen to collect and analyse the quantitative postnatal survey data and qualitative interviews data. The postnatal survey included measures of social support, trust, perceptions of safety, quality of care, control during childbirth, bonding and quality of life. Categorical data were analysed with chi-squared tests and continuous data were analysed with t-tests and/or Mann-Whitney U test to measure differences in measures scores among groups. The qualitative interview data were subjected to a thematic framework analysis. Data triangulation brought quantitative and qualitative data together at the interpretation stage. Findings A total of 166 women completed the survey and 30 women were interviewed (90 and 16 in POPPIE group; 76 and 14 in standard group). We found survey respondents in the POPPIE group, compared to respondents in the standard group, were significantly more likely to report greater trust in midwives (Mann-Whitney U, p&lt;0.0001), greater perceptions of safety during the antenatal care (t-test, p = 0.0138), have a particular midwife to contact when they needed during their pregnancy (t-test, p&lt;0.0001) and the postnatal period (chi-squared, p&lt;0.0001). They reported increased involvement in decisions regarding antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care (t-test, p = 0.002; p = 0.008; p = 0.006 respectively); and greater postnatal support and advice about: feeding the baby (chi-squared, p&lt;0.0001), handling, settling and looking after the baby (chi-squared, p&lt;0.0001), baby’s health and progress (chi-squared, p = 0.039), their own health and recovery (chi-squared, p = 0.006) and who to contact about any emotional changes (chi-squared, p = 0.005). There were no significant differences between groups in the reporting of perceptions of safety during birth and the postnatal period, concerns raised during labour and birth taken seriously, being left alone during childbirth at a time of worries, control during labour, bonding, social support, and physical and mental health related quality of life after birth. Results from qualitative interviews provided insight and depth into many of these findings, with women in the POPPIE group reporting more positive experiences of bonding towards their babies and more positive physical health postnatally. Conclusions Compared with standard maternity care, women at increased risk of PTB who received midwifery continuity of care were more likely to report increased perceptions of trust, safety and quality of care.

https://openalex.org/W3156411203,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe health and economic impacts globally. Strategies to safely reopen economies, travel and trade are a high priority. Until a reliable vaccine is available, non-pharmaceutical techniques are the only available means of disease control. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the extent to which social distancing (SD) and facemask (FM) use can mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 when restrictions are lifted. We used a microsimulation activity-based model for Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area, to evaluate the power of SD and FM in controlling the pandemic under numerous scenarios. The hypothetical scenarios are designed to picture feasible futures under different assumptions. Assuming that the isolation of infected cases and the quarantining of close contacts are in place, different numerical tests are conducted and a full factorial two-way MANOVA test is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the FM and SD control strategies. The main and interactive effects of the containment strategies are evaluated by the total number of infections, percentage of infections reduction, the time it takes to get the pandemic under control, and the intensity of active cases."
https://openalex.org/W3153915435,"Immune infiltration is typically quantified using cellular density, not accounting for cellular clustering. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) activate oncogenic signaling through paracrine interactions with tumor cells, which may be better reflected by local cellular clustering than global density metrics. Using multiplex immunohistochemistry and digital pathologic analysis we quantified cellular density and cellular clustering for myeloid cell markers in 129 regions of interest from 55 samples from 35 patients with metastatic ccRCC. CD68+ cells were found to be clustered with tumor cells and dispersed from stromal cells, while CD163+ and CD206+ cells were found to be clustered with stromal cells and dispersed from tumor cells. CD68+ density was not associated with OS, while high tumor/CD68+ cell clustering was associated with significantly worse OS. These novel findings would not have been identified if immune infiltrate was assessed using cellular density alone, highlighting the importance of including spatial analysis in studies of immune cell infiltration of tumors. Significance : Increased clustering of CD68+ TAMs and tumor cells was associated with worse overall survival for patients with metastatic ccRCC. This effect would not have been identified if immune infiltrate was assessed using cell density alone, highlighting the importance of including spatial analysis in studies of immune cell infiltration of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3152620040,"Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) leads to pancreatic endocrine dysfunction with progressive glycemic disturbance. Approximately 30%–50% of people with CF eventually develop CF–related diabetes (CFRD). Pre-CFRD states progress from indeterminant glycemia (INDET) to impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Screening guidelines recommend inconvenient annual 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), beginning at age 10 years. More efficient methods, such as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), have been evaluated, but only limited, relatively small studies have evaluated the association between HbA1c and pre-CFRD dysglycemic states. Objective To determine whether HbA1c is an appropriate screening tool for identifying patients with pre-CFRD dysglycemia to minimize the burden of annual OGTTs. Methods This retrospective review evaluated medical records data of all University of Massachusetts Memorial Health System CF patients with an HbA1c result within 90 days of an OGTT between 1997 and 2019. Exclusion criteria were uncertain CF diagnosis, other forms of diabetes, or incomplete OGTT. In total, 56 patients were included and categorized according to OGTT results (American Diabetes Association criteria): normal glucose tolerance, INDET, IFG, or IGT. Associations were evaluated between HbA1c and OGTT results and between HbA1c and pre-CFRD dysglycemic states. Results Mean HbA1c was not significantly different between patients with normal glucose tolerance and those in the INDET (p = 0.987), IFG (p = 0.690), and IGT (p = 0.874) groups. Analysis of variance confirmed the lack of association between HbA1c and glycemia, as mean HbA1c was not significantly different amongst the four categories (p = 0.250). Conclusion There is increasing awareness of the impact of pre-CFRD states, including reduced pulmonary function and nutritional status. Unfortunately, our results do not support using HbA1c as a screening tool for pre-CFRD dysglycemia, specifically INDET, IFG, and IGT. Further studies are warranted to evaluate more efficient screening methods to reduce the burden of annual OGTTs."
https://openalex.org/W3154934624,"Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs), encoded by Solute Carrier 9A (SLC9A) genes in human, are ubiquitous integral membrane ion transporters that mediate the electroneutral exchange of H+ with Na+ or K+. NHEs, found in the kidney and intestine, play a major role in the process of fluid reabsorption together via Na+,K+-ATPase pump and Na+ channels. Nevertheless, the expression pattern of NHE in the lung and its role in alveolar fluid homeostasis has not been addressed. Therefore, we aimed to examine the expression of NHE specific isoforms in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), and assess their role in congestive heart failure (CHF). Three NHE isoforms were identified in AEC and A549 cell line, at the level of protein and mRNA; NHE1, NHE2 and mainly NHE8, the latter was shown to be localized in the apical membrane of AEC. Treating A549 cells with angiotensin (Ang) II for 3, 5 and 24 hours displayed a significant reduction in NHE8 protein abundance. Moreover, the abundance of NHE8 protein was downregulated in A549 cells that were treated overnight with Ang II. NHE8 abundance in whole lung lysate was increased in rats with 1-week CHF compared to sham operated rats. However, lower abundance of NHE8 was observed in 4-week CHF group. In conclusion, we herein show for the first time, the expression of a novel NHE isoform in AEC, namely NHE8. Notably, Ang II decreased NHE8 protein levels. Moreover, NHE8 was distinctly affected in CHF rats, probably depending on the severity of the heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W3155795848,"Background Even though conceptually, Tuberculosis (TB) is almost always curable, it is currently the world’s leading infectious killer. Patients with pulmonary TB are the source of transmission. Approximately 23% of the world’s population is believed to be latently infected with TB bacteria, and 5–15% of them will progress at any point in time to develop the disease. There was a global diagnostic gap of 2.9 million between notifications of new cases and the estimated number of incident cases, and Indonesia carries the third-highest of this gap. Therefore, screening TB among the community is of great importance to prevent further transmission and infection. The electronic nose for screening TB (eNose-TB) project is initiated in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to screen TB by breath test with an electronic-nose that is easy-to-use, point-of-care, does not expose patients to radiation, and can be produced at low cost. Methods/Design The objectives of the two-phase planned project are to: 1) investigate the potential of an eNose-TB as a screening tool in Indonesia, in comparison with screening with clinical symptoms and chest radiology, which are currently used as a standard, and 2) analyze the time and cost of a screening algorithm with eNose-TB to obtain additional case detection. A cross-sectional study will be conducted in the first phase to validate the eNose-TB. The validation phase will involve 395 presumptive TB patients in the Surakarta General Hospital, Central Java. In the second phase, a cross-sectional research will be conducted, involving 1,383 adults and children in the municipality of Yogyakarta and Kulon Progo district of Yogyakarta Province. Discussion The findings will provide data concerning the sensitivity and specificity of the eNose-TB as a screening tool for tuberculosis, and the time and cost analysis of a screening algorithm with the eNose.

https://openalex.org/W3156008903,"Introduction The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide. Data on the mobility level of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) are needed. Objective To describe the mobility level of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU and to address factors associated with mobility level at the time of ICU discharge. Methods Single center, retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 infection were analyzed. The mobility status was assessed by the Perme Score at admission and discharge from ICU with higher scores indicating higher mobility level. The Perme Mobility Index (PMI) was calculated [PMI = ΔPerme Score ( ICU discharge – ICU admission )/ICU length of stay]. Based on the PMI, patients were divided into two groups: “Improved” (PMI &gt; 0) and “Not improved” (PMI ≤ 0). Results A total of 136 patients were included in this analysis. The hospital mortality rate was 16.2%. The Perme Score improved significantly when comparing ICU discharge with ICU admission [20.0 (7–28) points versus 7.0 (0–16) points; P &lt; 0.001]. A total of 88 patients (64.7%) improved their mobility level during ICU stay, and the median PMI of these patients was 1.5 (0.6–3.4). Patients in the improved group had a lower duration of mechanical ventilation [10 (5–14) days versus 15 (8–24) days; P = 0.021], lower hospital length of stay [25 (12–37) days versus 30 (11–48) days; P &lt; 0.001], and lower ICU and hospital mortality rate. Independent predictors for mobility level were lower age, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, and not having received renal replacement therapy. Conclusion Patients’ mobility level was low at ICU admission; however, most patients improved their mobility level during ICU stay. Risk factors associated with the mobility level were age, comorbidities, and use of renal replacement therapy."

We aimed to evaluate treatment outcomes and to identify the factors associated with death among patients with MDR and XDR-TB in Portugal. We assessed MDR-TB cases reported for the period 2000–2016, using the national TB Surveillance System. Treatment outcomes were defined according to WHO recommendations. We identified the factors associated with death using logistic regression. We evaluated treatment outcomes of 294 MDR- and 142 XDR-TB patients. The treatment success rate was 73.8% among MDR- and 62.7% among XDR-TB patients (p = 0.023). The case-fatality rate was 18.4% among MDR- and 23.9% among XDR-TB patients. HIV infection (OR 4.55; 95% CI 2.31–8.99; p &lt; 0.001) and resistance to one or more second-line injectable drugs (OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.26–5.92; p = 0.011) were independently associated with death among MDR-TB patients.

We previously observed an association between maternal stress and white matter microstructure in a sample of infants born prematurely. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between maternal trait anxiety, stressful life events and brain volumes.221 infants (114 males, 107 females) born prematurely (median gestational age = 30.43 weeks [range 23.57-32.86]) underwent magnetic resonance imaging around term-equivalent age (mean = 42.20 weeks, SD = 1.60). Brain volumes were extracted for the following regions of interest: frontal lobe, temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus and normalized to total brain volume. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to investigate the relationship between maternal anxiety/stress and brain volumes, controlling for gestational age at birth, postmenstrual age at scan, socioeconomic status, sex, days on total parenteral nutrition. Additional exploratory Tensor Based Morphometry analyses were performed to obtain voxel-wise brain volume changes from Jacobian determinant maps.In this large prospective study, we did not find evidence of a relationship between maternal prenatal stress or trait anxiety and brain volumes. This was the case for both the main analysis using a region-of-interest approach, and for the exploratory analysis using Jacobian determinant maps. We discuss these results in the context of conflicting evidence from previous studies and highlight the need for further research on premature infants, particularly including term-born controls."
https://openalex.org/W3152698549,"This paper analyzes hourly PM 2.5 measurements from government-controlled and U.S. embassy-controlled monitoring stations in five Chinese cities between January 2015 and June 2017. We compare the two datasets with an impulse indicator saturation technique that identifies hours when the relation between Chinese and U.S. reported data diverges in a statistically significant fashion. These temporary divergences, or impulses, are 1) More frequent than expected by random chance; 2) More positive than expected by random chance; and 3) More likely to occur during hours when air pollution concentrations are high. In other words, relative to U.S.-controlled monitoring stations, government-controlled stations systematically under-report pollution levels when local air quality is poor. These results contrast with the findings of other recent studies, which argue that Chinese air quality data misreporting ended after a series of policy reforms beginning in 2012. Our findings provide evidence that local government misreporting did not end after 2012, but instead continued in a different manner. These results suggest that Chinese air quality data, while still useful, should not be taken entirely at face value."

The current study characterized gyrification abnormalities in ferrets following VPA exposure during neonatal periods, corresponding to the late stage of cortical neurogenesis as well as the early stage of sulcogyrogenesis. Ferret pups received intraperitoneal VPA injections (200 μg/g of body weight) on postnatal days (PD) 6 and 7. BrdU was administered simultaneously at the last VPA injection. Ex vivo MRI-based morphometry demonstrated significantly lower gyrification index (GI) throughout the cortex in VPA-treated ferrets (1.265 ± 0.027) than in control ferrets (1.327 ± 0.018) on PD 20, when primary sulcogyrogenesis is complete. VPA-treated ferrets showed significantly smaller sulcal-GIs in the rostral suprasylvian sulcus and splenial sulcus but a larger lateral sulcus surface area than control ferrets. The floor cortex of the inner stratum of both the rostral suprasylvian and splenial sulci and the outer stratum of the lateral sulcus showed a relatively prominent expansion. Parvalbumin-positive neuron density was significantly greater in the expanded cortical strata of sulcal floors in VPA-treated ferrets, regardless of the BrdU-labeled status. Thus, VPA exposure during the late stage of cortical neurogenesis may alter gyrification, primarily in the frontal and parietotemporal cortical divisions. Altered gyrification may thicken the outer or inner stratum of the cerebral cortex by increasing parvalbumin-positive neuron density."
https://openalex.org/W3154960803,"Introduction Improving the quality of services is the primary goal of the Ethiopia reform program to satisfy patients. Patient satisfaction is an attitude resulting from a person’s general orientation towards a total experience of health care. According to world health organization consumer satisfaction is playing an increasingly important role in the quality of care reforms and health-care delivery more generally. Objective To assess patient’s satisfaction and associated factors with health care services among admitted patients in Pawie General Hospital, Benishangul Gumuze Region, West Ethiopia, 2020 Methods Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among adult patients admitted to Pawie General Hospital. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit 334 participants and a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were entered into Epi Data version 3.1, analyzed using SPSS version 23, and presented in tables and graphs. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were computed to identify factors associated with patient satisfaction. P-values &lt; 0.05 and adjusted odds ratios were used to declare the significance and strength of the association. Result The overall patient’s satisfaction towards inpatient health care services at Pawie General Hospital was 60.8% with 95% CI (55.4, 65.9). Factors like admission ward [AOR = 2.60; 95% CI (1.34, 5.03)] and privacy [AOR = 12.5; 95% C I (2.89, 54.1)] were significantly associated with patient’s satisfaction. Conclusion The satisfaction level of patients admitted to Pawie General Hospitals was low. Admission ward and perceived privacy assured were factors significantly associated with patient satisfaction among patients admitted to Pawie General Hospital. The hospital administration system is better to work together to fill the gaps identified and improve the level of patient satisfaction."

It has not only influenced the ways of human communication but also changed the way of learning. However, to utilize the facility of the Internet in effective manners, people need a certain set of skills called “Internet Literacy Skills”. The purpose of the study was to explore the level of Internet literacy skills of Undergraduate first-year students (Digital Natives) of the University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. The study is quantitative, and data were gathered through questionnaires. A total of 180 students from three disciplines i.e. Pure Sciences, Social Sciences, and Arts and Humanities were approached for the final data collection. Descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (regression analysis) were applied to analyze the collected data. Results further revealed that respondents possess very good knowledge to identify legal and illegal activities and information on the Internet. Findings of the study, not only reported the Internet literacy skills of digital natives but also helped to come up with a theoretical model that may be useful to design an efficient and effective Internet literacy module/subject to help students increase their Internet use-related skills."
https://openalex.org/W3153516697,"Human lower-limb kinematic measurements are critical for many applications including gait analysis, enhancing athletic performance, reducing or monitoring injury risk, augmenting warfighter performance, and monitoring elderly fall risk, among others. We present a new method to estimate lower-limb kinematics using an error-state Kalman filter that utilizes an array of body-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four kinematic constraints. We evaluate the method on a simplified 3-body model of the lower limbs (pelvis and two legs) during walking using data from simulation and experiment. Evaluation on this 3-body model permits direct evaluation of the ErKF method without several confounding error sources from human subjects (e.g., soft tissue artefacts and determination of anatomical frames). RMS differences for the three estimated hip joint angles all remain below 0.2 degrees compared to simulation and 1.4 degrees compared to experimental optical motion capture (MOCAP). RMS differences for stride length and step width remain within 1% and 4%, respectively compared to simulation and 7% and 5%, respectively compared to experiment (MOCAP). The results are particularly important because they foretell future success in advancing this approach to more complex models for human movement. In particular, our future work aims to extend this approach to a 7-body model of the human lower limbs composed of the pelvis, thighs, shanks, and feet."
https://openalex.org/W3153523353,"Background Computerized decision-support systems (CDSS) and performance-based incentives (PBIs) have potential to contribute to client satisfaction with health services. However, rigorous evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of these strategies in lower-income countries such as Ghana. This study aimed to determine the effect of a combined CDSS-PBI intervention on client satisfaction with maternal health services in primary facilities in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Methods We employed a quasi-experimental controlled baseline and endline design to assess the effect of the combined interventions on client satisfaction with maternal health services, measured by quantitative pre/post-test client satisfaction survey. Our analysis used difference-in-difference logistic regression, controlling for potential covariates, to compare variables across intervention and comparison facilities at baseline and endline. Results The combined CDSS-PBI intervention was associated with increased or unchanged client satisfaction with all maternal health services compared at endline. Antenatal client difference-in-difference of mean satisfaction scores were significant at endline for intervention (n = 378) and comparison (n = 362) healthcare facilities for overall satisfaction (DiD 0.058, p = 0.014), perception of providers’ technical performance (DiD = 0.142; p = 0.006), client-provider interaction (DiD = 0.152; p = 0.001), and provider availability (DiD = 0.173; p = 0.001). Delivery client difference-in-difference of satisfaction scores were significant at endline for intervention (n = 318) and comparison (n = 240) healthcare facilities for overall satisfaction with delivery services (DiD = 0.072; p = 0.02) and client-provider interaction (DiD = 0.146; p = 0.02). However, mean overall satisfaction actually reduced slightly in intervention facilities, while DiD for technical performance and provider availability were not significant. Conclusion This combined CDSS-PBI intervention was associated with greater antenatal and delivery client satisfaction with some aspects of maternity services within two years of implementation. It could be expanded elsewhere if funds allow, though further research is still required to assess cost-effectiveness and long-term effects on client satisfaction and maternal health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3154380811,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can have significant effects on phenotypic characteristics in cattle. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators by binding them to target mRNAs. In the present study, we scanned ~56 million SNPs against 1,064 bovine miRNA sequences and analyzed, in silico, their possible effects on target binding prediction, primary miRNA formation, association with QTL regions and the evolutionary conservation for each SNP locus. Following target prediction, we show that 71.6% of miRNA predicted targets were altered as a consequence of SNPs located within the seed region of the mature miRNAs. Next, we identified variations in the Minimum Free Energy (MFE), which represents the capacity to alter molecule stability and, consequently, miRNA maturation. A total of 48.6% of the sequences analyzed showed values within those previously reported as sufficient to alter miRNA maturation. We have also found 131 SNPs in 46 miRNAs, with altered target prediction, occurring in QTL regions. Lastly, analysis of evolutionary conservation scores for each SNP locus suggested that they have a conserved biological function through the evolutionary process. Our results suggest that SNPs in microRNAs have the potential to affect bovine phenotypes and could be of great value for genetic improvement studies, as well as production."
https://openalex.org/W3155921725,"Social grooming in the animal kingdom is common and serves several functions, from removing ectoparasites to maintaining social bonds between conspecifics. We examined whether time spent grooming with others in a highly social mammal species was associated with infection status for gastrointestinal parasites. Of six parasites detected, one ( Trichuris sp.) was associated with social grooming behaviors, but more specifically with direct physical contact with others. Individuals infected with Trichuris sp. spent significantly less time grooming conspecifics than those not infected, and time in direct contact with others was the major predictor of infection status. One model correctly predicted infection status for Trichuris sp. with a reliability of 95.17% overall when the variables used were time spent in direct contact and time spent grooming others. This decrease in time spent grooming and interacting with others is likely a sickness behavior displayed by individuals with less energy or motivation for non-essential behaviors. This study emphasizes the possible links between host behavior and parasitic infections and highlights the need for an understanding of a study population’s parasitic infections when attempting to interpret animal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3154243080,"Dormancy of hematopoietic stem cells and formation of progenitors are directed by signals that come from the bone marrow microenvironment. Considerable knowledge has been gained on the murine hematopoietic stem cell microenvironment, while less so on the murine progenitor microenvironment and even less so on these microenvironments in humans. Characterization of these microenvironments is decisive for understanding hematopoiesis and finding new treatment modalities against bone marrow malignancies in the clinic. However, it is equally challenging, because hematopoietic stem cells are difficult to detect in the complex bone marrow landscape. In the present study we are characterizing the human hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor microenvironment. We obtained three adjacent bone marrow sections from ten healthy volunteers. One was used to identify a population of CD34 + /CD38 - “hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors” and a population of CD34 + /CD38 + “progenitors” based on immunofluorescence pattern/intensity and cellular morphology. The other two were immunostained respectively for CD34/CD56 and for CD34/SMA. Using the combined information we performed a non-computer-assisted quantification of nine bone marrow components (adipocytes, megakaryocytes, bone surfaces, four different vessel types (arteries, capillaries, sinusoids and collecting sinuses), other “hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors” and other “progenitors”) within 30 μm of “hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors”, “progenitors”, and “random cell profiles”. We show that the microenvironment of the “hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors” is significantly enriched in sinusoids and megakaryocytes, while the microenvironment of the “progenitors” is significantly enriched in capillaries, other “progenitors”, bone surfaces and arteries."

Results Our sample included 96 patients (33% of the overall cohort) aged 60 years or above, with a mean age of 67.2 (SD = 5.7). The majority of the patients were female (62.5%). The Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Quick Inventory Depression Scale-Self Report (QIDS-SR) mean scores were high, 28.2 (SD = 7.49) [MADRS score range: 0–60; moderate severity≥20, high severity≥35] and 16.5 (SD = 4.94) [IDS-SR score range: 0–27; moderate severity≥11, high severity≥16], respectively. Mean self-esteem scores were 22.47 (SD = 6.26) [range 0–30]. In an age- and sex-adjusted model, we found a positive correlation between childhood trauma (CTQ scores) and depressive symptom severity [MADRS (β = 0.274; p = 0.07) and QIDS-SR (β = 0.302; p = 0.005) scores]. We detected a statistically significant correlation between physical abuse and depressive symptom severity [MADRS (β = 0.304; p = 0.03) and QIDS-SR (β = 0.362; p = 0.005) scores]. We did not observe any significant correlation between other types of trauma and depressive symptom severity. We showed that self-esteem (Rosenberg scale) mediated the effect of physical abuse (PA) on the intensity of depressive symptoms [MADRS: b = 0.318, 95% BCa C . I .

The purpose of this preliminary study was to test the efficacy and safety of calcipotriol, vitamin D analog, as a treatment for a fully-developed knee arthritis in Zymosan-induced arthritis (ZIA) model. Forty 5-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three arthritis groups and a non-arthritic control group with no injections (10 rats/group). A day after Zymosan (0.1 mg) had been administrated into the right knee joints, the same knees were injected with calcipotriol (0.1 mg/kg), dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle in a 100 μl volume. The left control knees were injected with saline (PBS) on two consecutive days. All injections, blood sampling and measurements were performed under general anesthesia on days 0, 1, 3 and 8. Internal organs and knees were harvested on day 8 and the histology of the whole knees was assessed blinded. Joints treated with calcipotriol showed a milder histological synovitis than those treated with vehicle (p = 0.041), but there was no statistically significant difference between the dexamethasone and vehicle groups. The clinical severity of arthritis did not differ between the arthritis groups measured by body temperature, swelling of the knee, thermal imaging, clinical scoring or cytokine levels on days 1, 3 and 8. Weight loss was bigger in rats treated with dexamethasone, propably due to loss of appetite,compared to other arthritis groups on days 2–3 (p&lt;0.05). Study drugs did not influence serum calcium ion and glucose levels. Taken together, this preliminary study shows that a single intra-articular injection of calcipotriol reduces histological grade of synovitis a week after the local injection, but dexamethasone did not differ from the vehicle. Calcipotriol may have an early disease-modifying effect in the rat ZIA model without obvious side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3153922450,"This study develops a definition of what mangrove-fisheries can encompass, incorporating a broad range of their possible characteristics. A detailed case study was conducted to develop a typology of mangrove-fishing in the Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia, using interview surveys to investigate the fishing activities associated with mangroves. This case study demonstrated the complexity that a mangrove-fishery can entail, where fishing is connected to the mangrove forest by fishers of multiple sectors, functions, locations and temporal scales. Through a comparison with other mangrove-fishing communities in Bali, it also highlighted that mangrove-fisheries are variable even when in close proximity. With particular reference to this case study, a framework was developed as a flexible tool for identifying the multiple dimensions of a mangrove-fishery in a local context. Following this framework should encourage researchers and managers to look outside of the groups of fishers traditionally expected to benefit from mangrove fishing. This will enable the development of a broader definition of mangrove-fisheries in a site specific way. Identifying the full scope of fishers that contribute to or benefit from a mangrove-fishery is the first step towards building management measures that reflect the interests of groups of fishers that may otherwise remain under-represented. This is in line with international efforts for sustainability, especially in promoting small-scale fishers’ access to sustainable resources under the UN Sustainable Development Goals."
https://openalex.org/W3154571914,"Introduction The longstanding inadequacies of syndromic management for genital ulceration and inflammation are well-described. The Rwanda National Guidelines for sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndromic management are not yet informed by the local prevalence and correlates of STI etiologies, a component World Health Organization guidelines stress as critical to optimize locally relevant algorithms. Methods Radio announcements and pharmacists recruited symptomatic patients to seek free STI services in Kigali. Clients who sought services were asked to refer sexual partners and symptomatic friends. Demographic, behavioral risk factor, medical history, and symptom data were collected. Genital exams were performed by trained research nurses and physicians. We conducted phlebotomy for rapid HIV and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) serologies and vaginal pool swab for microscopy of wet preparation to diagnose Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV), and vaginal Candida albicans (VCA). GeneXpert testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) were conducted. Here we assess factors associated with diagnosis of NG and CT in men and women. We also explore factors associated with TV, BV and VCA in women. Finally, we describe genital ulcer and RPR results by HIV status, gender, and circumcision in men. Results Among 974 men (with 1013 visits), 20% were positive for CT and 74% were positive for NG. Among 569 women (with 579 visits), 17% were positive for CT and 27% were positive for NG. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with CT in men included younger age, responding to radio advertisements, &lt;17 days since suspected exposure, and not having dysuria. Factors associated with NG in men included not having higher education or full-time employment, &lt;17 days since suspected exposure, not reporting a genital ulcer, and having urethral discharge on physical exam. Factors associated with CT in women included younger age and &lt; = 10 days with symptoms. Factors associated with NG in women included younger age, lower education and lack of full-time employment, sometimes using condoms vs . never, using hormonal vs . non-hormonal contraception, not having genital ulcer or itching, having symptoms &lt; = 10 days, HIV+ status, having BV, endocervical discharge noted on speculum exam, and negative vaginal wet mount for VCA. In multivariate analyses, only reporting &gt;1 partner was associated with BV; being single and RPR+ was associated with TV; and having &lt; = 1 partner in the last month, being pregnant, genital itching, discharge, and being HIV and RPR negative were associated with VCA. Genital ulcers and positive RPR were associated with being HIV+ and lack of circumcision among men. HIV+ women were more likely to be RPR+. In HIV+ men and women, ulcers were more likely to be herpetic rather than syphilitic compared with their HIV- counterparts. Conclusions Syndromic management guidelines in Rwanda can be improved with consideration of the prevalence of confirmed infections from this study of symptomatic men and women representative of those who would seek care at government health centers. Inclusion of demographic and risk factor measures shown to be predictive of STI and non-STI dysbioses may also increase diagnostic accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3154579315,"There is no agreement regarding the role of fresh fruit and vegetables’ affordability, accessibility and availability, or access in general, on obesity rates. In this article we investigated whether access to fresh fruit and vegetables is related to better biometric indicators such as weight and body mass index. Using mediation and matching methods and assuming that farmers and traditional market sellers have easy access to fruit and vegetables, we found that having better access is not associated to a reduction in weight or body mass index. Potential explanations for this result are that better access was not associated with fresh fruit and vegetables’ consumption and fruit and vegetables’ consumption was not associated with weight and body mass index. Also, fresh fruit and vegetables’ sellers had a higher weight and body mass index compared to the rest of the population but, a similar weight and body mass index compared to people with their same educational level. Therefore, variations on weight and body mass index were more associated with educational level rather than with access. Access may not be the single story to explain fruit and vegetable consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3154974460,"The ReAL model is a multinomial processing tree model that quantifies the contribution of three qualitatively distinct processes–recoding, associations, and accuracy–to responses on the implicit association test (IAT), but has only been validated on a modified version of the IAT procedure. The initial goal of the present research was to validate an abbreviated version of the ReAL model (i.e., the Brief ReAL model) on the standard IAT procedure. Two experiments replicated previous validity evidence for the ReAL model on the modified IAT procedure, but did not produce valid parameter estimates for the Brief ReAL model on the standard IAT procedure. A third, pre-registered experiment systematically manipulated all of the task procedures that vary between the standard and modified IAT procedures–response deadline, number of trials, trial constraints–to determine the conditions under which the Brief ReAL model can be validly applied to the IAT. The Brief ReAL model estimated theoretically-interpretable parameters only under a narrow range of IAT conditions, but the ReAL model generally estimated theoretically-interpretable parameters under most IAT conditions. We discuss the application of these findings to implicit social cognition research, and their implications to social cognitive theory."
https://openalex.org/W3156635321,"The restoration of the Poisson noisy images is an essential task in many imaging applications due to the uncertainty of the number of discrete particles incident on the image sensor. In this paper, we consider utilizing a hybrid regularizer for Poisson noisy image restoration. The proposed regularizer, which combines the overlapping group sparse (OGS) total variation with the high-order nonconvex total variation, can alleviate the staircase artifacts while preserving the original sharp edges. We use the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers to design an efficient minimization algorithm for the proposed model. Since the objective function is the sum of the non-quadratic log-likelihood and nonconvex nondifferentiable regularizer, we propose to solve the intractable subproblems by the majorization-minimization (MM) method and the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, respectively. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method for Poissonian image restoration including denoising and deblurring."
https://openalex.org/W3156672462,"Purpose To evaluate changes in central corneal thickness (CCT) following vitrectomy. Methods All consecutive old and new patients referred to glaucoma services for possible secondary glaucoma after vitrectomy and who had undergone corneal pachymetry between July 2013 to June 2020, were included. The eye that developed elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and was diagnosed clinically as glaucoma after vitrectomy, was labelled as the “affected” eye. The contralateral eye of the patient with normal IOP and no history of vitrectomy was labelled as the “control” eye. The difference in CCT in the affected eye and the contralateral control eye (ΔCCT) and CCT were compared between different age groups. Correlation of CCT in the affected eye with age, diagnosis, type of surgery done, lens status and pre-existing glaucoma was done using multivariate regression analysis. Results Of 127 eyes of 120 patients (M:F = 85:35), the average CCT in the affected eye was significantly higher than the unaffected contralateral control eye (p&lt;0.0001). The ΔCCT in eyes presenting at an age &lt;25 years was higher (median 582, 497–840) than those that presented later (median 518, 384–755), p &lt;0.0001, with maximum ΔCCT seen in eyes that had undergone vitrectomy at age&lt;12 years. The CCT in the affected eye was significantly higher in aphakic eyes (588±81.6 microns) than in pseudophakic eyes (552±79.03 microns), p = 0.03. On multivariate analysis, age&lt;25 years remained as a significant influencer of CCT in the affected eye (β = -1.7, p&lt;0.001, R2 = 28.3%). Conclusions Young age group&lt;25 years are more prone to corneal remodelling and CCT changes after vitrectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3154136377,"Background Children with central nervous system (CNS) tumors undergo frequent imaging for diagnosis and follow-up, but few studies have characterized longitudinal imaging patterns. We described medical imaging in children before and after malignant CNS tumor diagnosis. Procedure We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children aged 0–20 years diagnosed with CNS tumors between 1996–2016 at six U.S. integrated healthcare systems and Ontario, Canada. We collected computed topography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radiography, ultrasound, nuclear medicine examinations from 12 months before through 10 years after CNS diagnosis censoring six months before death or a subsequent cancer diagnosis, disenrollment from the health system, age 21 years, or December 31, 2016. We calculated imaging rates per child per month stratified by modality, country, diagnosis age, calendar year, time since diagnosis, and tumor grade. Results We observed 1,879 children with median four years follow-up post-diagnosis in the U.S. and seven years in Ontario, Canada. During the diagnosis period (±15 days of diagnosis), children averaged 1.10 CTs (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–1.13) and 2.14 MRIs (95%CI 2.12–2.16) in the U.S., and 1.67 CTs (95%CI 1.65–1.68) and 1.86 MRIs (95%CI 1.85–1.88) in Ontario. Within one year after diagnosis, 19% of children had ≥5 CTs and 45% had ≥5 MRIs. By nine years after diagnosis, children averaged one MRI and one radiograph per year with little use of other imaging modalities. Conclusions MRI and CT are commonly used for CNS tumor diagnosis, whereas MRI is the primary modality used during surveillance of children with CNS tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3154797345,"Prolonged hospitalization places a significant burden on healthcare resources. Compared to the general population, hospital length of stay (LOS) is generally longer in HIV-positive patients. We identified predictors of prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) in HIV-positive patients presenting to an emergency department (ED).In this cross-sectional study, HIV-positive patients presenting to the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital adult ED were prospectively enrolled between 07 July 2017 and 18 October 2018. Data was subjected to univariate and multivariate logistic regression to determine parameters associated with a higher likelihood of prolonged hospital LOS, defined as ≥7 days.Among the 1224 participants that were enrolled, the median (IQR) LOS was 4.6 (2.6-8.2) days, while the mean (SD) LOS was 6.9 (8.2) days. On multivariate analysis of the data, hemoglobin <11 g/dL (OR 1.37, p = 0.032), Glasgow coma scale (GCS) <15 (OR 1.80, p = 0.001), creatinine >120 μmol/L (OR 1.85, p = 0.000), cryptococcal meningitis (OR 2.45, p = 0.015) and bacterial meningitis (OR 4.83, p = 0.002) were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of LOS ≥7 days, while bacterial pneumonia (OR 0.35, p = 0.000) and acute gastroenteritis (OR 0.40, p = 0.025) were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of LOS ≥7 days.Various clinical and laboratory parameters are useful in predicting prolonged hospitalization among HIV-positive patients presenting to the ED. These parameters may be useful in guiding clinical decision making and directing the allocation of resources."
https://openalex.org/W3156078783,"Introduction The quality of the corneal tissue can be influenced by several factors inherent to the recipient, donor, and to the donation and transplantation process. The donated corneal tissue can be classified by its quality as excellent, good, regular, bad, or unacceptable for transplantation, evaluating it in a slit lamp. Objective To analyze the relationship between the clinical and sociodemographic variables of the donors and the donation process and the classification of the quality of the corneal tissue collected for transplantation. Methods This is an epidemiologic study, retrospective cohort type, which addressed the process of cornea donation by the Human Eye Tissue Bank in a reference service in Northeast Brazil. The sample consisted of corneas processed by the Human Eye Tissue Bank of Rio Grande do Norte (n = 419). For descriptive and inferential analysis, the study used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 25.0, and considered a significance level of 0.05. Logistic regression analysis was used for the adjustment of the final model. Results It was verified that the epidemiological profile showed a prevalence of individuals with a mean age of 42.54 years old, male (73.99%), and living in the metropolitan region of the state capital (75.66%). When analyzing the relationship between the clinical and sociodemographic variables of the donors, it was identified that those aged 45 years old or less had better quality corneas (excellent and good), while the chronological variables were predictive factors for corneas of regular and bad qualities. Conclusion The identification of the factors inherent to the donation process and predictors of corneal tissue quality contribute to minimizing the risk of transplantation and to a better ocular prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3156463512,"Background and aims Compared to in-hospital births, the long-term outcome of children born out-of-hospital, planned or unplanned, is poorly studied. This study aimed to examine mortality and morbidity by seven years of age in children born out-of-hospital compared to those born in-hospital. Methods This study was registered retrospectively and included 790 136 children born in Finland between 1996 and 2013. The study population was divided into three groups according to birth site: in-hospital (n = 788 622), planned out-of-hospital (n = 176), and unplanned out-of-hospital (n = 1338). Data regarding deaths, hospital visits, reimbursement of medical expenses, and disability allowances was collected up to seven years of age or by the year-end of 2018. The association between birth site and childhood morbidity was determined using multivariable-adjusted Cox hazard regression analysis. Results No deaths were reported during the first seven years after birth in the children born out-of-hospital. The percentage of children with hospital visits due to infection by seven years of age was lower in those born planned out-of-hospital and in the combined planned out-of-hospital and unplanned out-of-hospital group compared to those born in-hospital. Furthermore, the percentage of children with hospital visits and who received disability allowances due to neurological or mental disorders was higher among those born unplanned out-of-hospital and out-of-hospital in total when compared to those born in-hospital. In the multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the hazard ratio for hospital visits due to asthma and/or allergic diseases (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72–0.98) was lower in children born out-of-hospital when compared to those born in-hospital. A similar decreased risk was found due to infections (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.68–0.84). However, the risk for neurological or mental health disorders was similar between the children born in-hospital and out-of-hospital. Conclusions Morbidity related to asthma or allergic diseases and infections by seven years of age appeared to be lower in children born out-of-hospital. Birth out-of-hospital seemed to not be associated with increased risk for neurological morbidity nor early childhood mortality. Our study groups were small and heterogeneous and because of this the results need to be interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W3153243177,"Objectives Copeptin, an equimolar indicator of serum antidiuretic hormone levels, has been associated with higher mortality in critically ill patients and with the development of diabetes in the general population. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of copeptin levels with glycemic parameters in critically ill patients and to compare the time-course of copeptin in survivors and non-survivors. Design Prospective cohort study. Patients From June to October 2019, critically ill patients were prospectively enrolled and followed for 90 days. Measurements Plasma copeptin levels were determined at intensive care unit (ICU) admission (copeptin T1), 24 h (copeptin T2), and 48 h (copeptin T3) after study entry. Blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels were measured. ICU, in-hospital, and 90-day mortality, and length of stay in the ICU and hospital were evaluated. Results 104 patients were included. No significant correlation was detected between copeptin levels and blood glucose (r = -0.17, p = 0.09), HbA1c (r = 0.01, p = 0.9), glycemic gap (r = -0.16, p = 0.11), and stress hyperglycemia ratio (r = -0.14, p = 0.16). Copeptin T3 levels were significantly higher in survivors than in non-survivors at hospital discharge (561 [370–856] vs 300 [231–693] pg/mL, p = 0.015) and at 90 days (571 [380–884] vs 300 [232–698] pg/mL, p = 0.03). Conclusions No significant correlations were found between copeptin levels and glycemic parameters, suggesting that copeptin is not a relevant factor in the induction of hyperglycemia during critical illness. Copeptin levels at ICU day 3 were higher in survivors than in non-survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3156287505,"Bioaerosols are defined as aerosols that comprise particles of biological origin or activity that may affect living organisms through infectivity, allergenicity, toxicity, or through pharmacological or other processes. Interest in bioaerosol exposure has increased over the last few decades. Exposure to bioaerosols may cause three major problems in the food industry, namely: (i) contamination of food (spoilage); (ii) allergic reactions in individual consumers; or (iii) infection by means of pathogenic microorganisms present in the aerosol. The aim of this study was to characterise the culturable fraction of bioaerosols in the production environment of a fruit juice manufacturing facility and categorise isolates as harmful, innocuous or potentially beneficial to the industry, personnel and environment. Active sampling was used to collect representative samples of five areas in the facility during peak and off-peak seasons. Areas included the entrance, preparation and mixing area, between production lines, bottle dispersion and filling stations. Microbes were isolated and identified using 16S, 26S or ITS amplicon sequencing. High microbial counts and species diversity were detected in the facility. 239 bacteria, 41 yeasts and 43 moulds were isolated from the air in the production environment. Isolates were categorised into three main groups, namely 27 innocuous, 26 useful and 39 harmful bioaerosols. Harmful bioaerosols belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Penicillium and Candida were present. Although innocuous and useful bioaerosols do not negatively influence human health their presence act as an indicator that an ideal environment exists for possible harmful bioaerosols to emerge."
