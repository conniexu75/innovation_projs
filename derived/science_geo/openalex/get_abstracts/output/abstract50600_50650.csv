https://openalex.org/W2040193953,"A gene-specific transcription factor, called USF, has been partially purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Addition of USF results in a 10 to 20 fold increase in transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter in an in vitro system reconstituted with transcription factors TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, and RNA polymerase II. Binding of USF to the promoter inhibits DNAase I cleavages over a 20 base pair region just upstream of the -45 to +35 region shown previously to interact with TFIID. More discriminating footprint analyses using methidiumpropyl-EDTA-Fe(II) as the cleaving agent indicate that USF interacts primarily with the small palindromic DNA sequence GGCCACGTGACC located between positions -63 and -52 of the major late promoter, while TFIID interacts primarily with a 10 base pair DNA region centered on the consensus TATA sequence. Dissociation rate measurements indicate a cooperative interaction between USF and TFIID when simultaneously bound to the promoter DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2166801871,"A gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay has been used to identify proteins in HeLa cell extracts that specifically bind to the major late promoter of adenovirus. A major late promoter transcription factor MLTF has been detected as a discrete protein-DNA complex. MLTF binds specifically and with high affinity to sequences upstream of the TATA box of the major late promoter. This factor protects a 17 bp (-50 to -66) region in a DNAase I footprinting assay. The same region has been shown to be important for efficient transcription from the major late promoter both in vivo and in vitro. MLTF stimulates in vitro transcription only from a template containing this upstream region. The binding, footprinting, and transcription-stimulatory activities of MLTF cofractionate through two chromatographic steps. These results suggest that direct binding of MLTF to an upstream element activates transcription from the major late promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1506178395,"Abstract The cold-insoluble globulin (CI-globulin) of human plasma has been highly purified. Starting with Fraction I-1, or plasma cryoprecipitate, 2.1 m glycine fractionation (15°) precipitated mainly fibrinogen; concentration of supernatant CI-globulin-enriched material (16% ethanol, -4°) was carried out prior to final purification by chromatography on di-ethylaminoethylcellulose. Chromatographically purified CI-globulin contained no detectable fibrinogen and was homogeneous upon ultracentrifugation (s20,w0 = 12.3 S); only trace amounts of NH2-terminal amino acids were detectable. CI-globulin migrated as a fast β-globulin in agarose gel or cellulose acetate strip electrophoresis. In immunoelectrophoretic experiments, CI-globulin formed a single precipitin arc against an anti-CI-globulin serum. There was no detectable lipid, fibrin-stabilizing factor (Factor XIII), anti-hemophilic Factor B (Factor IX), plasminogen, plasmin, or thrombin inhibitory activity; low levels of anti-hemophilic factor A (Factor VIII) activity were present. There was no evidence of any alteration of the electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal, or NH2-terminal characteristics of CI-globulin following thrombin treatment or heating to 56° for 5 min. The plasma CI-globulin level, estimated by antigen-antibody crossed electrophoresis, was 0.33 g per liter (range = 0.26 to 0.38, n = 12). The level in serum, 0.20 g per liter (range = 0.14 to 0.30, n = 11), was consistently lower (19 to 52%), presumably attributable to CI-globulin incorporation or occlusion in the fibrin clot. After removal of plasma cryoprecipitate and Cohn Fraction I, supernatant CI-globulin levels were reduced by 59 and 79%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1985221567,"Two markers of neuronal plasticity were used to compare the response of the human central nervous system to neuronal loss resulting from Alzheimer's disease with the response of rats to a similar neuronal loss induced by lesions. In rats that had received lesions of the entorhinal cortex, axon sprouting of commissural and associational fibers into the denervated molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was paralleled by a spread in the distribution of tritiated kainic acid-binding sites. A similar expansion of kainic acid receptor distribution was observed in hippocampal samples obtained postmortem from patients with Alzheimer's disease. An enhancement of acetylcholinesterase activity in the dentate gyrus molecular layer, indicative of septal afferent sprouting, was also observed in those patients with a minimal loss of cholinergic neurons. These results are evidence that the central nervous system is capable of a plastic response in Alzheimer's disease. Adaptive growth responses occur along with the degenerative events."

https://openalex.org/W1990258307,"Red fluorescent and green fluorescent microspheres were instilled into separate but adjacent areas of dog lung lobes. After 7 days, the tracheobronchial lymph nodes that drained both of the instilled areas contained many macrophages with all red or all green microspheres but rarely both. This indicates that the particles did not translocate passively and that lung macrophages phagocytized the microspheres in the lung and carried them to the tracheobronchial lymph nodes. In addition, two populations of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM's), one that had phagocytized red microspheres in vivo and one that had phagocytized green microspheres, were lavaged from the lungs of dogs, mixed into one population, and instilled back into a previously unexposed lung lobe of the same dogs. As in the first experiment, the tracheobronchial lymph nodes that drained the instilled area contained numerous macrophages with either all red or all green microspheres. This suggested that the instilled PAM's had migrated to the tracheobronchial lymph nodes. Thus, lung macrophages, including PAM's probably play a critical role in the induction of lung immunity and in protection from disease by determining particle translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2058581358,"The tension that develops when relaxed muscles are stretched is the resting (or passive) tension. It has recently been shown that the resting tension of intact skeletal muscle fibers is equivalent to that of mechanically skinned skeletal muscle fibers. Laser diffraction measurements of sarcomere length have now been used to show that the exponential relation between resting tension and sarcomere length for whole frog semitendinosus muscle is similar to that of single fibers. Slack sarcomere lengths and the rates of stress relaxation in these muscles were similar to those in skinned fibers, and sarcomere length remained unchanged during stress relaxation, as in skinned fibers. Thus, in intact semitendinosus muscle of the frog up to a sarcomere length of about 3.8 micrometers, resting tension arises, not in the connective tissue as is commonly thought, but in the elastic resistance of the myofibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2052018389,"mRNA precursors with stable hairpins were constructed by inserting inverted repeats into an adenovirus transcriptional template that encoded the three late leader exons. When the loop of the hairpin contained the second exon and the flanking splice sites, most of the RNA spliced in vitro had the first exon joined directly to the third exon. The remainder was spliced normally. The same types of alternatively spliced RNAs were formed when a similar template was introduced into HeLa cells by transfection. Thus both in extracts and in cells, an exon became optional when sequestered in a hairpin loop. Perhaps a related mechanism creates the alternative splicing patterns of complex transcription units."
https://openalex.org/W2087932896,"X-ray diffraction patterns have been obtained from partially oriented samples of 300A chromatin filaments. The chromatin was prepared by methods that preserve its structure, and conditions were found in which the 300A filaments spontaneously form ordered aggregates, so that it was not necessary to pull fibers. The diffraction patterns show a meridional band at 110A, and equatorial bands at 340, 57, 37, and 27A. These patterns, together with patterns calculated from the known 7A electron density map of the nucleosome core particle, imply side-to-side packing of nucleosomes in the direction of the 300A filament, and radial packing around it. These results are consistent with the ""solenoid"" model of Finch and Klug, and are inconsistent with many other proposed models."
https://openalex.org/W2009100337,"Electron microscopy of rotary-shadowed fibrinogen demonstrates that the molecules modified for crystallization by limited cleavage with a bacterial protease retain the major features of the native structure. This evidence, together with image processing and x-ray analysis of the crystals and of fibrin, has been used to develop a three-dimensional low resolution model for the molecule. The data indicate that the two large end domains of the molecule would be composed of the carboxyl-terminus of the B beta chain (proximal) and gamma chain (distal), respectively; the carboxyl-terminus of the A alpha chain would fold back to form an additional central domain. On this basis, the carboxyl-terminal region of each of the three chains of fibrinogen is folded independently into a globular domain."

https://openalex.org/W2020570811,"Using an antisense construct of the discoidin gene transfected into Dictyostelium, we have repressed the expression of the three endogenous discoidin genes. Transformants exhibit a greater than 90% reduction in accumulated discoidin mRNA and protein. Nuclear run-on assays show that both the endogenous and the antisense genes are transcribed. Since only minor amounts of endogenous gene transcripts and none from the antisense gene can be detected on blots, we suggest that hybrids are formed within the nucleus and are rapidly degraded. Discoidin is believed to play a role in cell-substratum interaction and exhibits homologies to fibronectin. Discoidin-minus mutants exhibit the developmental phenotype of not streaming on a plastic surface. Antisense transformants show a similar phenotype and are thus phenocopies of these mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1967724786,"Fractal surfaces can be used to characterize the roughness or irregularity of protein surfaces. The degree of irregularity of a surface may be described by the fractal dimension D. For protein surfaces defined with probes in the range of 1.0 to 3.5 angstroms in radius, D is approximately 2.4 or intermediate between the value for a completely smooth surface (D = 2) and that for a completely space-filling surface (D = 3). Individual regions of proteins show considerable variation in D. These variations may be related to structural features such as active sites and subunit interfaces, suggesting that surface texture may be a factor influencing molecular interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2129625403,"Active or potentially active gene loci are preferentially sensitive to DNAase I digestion. Cedar and colleagues used this DNAase I sensitivity to label active sequences preferentially by nick translation of nuclei and chromosomes. Using biotinylated nucleotides and immunofluorescence detection, we have looked for compartmentalization of DNAase I-sensitive sequences by nick translation of nuclei maintained as three-dimensional structures. Labeled sequences in mouse L cells are preferentially localized at the nuclear periphery in both permeabilized nuclei and frozen sections. In newt and chicken nucleated erythrocytes, labeled regions are at borders of condensed chromatin masses along interchromatin channels communicating with the nuclear periphery. Control experiments indicate that nick translation of nuclei preferentially labels highly expressed genes and that the preferential localization of DNAase-I sensitive regions is probably not a consequence of fixation artifacts or selective nuclear permeability to the labeling reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2109354206,RNA polymerase I terminates transcription of mouse rDNA 565 bp downstream of the 3' end of mature 28S rRNA. This specific termination event can be duplicated in a nuclear extract system. RNA molecules with authentic 3' ends are transcribed from ribosomal minigene constructs provided the templates retain a minimal length of downstream spacer sequences. The nucleotide sequence of the region of transcription termination contains a set of repetitive structural elements consisting of 18 bp conserved nucleotides surrounded by stretches of pyrimidines. Termination in vivo occurs within the first element. This site is preferentially used in vitro at low template concentrations. At increasing DNA concentrations a termination site within the second repetitive element is used. Competition experiments with defined 3'-terminal fragments suggest that transcription termination by RNA polymerase I requires interaction of some factor (or factors) with the repetitive structural elements in the 3' nontranscribed spacer.
https://openalex.org/W1975096359,"A new process allows microencapsulation of purified human hemoglobin and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate to form neohemocytes. The microcapsule membrane is composed of phospholipids and cholesterol. Neohemocytes are substantially smaller than erythrocytes, contain 15.1 grams per decaliter of hemoglobin, and have a P50 value (the partial pressure of oxygen at which the hemoglobin is half-saturated) of 24.0 torr. All rats given 50-percent exchange transfusions survived with only limited evidence of reversible toxicity. Normal serum glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase values at 1, 7, and 30 days after transfusion were consistent with minimal hepatotoxicity. The concentration of blood urea-nitrogen was elevated by 35 percent after 1 day but returned to normal by day 7. However, histopathology revealed normal kidneys on day 1 as well as on days 7 and 30. Neohemocytes cleared from the circulation of transfused rats with an apparent half-life of 5.8 hours."

The two stack images sample the same depth slice of translucent or reflective specimens. The method will work most conveniently with a tandem scanning microscope (a direct-view, confocal scanning optical microscope). This is a direct method for recording stereo images that can be used to the limit of resolution in optical microscopy. It demonstrates a previously unrealized advantage of confocal optical microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2120222594,"Secretion of a foreign protein--chicken oviduct lysozyme--and of endogenous proteins was studied in the polarized epithelial Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line. Cell clones that secrete enzymatically active chicken lysozyme were generated by transforming the cells with lysozyme cDNA inserted in a SV40-pBR322 recombinant vector and a dominant selectable marker gene. The kinetics and polarity of lysozyme secretion from one transformed cell clone were studied using cell monolayers grown on nitrocellulose filters. Lysozyme was secreted into the apical and the basolateral medium, demonstrating the existence of direct transport pathways to each cell surface. Control experiments excluded the effects of monolayer leakiness, reabsorption, transepithelial transport, and depolarization. In contrast, the secretion of a set of endogenous proteins of MW 30-40 kd was found to be strictly apical showing that polarized secretion also occurs in this cell line. The latter group of proteins appear to be generated from larger precursor molecules by intracellular cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W2025907128,"The mitochondrial genome of the S-type male-sterile cytoplasm of maize appears to be a collection of linear DNA molecules that are maintained by two linear episomal DNA species, S1 (6397 bp) and S2 (5453 bp), recombining with larger circular molecules. The M825 inbred nuclear genotype promotes a high frequency of spontaneous fertile mutants. Where the mutation is maternally inherited, analysis of the mitochondrial DNA reveals that the S1 and S2 episomes and all associated linear molecules have been lost. Integrated copies of the S1 and S2 episomes are retained, though part of one of the two terminal inverted repeats of the integrated S2 sequence has been deleted in all revertants studied. This deletion appears to correlate with the absence of the S2-URF-1 transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2068649105,"Supercoiled plasmid DNAs (at bacterial superhelical density) harboring the homopurine-homopyrimidine sequence, poly(dG)-poly(dC), were reacted with bromoacetaldehyde (BAA), a reagent that reacts with unpaired DNA bases. Not only did the poly(dG)-poly(dC) sequence react with BAA but, surprisingly, neighboring sequences located 3' to the contiguous G sequences also reacted. The altered conformation in the poly(dG)-poly(dC) sequence and in the neighboring sequence occurred in the same supercoiled plasmid DNA molecule. Furthermore, the occurrence of an ""unpaired"" conformation in the neighboring sequence is strictly due to a positional effect, since it is observed when the poly(dG)-poly(dC) segment is adjacent to a variety of neighboring sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2077159423,"Human adenovirus-12-transformed cells express greatly reduced levels of the major histocompatibility complex class I antigens and are highly tumorigenic in syngeneic hosts. The finding that expression of a transfected class I gene is sufficient to abrogate their tumorigenicity underscores the importance of defining the conditions that will lead to derepression of endogenous class I genes in these cells. Brief treatment of Ad12-transformed cells with interferon results in the rapid but transient expression of class I antigens, and these interferon-treated cells have significantly reduced tumorigenicity in immunocompetent hosts. We have further demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of interferon, subsequent to the introduction of a tumorigenic dose of Ad12-transformed cells, results in complete protection against this tumor. The ability of interferon to ""induce"" class I gene expression may be an important modality in the treatment of a variety of spontaneous tumors that exhibit greatly reduced levels of class I antigens on their cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2153771719,"Cytoplasmic pH (pHi) was monitored during the cell cycle of synchronous populations of Dictyostelium discoideum by means of a pH ""null point"" method. There is a cycle of pHi that closely corresponds to the DNA replication cycle, with a minimum of pH 7.20 in interphase and a peak of pH 7.45 during S phase and mitosis. When DNA replication is blocked by hydroxyurea, pHi continues to oscillate with a similar period as the uninhibited division cycle. Even when protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide the periodic pHi cycles persist. Artificially raising pHi in exponentially growing cells by approximately 0.1 units causes a severalfold increase in the rates of protein and DNA synthesis. We conclude that an autonomous pHi oscillator exists in Dictyostelium cells, which operates independently of protein and DNA synthesis and which may have a major role in the timing and regulation of the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1603359051,"A non-ceruloplasmin ferroxidase (ferroxidase-II) protein was isolated from human serum and completely resolved from ceruloplasmin by DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography. This protein was isolated and purified approximately 500-fold by utilization of the Cohn IV-1 fraction, DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography, and gel filtration on Agarose A-15m, followed by gel filtration on Agarose A-50m. Ferroxidase-II differed from ceruloplasmin in many respects. Three of the most important differences were that ferroxidase-II (a) was yellow rather than blue as ceruloplasmin, (b) it was not inhibited by azide, and (c) it exhibited no p-phenylenediamine oxidase activity. Ferroxidase-II also differed significantly from the known plasma amine oxidases. The ferroxidase activity of ferroxidase-II was not lost by dialysis or ultrafiltration, but was inactivated by heat treatment and was proportional to the protein concentration at all stages of purification. Oxygen consumption with ferroxidase-II was observed simultaneously with iron oxidation. The ferroxidase-II activity in Wilson's disease serum represented a much larger percentage of the total ferroxidase activity than in normal serum. Although ferroxidase-II was decreased in Wilson's disease serum, it was reduced to a lesser extent than the ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity. Thus ferroxidase-II may account for the lack of correlation of ferroxidase activity with p-phenylenediamine oxidase activity of Wilson's disease serum and may be responsible for the maintenance of near normal iron metabolism despite the low levels of ceruloplasmin."

These proteins can be divided into at least nine groups (subgroups) based on sequence patterns which are so distinct that each subgroup is probably encoded by at least one germ-line gene. The subgroups of mouse kappa chains are generally quite different from those of human kappa chains.

https://openalex.org/W1591409921,"Abstract Antisera were prepared against the ferredoxins from Clostridium acidi-urici and Clostridium pasteurianum and characterized by quantitative precipitin and microcomplement fixation methods. The clostridial ferredoxins are thus the smallest naturally occurring polypeptides that have been shown to produce precipitating antibodies. The ferredoxin antibody of the immune rabbit serum is contained in the IgG fraction. The antiserum prepared against C. pasteurianum ferredoxin does not react with C. acidi-urici ferredoxin. Reconstituted ferredoxin is antigenically indistinguishable from the native ferredoxin as tested by microcomplement fixation. The antisera react much more strongly with ferredoxin than with apoferredoxin. Interpretation of this observation with respect to showing the difference in the conformation of ferredoxin and apoferredoxin is limited because the possible role of the iron-sulfur chromophore of ferredoxin as an antigenic determinant is not known. However, experiments with the tritium-hydrogen exchange technique showed conformational differences between the polypeptide portions of apoferredoxin and ferredoxin. Differences between the conformations of the polypeptide chain of the oxidized and the reduced states of C. acidi-urici ferredoxin were also shown by the tritium-hydrogen exchange technique. The reduced state was found to have fewer sites for equilibration with tritium, and thus to have a conformation more compact than the oxidized state of the iron-sulfur protein. Ferredoxin reconstituted from the fully tritiated apoferredoxin was found to retain more replaceable hydrogen atoms than the native oxidized ferredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2069400126,"With phenazine methosulfate and nitro blue tetrazolium, an activity stain for threonine deaminase has been developed. Because the deamination reaction does not involve any overall oxidation or reduction, it is proposed that one of the intermediates of the reaction, α-aminocrotonate or α-iminobutyrate, is the reducing agent. Studies with ferricyanide as the artificial electron acceptor indicate that a decarboxylation of the intermediate occurs during the dye reduction."
https://openalex.org/W119481034,"Electrophoretic analysis of extracts of 12 bumblebee species revealed complex patterns of extramitochondrial diphosphopyridine nucleotide-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8) variants. Most Bombus species show one pattern, while Bombus nevadensis has a second and Bombus occidentalis a third pattern. All three Psithyrus (i.e. parasitic bumblebee) species tested have a fourth pattern. All patterns share one feature, i.e. there is both a slow and fast migrating set of two to four bands each. The slow set, as a whole, stains more intensely than the fast set in flight muscle extracts, whereas the opposite is true for extracts of heads and abdomens. The slow sets have been termed alar-muscular, the fast sets omniregional. The major alar-muscular isozyme has been crystallized from thoraces of B. nevadensis. The omniregional isozymes of most, but not all, bumblebees utilize triphosphopyridine nucleotide, whereas none of the alarmuscular variants utilize this nucleotide. Electrophoretic experiments indicate that most, if not all, the variants differ in primary structure. In contrast to bumblebees, honeybees have only one form of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Rabbit antibodies directed against glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of honeybees and of B. nevadensis were prepared. Each of these antisera precipitated the honeybee enzyme and all of the bumblebee isozymes. Immunological experiments using the micro-complement fixation technique with anti-B. nevadensis glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reveal that thoracic extracts of all other bumblebees tested cross-reacted very strongly, with Bombus bifarius and B. occidentalis extracts showing slightly less reactivity than that of the other Bombus and Psithyrus species. Honeybee extracts cross-reacted much more weakly. Micro-complement fixation studies with anti-honeybee glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase suggest that extracts of different bumblebee species are immunochemically indistinguishable from one another."
