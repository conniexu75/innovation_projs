https://openalex.org/W2084544351,"There is a widespread interest in developing renewable sources of islet-replacement tissue for type I diabetes mellitus. Human mesenchymal cells isolated from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord (HUMSCs), which can be easily obtained and processed compared with embryonic and bone marrow stem cells, possess stem cell properties. HUMSCs may be a valuable source for the generation of islets.HUMSCs were induced to transform into islet-like cell clusters in vitro through stepwise culturing in neuron-conditioned medium. To assess the functional stability of the islet-like cell clusters in vivo, these cell clusters were transplanted into the liver of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats via laparotomy. Glucose tolerance was measured on week 12 after transplantation accompanied with immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy analysis. These islet-like cell clusters were shown to contain human C-peptide and release human insulin in response to physiological glucose levels. Real-time RT-PCR detected the expressions of insulin and other pancreatic beta-cell-related genes (Pdx1, Hlxb9, Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1, and Glut-2) in these islet-like cell clusters. The hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was significantly alleviated after xenotransplantation of islet-like cell clusters, without the use of immunosuppressants. In addition to the existence of islet-like cell clusters in the liver, some special fused liver cells were also found, which characterized by human insulin and nuclei-positive staining and possessing secretory granules.In this study, we successfully differentiate HUMSCs into mature islet-like cell clusters, and these islet-like cell clusters possess insulin-producing ability in vitro and in vivo. HUMSCs in Wharton's Jelly of the umbilical cord seem to be the preferential source of stem cells to convert into insulin-producing cells, because of the large potential donor pool, its rapid availability, no risk of discomfort for the donor, and low risk of rejection."
https://openalex.org/W1984426737,"Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is an important mechanism regulating global and gene-specific translation in response to different environmental stresses. Central to the eIF2 kinase response is the preferential translation of ATF4 mRNA, encoding a transcriptional activator of genes involved in stress remediation. In this report, we addressed whether there are additional transcription factors whose translational expression is regulated by eIF2 kinases. We show that the expression of the basic zipper transcriptional regulator ATF5 is induced in response to many different stresses, including endoplasmic reticulum stress, arsenite exposure, and proteasome inhibition, by a mechanism requiring eIF2 phosphorylation. ATF5 is subject to translational control as illustrated by the preferential association of ATF5 mRNA with large polyribosomes in response to stress. ATF5 translational control involves two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) located in the 5′-leader of the ATF5 mRNA, a feature shared with ATF4. Mutational analyses of the 5′-leader of ATF5 mRNA fused to a luciferase reporter suggest that the 5′-proximal uORF1 is positive-acting, allowing scanning ribosomes to reinitiate translation of a downstream ORF. During non-stressed conditions, when eIF2 phosphorylation is low, ribosomes reinitiate translation at the next ORF, the inhibitory uORF2. Phosphorylation of eIF2 during stress delays translation reinitiation, allowing scanning ribosomes to bypass uORF2, and instead translate the ATF5 coding region. In addition to translational control, ATF5 mRNA levels are significantly reduced in ATF4-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts, suggesting that ATF4 contributes to basal ATF5 transcription. These results demonstrate that eIF2 kinases direct the translational expression of multiple transcription regulators by a mechanism involving delayed translation reinitiation.

Four eIF2α kinases have been described in mammals, each responding to different stress arrangements through their unique regulatory regions. For example, phosphorylation of eIF2α by PEK (also known as Perk or EIF2AK3) is induced by accumulation of malfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar, 5Marciniak S.J. Ron D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1133-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 6Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α during this so-called ER stress inhibits global translation by lowering the levels of eIF2-GTP that are central for binding of initiator Met-tRNAiMet to the translational machinery (1Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 2Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Together with reduced protein synthesis, eIF2α phosphorylation increases the preferential translation of ATF4 mRNA, encoding a basic zipper (bZIP) transcription activator that is important for directing the expression of genes involved in metabolism, the redox status of cells, and apoptosis (7Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol.

Decreased protein synthesis conserves energy and provides sufficient time for ATF4, and other stress-responsive transcription factors, to reconfigure gene expression that would block or ameliorate damage elicited by the underlying stress. Other members of the eIF2α kinase family include GCN2 (EIF2AK4), whose activity is enhanced by amino acid depletion, UV irradiation or proteasome inhibition; HRI (EIF2AK1), which is regulated by heme deficiency and oxidative stress; and PKR (EIF2AK2), which functions in an antiviral pathway (2Holcik M.

Enhanced ATF4 expression during stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation occurs primarily by translational control, as illustrated by increased association of ATF4 mRNA with polysomes (11Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Central to ATF4 translational control is the 5′-leader of the ATF4 mRNA, which encodes two uORFs that have opposing functions (8Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 9Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). ATF4 translation begins with the 40 S ribosomal subunit bound to eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAiMet scanning from the 5′-end of the ATF4 mRNA and initiating translation at the positive-acting uORF1. Following uORF1 translation, ribosomes are thought to retain association with ATF4 mRNA and reinitiate translation at a downstream coding region (2Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 8Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In non-stressed cells when eIF2α phosphorylation is low and there is abundant eIF2-GTP, ribosomes scanning downstream from uORF1 readily reinitiate translation at the next available ORF, the inhibitory uORF2. Following translation of uORF2, ribosomes are suggested to dissociate from the ATF4 transcript, leading to lowered translation of the ATF4 coding region. During stress conditions, elevated phosphorylation of eIF2α reduces eIF2-GTP levels, thus increasing the time required for scanning ribosomes to become competent to reinitiate translation. Following translation of uORF1, delayed reinitiation would allow for a portion of the ribosomes to bypass the uORF2 initiation codon, and instead translate the ATF4 coding region. The central feature in ATF4 translational control-delayed translation reinitiation in response to eIF2α phosphorylation, is shared with the mechanism that induces translation of a related bZIP transcriptional regulator GCN4 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). ATF4 can form homodimers or heterodimers with other bZIP transcription factors, and elevated ATF4 synthesis directly contributes to increased binding of this transcription activator to the promoters of targeted genes (4Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar, 6Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev.

Among these genes is CHOP/GADD153, a bZIP transcriptional regulator that facilitates apoptosis during stress conditions (5Marciniak S.J. Ron D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1133-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 6Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar, 15Zinszner H.

Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). ATF4 and CHOP contribute to the transcriptional expression of GADD34, encoding a targeting subunit for a type 1 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates eIF2α (5Marciniak S.J. Ron D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1133-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 16Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ATF4/GADD34 path is important for directing feedback control of the eIF2α kinase pathway, allowing for translation of stress-related mRNAs induced via ATF4. Microarray studies utilizing PEK/PERK-/- and ATF4-/- mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells reported that of the genes requiring eIF2α phosphorylation for their induction in response to ER stress, about half required ATF4 function (7Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2364) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there may be additional transcription factors that are important for directing the eIF2α kinase pathway and are subject to translational control. We reasoned that, given the central role for bZIP transcription activators in the eIF2α kinase response, there may be additional bZIP proteins that are subject to translational control in response to eIF2α phosphorylation. One candidate is ATF5, a bZIP transcriptional regulator that is encoded by an mRNA that contains two uORFs with analogous proximity to that described in the ATF4 transcript (13Vinson C. Myakishev M. Acharya A. Mir A.A. Moll J.R. Bonovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6321-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 17Hansen M.B. Mitchelmore C. Kjaerulff K.M. Rasmussen T.E. Pedersen K.M. Jensen N.A. Genomics. 2002; 80: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ATF5 mRNA is expressed in many different tissues, with the highest levels present in liver (17Hansen M.B. Mitchelmore C. Kjaerulff K.M. Rasmussen T.E. Pedersen K.M. Jensen N.A. Genomics. 2002; 80: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ATF5 is suggested to play a role in cell survival, and reduced ATF5 function by siRNA approaches was shown to lead to selective destruction of certain cultured cancer cells, such as glioblastomas (18Angelastro J.M. Canoll P.D. Kuo J. Weicker M. Costa A. Bruce J.N. Greene L.A. Oncogene. 2005; 25: 907-916Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because ATF5 is suggested to be highly expressed in neuroprogenitor cells, and is diminished in postmitotic neurons, appropriate expression of ATF5 is proposed to be critical for neural differentiation (18Angelastro J.M. Canoll P.D. Kuo J. Weicker M. Costa A. Bruce J.N. Greene L.A. Oncogene. 2005; 25: 907-916Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Angelastro J.M. Mason J.L. Ignatova T.N. Kukekov V.G. Stengren G.B.

Cell Neurosci. 2005; 29: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study we find that expression of ATF5 protein is induced in response to eIF2α phosphorylation during a range of different stress conditions. Increased ATF5 expression occurs by a translational mechanism involving ribosomal reinitiation and uORFs located in the 5′-leader of the ATF5 mRNA. Superimposed with this translational control, we find that ATF5 mRNA levels are significantly reduced in ATF4-/- MEF cells, suggesting a role for ATF4-directed transcription of ATF5. Together, these results suggest that eIF2α phosphorylation directs ATF5 expression, and this transcription factor is integral to the eIF2α kinase response. Expression of Recombinant ATF5 and Antibody Production—Human ATF5 cDNA was inserted between the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites of plasmid pET28, yielding p834 that encodes an N-terminal polyhistidine-tagged version of full-length ATF5 expressed from an inducible T7 promoter. This plasmid was introduced and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (F- ompTrB- containing lysogen DE3), and bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an A600 of between 0.4 and 0.6. 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the cultures, and after further incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in Buffer A solution (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) containing 10 mm imidazole and lysed using a French press. Proteins in the soluble and insoluble portions of the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie R-250. The majority of recombinant ATF5 protein was found to be in the insoluble fraction. The soluble lysate portion was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer A and incubated at 4 °C. The agarose was washed with Buffer A solution containing 50 mm imidazole, and the ATF5 protein was eluted with buffer A solution containing 200 mm imidazole. The purified recombinant ATF5 protein was Mr ∼ 35,000 and was specifically recognized by antibody recognizing the polyhistidine tag. To prepare ATF5-specific antibody, insoluble lysate containing recombinant ATF5 was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the ATF5 protein was sliced from the polyacrylamide gel and injected into rabbits. ATF5 polyclonal antibody was affinity-purified using recombinant ATF5 protein. As described further below in the immunoblot analyses, the ATF5-specific antibody recognized purified recombinant ATF5 protein and ATF5 in mouse and human cell lines that was induced by different stress conditions. Cell Culture and Stress Conditions—MEF cells that were derived from S/S (wild-type eIF2α) and A/A (mutant eIF2α-Ser51A) mice were previously described (22Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 23Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Scheuner D. Kaufmann R.J. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5651-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PEK-/- and GCN2-/- MEF cells, and their wild-type counterparts, were reported previously (24Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Lu D. Hai T. Harding H.P. Wang X. Ron D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. ER stress was elicited in MEF cells by the addition of either 0.1 μm or 1 μm thapsigargin to the medium, followed by incubation for up to 6 h, as indicated. Alternatively, 20 μm arsenite or 1 μm of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, was added to the culture medium, and the MEF cells were cultured for up to 6 h, as indicated. To block transcription, 10 μm actinomycin D was added to MEF cells, as indicated. Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were cultured as described (25Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and treated with either 20 μm arsenite or 1 μm thapsigargin. Preparation of Protein Lysates and Immunoblot Analyses—MEF and human HepG2 cells cultured in stressed or non-stressed conditions were washed two times with chilled phosphate-buffered solution, and lysed in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm NaF, 17.5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors (100 μm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm of pepstatin) and sonication for 30 s. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad protein quantitation kit for detergent lysis following the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of each protein sample were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Polypeptide markers of known molecular weights (Bio-Rad) were included to determine the size of proteins identified in the immunoblot analysis. Transferred filters were then incubated in TBS-T solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20 supplemented with 4% nonfat milk, followed by incubation with TBS-T solution with antibody that specifically recognized the indicated proteins. ATF5 antibody was prepared against recombinant human ATF5 protein, as described above. ATF4 antibody was prepared against an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody prepared against purified polyhistidine-tagged human ATF4. CHOP (sc-7351) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and β-actin monoclonal antibody (A5441) was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody that specifically recognized phosphorylated eIF2α at Ser-51 was purchased from BioSource (44-728G). Monoclonal antibodies that recognizes either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated forms of eIF2α was provided by Dr. Scot Kimball (Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA). Filters were then washed three times in TBS-T, and the protein-antibody complexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate. Autoradiograms shown in the figures are representative of three independent experiments. RNA Isolation and Analyses—Northern analyses were carried out as previously described (26Kevil C.G. Walsh L. Laroux F.S. Kalogeris T. Grisham M.B. Alexander J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from S/S and A/A MEF cells treated with 1 μm thapsigargin, 20 μm sodium arsenite, or no stress, for the indicated number of hours using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of total RNA from each sample preparation was separated by electrophoresis using a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by using ethidium bromide staining and UV light. RNA was transferred onto nylon filters and hybridized to 32P-labeled-DNA probes specific for the indicated genes. Filters were washed using high stringency conditions and visualized by autoradiography. Levels of ATF5-luciferase mRNA expressed in S/S and A/A MEF cells transfected with the ATF5-Luc fusion constructs were treated with 0.1 μm thapsigargin for 6 h, or no stress. A 32P-labeled probe complementary to the luciferase reporter gene was used in a Northern blot analysis to measure ATF5-Luc transcripts. Plasmid Constructions and Luciferase Assays—PCR was used to generate a HindIII-PagI fragment DNA encoding the full-length ATF5 mRNA leader and ATF5 initiation codon, which was inserted between HindIII and NcoI restriction sites in a derivative of plasmid pGL3. The resulting plasmid contains the 5′-portion of the ATF5 coding sequence fused to the luciferase reporter gene downstream of a minimal TK promoter. The ATG initiation codons in each of the uORFs in the ATF5 mRNA were mutated individually or in combination to AGG using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were sequenced to ensure that there were only the desired changes. Plasmid transfections were performed using the S/S and A/A MEF cells grown to 40% confluency and the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Co-transfections were carried out in triplicates using wild type or mutant versions of the ATF5-Luc fusion plasmids and a Renilla luciferase plasmid serving as an internal control (Promega, Madison, WI). 24 h after transfection, MEF cells were treated with 0.1 μm thapsigargin for 6 h, or with no ER stress. Dual luciferase assays were carried out as described by the Promega instruction manual. Values are a measure of a ratio of firefly versus Renilla luciferase units (relative light units) and represent the mean values of three independent transfections. Results are presented as means ± S.E. that were derived from three independent experiments. The Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance. Transcriptional Start Site of ATF5 Transcripts—The cDNAs corresponding to the 5′-ends of the ATF5-Luc transcripts expressed in S/S MEF cells treated with 0.1 μm thapsigargin, or no stress, were amplified using a RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE kit, Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, there was amplification of cDNAs corresponding to the 5′-ends of ATF5 transcripts prepared from human HepG2 hepatoma cells treated with this ER stress condition, or no stress. Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase, resulting in the removal of free 5′-phosphates from RNAs other than mRNAs containing intact 5′-cap structures. The RNA preparations were then treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the cap structure, leaving a 5′-monophosphate that was ligated using T4 RNA ligase to a 45-base RNA adapter oligonucleotide that was supplied in the kit. A random-primed reverse transcription (RT) reaction and nested PCR were then carried out to amplify the 5′-end of endogenous ATF5 transcripts, as well as transfected thymidine kinase-minimal promoter driven ATF5-Luc mRNAs. The primers corresponding to the 5′-RACE adapter sequence were provided by the manufacturer. The sequences of the two nested antisense primers specific to endogenous ATF5 mRNA were the outer primer 5′-TTCCCATAGTCTACGAGCCATCCC-3′ and inner primer 5′-ACATGGCTGTAGCACAGGTGCT-3′. The outer primer used for amplifying the 5′-ends of ATF5-Luc transcript was 5′-CCATCTTCCAGCGGATAGAA-3′, which was combined with the same inner primer described earlier. A portion of the amplified DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV irradiation. The major DNA band was excised from the gel and sequenced (Fig. 1). The transcriptional start site was determined as the first nucleotide residue that was 3′- to the adapter sequence that was ligated to 5′- of the cDNA. Polysome Analysis of ATF5 Translational Control—S/S cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, as highlighted above, in the presence of 1.0 μm thapsigargin, or to no stress, for 6 h. 10 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to the medium prior to collection and analysis. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered-saline solution supplemented with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, and then lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. The extracts were passed through a 23-gauge needle for proper lysis of cells, incubated for 10 min on ice, and insoluble material was collected by microcentrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was then applied onto a 15-45% sucrose gradient containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, and centrifuged for 2 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-41Ti rotor. Following centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated, and the absorbance of cytosolic RNA at 254 nm was recorded by an in-line UV monitor. Total RNA was isolated from a portion of each fraction using TRIzol reagent as described by the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The mRNAs from fractions collected were amplified using RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) and the following primers: ATF4 forward (5′-TCACGAAATCCAGCAGCAGTG-3′), ATF4 reverse (5′-CAAGCCATCATCCATAGCCG-3′), ATF5 forward (5′-CTACCCCTCCATTCCACTTTCC-3′, ATF5 reverse (5′-TTCTTGACTGGCTTCTCACTTGTG-3′), β-actin forward (5′-TTCTTTGCAGCTCCTTCGTTGCCG-3′), and β-actin reverse (5′-TGGATGGCTACGTACATGGCTGGG-3′). For RT-PCR analysis of cytosolic mRNA levels, equal volumes were reverse transcribed using oligo(dT), then 50 ng of cDNA from each fraction was amplified with Bullseye R-Taq (MIDSCI). PCR was carried out for 25, 27, 30, 33, and 35 cycles to determine the linear range of amplification. In this study, 25 cycles were used for PCR for ATF4, and 27 cycles for ATF5 and β-actin. Densitometry was performed using the software provided with Quantity One imaging system (Bio-Rad). Phosphorylation of eIF2α Is Required for Increased ATF5 Protein Levels in Response to Diverse Stress Conditions—The ATF5 mRNA has two uORFs that are conserved among many different vertebrates, including human, mouse, rat, cow, and frogs (Fig. 1). The 5′-proximal uORF1 encodes a polypeptide that is only three amino acid residues in length, Met-Ala-Leu, that is conserved among the different ATF5 orthologs. The downstream uORF2 encodes a polypeptide ranging from 59 residues in length in human and cow, to 53 residues in the frog ATF5 mRNA. In each example, the uORF2 overlaps, out of frame, with the ATF5 coding region (Fig. 1). Given the importance of uORFs in ATF4 translational control in response to eIF2α phosphorylation, we addressed whether the levels of ATF5 protein were increased in response to environmental stresses by a mechanism requiring eIF2α phosphorylation. Wild-type MEF cells, designated S/S, and a mutant version containing alanine substituted for the serine-51 phosphorylation site in eIF2α, termed A/A, were exposed to three different stress conditions known"
https://openalex.org/W2108690383,"Climatic change is expected to lead to changes in species' geographical ranges. Adaptation strategies for biodiversity conservation require quantitative estimates of the magnitude, direction and rates of these potential changes. Such estimates are of greatest value when they are made for large ensembles of species and for extensive (sub-continental or continental) regions.For six climate scenarios for 2070-99 changes have been estimated for 431 European breeding bird species using models relating species' distributions in Europe to climate. Mean range centroid potentially shifted 258-882 km in a direction between 341 degrees (NNW) and 45 degrees (NE), depending upon the climate scenario considered. Potential future range extent averaged 72-89% of the present range, and overlapped the present range by an average of 31-53% of the extent of the present range. Even if potential range changes were realised, the average number of species breeding per 50x50 km grid square would decrease by 6.8-23.2%. Many species endemic or near-endemic to Europe have little or no overlap between their present and potential future ranges; such species face an enhanced extinction risk as a consequence of climatic change.Although many human activities exert pressures upon wildlife, the magnitude of the potential impacts estimated for European breeding birds emphasises the importance of climatic change. The development of adaptation strategies for biodiversity conservation in the face of climatic change is an urgent need; such strategies must take into account quantitative evidence of potential climatic change impacts such as is presented here."
https://openalex.org/W2164353133,"Background The ability to estimate the passage of time is of fundamental importance for perceptual and cognitive processes. One experience of time is the perception of duration, which is not isomorphic to physical duration and can be distorted by a number of factors. Yet, the critical features generating these perceptual shifts in subjective duration are not understood. Methodology/Findings We used prospective duration judgments within and across sensory modalities to examine the effect of stimulus predictability and feature change on the perception of duration. First, we found robust distortions of perceived duration in auditory, visual and auditory-visual presentations despite the predictability of the feature changes in the stimuli. For example, a looming disc embedded in a series of steady discs led to time dilation, whereas a steady disc embedded in a series of looming discs led to time compression. Second, we addressed whether visual (auditory) inputs could alter the perception of duration of auditory (visual) inputs. When participants were presented with incongruent audio-visual stimuli, the perceived duration of auditory events could be shortened or lengthened by the presence of conflicting visual information; however, the perceived duration of visual events was seldom distorted by the presence of auditory information and was never perceived shorter than their actual durations. Conclusions/Significance These results support the existence of multisensory interactions in the perception of duration and, importantly, suggest that vision can modify auditory temporal perception in a pure timing task. Insofar as distortions in subjective duration can neither be accounted for by the unpredictability of an auditory, visual or auditory-visual event, we propose that it is the intrinsic features of the stimulus that critically affect subjective time distortions."
https://openalex.org/W2083558142,"Dynamics of biological processes on the deep-sea floor are traditionally thought to be controlled by vertical sinking of particles from the euphotic zone at a seasonal scale. However, little is known about the influence of lateral particle transport from continental margins to deep-sea ecosystems. To address this question, we report here how the formation of dense shelf waters and their subsequent downslope cascade, a climate induced phenomenon, affects the population of the deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus. We found evidence that strong currents associated with intense cascading events correlates with the disappearance of this species from its fishing grounds, producing a temporary fishery collapse. Despite this initial negative effect, landings increase between 3 and 5 years after these major events, preceded by an increase of juveniles. The transport of particulate organic matter associated with cascading appears to enhance the recruitment of this deep-sea living resource, apparently mitigating the general trend of overexploitation. Because cascade of dense water from continental shelves is a global phenomenon, we anticipate that its influence on deep-sea ecosystems and fisheries worldwide should be larger than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W1974083452,"Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized through the Kennedy pathway, but more than 50% of PC is remodeled through the Lands cycle, i.e. the deacylation and reacylation of PC to attain the final and proper fatty acids within PC. The reacylation step is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), and we report here the identification of a novel LPCAT, which we named LPCAT3. LPCAT3 belongs to the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family and encodes a protein of 487 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56 kDa.

The biomembrane lipid bilayer serves as an important structure that compartmentalizes living cells and also forms organized intracellular membrane organelles for various physiological functions. The major and essential structural components of membrane lipid bilayers are phospholipids (PLs) including phosphatidylcholine (PC), 2The abbreviations used are:PCphosphatidylcholinePPARαperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor αLPClysophosphatidylcholineLPSlysophosphatidylserineLPAlysophosphatidic acidLPGlysophosphatidylglycerolLPElysophosphatidylethanolamineLPIlysophosphatidylinositolPSphosphatidylserinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePGphosphatidylglycerolPAphosphatidic acidPIphosphatidylinositolMBOATmembrane-bound O-acyltransferaseDGAT1diacylglyerol acyltransferase 1LPSATlysophosphatidylserine acyltransferasePLphospholipidDGdiacylglyerolAGPATacyl-CoA:acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferaseLPCATlysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferaseERendoplasmic reticulumGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasesiRNAsmall interfering RNALPAATlysophosphatidic acid acyltransferaseLPGATlysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase. phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), among which PC is the most abundant in mammals. Besides the fundamental role in maintaining the membrane structure, some PLs such as phosphatidylinositol (PI) and diacylglycerol (DG) play important roles in signal transduction. The pathway of PL de novo synthesis has been pioneered and elegantly elucidated by Dr. Eugene Kennedy and colleagues (1Kennedy E.P. Vance D.E. Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 1-9Google Scholar). phosphatidylcholine peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α lysophosphatidylcholine lysophosphatidylserine lysophosphatidic acid lysophosphatidylglycerol lysophosphatidylethanolamine lysophosphatidylinositol phosphatidylserine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidic acid phosphatidylinositol membrane-bound O-acyltransferase diacylglyerol acyltransferase 1 lysophosphatidylserine acyltransferase phospholipid diacylglyerol acyl-CoA:acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase endoplasmic reticulum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase small interfering RNA lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase. PLs are known to be remodeled after their de novo synthesis through deacylation and reacylation processes to acquire their appropriate fatty acid composition. This deacylation and reacylation process, defined as the Lands cycle, may be critical for proper membrane fluidity, vesicle trafficking, and other relevant biological functions (2Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lands W.E. Merkl I. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 898-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Merkl I. Lands W.E. J.

In pancreatic β cells, PL remodeling is believed to play an essential role in amplifying the signal for insulin secretion; and in hepatocytes, proper PL composition appears vital for very low-density lipoprotein assembly and secretion (6Bao S.

The saturated fatty acids found frequently at the sn-1 position of PC are believed to be derived from de novo biosynthesis, whereas the unsaturated fatty acids, usually found at the sn-2 position in PC, are esterified mainly through the remodeling process (5MacDonald J.I. Sprecher H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Indeed, the two acyl-CoA:acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) enzymes described in recent years do not appear to have specific substrate preference toward fatty acyl-CoAs at the sn-2 position within the de novo PC biosynthetic pathway (8Aguado B. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4096-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Eberhardt C. Gray P.W. Tjoelker L.W. J. Biol.

In contrast, fatty acyl chain at the sn-2 position of PC is believed to be hydrolyzed by a specific phospholipid lipase A2 family member, which is then re-acylated by the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases (LPCAT). LPCAT activity has been found to reside primarily in microsomal fractions of tissues and characterization of this activity using microsomes from various tissues has led to the hypothesis that multiple forms of enzymes may exist in different tissues with different substrate specificity of fatty acyl-CoAs (5MacDonald J.I. Sprecher H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Choy P.C. Skrzypczak M. Lee D. Jay F.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Attempts to purify the enzyme(s) have not been successful historically largely due to its membrane protein nature and the fact that LPCAT activity was mostly lost during solubilization and/or further fractionation (5MacDonald J.I.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and Nakanishi and colleagues (12Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A.

A second LPCAT (LPCAT2) was also reported that is also an acetylCoA:lyso platelet-activating factor acyltransferase (lyso-PAFAT) with relatively broad tissue distribution (13Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Nakanishi H. Harayama T. Ishii S. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6532-6539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). LPCAT activity from liver microsomes indicated that the liver LPCAT prefers unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA as substrates but the identity of this enzyme has yet to be determined (14Lands W.E. Inoue M. Sugiura Y. Okuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14968-14972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the identification and characterization of such an enzyme, which we named LPCAT3. LPCAT3 belongs to the MBOAT family and is localized to the ER and most abundantly expressed in liver, pancreas, and adipose. Importantly, LPCAT3 prefers unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates and appears to be the only such enzyme in liver responsible for this function. Materials—Various lysophospholipids and acyl-CoAs were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 14C-Labeled lysophospholipids, acyl-CoAs, and phospholipids were ordered from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Plasmid Construction—A full-length human LPCAT3 coding cDNA (NCBI accession number NM_005768) was purchased from Invitrogen. The C-terminal FLAG-tagged LPCAT3 was generated by PCR and subcloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The sequences of the primers are as follows: 5′-TCCACCATGGCGTCCTCAGCGGAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCACTTATCGTCCTCATCCTTGTAATCAGCAGCAGCTTCCATCTTCTTTAA-3′ (reverse). The LPCAT3-FLAG fusion was transferred to the pcDNA3.2V5/DEST vector using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The human LPCAT1 (SC112001), LPCAT2 (SC100893), GPAM (SC106982), LPGAT1 (SC121130), and AGPAT2 (SC116102) cDNA were purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). The sequences of all the constructs were confirmed by sequencing from both directions. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Membrane Protein Preparation—Human 293, COS-7, and Huh7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 (3:1) medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum in a humidified air atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For transfections, 5 × 105 293 cells, 1 × 105 COS-7 cells, or 2 × 105 Huh7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Falcon, Corning, NY). 1 μg of DNA was transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) in each experiment according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were scraped into 150 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and then sonicated three times on ice for 30 s. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 × g, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet as the membrane fraction was resuspended in the same buffer and frozen at –80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined using a commercially prepared protein assay kit (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Expression of FLAG-tagged LPCAT3 was verified by Western blot analysis with a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). In Vitro Acyltransferase Activity Assays—Acyltransferase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled acyl-CoAs into phospholipids. The reaction mixture in a total volume of 100 μl contained 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 200 μm of each lysophospholipid, 20 μm [1-14C]acyl-CoA, and 5 μgof membrane proteins from HEK293 cells transfected with LPCAT1, LPCAT2, LPCAT3, AGPAT2, LPGAT1, GPAM, or empty vector. The reaction was started by the addition of the membrane proteins, incubated for 20 min at room temperature and was stopped by adding 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The phospholipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (15Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The organic phase was air dried and separated by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4) as the solvent followed by exposure to a PhosphorImager screen. The Prism4 software was used for non-linear regression, curve fit analysis to calculate apparent Km and Vmax. Confocal Microscopy—COS-7 cells were transfected with LPCAT3-FLAG on glass-bottom culture dishes (MetTek, Ashland, MA). 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with 100 nm MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or a rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada) in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin. After briefly washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-Mouse SFX or Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit SFX (Invitrogen). The cells were counterstained with propidium iodide (Invitrogen) to visualize the nuclei. Confocal microscopy was performed with an LSM510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a ×40 water immersion objective lens (numerical aperture = 1.2). LPCAT3-FLAG was monitored by excitation at 488 nm and emission with a 505–530-nm filter. Endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria markers were monitored by excitation at 543 nm and emission with a 585–615-nm filter. For the detection of propidium iodide, the excitation was at 633 nm and emissions were taken with a long pass 650-nm filter. Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR—Poly(A)+ RNA was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) and the cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of poly(A)+ RNA utilizing the Invitrogen SuperScript™ III First-strand Synthesis System for reverse transcriptase-PCR. The TaqMan gene expression assays ordered from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) were Hs00195039_A1 (human LPCAT3) and Hs99999905_A1 (human GAPDH). Real-Time PCR was performed on 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Roche). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained using Applied Biosystems SDS2.3 software; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a reference gene. The data were normalized by setting the average spleen expression value to 1. siRNA Transfection—200 pmol of human LPCAT3 siRNAs (siRNA ID numbers 122586 and 16819; Ambion) and control siRNA (silencer negative control 1; Ambion) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The siRNA transfection was performed for 2 days in Huh7 cells. RNA from the transfected cells was collected for reverse transcription and real-time PCR. The membrane proteins from the transfected cells were prepared for the in vitro acyltransferase activity assay. Animals—All experiments were performed in accordance with Eli Lilly and Company Animal Care and Use Policies. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 (C57BL/6NTac strain) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α–/– (PPARα) (B6.129S4-Ppara < tm1Gonz > N12 strain) mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Hudson, NY) and acclimated for 2 weeks before the start of the experiment. The mice were provided Purina 5001 rodent chow (Purina Mills, Richmond, IN) and water ad libitum throughout the experiment. Compounds were suspended at various concentrations in 1% carboxymethylcellulose, 0.25% Tween 80 and given by oral gavage (200 μl/animal/day) for 7 days. The animals were euthanized 3 h after the final dose by CO2 asphyxiation. Blood samples for serum preparation were taken by cardiac puncture; livers were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and used later for mRNA analysis. Statistics—The values are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences among groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls test, using Prism (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). A p value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Genomic efforts in recent years have identified a family of glycerolipid acyltransfereases and a family of membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (16Hofmann K. Trends Biochem.

We thus focused on screening the putative acyltransferases for LPCAT activity to identify the LPCAT in liver. Candidate cDNAs were subcloned into an expression vector and the cognate proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells. Membranes were then prepared and analyzed for LPCAT activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One of the candidates, the human membrane-bound O-acyltransferase 5 (MBOAT5) exhibited robust LPCAT activity and was further characterized. Fig. 1A shows the LPCAT activity of human MBOAT5 (named LPCAT3 later in the text), whereas human LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 were used as controls. Contrary to what was reported by Agarwal et al. (22Agarwal A.K. Sukumaran S. Bartz R. Barnes R.I. Garg A. J. Endocrinol. 2007; 193: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), human LPCAT1 had ample LPCAT activity compared with vector and mitochondria acyl-CoA:glycerol-3-phosphate acyl-CoA acyltransferase (mtGPAT/GPAM) as negative controls, consistent with the reports by Chen et al. (11Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and Nakanishi et al. (12Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

LPCAT2 had very limited LPCAT activity in our experiments (its lyso-PAFAT activity was confirmed in a separate experiment, data not shown). Human MBOAT5 had virtually equivalent LPCAT activity to that of LPCAT1 and we therefore renamed it as LPCAT3. Because of the fact that we do not know the relative protein expression levels, the relative activity of each LPCAT could not be accurately assessed. Insertion of a FLAG tag at the carboxyl terminus of the protein slightly reduced, but largely retained LPCAT activity. In addition, LPCAT3 also had discernable lysophosphatidylserine acyltransferase (LPSAT) activity (Fig. 1A). To examine the substrate specificity of LPCAT3 against other lysophospholipids, lysophosphatic acid (LPA), lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) were used as substrates along with 14C-labeled palmitoyl-CoA. LPCAT3 did not demonstrate any detectable activity against these substrates, whereas AGPAT2 and LPGAT1 exhibited respective LPAAT and LPGAT activities against LPA or LPG as positive controls (Fig. 1B). Thus, LPCAT3 is a specific LPCAT and LPSAT. The complete amino acid sequence of human LPCAT3 deduced from the cDNA sequence is shown in Fig. 2A. The protein has 487 amino acids and contains the KKME motif at the extreme carboxyl terminus as a potential ER retention signal. In contrast to other lysophospholipid acyltransferases, LPCAT3 does not contain HX4D, a sequence motif that is conserved among glycerolipid acyltransferase family members (17Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The sequence that is conserved among the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase members is underlined (Fig. 2A). The detailed alignment of the region with those of human diacylglyerol acyltransferase 1, cholesterol acyltransferase 1 and 2 (Fig. 2B) suggested multiple conserved amino acids including the invariable Asn-358 and His-374 in the MBOAT family, implicating potential roles of these amino acids in substrate binding or catalysis or maintaining the proper structure for such enzymatic activities. Examination of the LPCAT structure via hydropathy plot (Fig. 2C) suggested the existence of seven transmembrane domains and a hypothetical membrane topology model (Fig. 2C). When expressed in HEK293 cells and examined using Western blotting analysis, the protein had an apparent molecular mass of about 56 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular mass from the primary sequence (Fig. 2D). The LPCAT3 substrate specificity was further examined in three separate experimental protocols. First, using 1-palmitoyl-LPC as a substrate, different fatty acyl-CoAs were tested as acyl donors in the same experiment. Among the saturated fatty acyl-CoAs, only lauroyl-CoA had comparable activity compared with unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs. Oleoyl-CoA (18:1), linoleoyl-CoA (18:2), and arachidonyl-CoA (20:4) all demonstrated robust LPCAT activity (Fig. 3A). Next the specificity of LPC was evaluated using different fatty acyl chains at the sn-1 position of LPC. Among all the different substrates examined, 1-myristoyl-LPC (14:0) and 1-palmitoyl-LPC (16:0) had the most robust activity, whereas no detectable activity was observed using 1-hexanoyl (6:0) and 1-arachidonyl (20:0) LPC as substrates (Fig. 3B). Finally, using 1-palmitoyl-LPS as the substrate, different fatty acyl-CoAs were evaluated within the same experiment with their relative LPSAT activity. All unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs exhibited greater activity than saturated fatty acyl-CoAs and increase in desaturation appeared to result in a further increase in LPSAT activity (Fig. 3C). In short, LPCAT3 favors unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs as acyl donors compared with saturated fatty acyl-CoAs. We then conducted kinetic studies using 1-palmitoyl-LPC and different fatty acyl-CoAs as the substrates (Fig. 4A and Table 1). Increased fatty acyl-CoA concentrations resulted in increased LPCAT activity. The apparent Km and Vmax values were calculated and are listed in Table 1. Whereas the unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs have higher apparent Km values than those of saturated fatty acyl-CoAs, the apparent Vmax values are in general greater. The order of the activities as evaluated by Vmax/Km using different acyl donors is linoleoyl-CoA > arachidonoyl-CoA > oleoyl-CoA > palmitoyl-CoA > stearoyl-CoA (Table 1). When using arachidonoyl-CoA as the fixed substrate, increased 1-palmitoyl-LPC concentrations led to increased LPCAT activity (Fig. 4B). Quantitative assessment suggested an apparent maximal reaction velocity of 6364 nmol/min/mg of proteins and an apparent Km value of 72 μm.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of LPCAT3Acyl-CoAKmVmaxVmax/Kmμmnmol/min/mg proteinPalmitoyl-CoA (16:0)41.291,78243.2Stearoyl-CoA (18:0)35.6599627.5Oleoyl-CoA (18:1)72.684,69864.6Linoleoyl-CoA (18:2)201.418,14890.1Arachidonoyl-CoA (20:4)71.566,24787.31-Palmitoyl-LPC72.196,36488.2 Open table in a new tab The subcellular localization of LPCAT3 was examined using indirect immunofluorescence. LPCAT3 with the FLAG tag at the carboxyl terminus was transiently expressed in COS cells, and indirect immunofluorescence study was conducted using an antibody against the FLAG tag. An ER resident protein Calnexin, and a mitochondria dye (MitoTracker), were used as markers. Fig. 5 shows that staining of LPCAT3 overlapped with that of Calnexin, indicating its ER localization (Fig. 5). Consistent with this notion, there was no overlapping staining of LPCAT3 with the mitochondria marker (data not shown). The tissue distribution of human LPCAT3 was examined with quantitative PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The highest level of expression was observed in liver, followed by pancreas and adipose tissue (Fig. 6). Relative low levels of expression were observed in many other tissues. Notably, skeletal muscle and heart had very low levels of LPCAT3 expression (Fig. 6). The expression pattern of human LPCAT3 suggested its primary expression in metabolically active tissues. To examine the relative contribution of human LPCAT3 to total cellular LPCAT activity, we used siRNA knockdown technology to effectively reduce LPCAT3 mRNA in human hepatoma Huh7 cells to below 15% of the control level with two different oligonucleotides (Fig. 7A). The reduced LPCAT3 expression resulted in more than 90% reduced membrane LPCAT activity compared with the control (Fig. 7, B and C). This study suggested that LPCAT3 is the major enzyme contributing to LPCAT activity in Huh7 cells and possibly liver in vivo. PPARα is a nuclear receptor that regulates fatty acid oxidation and target genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism (23Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Long chain fatty acids are believed to be endogenous ligands for PPARα (23Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Because of the predominant expression of LPCAT3 in the liver and its possible link to lipid metabolism, its regulation by PPARα agonists was examined. C57BL6 mice were treated with prototypic PPARα agonists for 7 days and liver LPCAT3 mRNA levels were examined. Fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist drug in clinical use, dose-dependently elevated liver LPCAT3 mRNA with maximum induction of 3-fold. A structurally divergent prototypic PPARα agonist, WY14643, also dose-dependently increased liver LPCAT3 mRNA by 3-fold (Fig. 8A). More importantly, this regulation was completely absent in PPARα null mice, indicating the PPARα agonist regulation of LPCAT3 by these two compounds was specifically mediated by PPARα (Fig. 8B). We report here the identification and characterization of a novel LPCAT, which we named LPCAT3. We believe that LPCAT3 is the long-sought liver LPCAT based on the following observations. 1) Membranes from HEK293 cells overexpressing LPCAT3 have increased LPCAT activity. 2) LPCAT3 is localized within ER, consistent with the finding that LPCAT activity is largely microsomal. 3) LPCAT3 prefers unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates, which is in agreement with the previous characterization of LPCAT activity using liver microsomes. 4) LPCAT3 is highly expressed in liver. 5) Reduction of LPCAT3 expression through siRNA in hepatoma Huh7 cells resulted in dramatic reduction of membrane LPCAT activity. It has been known for years that PC undergoes a deacylation-reacylation remodeling process in many cell and tissue types primarily at the sn-2 position (24Lands W.E.M. Crawford C.G. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2. Plenum Press, New York1976: 3-85Google Scholar). It has also been estimated that more than 50% of PC is acquired from PC remodeling (2Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5MacDonald J.I. Sprecher H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Choy P.C. Skrzypczak M. Lee D. Jay F.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PL remodeling is probably a necessary step to attain the appropriate fatty acyl chains within PL to maintain the proper membrane structure for a variety of physiological functions because the de novo PL biosynthetic enzymes appear to have very limited substrate specificity (10Choy P.C. Skrzypczak M. Lee D. Jay F.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reacylation of PL, catalyzed by lyso-PL acyltransferase(s), has been identified primarily within microsomal fractions (24Lands W.E.M. Crawford C.G. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2. Plenum Press, New York1976: 3-85Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that different LPCATs may exist in different cell types or tissues based on the studies using microsomal preparations from different cells and tissues (5MacDonald J.I. Sprecher H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Choy P.C. Skrzypczak M. Lee D. Jay F.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Indeed, Chen et al. (11Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and Nakanishi et al. (12Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20140-20147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of an LPCAT (LPCAT1) with expression specifically in alveolar type II cells in lung. This enzyme prefers saturated fatty acyl-CoA and is thought to be primarily responsible for dipalmitoyl-PC production in surfactants. Another LPCAT (LPCAT2), with weak activity in our assay system, is also a lyso-PAFAT with a speculated role in inflammatory cells (13Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Nakanishi H. Harayama T. Ishii S. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6532-6539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The LPCAT we identified (which we named LPCAT3) is expressed primarily in metabolic tissues (liver, pancreas, and adipose). LPCAT3 has comparable LPCAT activity compared with that of LPCAT1, but has opposite substrate specificity in that it prefers unsaturated fatty acids. Our work along with others convincingly proves the original hypothesis that different enzyme forms with differential substrate specificity exist and are likely to perform specific physiological functions in different cells or tissues. In addition, our siRNA knockdown experiment in Huh7 cells suggests that LPCAT3 is primarily responsible for the LPCAT activity detected in hepatocytes. It is interesting to note that LPCAT3 has moderate activity toward LPS while not displaying any detectable activity against LPA, LPE, and LPI, especially because a recently identified yeast membrane-bound O-acyltransferase has relatively broad substrate activities against all the lyso-PLs (25Jain S.

It is possible that specific assay conditions may have prevented us from detecting such activities. Alternatively, distinct forms of LPE and LPI acyltransferases in mammals may exist in contrast to the situation in yeast. Cloning of mammalian LPAAT1 and LPAAT2 were reported in recent years, whereas mammalian LPE and LPI acyltransferases have yet to be identified. Studies using rat liver microsomes suggest the existence of such activities and possibly a distinct LPEAT and/or LPIAT (3Lands W.E. Merkl I. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 898-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact physiological function of PC remodeling is not clear, although it appears that the remodeling process is necessary for cells to acquire the appropriate PC composition for specific functions. Our work thus provides an invaluable tool for future investigations in this area. Importantly, LPCAT3 has a very high level expression in liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue. It is known that in pancreatic β-cells, PC remodeling is an important step in generating necessary signals for optimal insulin release. The release of arachidonic acid and LPC may have important functions in this process (6Bao S. Bohrer A. Ramanadham S. Jin W. Zhang S. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The role of LPCAT could be to build the initial appropriate PC substrates for the ensuing hydrolysis by phospholipase A2 or alternatively to reacylate LPC back to PC to switch off the insulin release. The investigation of the exact role of LPCAT in this process is warranted. In hepatocytes, PC content and composition may impact very-low density lipoprotein secretion (7Tran K. Sun F. Cui Z. Thorne-Tjomsland G. St. Germain C. Lapierre L.R. McLeod R.S. Jamieson J.C. Yao Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Yao H. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 849-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), thus the relevance of LPCAT3 in lipid homeostasis will be an interesting subject to explore in the future. In this regard, it is important to note that Yao and Ye (30Yao H. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 849-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that reduced PC biosynthesis in Huh7 cells resulting from reduced long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 3 expression significantly impacted apolipoprotein B lipidation and secretion. PPARα is a nuclear receptor that primarily regulates fatty acid oxidation. PPARα also regulates apolipoproteins important for cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis. The endogenous ligands for PPARα are believed to be long chain fatty acids. Our finding that LPCAT3 is specifically regulated by PPARα agonists in a PPARα-dependent manner further implicates a role for LPCAT3 in lipid metabolism. The exact role of LPCAT3 in a variety of physiological processes will have to await future in vitro and in vivo studies.

https://openalex.org/W2102006028,"The recognition of lysine-type peptidoglycans (PG) by the PG recognition complex has been suggested to cause activation of the serine protease cascade leading to the processing of Spätzle and subsequent activation of the Toll signaling pathway. So far, two serine proteases involved in the lysine-type PG Toll signaling pathway have been identified. One is a modular serine protease functioning as an initial enzyme to be recruited into the lysine-type PG recognition complex. The other is the Drosophila Spätzle processing enzyme (SPE), a terminal enzyme that converts Spätzle pro-protein to its processed form capable of binding to the Toll receptor. However, it remains unclear how the initial PG recognition signal is transferred to Spätzle resulting in Toll pathway activation. Also, the biochemical characteristics and mechanism of action of a serine protease linking the modular serine protease and SPE have not been investigated. Here, we purified and cloned a novel upstream serine protease of SPE that we named SAE, SPE-activating enzyme, from the hemolymph of a large beetle, Tenebrio molitor larvae. This enzyme was activated by Tenebrio modular serine protease and in turn activated the Tenebrio SPE. The biochemical ordered functions of these three serine proteases were determined in vitro, suggesting that the activation of a three-step proteolytic cascade is necessary and sufficient for lysine-type PG recognition signaling. The processed Spätzle by this cascade induced antibacterial activity in vivo.

Innate immunity is a crucial host defense mechanism against microbial infection in all animals. The ability of a host to distinguish between self and non-self remains a central hallmark of innate immunity (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Pathogenic microbes possess distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycans (PG) 2The abbreviations used are: PGpeptidoglycanPGRPpeptidoglycan-recognition proteinGNBP1Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein 1SPserine proteaseSpzSpätzleSPESpz-processing enzymeMSPmodular serine proteaseSAESPE-activating enzymeLDLalow density lipoprotein receptor A repeatsCCPcomplement control proteinAMPantimicrobial peptide. of Gram-positive bacteria, and the β-1,3-glucan of fungi (2Medzhitov R.

The recognition of these PAMPs is achieved by a group of germ line-encoded receptors and soluble proteins (2Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). The Drosophila Toll signaling pathway is responsible for defense against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, while the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway is activated primarily in defense against Gram-negative bacteria. Both of these pathways lead to the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) via NF-κB-like transcription factors (3Anderson K.V. Curr.

These proteins are believed to mediate the activation of a serine protease (SP) cascade and ultimately, the cleavage of Spätzle (Spz). Cleaved Spz serves as a ligand for the cell membrane receptor Toll and induces the production of AMPs (6Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J. Annu Rev.

Cell. 2006; 10: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Drosophila melanogaster GNBP3 (Dm-GNBP3), however, is known to be required for the detection of fungal cell wall components in the Toll signaling pathway (11Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 1999; 285: 1917-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These recognition signals against bacteria and fungi are amplified in hemolymph (insect blood) by a proteolytic SP cascade similar to the vertebrate complement system (6Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J. Annu Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 697-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). The amplification of these recognition signals represents an efficient host defense strategy in insects, which are devoid of an acquired immune system. Although information regarding the functions of PAMP recognition proteins, such as PGRP-SA and GNBP3, which lead to the Toll activation cascade are continuously increasing (6Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J. Annu Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 697-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, 11Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 1999; 285: 1917-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), details of the activation mechanism of the extracellular SP cascade in the Toll pathway have not been clearly resolved. At present, several SPs and SP homologues have been identified as Toll pathway regulating factors (11Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M.

Among them, Dm-Spz-processing enzyme (SPE) was identified, and its biological function was determined as a processing enzyme to cleave Spz pro-protein to active Spz (13Kambris Z. Brun S. Jang I.H.

Even though the biological functions of SPE have been characterized by Drosophila genetic studies, the identification of a direct upstream activator of SPE still awaits further investigation. We recently demonstrated in a large beetle, Tenebrio molitor that the lysozyme-mediated partial digestion of highly cross-linked Lys-type PG dramatically increases the binding of T. molitor PGRP-SA (Tm-PGRP-SA), which then recruits the GNBP1 homologue and an active form of modular serine protease (MSP) (9Park J.W. Kim C.H. Kim J.H. Je B.R. Roh K.B. Kim S.J. Lee H.H. Ryu J.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Lee W.J. Ha N.C. Lee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we proposed a model where clustering of Tm-PGRP-SA causes the recruitment of Tm-GNBP1 and active Tm-MSP to form an initial PG recognition complex, which then leads to activation of the Toll pathway (9Park J.W. Kim C.H. Kim J.H. Je B.R. Roh K.B. Kim S.J. Lee H.H. Ryu J.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Lee W.J. Ha N.C. Lee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, because of the lack of molecular information regarding an immediate downstream factor(s) of the Tm-MSP molecule, the molecular details of how the PG recognition signal triggered by Tm-PGRP-SA and Tm-GNBP1 proteins remains unanswered. In addition, how many SPs are involved in the Toll signaling pathway are as yet undetermined. Therefore, purification and determination of the biological functions of unidentified SPs engaged in the Toll signaling pathway are essential for understanding the molecular host defense against bacterial and fungal infections. The elegant Drosophila genetic studies are very powerful for characterizing and ordering the components in the Drosophila Toll pathway (3Anderson K.V. Curr. Opin Immunol. 2000; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 15Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, there is a limit for this system in terms of determining the biochemical mechanisms involved in regulating this proteolytic cascade. Drosophila has several alternative routes to the Toll pathway, used in various developmental stages and infection protocols, and it seems difficult to determine the clear activation mechanism. For instance, Dm-Persphone is another protease linked to the Toll pathway and antifungal immunity, yet the biological functions of this molecule have been partially characterized by Drosophila genetic studies. The proper identification of upstream or downstream factor(s) of Dm-Persephone still awaits further investigations (11Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 1999; 285: 1917-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Gottar M. Gobert V. Matskevich A.A. Reichhart J.M. Wang C. Butt T.M. Belvin M. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Cell. 2006; 127: 1425-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To provide compelling biochemical data on how the Lys-type PG recognition signal can be sequentially transferred to Spz using purified pattern recognition proteins and SPs, it is necessary to use a larger insect, which enables us to collect large amounts of hemolymph. Here, we purified and cloned a novel downstream SP (Tm-41 kDa SP) of the Tm-MSP molecule, which is a link between Tm-MSP and Tm-SPE. Additionally, native Tm-GNBP1, Tm-GNBP3, Tm-MSP, and Tm-SPE proteins were purified to homogeneity from the hemolymph of T. molitor larvae. Also, we produced recombinant Tm-PGRP-SA, Tm-41 kDa SP, Tribolium castneum Spz (Tc-Spz) pro-protein and Toll ectodomain proteins using a baculovirus-insect expression cell system. By performing in vitro reconstitution experiments with these purified native and recombinant proteins, the sequential activation modes of these three SPs and the PG recognition signaling pathway were determined. These experiments clearly show how the PG/Tm-PGRP-SA/Tm-GNBP1 complex transfers Lys-type PG recognition signal to downstream factors through a three-step activation of a serine protease cascade in T. molitor larvae. Animals and Collection of Hemolymph—T. molitor larvae (mealworm) were maintained on a laboratory bench in terraria containing wheat bran. Hemolymph was collected as previously described (16Zhang R. Cho H.Y. Kim H.S. Ma Y.G. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42072-42079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, to harvest the hemolymph, a larva was pricked using a 25-gauge needle and then a 10-μl drop of hemolymph was collected in 50 μl of a modified anti-coagulation buffer (136 mm trisodium citrate, 26 mm citric acid, 20 mm EDTA, and 15 mm sodium chloride, pH 5.0). The collected crude hemolymph was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then stored at -80 °C until use. Purification of the Soluble Linearized Lys-type PG—Soluble linearized Lys-type PG was prepared as previously described (9Park J.W. Kim C.H. Kim J.H. Je B.R. Roh K.B. Kim S.J. Lee H.H. Ryu J.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Lee W.J. Ha N.C. Lee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude linearized Lys-type PG was obtained from Staphylococcus aureus insoluble peptidoglycan (20 mg) by digestion with Achromobacter β-lytic protease (2 μg) for 14 h at 37 °C. This was then fractionated on a size exclusion column (Toyopearl HW-55S column, 2.6 × 155 cm). The fractions that could induce phenoloxidase activity were collected and concentrated using a rotary evaporator at 4 °C. The concentrated solution was loaded again onto the same column equilibrated with distilled water at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The linearized Lys-type PG-containing fractions were pooled and stored at 4 °C until use. To ascertain that the purified linearized Lys-type PG originated from S. aureus Lys-type PG, we analyzed the amino acid composition of linearized Lys-type PG, which had the same amino acid composition (d-Glu/l-Gly/d-Ala/l-Lys = 1:5:1:1) as reported for the S. aureus Lys-type peptidoglycan (17Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino Acid Sequencing—To obtain amino acid sequences from purified proteins and cleavage products generated by proteases, proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with a solution containing 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and 50% methanol. The membrane was destained with 50% methanol containing 10% acetic acid (v/v) until the protein bands became visible. The fragments of interest were excised and analyzed on a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using standard techniques. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Rabbit antisera against Tm-PGRP-SA and Tm-GNBP3 raised previously were used after affinity purification as described (16Zhang R. Cho H.Y. Kim H.S. Ma Y.G. Osaki T.

The polyclonal antibodies of Tm-GNBP1 and Tm-MSP were raised using keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-conjugated synthetic peptides based on chemically determined partial sequences present in the Tm-GNBP1 and Tm-MSP (9Park J.W. Kim C.H. Kim J.H. Je B.R. Roh K.B. Kim S.J. Lee H.H. Ryu J.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Lee W.J. Ha N.C. Lee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The following peptides were used: LEAYEPKGFRAS is located at the N-terminal region of Tm-GNBP1 and VNGKPVKKGDYPWQ is located at the N terminus of the catalytic SP domain of Tm-MSP. KLH-conjugated synthetic peptides with more than 95% purity were purchased from Peptron, Inc. (Daejeon, Korea). Rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 500 μg of KLH-conjugated peptides in Freund's complete adjuvant. A booster dose (250 μg in Freund's incomplete adjuvant) was given after 4 weeks, and the animals were bled 2-3 weeks thereafter. The resulting antibodies were affinity-purified as previously described (9Park J.W. Kim C.H. Kim J.H. Je B.R. Roh K.B. Kim S.J. Lee H.H. Ryu J.H. Lim J.H. Oh B.H. Lee W.J. Ha N.C. Lee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies against the purified Tm-41 kDa SP and Tm-SPE proteins were raised by injecting 10 μg of purified proteins into each male albino rabbit with complete Freund's adjuvant and giving two booster injections with the same amount of protein 7 and 14 days later. The resulting antibody was also affinity-purified as described above. Measurement of the PG-specific Amidase Activity—To determine amidase activity in the sample, commercially available α-thrombin substrate (t-butyloxycarbonyl-benzyl-l-valinyl-l-prolinyl-l-arginine-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA) was used. This substrate was dissolved in dimethylformamide according to the manufacturer's instruction. 10 μl of crude hemolymph or fractionated fractions from column chromatography were incubated with 490 μl of substrate solution, which contains 20 μm substrate in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). After incubation of the mixture at 30 °C for 1 h, 500 μl of 17% (v/v) acetic acid was added to terminate enzyme reaction. The specific amidase activity can be detected by fluorescence spectrophotometry at λex = 380 nm and λem = 460 nm. One unit of the amidase activity was defined as the amount that liberated 1 nmol of 7-amino-4-methylcoumain per min. In Vitro Reconstitution Experiments and Determination of Amino Acid Sequences—To examine whether each mixture could generate Lys-type PG-dependent amidase activity, in vitro reconstitution experiments were performed with the eluted fractions from a Heparin-Toyopearl column in the presence of Lys-PG and Ca2+. During the purification of essential factors by column chromatography, the purified factors were co-incubated with other fractions or purified factors as described above. To determine the proteolytic cleavage sites, the reaction mixtures were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions after induction of activation. The generated products from zymogen were confirmed by their N-terminal sequences or by Western blot analysis after electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Purification and cDNA Cloning—The detailed purification methods of Tenebrio active and zymogenic forms of Tm-MSP, Tm-41 kDa SP, and Tm-SPE proteins are described under supplemental methods S2-S5. Additionally, Tm-GNBP1 and Tm-GNBP3 proteins were purified to homogeneity as described under supplemental methods S6 and S7, respectively. The entire purification scheme of these proteins is shown in supplemental Fig. S2. The detailed procedures of cDNA cloning of Tm-MSP, Tm-41 kDa, Tm-SPE, and Tm-GNBP1 are described under supplemental methods S8-S11. Supplemental Tables S1-S4 list the DNA primer sequences used for this study. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Tm-PGRP-SA, Tm-41 kDa SP, Recombinant Tc-Spz, and Tc-Toll Ectodomain Proteins—The cDNAs encoding the Tc-SAE zymogen, Tc-Spz (residues 19-227), and Tc-Toll ectodomain (residues 2-777) were subcloned into BamHI and XhaI sites of the pFASTBAC-SEa vector, as previously described (19Piao S.

This was modified from pFASTBAC-HTc by inserting a Mellitin signal sequence for secretion. The recombinant baculoviruses to express these proteins were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Detailed procedures are described under supplemental methods S12. Antibacterial Assay—Antibacterial activity was assayed essentially as previously described (20Moon H.J. Lee S.Y. Kurata S. Natori S. Lee B.L. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We monitored bactericidal activity of the collected hemolymph from the cleaved Tc-Spz-injected Tenebrio larvae and the whole extract from the cleaved Tc-Spz-injected Tribolium adults. The procedure is described under supplemental methods S13. The Components Involved in the PG Recognition Signaling Pathway Can Be Identified by Measuring Their Amidase Activity—Our previous studies demonstrated that Tenebrio SP zymogens, Tm-PGRP-SA and Tm-GNBP proteins are known to be easily activated or rapidly degraded during the collection of hemolymph or during column chromatography (16Zhang R. Cho H.Y. Kim H.S. Ma Y.G. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42072-42079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Park J.W. Je B.R.

In this study, it was desirable to rapidly analyze the unstable SP zymogens, which were obtained from chromatographic procedures, for determination of their biological functions. Therefore, an easy and prompt bioassay was required rather than a time-consuming antimicrobial assay. Previously, we observed that when a commercially available α-thrombin fluorescence synthetic peptide substrate, Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA, was co-incubated with the Tenebrio hemolymph in the presence of bacterial PG or fungal β-1,3-glucan, it was specifically hydrolyzed within 10 min (16Zhang R. Cho H.Y. Kim H.S. Ma Y.G. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42072-42079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Park J.W. Je B.R.

This result suggested that measurement of this amidase activity may be a suitable method to use during purification and characterization of the unidentified SP zymogens from Tenebrio hemolymph. Using this bioassay, we found that co-incubation of three different fractions (E1, E2, and E3, supplemental Fig. S1A) from the Heparin-Toyopearl column showed specific amidase activity against the α-thrombin substrate in the presence of PG and Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S1B, column 1). These results indicate that E1, E2, and E3 fractions may contain all of the essential components, such as Tm-PGRP-SA and Tm-GNBP1 and unidentified SP(s) including Tm-MSP, which are necessary for triggering the PG recognition signal. In contrast, β-1,3-glucan-dependent amidase activity was observed when E2 and E3 fractions were co-incubated with β-1,3-glucan and Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S1B, column 9), suggesting that Tm-GNBP3 may exist in either the E2 or E3 fractions, or in both. Prior to purification of these proteins, we determined the localization of Tm-PGRP-SA, Tm-GNBP1, Tm-MSP, and Tm-GNBP3 by immunoblotting analysis. Tm-GNBP1 was localized in fraction E1. Tm-MSP and Tm-PGRP-SA were identified in fraction E2 and Tm-GNBP3 was confirmed to be present in fraction E3 (supplemental Fig. S1C). Five Purified Proteins Are Enough to Show PG-specific Amidase Activity—Using a combination of PG-dependent amidase activity measurements and Western blot analyses during column chromatography, two native GNBP proteins (Tm-GNBP1 and Tm-GNBP3), three different SP zymogens and their active forms (Tm-MSP, Tm-41 kDa, and Tm-44 kDa proteins) were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1A). For a detailed purification scheme and methods, see supplemental Fig. S2 and supplemental methods S2-S7, respectively. Three purified SP zymogens were each represented by a single band under both reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1A). However, all three purified active forms of SPs showed two bands under reducing conditions (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3), but only one band under non-reducing conditions (lanes 4-6). To exclude the possibility that the generated bands (arrows, Fig. 1B) under reducing conditions were contaminating peptides, we determined their partial amino acid sequences of the these bands using LC-mass spectrometry and confirmed that the determined partial sequences originated from the N-terminal domains of the purified SPs (data not shown). The bands indicated by arrowheads (Fig. 1B) were confirmed as SP domains by immununoblot analysis (data not shown). These results suggest that the purified three SPs do not contain any other impure proteins. To determine which components are necessary for PG-dependent amidase activity, in vitro reconstitution experiments were performed. When five proteins except for Tm-GNBP3, (namely Tm-PGRP-SA, Tm-GNBP1, Tm-MSP, Tm-41 kDa, and Tm-44 kDa proteins), were co-incubated in the presence of Lys-type PG and Ca2+, PG-specific amidase activity was generated against an α-thrombin substrate (Fig. 1C, column 1). This result suggested that these five proteins are the minimal number of essential factors necessary for PG recognition. cDNA Cloning and Biochemical Characterization of the Newly Purified Proteins—We previously reported the cDNA sequences of Tm-PGRP-SA (18Park J.W. Je B.R. Piao S. Inamura S. Fujimoto Y. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Söderhäll K. Ha N.C. Lee B.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42072-42079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (known as β-1,3-glucan-binding protein). In this study, cDNAs encoding newly purified Tm-MSP, Tm-41 kDa, Tm-44 kDa, and Tm-GNBP1 proteins were cloned based on experimentally determined partial amino acid sequences. To predict the biological functions of the four purified proteins, we first examined the amino acid sequence homology and domain organization of the four proteins (supplemental Fig. S3, A-D). Tm-MSP consists of four low density lipoprotein receptor A repeats (LDLa) domains, one complement control protein (CCP) domain and an SP domain. The substrate specificity pocket residues of the SP domain, Ser-569 (c189; “c” for the chymotrypsinogen numbering), Ser-596 (c216), and Gly-610 (c226) indicate that Tm-MSP is a chymotrypsin-like SP. This SP shows 59, 36, and 33% sequence identities with Tc-MSP (XP_967486), Manduca sexta HP-14 (Ms-HP-14) (22Ji C. Wang Y. Guo X. Hartson S. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34101-34106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the D. melanogaster MSP-like protein (Dm-MSP, CG31217), respectively (supplemental Fig. S3A). The domain organizations of these three known MSP-like proteases are shown in Fig. 2A. Furthermore, the N-terminal sequence of the purified active form of Tm-MSP was determined to be Ile-Val-Asn-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val, which was an exact match with the deduced amino acid sequence of the Tm-MSP zymogen from Ile-375 to Val-381. This result supports the hypothesis that the Tm-MSP zymogen is cleaved between the Leu-374 and Ile-375 residues located between the CCP domain and catalytic SP domain (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the Tm-MSP zymogen may be cleaved by a chymotrypsin-like SP. The Tm-41 kDa protease consists of an N-terminal clip domain and a C-terminal SP domain and is most homologous to the Tc-Snake-like protease (XP_973839), with 51% sequence identity. The catalytic SP domain of the 41 kDa protein shows 40, 36, and 35% identities to Dm-Snake (23LeMosy E.K. Tan Y.Q. Hashimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stress-activated signal transduction events coordinate cellular responses to environmental change. Cells have evolved a large battery of protein kinase families to direct adaptation of cells to stress, including AGC, PTK, CMGC, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and calcium-calmodulin kinase family (1Caenepeel S.

Furthermore, although DAPK-1 can function as a growth suppressor (21Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), growing evidence also indicates it can function as an anti-apoptotic factor (22Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L.

It is widely accepted that caspase-dependent apoptosis is one of multiple cell death programs. Programmed cell death is classified based on morphological criteria into several categories. Apoptosis or type I cell death is characterized by cell rounding and cytoplasmic condensation, membrane blebbing, cytoskeletal collapse, chromatin condensation and fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies that are phagocytosed by macrophages or neighboring cells. Autophagic or type II cell death is characterized by the formation of autophagic vesicles in the cytoplasm accompanied by mitochondrial dilation, enlargement of the ER and the Golgi, and nuclear condensation without ordered DNA fragmentation. Type II cell death has been observed both in whole organisms during development, in pathological situations, and during neurodegeneration such during as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Type I and type II cell death programs are not mutually exclusive and can coincide in vivo in certain tissues and in cell culture. DAPK-1 is capable of initiating both type I apoptotic and type II autophagic programs, depending on the cell system and specific stimulus. The extent to which DAPK-1 contributes to type I apoptotic death often depends on p53 status, but p53 does not impact on the regulation of type II cell death by DAPK-1. The two modes of action of DAPK-1 add to the notion that it is a central player in cell death activated by a diverse array of different stimuli. At the biochemical level DAPK-1 is composed of several functional domains, including its kinase domain, ankyrin repeat domain, calmodulin binding domain, and death domain (26Raveh T. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Spivak T. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). How these domains directly affect the many biological activities of DAPK-1 is not well defined, and there are relatively few DAPK-1-binding proteins. For example, one of the few bona fide partner proteins that exists for the death domain of DAPK-1 is ERK, whose docking to a specific LXL motif mediates DAPK-1-dependent apoptosis (10Chen C.H. Wang W.J. Kuo J.C. Tsai H.C. Lin J.R. Chang Z.F. Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The ERK docking is attenuated by a germ line death domain mutation that abrogates ERK binding and prevents apoptosis (15Stevens C. Lin Y. Sanchez M. Amin E. Copson E. White H. Durston V. Eccles D.M. Hupp T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13791-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By contrast to ERK, RSK-mediated phosphorylation of DAPK-1 attenuates the apoptotic response by an undefined mechanism (27Anjum R. Roux P.P. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1762-1767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Identifying novel DAPK-1-binding proteins and substrates will expand on our understanding of the mechanisms of the many diverse functions of DAPK-1. In this study we focus on developing a linear interaction peptide consensus for the core kinase domain of DAPK-1 using peptide-aptamers, and we characterize one interaction that occurs with the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B. The MAP1B protein has been classically studied in neuronal cells (28Gordon-Weeks P.R. Fischer I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 48: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) where it regulates the organization of microtubules, mediates axonal migration (29Del Rio J.A. Gonzalez-Billault C. Urena J.M.

Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 70-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and contributes to the transport of cargo proteins on microtubules (31Jimenez-Mateos E.M. Gonzalez-Billault C. Dawson H.N. Vitek M.P. Avila J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Like DAPK-1, MAP1B has been independently shown to play a role in cytoskeletal dynamics (for review see Ref. 21Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and to influence cell fate in cultured cells and in whole tissues. Interestingly, MAP1B has been shown recently to interact with the autophagy marker protein LC3 (32Halpain S. Dehmelt L. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), prompting us to investigate its role in the regulation of autophagic processes in relation to DAPK-1. Here, data are presented demonstrating a genetic and biochemical interaction between MAP1B and DAPK-1 that reduces cultured cell growth independently of apoptosis and stimulates membrane blebbing dependent on an active autophagic program. These data show that DAPK-1-induced cell membrane blebbing is linked to autophagy and provide a novel interaction partner whose study may shed light on the mechanisms of DAPK-1-mediated changes in cytoskeletal structures leading to an enhancement of its activity in autophagy, membrane blebbing, and associated pathologies. Reagents and Plasmids—All chemicals were acquired from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Gateway recombination cloning vectors were obtained from Invitrogen. Human full-length DAPK-1 cDNA and mRNA corresponding to the DAPK-1 kinase domain (N1-274) were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR amplification from total RNA isolated from HCT116 cells. The forward primer atgaccgtgttcaggcagg was used with reverse primers tcaccgggatacaacagagct for full-length cDNA and tcaccagggatgctgcaaactatc for the kinase domain. Forward and reverse primers were designed to contain attB1 (ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggctgg) and attB2 (ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtg) sites, respectively, for incorporation into vector pDONR201. The following MAP1B constructs were cloned from human fetal brain total RNA (Ambion) into pDONR221 using the gateway system: ≈4-kb fragments of transcript variants 1 (V1) and 2 (V2) (equivalent to rat constructs (33Uchida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 366-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)) using forward primers atggcgaccgtggtggtgg and atgatcactgatgctgccc. Respectively. in conjunction with the reverse primer actgaattcaaaactcactg and the N terminus of variant 1 (N126) using reverse primer taagcgcacctcggtg. The various DAPK-1 pDONR201 and MAP1B pDONR221 constructs were then recombined using the LR reaction (components Invitrogen) into the required destination vector for bacterial, insect cell, or mammalian expression for native expression or with either His, GST, V5, or GFP tags as required. Empty vector constructs contained 1 kb of nonspecific DNA preceded by two stop codons incorporated by Gateway recombination cloning. Full-length human native transcript variant 1 (NM 005909) of MAP1B was acquired from Origen. Double HA/FLAG-tagged DAPK-1 (NM 004938), kinase activity attenuated (K42A), and calmodulin domain deleted (ΔCaM) constructs were a gift from Adi Kimchi (Weizmann Institute, Israel). Development of DAPK-1 Binding Ligands Using Peptide Combinatorial Libraries—A peptide phage combinatorial library of random 12-mer peptides (New England Biolabs) was used as a source of combinatorial peptides. 96-Well flat bottom plate wells (Microlite 2, Dynatech Laboratories) were coated with 1 μg/ml anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) to capture purified GST-tagged DAPK-1 kinase domain. After capture and washing, wells were incubated for 1 h with 2 × 1011 phages in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The phage particles were eluted by acid or ATP incubation and neutralized with 15 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.1). Eluted phage particles were then amplified by infection of ER2378 cells and then polyethylene glycol-precipitated. This procedure was repeated three times with ∼2 × 1011 plaque-forming units of the first or second round amplified eluate used as input phage. In addition, the concentration of Tween 20 in the binding and wash buffers was increased stepwise, from 0.1 to 0.5%, with each successive round of biopanning to reduce nonspecific binding of the amplified phage peptide particles. The third round of polyethylene glycol-precipitated phage was titrated, and individual plaques were regrown and tested for DAPK-1-kinase domain binding activity. DNA from 10 binding phage plaques was then amplified and prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). The Abi Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer was used to sequence the DNA with the -96gIII primer. Sequence data from the 12-mer peptides obtained were then analyzed for target homology using both the e-motif and/or NCBI algorithms blastp, psi-blast, and phi-blast. After phage display biopanning, the ability of purified DAPK-1 to bind isolated phage 12-mers was further assessed using synthesized biotinylated peptides (Cambridge Peptides). Peptide association was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Recombinant Protein Purification and DAPK-1 Kinase Assay—Active GST-tagged DAPK-1 kinase domain 1-274 (DAPK-1-KD) pDEST20 was expressed in insect Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) and in Escherichia coli. After gentle lysis, GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. His-tagged DAPK-1-KD pDEST10 were expressed in E. coli, extracted using lysis with lysozyme, and purified using nickel beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A nonradioactive kinase assay was used to assay the activity of purified kinase. Tetrameric p53 was purified for use as a substrate in kinase reactions as described previously (34Luciani M.G. Hutchins J.R. Zheleva D. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 503-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting for phospho-Ser20 p53 was performed using monoclonal antibody FPS20 (35Craig A.L. Burch L. Vojtesek B. Mikutowska J. Thompson A. Hupp T.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To access the conformational integrity of purified kinase DAPK-1-KD, p53 binding assays were performed in the presence or absence of Box-V docking site peptide (19Craig A.L. Chrystal J.A. Fraser J.A. Sphyris N. Lin Y. Harrison B.J. Scott M.T. Dornreiter I. Hupp T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3542-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DAPK-1 or p53 was directly adsorbed to the solid phase or captured via anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Sigma). DAPK-1 binding was detected using monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), and p53 binding was detected using antibodies DO1 or ICA9. Cell Culture Transfection and siRNA—A375 and HCT116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. For transfections, cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 per well 1 day prior to transfection. Transient transfections were performed using 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent/μg of DNA in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection unless otherwise stated. For transient MAP1B knockdown cells were seeded at half-density (1 × 105) per well. MAP1B siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA was obtained from Dharmacon. 120 pmol of siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected per 30-mm plate with 2 μl of Lipofectamine for 18-72 h. Nontargeting siCONTROL was used as a negative control in siRNA experiments. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in denaturing RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA with 1× protease inhibitor mixture) (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were reduced in sample buffer containing 0.2 m DTT at 85 °C for 5 min, resolved in 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), and transferred onto nitrocellulose Highbond-C Extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using high molecular weight transfer buffer (1.5× TG, 1.5% SDS, 10% methanol). Membranes were then rinsed and blocked in 5% nonfat milk/PBS for 1 h at room temperature before probing with primary antibody either overnight at 4 °C or at room temperature for 2 h in PBS, 1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat milk. This was followed by washing three times for 5 min in PBS-T. Membranes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse antibody (DakoCytomation) at room temperature for 45 min, followed by washing five times for 5 min in PBS-T. Secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and autography. Primary mouse monoclonal antibodies were used at the following concentrations: DAPK-1 1:250 (BD Biosciences), MAP1B 1:500 (AA6 - Sigma), anti-V5 1:2500 (Invitrogen), p53 1:1000 (DO1), and GFP 1:1000 (Abcam ab1218). Immunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitation of co-transfected proteins, HCT116 cells were co-transfected for 24 h with a total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA consisting of 1 μg of DAPK-1 and 1 μg of V5-tagged MAP1B V1/V2 construct or control vector as indicated. Cells were lysed with mammalian cell detergent lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mm DTT, 0.4 m KCl with 1× protease inhibitor mixture) (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min on ice and cleared at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. 2 μg of anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) was immobilized per 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed three times in 1 ml of PBS-T for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were carried out on a rotor for 2 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 15% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl, and protease inhibitor) using 20 μl of V5 beads with 200 μg of total protein. After precipitation, the beads were sedimented, washed three times with PBS-T, and incubated for 5 min at 85 °C with sample buffer + 0.2 m DTT. Co-precipitated DAPK-1 was detected by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal anti-DAPK-1 antibody (BD Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins after starvation, HEK293 cells were starved for 3 h with Earles' balanced salt solution before treatment with 2 μg/ml nocodazole and 5 μm latrunculin B for 1 h to liberate cytoskeletal associated protein complexes. Cells were lysed by mixing cell pellets with IP lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture) (1× Calbiochem) for 30 min on a rotor at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml nocodazole and 5 μm latrunculin B. Microtubule Polymerization Cycling—137-mm plates of confluent A375 cells were used to prepare microtubule complexes by temperature-dependent polymerization/depolymerization cycling. Cells were harvested in 2.5 ml of homogenization buffer HB (0.1 m MES, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) containing phosphatase inhibitor 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Cell lysis was achieved by addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotor, and then the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 × g three times. GTP was added to cleared lysates (final concentration 1 mm) to allow microtubules to form at 37 °C for 30 min. Microtubules were then pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min; the supernatant was removed, and the microtubules in the pellet were depolymerized in 1 ml of HB for 40 min at 4 °C. Microtubule polymerization and depolymerization were performed a further two cycles to obtain a purified microtubule preparation. Immunofluorescence and Cell Morphology Assessment—A375 cell cytoskeletons were visualized by partial cytoplasm extraction using fixative supplemented with detergent (3% paraformaldehyde and 0.01% Triton in PHEM Buffer: 60 mm Pipes, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 6.9)). After transfection with HA-DAPK-1 and full-length MAP1B for the indicated times, cells were fixed for 15 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min with antibody dilution buffer (10% normal horse serum and 0.1% Triton in PBS) to block. Blocked cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the following primary antibodies in antibody dilution buffer: rat anti-HA 1:50 (3F10, Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-tubulin 1:100 (ab6046, Abcam), and mouse anti-MAP1B 1:200 (mouse monoclonal AA6, Sigma). After washing with PBS, the following highly cross-adsorbed fluorescent Alexa dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were diluted 1:100 and bound for 45 min at room temperature as follows: Alexa488 anti-rat, Alexa405 anti-tubulin, and Alexa568 anti-mouse. F-actin was stained with Alexa633-conjugated phalloidin. Cells were visualized using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using the ×63 objective lens. Quantification of HA-DAPK-1 and Endogenous MAP1B Co-localization with Cortical Actin—After transfection for 24 h with HA-DAPK-1, A375 cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C before simultaneous blocking and membrane permeabilization in antibody dilution buffer for 30 min. Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations: MAP1B (AA6) 1:200 and HA (rat monoclonal 3F10, Roche Applied Science) 1:50 in antibody dilution buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescent highly cross-adsorbed Alexa dye-conjugated Alexa488 anti-rat and Alexa568 anti-mouse secondary antibodies were diluted 1:100 in antibody dilution buffer and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. F-actin was stained with Alexa633-conjugated phalloidin. Cells were visualized using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using the ×63 objective lens. Autophagy Assays—Autophagy was detected in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing the autophagy marker GFP-LC3 (36Tanida I. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 37Kochl R. Hu X.W. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). HEK293-LC3 cells were a gift from Sharon Tooze (Cancer Research UK, London). For assay of autophagy after MAP1B siRNA, HEK-LC3 cells were seeded at half-density, and 25 pmol per cm2 of MAP1B siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected using 0.4 μl/cm2 Lipofectamine 2000 for 32 h. After 32 h siRNA knockdown, growth medium was changed, and cells were transfected for a further 32 h with 100 ng/cm2 of HA-DAPK-1 expression vector with 0.8 μl/cm2 of Lipofectamine 2000. Autophagosomes were counted in fixed and stained cells, providing a quantifiable mark"
https://openalex.org/W2054891396,"Human cardiac fibroblasts are protected from oxidative stress triggered by inflammation after myocardial injury (Li, P. F., Dietz, R., and von Harsdorf, R. (1999) <i>FEBS Lett.</i> 448, 206–210) by expressing potent antioxidant defenses such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, glutathione-peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins. Recently the transcription factor FOXO3A has been shown to increase resistance to oxidative stress by up-regulation of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and peroxisomal catalase (Kops, G. J., Dansen, T. B., Polderman, P. E., Saarloos, I., Wirtz, K. W., Coffer, P. J., Huang, T. T., Bos, J. L., Medema, R. H., and Burgering, B. M. (2002) <i>Nature</i> 419, 316–321; Nemoto, S., and Finkel, T. (2002) <i>Science</i> 295, 2450–2452). We hypothesized that FOXO3A also regulates the expression of Prx III, the mitochondrial peroxiredoxin, in human cardiac fibroblasts. We found that depletion of FOXO3A leads to a dramatic reduction of Prx III mRNA and protein in serum-deprived human cardiac fibroblasts. These data suggest that endogenous FOXO3A is necessary for base-line expression of Prx III. Next, we identified two putative FOXO3A DNA binding sites in Prx III promoter at –267 and –244 nucleotides relative to the start codon. We demonstrated that both sequences are required for binding of endogenous FOXO3A to the Prx III promoter by performing electromobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Inhibition of endogenous FOXO3A by insulin growth factor 1 prevented binding of FOXO3A to Prx III promoter. In contrast, overexpression of FOXO3A increased Prx III promoter activity. Furthermore, depletion of Prx III was associated with enhanced apoptosis and oxidative stress after serum deprivation. We conclude that FOXO3A mediates Prx III expression, and this may play a critical role in the resistance to oxidative stress in cardiac fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2090628370,"Caspase-2 is one of the most conserved caspases, yet its biological function remains a matter of controversy. In the present article we analysed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from caspase-2 knockout mice for their sensitivity to various apoptosis inducing agents. We found that cell death induced by drugs that disrupt cytoskeleton is significantly inhibited in Casp2−/− MEFs. These drugs included zoledronic acid, vincristine, cytochalasin D and paclitaxel. We demonstrate that MEFs lacking Casp2 show clonogenic survival following drug treatment, whereas all Casp2+/+ MEFs die, indicating that caspase-2 is required for apoptosis induced by cytoskeletal disruption. We further found that caspase-2 mediates apoptosis via Piddosome, Bid and Bax activation, and cytochrome c release. In the absence of caspase-2, Bid and Bax activation, and cytochrome c release are significantly delayed following drug treatment. Our data provide strong support for a context-dependent function of caspase-2 in apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2125244516,"ERK1/2 is known to be involved in hormone-stimulated steroid synthesis, but its exact roles and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Both ERK1/2 phosphorylation and steroidogenesis may be triggered by cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-dependent and-independent mechanisms; however, ERK1/2 activation by cAMP results in a maximal steroidogenic rate, whereas canonical activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) does not. We demonstrate herein by Western blot analysis and confocal studies that temporal mitochondrial ERK1/2 activation is obligatory for PKA-mediated steroidogenesis in the Leydig-transformed MA-10 cell line. PKA activity leads to the phosphorylation of a constitutive mitochondrial MEK1/2 pool with a lower effect in cytosolic MEKs, while EGF allows predominant cytosolic MEK activation and nuclear pERK1/2 localization. These results would explain why PKA favors a more durable ERK1/2 activation in mitochondria than does EGF. By means of ex vivo experiments, we showed that mitochondrial maximal steroidogenesis occurred as a result of the mutual action of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein -a key regulatory component in steroid biosynthesis-, active ERK1/2 and PKA. Our results indicate that there is an interaction between mitochondrial StAR and ERK1/2, involving a D domain with sequential basic-hydrophobic motifs similar to ERK substrates. As a result of this binding and only in the presence of cholesterol, ERK1/2 phosphorylates StAR at Ser(232). Directed mutagenesis of Ser(232) to a non-phosphorylable amino acid such as Ala (StAR S232A) inhibited in vitro StAR phosphorylation by active ERK1/2. Transient transfection of MA-10 cells with StAR S232A markedly reduced the yield of progesterone production. In summary, here we show that StAR is a novel substrate of ERK1/2, and that mitochondrial ERK1/2 is part of a multimeric protein kinase complex that regulates cholesterol transport. The role of MAPKs in mitochondrial function is underlined."
https://openalex.org/W2009294443,"It is widely recognized that mitochondrial dysfunction, most notably defects in the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I), is closely related to the etiology of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). In fact, rotenone, a complex I inhibitor, has been used for establishing PD models both in vitro and in vivo. A rat model with chronic rotenone exposure seems to reproduce pathophysiological conditions of PD more closely than acute mouse models as manifested by neuronal cell death in the substantia nigra and Lewy body-like cytosolic aggregations. Using the rotenone rat model, we investigated the protective effects of alternative NADH dehydrogenase (Ndi1) which we previously demonstrated to act as a replacement for complex I both in vitro and in vivo. A single, unilateral injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the NDI1 gene into the vicinity of the substantia nigra resulted in expression of the Ndi1 protein in the entire substantia nigra of that side. It was clear that the introduction of the Ndi1 protein in the substantia nigra rendered resistance to the deleterious effects caused by rotenone exposure as assessed by the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine. The presence of the Ndi1 protein also prevented cell death and oxidative damage to DNA in dopaminergic neurons observed in rotenone-treated rats. Unilateral protection also led to uni-directional rotation of the rotenone-exposed rats in the behavioral test. The present study shows, for the first time, the powerful neuroprotective effect offered by the Ndi1 enzyme in a rotenone rat model of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2086857006,"Background Many parasites of medical and veterinary importance are transmitted by cold-blooded intermediate hosts or vectors, the abundance of which will vary with ambient temperatures, potentially altering disease prevalence. In particular, if global climate change will increase mean ambient temperature in a region endemic with a human pathogen then it is possible that the incidence of disease will similarly increase. Here we examine this possibility by using a mathematical model to explore the effects of increasing long-term mean ambient temperature on the prevalence and abundance of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of schistosomiasis in humans. Principal Findings The model showed that the impact of temperature on disease prevalence and abundance is not straightforward; the mean infection burden in humans increases up to 30°C, but then crashes at 35°C, primarily due to increased mortalities of the snail intermediate host. In addition, increased temperatures changed the dynamics of disease from stable, endemic infection to unstable, epidemic cycles at 35°C. However, the prevalence of infection was largely unchanged by increasing temperatures. Temperature increases also affected the response of the model to changes in each parameter, indicating certain control strategies may become less effective with local temperature changes. At lower temperatures, the most effective single control strategy is to target the adult parasites through chemotherapy. However, as temperatures increase, targeting the snail intermediate hosts, for example through molluscicide use, becomes more effective. Conclusions These results show that S. mansoni will not respond to increased temperatures in a linear fashion, and the optimal control strategy is likely to change as temperatures change. It is only through a mechanistic approach, incorporating the combined effects of temperature on all stages of the life-cycle, that we can begin to predict the consequences of climate change on the incidence and severity of such diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2141402938,"In vertebrate retinal photoreceptors, the absorption of light by rhodopsin leads to photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal to its all-trans isomer. To sustain vision, a metabolic system evolved that recycles all-trans-retinal back to 11-cis-retinal. The importance of this visual (retinoid) cycle is underscored by the fact that mutations in genes encoding visual cycle components induce a wide spectrum of diseases characterized by abnormal levels of specific retinoid cycle intermediates. In addition, intense illumination can produce retinoid cycle by-products that are toxic to the retina. Thus, inhibition of the retinoid cycle has therapeutic potential in physiological and pathological states. Four classes of inhibitors that include retinoid and nonretinoid compounds have been identified. We investigated the modes of action of these inhibitors by using purified visual cycle components and in vivo systems. We report that retinylamine was the most potent and specific inhibitor of the retinoid cycle among the tested compounds and that it targets the retinoid isomerase, RPE65. Hydrophobic primary amines like farnesylamine also showed inhibitory potency but a short duration of action, probably due to rapid metabolism. These compounds also are reactive nucleophiles with potentially high cellular toxicity. We also evaluated the role of a specific protein-mediated mechanism on retinoid cycle inhibitor uptake by the eye. Our results show that retinylamine is transported to and taken up by the eye by retinol-binding protein-independent and retinoic acid-responsive gene product 6-independent mechanisms. Finally, we provide evidence for a crucial role of lecithin: retinol acyltransferase activity in mediating tissue specific absorption and long lasting therapeutic effects of retinoid-based visual cycle inhibitors. In vertebrate retinal photoreceptors, the absorption of light by rhodopsin leads to photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal to its all-trans isomer. To sustain vision, a metabolic system evolved that recycles all-trans-retinal back to 11-cis-retinal. The importance of this visual (retinoid) cycle is underscored by the fact that mutations in genes encoding visual cycle components induce a wide spectrum of diseases characterized by abnormal levels of specific retinoid cycle intermediates. In addition, intense illumination can produce retinoid cycle by-products that are toxic to the retina. Thus, inhibition of the retinoid cycle has therapeutic potential in physiological and pathological states. Four classes of inhibitors that include retinoid and nonretinoid compounds have been identified. We investigated the modes of action of these inhibitors by using purified visual cycle components and in vivo systems. We report that retinylamine was the most potent and specific inhibitor of the retinoid cycle among the tested compounds and that it targets the retinoid isomerase, RPE65.

Finally, we provide evidence for a crucial role of lecithin: retinol acyltransferase activity in mediating tissue specific absorption and long lasting therapeutic effects of retinoid-based visual cycle inhibitors. In vertebrate photoreceptor cells, absorbance of light by the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, coupled to rhodopsin leads to its photoisomerization to all-trans-retinal and initiation of the phototransduction signal cascade (reviewed in Ref. 1Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 743-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). To ensure constant vision, 11-cis-retinal is efficiently regenerated by a complex sequence of enzymatic reactions called the visual or retinoid cycle (reviewed in Refs. 2Travis G.H. Golczak M.

Golczak M. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 469-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Three main strategies have been developed to treat these diseases. The first uses virally mediated transfer gene technology to replace the defective gene. This approach has successfully rescued vision in mouse and dog models of Leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa (8Acland G.M. Aguirre G.D. Ray J. Zhang Q. Aleman T.S. Cideciyan A.V.

Symp. 2004; 255 (discussion 63–67, 177–178): 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This approach is used for diseases associated with accumulation of toxic visual cycle by-products (e.g. lipofuscin fluorophores, such as N-retinidene-N-retinyl ethanolamine (A2E) and its derivatives) that can cause multiple forms of retinal degeneration (21Finnemann S.C.

Examples of diseases sharing this phenotype include age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, and Stargardt disease (reviewed in Ref. 2Travis G.H. Golczak M. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 469-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar).Visual cycle inhibitors can be classified into four distinct groups based on their chemical structures. The first consists of 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA) and the hydroxyphenyl amide of its all-trans isomer, fenretinide (Fig. 1A). These retinoid inhibitors have been used for decades in the treatment of acne and chemoprevention of cancer (24Conley B. O'Shaughnessy J. Prindiville S. Lawrence J. Chow C. Jones E. Merino M.J. Kaiser-Kupfer M.I. Caruso R.C. Podgor M. Goldspiel B. Venzon D. Danforth D. Wu S. Noone M. Goldstein J. Cowan K.H. Zujewski J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 275-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical reports showing delayed dark adaptation and night blindness upon 13-cis-RA treatment drew attention to these compounds as potential visual therapeutics (25Caffery B.E. Josephson J.E. J. Am. Optom. Assoc. 1988; 59: 221-224PubMed Google Scholar, 26Caruso R.C. Zujewski J. Iwata F. Podgor M.J. Conley B.A. Ayres L.M. Kaiser-Kupfer M.I. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 13-cis-RA was found to inhibit 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the final enzymatic step in the visual cycle (27Gamble M.V. Mata N.L. Tsin A.T. Mertz J.R. Blaner W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and to bind RPE65 (28Gollapalli D.R. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10030-10035Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fenretinide slowed the flux of retinoids into the eyes, most probably by reducing levels of vitamin A bound to serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) (17Radu R.A. Mata N.L. Nusinowitz S. Liu X. Sieving P.A. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4742-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Both compounds reduced A2E deposition in the eye (18Radu R.A. Han Y. Bui T.V. Nusinowitz S. Bok D. Lichter J. Widder K. Travis G.H. Mata N.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Radu R.A. Mata N.L. Bagla A.

Developed as a transition state analog for the isomerization reaction, Ret-NH2 inhibits 11-cis-retinol production (29Golczak M. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Golczak M. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Kubota R. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Moreover, Ret-NH2 is reversibly N-acetylated by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) and stored in retinosomes within the RPE (30Golczak M. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Kubota R. Palczewski K. J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This last characteristic may contribute to its efficient transport and long-lasting inhibition of the retinoid cycle in vivo. Farnesyl-containing isoprenoid derivatives, originally characterized by Rando and co-workers (33Maiti P. Kong J. Kim S.R. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 852-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), belong to the third group of inhibitors. These are thought to act through interaction with RPE65 (Fig. 1C), although their therapeutic efficiency is retracted (34Maiti P. Kong J. Kim S. Sparrow J. Allikmets R. Rando R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8700Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The last class of inhibitors is composed of nonretinoid hydrophobic primary amine with therapeutic potential. These compounds have yet to be evaluated (Fig. 1D).In the present work, we used biochemical, cell culture, and in vivo experimental approaches to compare the properties and therapeutic potential of various retinoid cycle inhibitors that might benefit retinal diseases. We evaluated inhibitory efficacy and potency, molecular targets, and modes of action in vivo and in vitro. Farnesylamine and farnesol derivatives were used to investigate the role of the amino group in inhibiting the retinoid cycle. Finally, we evaluated the role of serum RBP/STRA6 (retinoic acid-responsive gene product 6) in delivering some of these therapeutic agents to the eyes.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—Rbp–/– mice were previously generated and described (35Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S. Cosma M.P. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4633-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 36Quadro L.

Colantuoni V. Blaner W.S. Mendelsohn C.L. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 4479-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All mice were from a mixed C57Bl/6 × sv129 genetic background. Lrat–/– mice were generated and genotyped as described previously (55Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Abca4–/– mice were generated by standard procedures (Ingenious Targeting, Inc., Rochester, NY). The targeting vector was constructed by replacing exon 1 with the neo cassette. Abca4–/– mice were maintained in a mixed background of C57BL/6 and 129Sv/Ev, and siblings with Leu residue in position 450 (Leu-450) of RPE65 were used. Genotyping of mice was done by PCR using primers ABCR1 (5′-GCCCAGTGGTCGATCTGTCTAGC-3′) and ABCR2 (5′-CGGACACAAAGGCCGCTAGGACCACG-3′) for wild type (WT) (619 bp) and A0 (5′-CCACAGCACACATCAGCATTTCTCC-3′) and N1 (5′-TGCGAGGCCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAGC-3′) for targeted deletion (455 bp). PCR products were cloned and sequenced to verify their identity.Typically, 6-week-old mice were used for these experiments. Mice were maintained continuously in darkness, and all experimental manipulations were performed under dim red light passed through an Eastman Kodak Co. Safelight filter. All animal procedures were approved by Case Western Reserve University and conformed with recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the Association of Research for Vision and Ophthalmology. Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse (Mahan's Packing, Bristolville, OH), and RPE microsomes were prepared from bovine eyecups (37Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Materials and Chemical Syntheses—13-cis-RA and all-trans-RA were purchased from Sigma and fenretinide from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Toronto, Canada). (2E,6E)-N-hexadecyl-3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-2,6,10-trienamine (TDH) and (12E,16E)-13,17,21-trimethyldocosa-12,16,20-trien-11-one (TDT) were synthesized by Acucela Inc. (Bothell, WA). Ret-NH2 was synthesized as previously described (29Golczak M. Kuksa V. Maeda T. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clark D.A. Heterick B.E. Snelling R.R. J. Nat. Prod. 2003; 66: 325-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Reaction progress was monitored by TLC. The chemical structure of farnesylamine derivatized with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide in the presence of 10% of trimethylchlorosilane was validated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Stable Transduction of the NIH3T3 Cell Line—An NIH3T3 stable cell line expressing LRAT and two double-stable cell lines expressing LRAT/RPE65 and LRAT/STRA6 were used. Full-length human LRAT, RPE65, and STRA6 clones used to prepare these cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). For construction of retroviral expression vectors, LRAT, RPE65, and STRA6 cDNA were amplified by PCR, and EcoRI and NotI restriction sites were introduced at the ends of the coding sequence by using the following primers: STRA6, GCAGATGAATTCACCATGTCGTCCCAGCCAGCAGG and CGTCTAGCGGCCGCTCAGGGCTGGGCACCATTGG; LRAT, GAGGTGAATTCAGCTACTCAGGGATGAAGAACCCCATGCTG and ACTGACGCGGCCGCATGAAGTTAGCCAGCCATCCATAG; RPE65, TCTGGGAATTCAACTGGAAGAAAATGTCTATCCAGGTTGAG and CTTGCTGGCGGCCGCTCAAGATTTTTTGAACAGTCC. These primers were cloned into the pMXs-IG (STRA6 and RPE65) or pMXs-IP (LRAT) retroviral vectors provided by Dr. T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo) (39Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T. Kumagai H. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Inserts were sequenced and confirmed to be identical to LRAT, RPE65, and STRA6 reference sequences deposited in the Ensembl data base. The Phoenix-Eco retroviral producer cell line as well as the NIH3T3 cells were cultured in growth medium (GM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.2, with 4 mm l-glutamine, 4,500 mg/liter glucose, and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, 2.5 × 106 Phoenix-Eco cells were seeded on a 6-cm plate and cultured in 6 ml of GM. To generate a transfection mixture, 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.05, containing 10 mm KCl, 12 mm dextrose, 280 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mm Na2HPO4 was added to an equal volume of 250 mm CaCl2 solution containing 20 μg of plasmid DNA, mixed, incubated for 1 min, and added dropwise to the cells. This medium was replaced with fresh GM 8 h after transfection and replaced again 24 h later. The retroviral supernatant was harvested 48 h post-transfection, centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min to remove detached cells, aliquoted into 0.5-ml portions, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. 24 h prior to transduction, 2 × 105 NIH3T3 fibroblasts were plated per 6-cm dish in 6 ml of GM. For transduction, this medium was replaced with a mixture consisting of 2.5 ml of GM (the one just collected, not fresh GM), 0.5 ml of viral supernatant, and 5 μg/ml Polybrene. The plate was gently swirled and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C in 5% CO2 before replacing the medium with fresh GM. After reaching confluence, cells were split and seeded at 2 × 105. This infection cycle was repeated 2–4 times.LRAT, Retinol Dehydrogenase (RDH), and Enzymatic Isomerization Assays—The LRAT activity assay was carried out in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% bovine serum albumin (final volume 200 μl). All-trans-retinol was delivered in 0.8 μlof N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to a final concentration of 10 μm, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of bovine RPE microsomes (150 μg of protein). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, stopped by injecting 300 μl of methanol, and mixed with the same volume of hexane. Retinoids were extracted and analyzed on a Hewlett Packard 1100 series HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector and a normal phase column (Agilent-Si; 5 μm, 4.5 × 250 mm) eluted with 10% ethyl acetate in hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min.Activities of RDH in bovine rod outer segments (ROS) and RPE microsomes were assayed by monitoring retinol production (reduction of retinal). Each reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 50 mm MES, pH 5.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg of UV-treated RPE microsomes or ROS, the test substrate, and a reducing agent (NADH or NADPH). For RDH5, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 11-cis-retinal (2 μm) followed by 60 μm NADH. To detect RDH activity in ROS, NADPH (60 μm) was added first, and the samples were exposed to a single flash of light from an electronic flash (40Palczewski K. Jager S. Buczylko J. Crouch R.K. Bredberg D.L. Hofmann K.P. Asson-Batres M.A. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13741-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated with 300 μlof methanol, and retinoids were extracted with 300 μl of hexane. The upper phase was removed and dried using a SpeedVac. The residue was dissolved in 200 μl of hexane, and 100 μl of this solution was analyzed by HPLC as described above.Isomerase assays were performed as previously described (41Stecher H. Gelb M.H. Saari J.C. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8577-8585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 42Stecher H. Palczewski K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 330-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Reactions were carried out in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1% bovine serum albumin, containing 1 mm ATP and 6 μm apo-cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein. Inhibition by test compounds was assessed by preincubating UV-treated RPE microsomes for 5 min at 37 °C with test compound delivered in 1 μl of DMF before the addition of apo-cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein and all-trans-retinol (10 μm). The same volume of DMF was added to control reactions. Experiments were performed three times in duplicates. For isomerization reaction assays in cell culture, NIH3T3 cells expressing LRAT and RPE65 were cultured in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well for 20 h before each experiment. GM was removed, and 2 ml of fresh GM containing 10 μm all-trans-retinol and 3 μm test compound were added. Cells and medium were collected after 16 h of incubation. Samples were treated with 2 ml of methanol, homogenized, and saponified with 1 m KOH at 37 °C for 2 h prior to extraction with hexane. The resulting hexane phase was collected, dried using a SpeedVac, and redissolved in 250 μl of hexane, and retinoid composition was determined by normal phase HPLC as described above.Inhibitor Administration and Extraction/Analysis of Retinoids from Mouse Eyes—Typically, all compounds tested in mice were delivered in 50 μl of tissue culture grade dimethylsulfoxide by intraperitoneal injection. Procedures related to the analysis of dissected mouse eyes, derivatization of retinals with hydroxylamine, and separation of retinoids have been described (14Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Typically, two mice were used per assay, and assays were repeated three times.Expression and Purification of Human RPE65—Full-length human RPE65 containing a C-terminal 1D4 tag was cloned into the pFastBac HT A plasmid, and the resulting construct was used to produce baculovirus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Bac-to-Bac handbook). For protein expression, 50 ml of high titer P3 baculovirus was added to 600 ml of cultured Sf9 cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, and the cells were shaken at 27 °C. After 36–48 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, containing one dissolved tablet of EDTA-free complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell suspensions were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Suspensions were thawed with 40 ml of 20 mm bis-tris-propane, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 2 mm CHAPS, and one dissolved tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and lysates were centrifuged at 145,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, diluted 2-fold with lysis buffer, and loaded onto a 3-ml Talon resin (Clontech) column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 30 column volumes of 20 mm BTP, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 2 mm CHAPS, and 5 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with a buffer consisting of 20 mm BTP, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 2 mm CHAPS, and 150 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, TEV protease (43Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) was added at a concentration of 3% (w/w) (based on protein concentration), and mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for ∼14 h to remove the N-terminal His6 tag, and protein was purified further on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Fractions containing RPE65 were identified by immunoblotting. RPE65 preparations were >99% pure after gel filtration chromatography based on Coomassie- and silver-stained SDS-PAGE.Tissue Extraction of Ret-NH2 and N-Retinylamides—Mouse liver (1 g) was homogenized in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 9.0, and 10 ml of methanol. The retinoids were extracted with 20 ml of hexane. The organic phase containing retinoids was collected, dried down in a SpeedVac, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20% ethyl acetate/hexane containing 0.5% ammonia in methanol. N-Retinylamides were separated on a normal phase HPLC column (Agilent-Si; 5 μm, 4.5 × 250 mm) by a solution of 20% ethyl acetate in hexane at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, whereas Ret-NH2 was eluted with 100% ethyl acetate in the presence of 0.5% ammonia in methanol at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min.Mouse A2E Analysis—Two whole mouse eyes were homogenized and extracted twice in 1.0 ml of CH3CN with a glass-glass homogenizer and dried using a SpeedVac. The residue was redissolved in 120 μl of 80% CH3CN in H2O with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 100 μl was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC with a C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) developed with a linear gradient of CH3CN (0–100%) in H2O with the addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a 1.5 ml/min flow rate. Quantification of A2E and iso-A2E was performed by comparison"
https://openalex.org/W2059987067,"Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway results in an increase in cell proliferation and survival. Somatic mutations within the PI3K catalytic subunit, PIK3CA are common cause of increasing PI3K activity and are believed to be oncogenic in many cancer types. Few reports addressed the association between PIK3CA mutations and tumor progression specifically in microsatellite instable (MSI) colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present study, we have evaluated PIK3CA mutational status in a series of 410 Middle Eastern CRC and 13 colon cell lines to study the prevalence of PIK3CA mutations in MSI cases, PTEN expression in CRC and possibility of therapeutic targeting of this set of patients. PIK3CA mutations were found in four of the cell lines tested and 51 colorectal carcinomas (12.2%). Three of these four mutated cell lines were MSI. PTEN was inactivated in 66.1% of the CRC. Furthermore, we observed a strong association between PIK3CA mutations and MSI status (P=0.0046) while PTEN loss was more frequent in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC (P=0.043). A high prevalence of genetic alterations in PI3K/AKT pathway in Saudi cohort of CRC, predominance of PIK3CA mutations in the MSI subgroup and their possible involvement in development/progression of this subset of CRC are some of the significant findings of our study."

Thirty eight of the subjects (13.3%) failed to respond to PHA stimulation and were excluded from the analysis. In the 247 remaining patients, response to PHA did not vary according to CD4 cell count categories (p = 0.51). EC ELISPOT was positive in 125 (50.6%) subjects, while 53 (21.5%) had a positive TST. Concordance between EC ELISPOT and TST was observed in 151 patients (61.1%) (kappa = 0.23). The proportion of subjects with a positive response to the EC ELISPOT assay decreased with declining CD4 counts (p trend = 0.001), but were consistently higher than the proportion of TST responders. In multivariate analysis, the risk of being EC-ELISPOT positive in HIV infected individuals was associated with age, CD4 count and HIV-1 strain.Our study indicates that IGRAs using M. tuberculosis specific antigens are likely to retain their validity for the diagnosis of LTBI among HIV positive individuals, but may be impaired by T-cell anergy in severely immuno-suppressed individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1968342451,"The prototypical second messenger cAMP is a key regulator of immune and inflammatory responses. Its ability to inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 responses is due to induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), a negative regulator of IL-6 receptor signaling. We have determined previously that SOCS-3 induction by cAMP occurs independently of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, instead requiring the recently identified cAMP sensor exchange protein activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC1). Here we present evidence to suggest that the C/EBP family of transcription factors link EPAC1 activation to SOCS-3 induction. Firstly, selective activation of EPAC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells increased C/EBP DNA binding activity and recruitment of C/EBPβ to the SOCS-3 promoter. Secondly, knockdown of C/EBPβ and -δ isoforms abolished both SOCS-3 induction and inhibition of IL-6 signaling in response to cAMP. Thirdly, overexpression of C/EBPα, -β, or -δ potentiated EPAC-mediated accumulation of SOCS-3. Finally, these effects were not restricted to human umbilical vein endothelial cells, because similar phenomena were observed in murine embryonic fibroblasts in which C/EBPβ or δ had been deleted. In summary, our findings constitute the first description of an EPAC-C/EBP pathway that can control cAMP-mediated changes in gene expression independently of protein kinase A."
https://openalex.org/W2013358742,"Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiologic agent of porcine contagious pleuropneumonia, a cause of considerable world wide economic losses in the swine industry. We sequenced the complete genome of A. pleuropneumoniae, JL03, an isolate of serotype 3 prevalent in China. Its genome is a single chromosome of 2,242,062 base pairs containing 2,097 predicted protein-coding sequences, six ribosomal rRNA operons, and 63 tRNA genes. Preliminary analysis of the genomic sequence and the functions of the encoded proteins not only confirmed the present physiological and pathological knowledge but also offered new insights into the metabolic and virulence characteristics of this important pathogen. We identified a full spectrum of genes related to its characteristic chemoheterotrophic catabolism of fermentation and respiration with an incomplete TCA system for anabolism. In addition to confirming the lack of ApxI toxin, identification of a nonsense mutation in apxIVA and a 5'-proximal truncation of the flp operon deleting both its promoter and the flp1flp2tadV genes have provided convincing scenarios for the low virulence property of JL03. Comparative genomic analysis using the available sequences of other serotypes, probable strain (serotype)-specific genomic islands related to capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharide O-antigen biosyntheses were identified in JL03, which provides a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of serotypic diversity of A. pleuropneumoniae."

OmpR is a winged helix-turnhelix DNA-binding protein that functions as a global regulator in bacteria and is also important in pathogenesis. A detailed mechanistic picture of how OmpR binds to DNA and activates transcription is lacking. We used NMR spectroscopy to solve the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of OmpR (OmpRC) and to analyze the chemical shift changes that occur upon DNA binding. There is little overlap in the interaction surface with residues of PhoB that were reportedly involved in protein/protein interactions in its head-to-tail dimer. Multiple factors account for the lack of overlap. One is that the spacing between the OmpR half-sites is shorter than observed with PhoB, requiring the arrangement of the two OmpR molecules to be different from that of the PhoB dimer on DNA. A second is the demonstration herein that OmpR can bind to its high affinity site as a monomer. As a result, OmpRC appears to be capable of adopting alternative orientations depending on the precise base composition of the binding site, which also contributes to the lack of overlap. In the presence of DNA, chemical shift changes occur in OmpR in the recognition α-helix 3, the loop between β-strand 4 and α-helix 1, and the loop between β-strands 5 and 6. DNA contact residues are Val203 (T), Arg207 (G), and Arg209 (phosphate backbone). Our results suggest that OmpR binds to DNA as a monomer and then forms a symmetric or asymmetric dimer, depending on the binding site. We propose that during activation OmpR binds to DNA and undergoes a conformational change that promotes phosphorylation of the N-terminal receiver domain, the receiver domains dimerize, and then the second monomer binds to DNA. The flexible linker of OmpR enables the second monomer to bind in multiple orientations (head-to-tail and head-to-head), depending on the specific DNA contacts.

The flexible linker of OmpR enables the second monomer to bind in multiple orientations (head-to-tail and head-to-head), depending on the specific DNA contacts. All cells must sense and respond to changes in their environment to survive. In prokaryotes, signal transduction is largely achieved via two-component regulatory systems (for reviews see Ref. 1Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). In their simplest form, the first component is a sensor kinase, usually a membrane protein that is phosphorylated on a conserved histidine residue in response to an environmental signal. The phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred onto a conserved aspartic acid of the second component, the response regulator. The modified output of the response regulator is most often a change in gene expression, but some effector domains exhibit altered enzymatic activity or protein/protein interactions. Response regulators are grouped into three subfamilies based on the structural similarity of their effector domains: OmpR/PhoB, NtrC/DctD, and NarL/FixJ. The EnvZ/OmpR two-component system regulates reciprocal expression of the porin genes ompF and ompC in response to changes in the osmolality of the growth medium (2van Alphen W. Lugtenberg B. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 623-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At low osmolality, OmpF is the major porin in the outer membrane, whereas at high osmolality OmpC is the predominant porin. The two porins do not differ from one another by the size of their pores (3Basle A. Rummel G. Storici P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 4Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar), although OmpC has a slower flow rate (5Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. Foulds J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 232-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because of electrostatic pore potential (3Basle A. Rummel G. Storici P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become apparent that OmpR is a global regulator, regulating at least 125 genes, including small RNAs, in response to unknown signals (6Oshima T. Aiba H. Masuda Y. Kanaya S. Sugiura M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 7Guillier M. Gottesman S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 231-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Deletion of ompR/envZ had the second most dramatic phenotype compared with deletion of all the other two-component systems in Escherichia coli (4Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). OmpR also plays an important role in pathogenesis, particularly in Salmonella enterica, Yersinia, and Shigella, where it turns on type III secretion systems and down-regulates flagellar gene expression (8Dorman C.J.

Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, regulation of virulence gene expression is EnvZ-dependent but not driven by osmolality (18Feng X. Oropeza R. Kenney L.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). OmpR directly activates the SsrA/B two-component regulatory system that switches on type III secretion, enabling S. enterica sv. Typhimurium to replicate in macrophages and cause a systemic infection (13Lee A.K. Detweiler C.S. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Feng X. Oropeza R. Kenney L.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, in a wide variety of organisms, OmpR plays a central regulatory role in controlling expression of both housekeeping and virulence genes. OmpR is the archetype example from the largest subfamily of response regulators in E. coli. It is a two domain response regulator, composed of an N-terminal receiver or phosphorylation domain (19Kato M. Aiba H. Tate S. Nishimura Y. Mizuno T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal DNA binding domain (20Tate S. Kato M. Nishimura Y. Arata Y. Mizuno T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The two domains are joined by a long, flexible linker that is susceptible to proteolysis (21Kenney L.J. Bauer M.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8866-8870Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in the N terminus increases the affinity of the C terminus for DNA (22Aiba H. Nakasai F. Mizushima S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol.

This communication is bi-directional in that DNA binding also stimulates phosphorylation (26Ames S.K. Frankema J. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and requires the domains to be linked (27Mattison K. Oropeza R. Kenney L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32714-32721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The dynamic nature of OmpR has prevented the determination of a crystal structure of the full-length protein, and co-crystallization of the C terminus bound to DNA has not been achieved. Thus, although OmpR is an important regulator, many structural and functional features have not yet been resolved. For example, sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicate that from 0 to 38 μm OmpR is 90% monomeric, 4L. J. Kenney and K. van Holde, unpublished results. yet it reportedly binds DNA as a dimer (23Harlocker S.L. Bergstrom L. Inouye M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24155-24161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is presumed, based on structural homology to other response regulators, that dimerization occurs upon phosphorylation and promotes interaction along its N-terminal α4-β5-α5 face (31Toro-Roman A. Mack T.R. Stock A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It was suggested that a common mechanism of dimerization is employed by the OmpR subfamily of response regulators, even though substantial functional differences exist among subfamily members. This view has been recently challenged by a crystal structure of the RegX3 response regulator from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which demonstrated a domain-swap mode of dimerization (32King-Scott J. Nowak E. Mylonas E. Panjikar S. Roessle M. Svergun D.I. Tucker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37717-37729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we present the results from our NMR studies of the DNA binding domain of OmpR (OmpRC). Changes in chemical shifts that occurred upon DNA binding enabled us to identify the susceptible residues. Phenotypic analysis further highlighted a role for these residues in activating transcription. Based on these results, we propose that OmpR binds to its high affinity site as a monomer making contacts with T and G bases via Val203 and Arg207 and phosphate backbone contacts via Arg209 in the recognition helix (α-helix 3). A second OmpR molecule binds subsequently. Weak protein/protein interactions in the dimer facilitate interaction with the DNA of the second, lower affinity half-site. The molecular basis for this reduced affinity is now apparent, the result of deviation from the preferred core sequence of GTXTCA (5′-3′ of the template strand, where X is A or T). Our results also account for the structural basis of the reduced affinity of an OmpR2 mutant V203M for ompC (33Tran V.K. Oropeza R. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1257-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

Standard homonuclear two-dimensional and heteronuclear two- and three-dimensional experiments were acquired for the backbone and side chain and NOE constraint assignments and 3J coupling constants (36Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Data were processed and analyzed using commercial software SYBYL (Tripos Inc., St. Louis). All 1H dimensions were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, and 13C and 15N were indirectly referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (37Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). The assignment of the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignment of 109 amino acid residues of OmpRC was achieved through a combination of standard two- and three-dimensional double and triple resonance NMR experiments (38Kanelis V. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More than 70% of all side chain resonances were assigned for OmpRC. Structural Restraints and Structural Calculations—NMR distance restraints were collected from three different NOESY spectra as follows: three-dimensional NOESY-15N-HSQC (mixing time 120 ms) for amide protons, three-dimensional NOESY-13C-HSQC in D2O (mixing time 100 ms) for aliphatic protons, and two-dimensional 1H-NOESY in D2O (mixing time 100 ms) for aromatic protons. NOE restraints were grouped into four distance ranges: strong, 1.8-2.8 Å; medium, 1.8-4.0 Å; weak, 1.8-5.0 Å; and very weak, 1.8-6.0 Å for backbone-backbone NOE correlations, whereas an additional 0.5 Å was added to the upper bound of the NOE restraints for backbone-side chain and side chain-side chain NOEs (39Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Pseudo-atom corrections were applied for distances involving methyl protons, aromatic ring protons, and nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons (40Wuthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints were employed in areas of regular secondary structures, displaying characteristic NOE cross-peaks. Each deduced hydrogen bond was represented by two distance constraints: 1.7-2.4 Å for HN-O and 2.7-3.4 Å for N-O. Dihedral angle restraints were derived from 3JHNHα coupling constants obtained from a three-dimensional HNHA experiment and were included in the refinement protocol. The φ angles were restrained to -60 ± 30° for 3JHNHα < 6.0 Hz and dNN > dαN, -120 ± 50° for 3JHNHα = 8.0-9.0 Hz, and -120 ± 30° for 3JHNHα > 6.0 Hz. Further restraints for φ and ψ were added on the basis of the consensus chemical shift index (41Wishart D.S. Case D.A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 338: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and NOE patterns characteristic of secondary structure as follows: helical residues, -60 ± 40° (φ) and -50 ± 50° (Ψ), β-strand residues, -120 ± 40° (φ) and -130 ± 50° (Ψ). Structure calculations were performed with the program DYANA 1.5 (42Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) using a 40,000-step energy minimization procedure. For the initial rounds of structure calculations, only sequential, intra-residual, medium range NOEs and unambiguous long range NOEs and coupling constants were used. Subsequently, all other long range NOEs and hydrogen bonds were introduced in consecutive steps. 100 structures were calculated in each round, and of these, the 20 structures with the lowest target functions were used to analyze restraint violations and to assign additional NOE restraints for the following round. This process was repeated until more than 90% of the NOE peaks in the spectra had been assigned, and all violations were eliminated. In the final stage, the 20 structures with the lowest target functions were used for structural analyses. All subsequent analyses of the structure and graphic representations of the three-dimensional structures were performed using MOLMOL (43Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK-NMR (44Doreleijers J.F. Rullmann J.A. Kaptein R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Construction of an ompC1 Site Mutation by PCR—To construct an ompC1-lacZ fusion, DW245 was digested with NdeI and PstI, and the ompC1-lacZ fragment was subcloned into pAH125 that had been cleaved with same enzymes (45Haldimann A. Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The plasmid pJR714 was used as a template to make the ompC1 site G to A mutation. The ompC1 region was amplified using OmpC071 (5′-GTCGACAATCTGGTAACTTTTATC-3′) and LacZ075 (5′-GATATCCTGCACCATCGTCTGC-3′) primers and two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation and then subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector. The PCR contained 10 ng of double-stranded DNA template pJR714, 10 μm of each primer, 2.5 mm each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 15 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in 20 μl. This plasmid, pJR731, was cleaved by using SalI and EcoRV and then subcloned into pJR714 after cleavage with the same enzymes. The mutation was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. pJR731 was integrated into the chromosomal attB site by direct transformation of E. coli MC4100 hosts (WT and ompR mutant) carrying a helper plasmid as described previously by Haldimann and Wanner (45Haldimann A. Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Construction of ompR Mutations by PCR—To create the OmpR mutants, ompR was amplified using OmpR061 and OmpR062 or EnvZ061 primers and then subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector. Two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were used for the PCR. The PCR contained 10 ng of double-stranded DNA template, 10 μm of each primer, 2.5 mm of each dNTP, 15 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in 20 μl. The reaction was amplified by 25 cycles at 95 °C (30 s), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min). The products were used as a template in a second PCR using OmpR061 and OmpR062 primers. The product of the second PCR was subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector. The plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. Overexpression and Purification of OmpR Mutants—To overproduce the mutant OmpR proteins, each plasmid was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the expression vector pET15b (Novagen) that had been cleaved with the same enzymes. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli strain DH5α, and individual transformants were screened for the presence of the appropriate recombinant plasmid. The resulting plasmids encoded a mutant OmpR with a His6 tag at the N terminus. Each plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were incubated with moderate shaking at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached a value of 0.6. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubations were continued for 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). Lysozyme and protease inhibitor (4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride-hydrochloride) were added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and 1 mm, respectively. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were frozen at -70 °C and thawed and sonicated six times, each for 30 s. The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. The proteins were purified by affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's procedure (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). β-Galactosidase Assays—All of the OmpR mutants were subcloned into pBluescript KS vector using XbaI and BamHI. The resulting plasmids were cleaved with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into the pFR29* that had been cleaved with the same enzymes. pFR29* is a derivative of pFR29 from which the envZ gene has been excised (46Russo F.D. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The plasmids were used to transform strains MH225, MH513, MH225.101, and MH513.101. MH225 contains a chromosomal ompC-lacZ fusion and MH513 contains a chromosomal ompF-lacZ fusion (47Hall M. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The .101 strains contain a small in-frame deletion in the ompR gene (48Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of bacteria was diluted 1:100 and grown to mid-log phase in minimal A medium with 15% sucrose (ompC-lacZ) or without sucrose (ompF-lacZ). IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were inoculated for 2 h. Expression of mutant OmpR proteins was confirmed by a Western blot. Transcription of the ompF-lacZ and ompC-lacZ fusions was monitored by β-galactosidase assays as described previously by Miller (49Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). All β-galactosidase measurements were performed in triplicate with at least two independent cultures. OmpR Phosphorylation Assays—5 μm OmpR or mutant OmpR protein was incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2 in 100 μl. Phosphorylation was initiated by adding 15 mm of ammonium hydrogen phosphoramidate. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and stopped by addition of 20 mm EDTA. Phosphorylation of OmpR and OmpR mutant proteins was determined by separation on a C4 column using reversed phase HPLC as described (24Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). DNA Binding—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were employed for measurements of DNA binding. The 219-bp upstream region of ompF, extending from residues +71 to -148 (containing OmpR-binding sites F1, F2, and F3), was amplified by PCR using [γ- 32P]ATP-labeled OmpF051-1 and unlabeled OmpF052-1 as the primers (Table 2). For ompC, the 196-bp upstream region of ompC (+40 to -156 containing OmpR-binding sites C1, C2, and C3) was amplified by PCR using [γ-32P]ATP-labeled OmpC052 and unlabeled OmpC051 as the primers (Table 2). The labeled 219- and 196-bp DNA (∼1 × 103 cpm) fragments were incubated with various concentrations of phosphorylated mutant or wild type OmpR protein for 20 min at 30 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1× binding buffer (4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)). Following the incubation, the samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed to film.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideOligonucleotide sequence (5′ → 3′)UseSsrBCATCGATTAATCTGACTGNMRC1-half (C1b)AC (ATTTTGAAACATCTA) TNMRC1a-C1bAC (TTTACATTTT (GAAACATCTA)) TNMRC1a-C1b®AC (TTTACATTTT (TAGATGTTTC)) TNMROmpC051GCTTGATGTTAGGTGCTTATTTCGGel mobility shift assayOmpC052GCCACTGCATACTGATTAACCCTCGel mobility shift assayOmpF051-1CATCACGTCTCTATGGAAATATGGel mobility shift assayOmpF052-1CTGCCGTCAATAAGTTCTGTCGel mobility shift assayOmpR061CATATGCAAGAGAACTACAAGATTCOmpR mutant constructionOmpR062GGATCCTCATGCTTTAGAGCCGTCOmpR mutant constructionEnvZ061CCATATGGTTAAAGGCACGGGOmpR mutant construction162-1GATGCCGCTCTGTAGCGGTGAGOmpR mutant construction162-2CTCACCGCTACAGAGCGGCATCOmpR mutant construction163-1CCGCTCACCTGTGGTGAGTTTGOmpR mutant construction163-2CAAACTCACCACAGGTGAGCGGOmpR mutant construction164-1CTCACCAGCTGTGAGTTTGCGOmpR mutant construction164-2CGCAAACTCACAGCTGGTGAGOmpR mutant construction173-1GAAGGCACTGTGTAGCCATCCGOmpR mutant construction173-2CGGATGGCTACACAGTGCCTTCOmpR mutant construction176-1GTCAGCCATTGTCGTGAGCCOmpR mutant construction176-2GGCTCACGACAATGGCTGACOmpR mutant construction183-1GCTCTCCCGCTGTAAGCTGATGOmpR mutant construction183-2CATCAGCTTACAGCGGGAGAGCOmpR mutant construction184-1CTCCCGCGATTGTCTGATGAACOmpR mutant construction184-2GTTCATCAGACAATCGCGGGAGOmpR mutant construction191-1CTTGCCCGTTGTCGTGAATATTCOmpR mutant construction191-2GAATATTCACGACAACGGGCAAGOmpR mutant construction212-1GCCGCATGTGTGAAGAAGATCOmpR mutant construction212-2GATCTTCTTCACACATGCGGCOmpR mutant construction215-1GTGGAAGAATGTCCAGCGCATCOmpR mutant construction215-2GATGCGCTGGACATTCTTCCACOmpR mutant construction224-1CGCGTTACATTCAGTGTGTCTGGGGTCOmpR mutant construction224-2GACCCCAGACACACTGAATGTAACGCGOmpR mutant construction225-1GTTACATTCAGACCTGCTGGGGTCTGOmpR mutant construction225-2CAGACCCCAGCAGGTCTGAATGTAACOmpR mutant construction226-1C"
https://openalex.org/W2051930873,"Parkinson disease (PD) belongs to a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders with movement alterations, cognitive impairment, and α-synuclein accumulation in cortical and subcortical regions. Jointly, these disorders are denominated Lewy body disease. Mutations in the parkin gene are the most common cause of familial parkinsonism, and a growing number of studies have shown that stress factors associated with sporadic PD promote parkin accumulation in the insoluble fraction. α-Synuclein and parkin accumulation and mutations in these genes have been associated with familial PD. To investigate whether α-synuclein accumulation might be involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders by interfering with parkin solubility, synuclein-transfected neuronal cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing parkin. Challenging neurons with proteasome inhibitors or amyloid-β resulted in accumulation of insoluble parkin and, to a lesser extent, α-tubulin. Similarly to neurons in the brains of patients with Lewy body disease, in co-transduced cells α-synuclein and parkin colocalized and co-immunoprecipitated. These effects resulted in decreased parkin and α-tubulin ubiquitination, accumulation of insoluble parkin, and cytoskeletal alterations with reduced neurite outgrowth. Taken together, accumulation of α-synuclein might contribute to the pathogenesis of PD and other Lewy body diseases by promoting alterations in parkin and tubulin solubility, which in turn might compromise neural function by damaging the neuronal cytoskeleton. These studies provide a new perspective on the potential nature of pathogenic α-synuclein and parkin interactions in Parkinson disease.

Of these substrates, more recent studies in parkin knock-out mice have shown that p38 is the most important parkin substrate (37Ko H.S. Coelln von R. Sriram S.R. Kim S.W. Chung K.K. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J. Johnson B. Saffary R. Goh E.L. Song H. Park B.J. Kim M.J. Kim S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7968-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar); however, p38 is unlikely to be a target of parkin-mediated degradation because a previous study showed that p38 is largely mono-ubiquitinated in the presence of parkin, and poly-ubiquitinated p38 is difficult to detect (38Hampe C. Ardila-Osorio H. Fournier M. Brice A. Corti O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2059-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Based on the genetic evidence and the known role of parkin as a ubiquitin ligase, most studies have focused at investigating the role of parkin alterations and proteasomal dysfunction on α-syn accumulation in the pathogenesis of PD (28Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 39Moore D.J. West A.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Annu. Rev.

Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and stress factors might lead to the accumulation of parkin, and that translocation of parkin into the insoluble fraction might impair neuronal cell function (41Wong E.S.

Neurol. 2005; 191: S17-S27Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), then it is also possible that α-syn might interfere with parkin by promoting aggregation and accumulation in the insoluble fraction. In this context, we explored the pathological interactions between α-syn and parkin. We found that α-syn accumulation interfered with parkin and α-tubulin solubility and distribution, leading the cytoskeletal alterations and neuronal dysfunction. This study provides a new perspective about the nature of the interactions between α-syn and parkin. Tissue Culture—Briefly, as previously described (47Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Mackowski B. Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), B103 neuronal cell lines stably transfected with either human α-syn, β-syn, or empty vector (pCEP4; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used. These cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA) in the presence of 50 μg/ml Hygromycine B (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. This neuronal cell line, derived from rat neuroblastoma, was selected because α-syn overexpression results in the formation of discrete insoluble aggregates in the cell body and processes accompanied by reduced neurite outgrowth (47Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Mackowski B. Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), mimicking another important aspect of LBD, namely compromised axonal plasticity (48Masliah E. Terry R. Brain Pathol. 1993; 3: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Primary rat cortex (P0) was dissected, digested by trypsin, mechanically dissociated, and plated at 8 × 105–1 × 106 cells per dish/well under serum-free conditions in neurobasal A media supplemented with B27. Primary cultured neurons were maintained for a minimum of 14 divisions prior to co-transfection with lentiviruses expressing parkin, α-syn, or GFP. Lentivirus-mediated Transfection and Treatment with MG132—Lentiviral vectors encoding α-syn (lenti-α-syn), β-syn (lenti-β-syn), parkin (lenti-parkin, the pcDNA(+)Myc-parkin was a kind gift from Dr. N. Hattori, Department of Neurology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Japan), APP(sw), or green fluorescent protein (lenti-GFP) were prepared as previously described (49Marr R.A. Rockenstein E.

Briefly, 2.5 × 105 cells growing in 6-well plates were incubated with either lenti-α-syn, lenti-β-syn, lenti-parkin, lenti-APP(sw), lenti-GFP (1:1000 dilution of preparations of 1.5 × 107 transduction units), or vehicles alone in 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 days. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 10 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) for 20 h. The efficiency of transduction of each lentivirus was confirmed to be more than 90% by confocal microscopy. The cells were either harvested in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and used for immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min for immunocytochemistry. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin, mouse monoclonal anti-actin, and rabbit polyclonal anti-β-syn were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-α-syn was from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-parkin was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-Aβ was obtained from Signet Laboratories (Dedham, MA). Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation Analyses—Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (50Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Crews L. Bar-On P. Gage F.H. Marr R. Masliah E. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 50 mm NaF, with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) containing 1% Triton X-100. After incubation at 4 °C for 20 min, cell lysates were separated into detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Frozen tissues from the temporal cortex of six LBD and five age-matched control cases (Table 1) were analyzed for parkin accumulation in the insoluble fraction. Cases were obtained from the UCSD Alzheimer Disease Research Center. For each case, 100 μg of frozen superior temporal neocortical sample were homogenized in 3× volume buffer A and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min. 1% Triton X-100 was added to supernatants, and samples were separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Fractions were then used for immunoblotting.TABLE 1Clinical and neuropathological characteristics of control non-demented and LBD casesGroupnPMIAgeGender M/FBlessed rangeBraak stageBrain weightPlaquesTanglesControl non-demented511.5 ± 4.184 ± 2.54/10–101182 ± 562.5 ± 0.2890LBD613 ± 2.885 ± 1.33/324–33III–VI1105 ± 85.542.1 ± 528.8 ± 2.1 Open table in a new tab The detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were resolved with SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Immobilon P; Millipore, Bedford, MA) The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween-20) containing 5% skim milk, flowed by incubation with primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and analyzed with a Versadoc XL imaging apparatus (Bio-Rad). Analysis of actin levels was used as a loading control. Immunoprecipitation assays were carried out essentially as previously described (51Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were then centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm, and the protein concentrations were determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 300 μg of the supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of antibody for parkin, α-tubulin, or α-syn overnight at 4 °C, and then immunocomplexes were adsorbed to protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing extensively with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, samples were heated in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunocytochemistry and Laser-scanning Confocal Microscopy—Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips to 70% confluence, and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody for α-syn, parkin, or α-tubulin. The next day, antibodies were detected with the Tyramide Signal Amplification-Direct (Red) system (NEN Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and sections were imaged with a Zeiss 63× (N.A. 1.4) objective on an Axiovert 35 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with an attached MRC1024 laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) system (Bio-Rad) (52Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sisk Sagara A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Studies—Both control siRNA and siRNA for α-syn were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transfection of the siRNA (final concentration, 100 nm) was carried out using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for 72 h with lentivirus transfection. Cells were then lysed and used for immunoblot analysis. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—For immunoprecipitation, parkin was bound to anti-Myc IgG-linked protein G beads from extracts of 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 (+) Myc-parkin. To prepare aggregates of α-syn, recombinant α-syn was incubated in 20 μl of distilled water at 65 °C for 24 h essentially as previously described (53Uversky V.N. Lee H.J. Li J. Fink A.L. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43495-43498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in a 50-μl mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 μg of ubiquitin (Boston Biochem, Boston, MA), 100 ng of E1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 200 ng of UbcH7 (Boston Biochem, Boston, MA), immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged parkin, and 5 μg of purified α-tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc, Denver, CO) with 0.25 nmol of bovine serum albumin, 0.25 nmol of recombinant soluble or aggregated α-syn. The reactions were carried out for 2 h at 37 °C before terminating with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixtures were then analyzed by immunoblotting for ubiquitin antibody. Statistical Analyses—Analyses were carried out with the StatView 5.0 program (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Differences among means were assessed by one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc Dunnetts test. Comparisons between two groups were done with the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. All values in the figures are expressed as means ± S.E., and the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. α-Synuclein Promotes the Abnormal Accumulation of Parkin and Tubulin into the Detergent-insoluble Fraction of Neurons—To investigate the effects of α-syn on parkin accumulation and cellular distribution, stably transfected B103 neuroblastoma cells expressing α-syn-, β-syn-, or vector control were infected with a lentiviral vector expressing parkin. For this, we first analyzed the levels of α- and β-syn in the presence or absence of MG132 (Fig. 1A) because previous studies have shown that proteasomal inhibition facilitates the pathological effects of α-syn (54Wang C. Tan J.M. Ho M.W. Zaiden N. Wong S.H. Chew C.L. Eng P.W. Lim T.M. Dawson T.M. Lim K.L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis showed that both α- and β-syn levels were increased in the presence of MG132 compared with controls (Fig. 1A). To assess the effects of α-syn on parkin accumulation under conditions of cellular stress, parkin levels were determined. Western blot analysis showed that treatment with MG132 increased the levels of parkin (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, this effect was enhanced by α-syn but not by β-syn. Next, we examined whether the excess parkin might be translocated into detergent-insoluble fractions. For this, cells were lysed with Triton X-100 and separated into detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions. Immunoblotting analysis showed that in the presence of MG132, levels of parkin in the detergent-insoluble fraction were increased in α-syn-transfected cells, compared with vector- or β-syn-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). Similarly, insoluble parkin accumulated in α-syn-transfected cells when cells were treated with lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor (data not shown), or infected with a lentiviral vector expressing the AD-related mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) (Fig. 1C). Actin levels were not affected under either condition (Fig. 1C). To confirm the effects of α-syn on parkin, siRNA experiments were performed. When cells were transfected with siRNA targeting α-syn mRNA, expression levels of α-syn significantly decreased in α-syn-transfected cells both in the presence and absence of MG132 (Fig. 1D). Under these experimental conditions, immunoblotting analysis revealed that the amount of insoluble parkin was dramatically decreased by α-syn siRNA compared with control siRNA in α-syn-transfected cells, whereas insoluble parkin was not changed by α-syn siRNA in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). Recent studies have shown that parkin-mediated ubiquitination promotes degradation of target proteins such as α-tubulin (55Ren Y. Zhao J. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that, similarly to parkin, α-syn might interfere with α-tubulin clearance. Immunoblot analysis showed that in the presence of MG132, the levels of insoluble α-tubulin were considerably increased in α-syn-transfected cells even when parkin was overexpressed (Fig. 1E). We next examined whether α-syn accumulation may promote similar effects on parkin and α-tubulin in primary neurons. For this purpose, rat cortical primary neurons were co-infected with lentiviral vectors expressing parkin and α-syn. Immunoblot analysis showed that in the presence of MG132, α-syn expression promoted accumulation of insoluble parkin and, to a lesser extent, α-tubulin in the detergent-insoluble fractions compared with lenti-GFP control (Fig. 2). These effects were more pronounced in primary neurons infected with a lentiviral vector expressing familial-linked A53T mutant α-syn (Fig. 2). β-Synuclein had no effect on insoluble parkin or α-tubulin accumulation in primary neurons (not shown). Together, these results support the possibility that α-syn might promote abnormal accumulation of parkin and α-tubulin in the detergent-insoluble fraction that might affect the neuronal cytoskeleton. Parkin and α-Tubulin Are Increased in the Insoluble Fraction in the Brains of LBD—To investigate whether α-syn accumulation in patients with LBD results in similar alterations in parkin as observed in neuronal cell lines, immunoblot analysis with detergent-insoluble fractions was performed. This analysis showed that in patients with LBD, levels of parkin and α-tubulin in the detergent-insoluble fraction were significantly increased compared with unimpaired controls (Fig. 3, A–C). In the detergent-soluble fraction, no differences were detected between the two groups (Fig. 3, A–C). Double immunocytochemical analysis confirmed that compared with controls (Fig. 3, D–F), in LBD α-syn and parkin were co-localized in the neocortical LBs and neurites (but not in synapses) (Fig. 3, G–I). These results support the notion that aggregated α-syn might lead to an increase of insoluble parkin and α-tubulin in vivo. Parkin Self-ubiquitination and Ubiquitination of α-Tubulin Are Altered by α-Syn Overexpression—It has been previously shown that parkin self-ubiquitinates and that ubiquitinated parkin is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (29Kahle P.J. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 35Snyder H. Wolozin B. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 425-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36Choi P.

Therefore we reasoned that α-syn might interfere with parkin ubiquitination, resulting in reduced solubility. To examine this possibility, parkin immunoprecipitates were analyzed with an antibody against ubiquitin. This study showed that levels of ubiquitinated parkin were decreased in α-syn-transfected cells treated with MG132 compared with controls (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with previous reports (57Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S"
https://openalex.org/W2067290862,"Accurate chromosomal segregation is monitored by the mitotic checkpoint, and an increased rate of chromosomal missegregation leads to chromosomal instability (CIN). Here, we demonstrate that the HBV X protein (HBx) binds BubR1, a component of the mitotic checkpoint complex and co-localizes with BubR1 at the kinetochores. HBx binding to BubR1 attenuates the association between BubR1 and CDC20, an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and induces slippage of mitotic arrest in the presence of microtubule poisons. In addition, HBx binding to BubR1 results in the accumulation of lagging chromosomes and chromosome bridges. In contrast, a C-terminally truncated HBx mutant (HBx1–100) fails to bind BubR1 and does not cause aberrant chromosomal segregation. This provides a novel mechanism for dysregulation of the mitotic checkpoint by a viral pathogen linking it to the accumulation of chromosomal instability in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2095364760,"Background We recently described a genomic pathway approach to study complex diseases. We demonstrated that models constructed using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within axon guidance pathway genes were highly predictive of Parkinson disease (PD) susceptibility, survival free of PD, and age at onset of PD within two independent whole-genome association datasets. We also demonstrated that several axon guidance pathway genes represented by SNPs within our final models were differentially expressed in PD. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we employed our genomic pathway approach to analyze data from a whole-genome association dataset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); and demonstrated that models constructed using SNPs within axon guidance pathway genes were highly predictive of ALS susceptibility (odds ratio = 1739.73, p = 2.92×10−60), survival free of ALS (hazards ratio = 149.80, p = 1.25×10−74), and age at onset of ALS (R2 = 0.86, p = 5.96×10−66). We also extended our analyses of a whole-genome association dataset of PD, which shared 320,202 genomic SNPs in common with the whole-genome association dataset of ALS. We compared for ALS and PD the genes represented by SNPs in the final models for susceptibility, survival free of disease, and age at onset of disease and noted that 52.2%, 37.8%, and 34.9% of the genes were shared respectively. Conclusions/Significance Our findings for the axon guidance pathway and ALS have prior biological plausibility, overlap partially with PD, and may provide important insight into the causes of these and related neurodegenerative disorders."

We varied furin-mediated proteolysis by mutating the P1 site in α and/or γ subunit furin consensus cleavage sites (αmut and γmut). Our findings were as follows. (i) The β subunit alone is not transported to the cell surface nor cleaved upon assembly with the α and/or γ subunits.

Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The membrane topology of each subunit was predicted to consist of two transmembrane domains with short cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini and joined by a large extracellular loop. This prediction is strongly supported by recent crystallization of ENaC relative ASIC1. The ASIC1 structure (2Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) also makes it clear that ENaC is likely a heterotrimer (α1β1γ1), in contrast to the heterotetrameric, octameric, or nonameric stoichiometry (αβαγ) proposed previously (3Firsov D.

In the Xenopus oocyte expression system, it has been possible to quantitate the number of channel complexes expressed at the cell surface and to measure in the same oocyte the amiloride-sensitive current generated by the expression of ENaC at the membrane (6Firsov D. Gruender S. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Nova Acta Leopoldina. 1997; 302: 13-22Google Scholar, 7Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Maximal ENaC activity measured by the amiloride-sensitive inward current (INa) is observed only when the α, β, or γ subunits are co-injected in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. There is an excellent correlation between INa and the number of channel complexes expressed at the cell surface (7Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). When the α subunit is injected alone (presumably α3 trimers), only 1 or 2% of maximal activity is observed. When the α/β or α/γ subunits are co-injected (potentially forming α2β1, α1β2, α2γ1, or α1γ2), 5–15% of maximal activity is recorded. The β or γ subunit alone does not lead to any significant channel activity, whereas expression of the β/γ subunits leads to very small activity (2%) after prolonged incubation (6–7 days after injection) (8Bonny O.

These data indicated that the α subunit has an essential chaperone role, bringing the β and γ subunits to the plasma membrane, but the β and γ subunits are also essential for optimal expression of channel complexes at the cell surface. epithelial sodium channel rat ENaC amiloride-sensitive inward current modified Barth solution wild type. epithelial sodium channel rat ENaC amiloride-sensitive inward current modified Barth solution wild type. The endogenous processing of ENaC in heterologous expression systems is significant and specific for each subunit. Hughey et al. (9Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A.

However, co-expression of the αβγ ENaC subunits revealed a second band for each subunit (65 kDa for α, 110 kDa for β, and 75 kDa for γ). The smaller size of the processed α and γ subunits was consistent with proteolytic cleavage. Hughey et al. (10Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P.

They demonstrated that the α and γ ENaC subunits may be cleaved during maturation at consensus sites for furin cleavage. Using site-specific mutagenesis of the key P1 arginine in the RXXR(P1) furin sequences in α and γ, ENaC expression in furin-deficient cells, and furin-specific inhibitors, the authors proposed that ENaC cleavage correlated with channel activity (10Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

A demonstration of a direct correlation between endogenous proteolytic cleavage of surface-expressed ENaC and activation in the same expression system was not provided. Important questions remain. Does the processing occur on the exocytic and/or endocytic pathway or at the plasma membrane? What is the relative importance of α versus γ cleavage for channel activation? We recently designed an experimental protocol that allows labeling of cell surface-expressed protein (11Michlig S. Harris M. Loffing J. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38264-38270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and direct correlation of channel cleavage and amiloride-sensitive ENaC-mediated sodium transport (12Harris M. Firsov D. Vuagniaux G. Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 58-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, because both the α and γ subunits undergo endogenous proteolysis, leading to a specific pattern for each subunit expressed at the cell surface, it is not clear whether α and/or γ processing was required for channel activity under base-line conditions. We reasoned that if cleavage of the α and/or γ ENaC subunits takes place at the plasma membrane, causing channel activation, there should be a precursor-product relationship between the pool of full-length uncleaved channel (precursor associated with little or no ENaC activity) and the pool of cleaved channel (product associated with increased ENaC activity). We co-injected the α, β, and γ subunits in all combinations and measured INa and the size of channel subunits expressed at the cell surface (biotinylated proteins) or in the intracellular pool (non-biotinylated proteins) to establish a direct correlation between cell surface expression of cleaved subunit and sodium transport. Using the α and/or γ ENaC subunits with furin cleavage site mutations, we provide evidence that ENaC activation during preferential assembly requires furin-dependent and furin-independent processing. cRNAs—Complementary RNAs of rat αβγ ENaC subunits were synthesized in vitro using SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase. C terminally V5 epitope-tagged α, β, and γ ENaC subunits were created by PCR amplification. For each subunit, two primers were synthesized. The forward primer contains the SpeI site and the start codon of the ENaC gene; the reverse primer contains the I site, the coding sequence for V5, and the C-terminal sequence of the ENaC gene. PCR products were purified and cloned into the SpeI/NotI sites of vector pSDE. Furin mutants were engineered as described by Hughey et al. (10Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using C terminally V5 epitope-tagged α or γ subunits. In the present study we used the αR205A/R231A mutant (αmut) and γR138A (γmut). Antibodies—Monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was obtained from Invitrogen and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The actin antibody was from Sigma. Expression of ENaC cRNA in Xenopus Oocytes—The cRNAs were injected into Xenopus oocytes (3.3 ng of each subunit) and kept in modified Barth solution (MBS) containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2). Electrophysiological measurements and cell surface biotinylation were performed 24 h after injection. INa was recorded using a two-electrode voltage clamp and was defined as the difference between Na+ currents obtained in the presence and absence of amiloride (5 μm). Biotinylation of ENaC Subunits on the Cell Surface—Biotinylation was performed in 40-well plates using 50 oocytes/experimental condition as described (11Michlig S. Harris M. Loffing J. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38264-38270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Harris M. Firsov D. Vuagniaux G. Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 58-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All biotinylation steps were performed at 4 °C. After incubation in MBS for 30 min at 4 °C, the oocytes were washed three times with MBS. After the last wash, the MBS was removed and replaced by a biotinylation buffer containing 10 mm triethanolamine, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) (pH 9.5). The incubation lasted 15 min with gentle agitation. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by washing the oocytes two times with quench buffer containing 192 mm glycine and 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) added to MBS. After the second wash, oocytes were incubated for 5 min in the quench buffer with gentle agitation. Oocytes were then washed two times with MBS and lysed by repeated pipetting with Pasteur pipettes in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, and 5 mg/ml each leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin (20 μl/oocyte). The lysates were vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged for 10 min at ∼5,000 × g. Supernatants were transferred to new 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μl of ImmunoPure-immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) washed with lysis buffer. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with agitation, the tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at ∼5,000 × g. The supernatant (non-biotinylated pool) was removed, and the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. 35 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads. All samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C before being loaded on 8–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Cell surface labeling was restricted to plasma membrane proteins, as shown by the absence of any significant amount of actin in this fraction. Essentially, the non-biotinylated protein pool represents proteins expressed intracellularly (i.e. the intracellular pool of membrane- and non-membrane-associated proteins) and is characterized by a large amount of actin. In some experiments, the non-biotinylated protein pool was spun down at 20,000 × g for 20 min to get a crude postcytoplasmic membrane fraction (the non-biotinylated membrane-enriched pool). Statistical Analysis—All data are represented as means, and error bars indicate S.E. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and was followed by Bonferroni's post-test when appropriate. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The number of independent experimental repetitions is represented by n. α Subunit—After a 24-h incubation (Fig. 1A), a subunit alone (lane 1) did not generate a significant amiloride-sensitive current. Co-expression of α with β (Fig. 1A, lane 2) or γ (lane 3) increased INa with respect to α-injected (lane 1) or non-injected (lane 13) oocytes, representing ∼15% of maximal activity observed when the αβγ subunits were co-injected (lane 4). A full-length uncleaved 95-kDa α subunit band was predominantly observed at the cell surface (Fig. 1B) of α (lane 1)-, αβ (lane 2)-, αγ (lane 3)-, and αβγ (lane 4)-injected oocytes. The predominant cleavage product was a 65-kDa band, although other bands (80 kDa and smaller) were observed but in small and variable proportions upon long film exposure (data not shown). In the non-biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 1C), the 95-kDa band was predominantly observed (lanes 1–4). Membrane enrichment of the non-biotinylated protein pool revealed the α subunits to be in the full-length 95-kDa form (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–4). αmut Subunit—The 65-kDa fragment has been observed in vivo and in vitro and proposed to be due to furin-mediated proteolysis. To test the possible physiological role of the expression of the putative furin 65-kDa fragment at the cell surface, we directly compared the effect of αmut on INa and on the pattern of a cleaved α fragment at the cell surface. After 24 h of incubation, the αmut subunit alone (Fig. 1, B–D, lane 5) did not generate a significant amiloride-sensitive current. Co-expression of αmut with β (lane 6) or γ (lane 7) increased INa with respect to non-injected oocytes (lane 13) at levels significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that observed in WT αβ (lane 2 versus lane 6) and equal to that in αγ complexes (lane 3 versus lane 7). Co-expression of αmut with β and γ (lane 8) resulted in a 60% reduction (p < 0.01) in INa. Co-expression of αmut with β and γmut (lane 12) resulted in a similar 60% reduction (p < 0.05) in INa. Mutation of the furin cleavage sites in the α subunit eliminated the appearance of the 65-kDa cleavage product at the cell surface (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–12). Quantitation of six independent α assembly experiments is shown in Fig. 2. Upon preferential assembly of αβγ complexes, there was no significant change in the biotinylated pool, non-biotinylated protein pool, or membrane-enriched protein pool of the full-length 95-kDa α subunit (Fig. 2, A–C, lanes 1–4), but there was a small but insignificant increase in the amount of cleaved 65-kDa fragments in the biotinylated pool (panels A–C, lanes 5–8). There was no detectable 65-kDa band in the non-biotinylated pool or in the membrane-enriched protein pool (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 1–8). The non-biotinylated membrane-enriched pool showed a progressive but non-significant decrease in the full-length α subunit (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4). Mutation of the furin cleavage sites in the α subunit alone did not change the quantity of the 95-kDa bands in the biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 2A, lanes 9–12), the non-biotinylated pool (panel B, lanes 9–12), or the non-biotinylated membrane-enriched pool (panel C, lanes 9–12). This mutation also eliminated the 65-kDa band in the biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–16), the non-biotinylated pool (panel B, lanes 13–16), and the non-biotinylated membrane-enriched pool (panel C, lanes 13–16). αmut and γmut Subunits—Mutation of the furin sites in both the α and γ subunits decreased the amount of 95-kDa bands in αmutγmut- and αmutβγmut-injected oocytes in the biotinylated pool (p < 0.01 and 0.001, respectively; Fig. 2A, lanes 19 and 20), the αmutβγmut-injected oocytes in the non-biotinylated pool (p < 0.05; panel B, lane 20), and the αmutβγmut-injected oocytes in the non-biotinylated membrane-enriched pool (p < 0.001; panel C, lane 20). The 65-kDa band was also eliminated in the biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 2A, lanes 21–24), the non-biotinylated pool (panel B, lanes 21–24), and the non-biotinylated membrane-enriched pool (panel C, lanes 21–24). Collectively, the data indicate that the furin consensus site on the α subunit is required for ENaC activation upon assembly into αβγ complexes, but 40% of INa is not accounted for by this mechanism. Interestingly, the activation observed when α is assembled into the αβ heterodimer is not inhibited but rather enhanced, suggesting that the β subunit may also play a distinct furin-independent role in ENaC activation. β Subunit—After a 24-h incubation (Fig. 3A), the β subunit alone (lane 1) or βγ subunits together (lane 3) did not generate a significant current, whereas αβ (lane 2) or αβγ (lane 4) significantly increased INa with respect to β-injected (lane 1) or non-injected (lane 5) oocytes. At the cell surface (Fig. 3B), a single molecular mass species (105 kDa) of the β subunit was detected in αβγ-injected oocytes (lane 4) and in small proportions in αβ-injected oocytes with no evidence of cleavage or processing. In the non-biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 3C), a single molecular mass species (105 kDa) of the β subunit was detected in all conditions (lanes 1–4) with no evidence of cleavage or processing. We conclude that the β subunit cannot traffic to the plasma membrane unless accompanied by the α subunit. Quantitation is shown in Fig. 4. The amount of β subunits detected at the cell surface in β-, αβ-, or βγ-injected oocytes was small and not significantly different from background (non-injected oocytes), whereas the amount of β subunits detected in αβγ-injected oocytes was significant compared with controls. There were no significant differences in the amount of β subunits detected in the non-biotinylated protein (intracellular) pool.FIGURE 4Densitometry of β rENaC cell surface expression when assembled with α rENaC and/or γ rENaC. Western blots of biotinylated and non-biotinylated protein in Xenopus oocytes injected with V5-tagged β rENaC alone and with α rENaC and/or γ rENaC were subjected to densitometric analysis (n = 3). Oocytes injected with αβγ rENaC had significantly more 105-kDa bands at the cell surface than β, αβ, and βγ rENaC-injected oocytes (p < 0.001). No significant difference was detected between the experimental groups in the 105-kDa band in the non-biotinylated protein pool.

At the cell surface (Fig. 5B), a 76-kDa γ subunit species was predominantly observed in αβγ-injected oocytes (lane 4). In the non-biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 5C), the 87-kDa full-length species was predominantly observed (lanes 1–4) with very little, if any, evidence of the 76-kDa species. However, this 76-kDa fragment was readily detected in the non-biotinylated membrane-enriched pool in all injection conditions along with the 87-kDa band (Fig. 5D, lanes 1–4). After a 24-h incubation (Fig. 5A), the γmut subunit expressed alone (lane 5) or γmut co-expressed with β (lane 7) did not generate any significant amiloride-sensitive current, whereas γmut co-expressed with α (lane 6) yielded around 5% of maximal activity observed when the αβγmut subunits were co-injected (lane 8). Importantly, the level of activity was identical to that of wild type channels (Fig. 5A, lane 4 versus lane 8). At the cell surface (Fig. 5B), only the full-length 87-kDa species was observed, whereas the 76-kDa γ subunit species was conspicuously absent in αβγmut-injected oocytes, indicating that the furin consensus site was no longer used by endogenous furin or furin-like proteases. In the non-biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 5C), only the 87-kDa full-length species was observed (lanes 5–8), with no evidence of the 76-kDa species even after long-term exposure (data not shown). In the non-biotinylated membrane-enriched protein pool (Fig. 5D), there was no evidence of the 76-kDa fragment, a fragment that was clearly identified in wild type channel complexes (lanes 1–4 versus lanes 5–8). Quantitation of six independent γ assembly experiments is shown in Fig. 6. Upon preferential assembly of αβγ complexes, there was a large variation in cell surface expression of the full-length 87-kDa γ subunit (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–4). There was a >10-fold increase (p < 0.001) in the expression of the cleaved 76-kDa species in fully assembled αβγ channels (Fig. 6A, lane 8) compared with αγ (lane 6) or βγ (lane 7) complexes. This increase correlated with a 4-fold decrease (p < 0.05) of the 87-kDa species in the non-biotinylated total protein pool (Fig. 6B), but not in the non-biotinylated membrane pool (panel C). There was a correlation between γ cleavage and INa, suggesting a causal relationship. To test this hypothesis, we performed experiments with γmut. γmut Subunit—If cleavage of γ by furin is essential for channel activation, it is expected that prevention of furin-specific cleavage should prevent ENaC activation. Upon preferential assembly of αβγmut complexes (Fig. 6A, lane 12), there was a 3-fold decrease (p < 0.05) in cell surface expression of the full-length 87-kDa γ subunit compared with αβγ-injected oocytes (lane 4). Despite this relative decrease in cell surface expression, INa was identical to that of wild type channels (Fig. 5A, lane 4 versus lane 8), indicating that activation can occur independently of furin-dependent γ cleavage. There was a significant decrease of the 87-kDa species in the non-biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 5B, lanes 9–12). The non-biotinylated membrane pool (Fig. 5C) was less depleted compared with controls (lanes 9–11 versus lanes 1–3). By contrast, a very significant 90% decrease of the 87-kDa species was observed in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5C, lane 12 versus lane 4) These data suggest that the γ furin site mutation may interfere with protein synthesis and/or degradation. Despite that effect, ENaC activity measured as INa remained unchanged. We conclude that there is no causal relationship between γ cleavage and ENaC activation upon preferential assembly. Furin-dependent and Furin-independent Mechanisms—The main findings of this study are 2-fold. First, assembly of the α, β, and γ ENaC subunits as functional (conducting) αβγ, αβ, and αγ heteromeric complexes greatly promotes surface expression of cleaved products of both the α and γ subunits. The endogenous proteases that cleave the α and γ subunits are not known with certainty. However, the leading candidates for major players are furin or furin-like enzymes. When the consensus sites for furin cleavage identified by Hughey et al. (10Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) were mutated, the 65-kDa α fragment and the 76-kDa γ fragment were no longer detected. Second, we discovered that specific elimination of furin-mediated cleavage had a range of effects on ENaC at the cell surface. Furin-mediated cleavage of the α subunit affected basal INa, whereas cleavage of the γ subunit affected overall expression levels. Although these observations are descriptive, we feel that they offer mechanistic insights into the roles of proteolysis in ENaC function. Role of the 65-kDa α Fragment—Upon assembly of α into αβγ complexes, both the INa and intensity of the 65-kDa fragment increased (Figs. 1 and 2). When the α furin sites were mutated, the 65-kDa fragment disappeared, and base-line INa was reduced by 60% (p < 0.01). The cellular location where cleavage occurs was not identified by the present data, but it is clear that cleavage is promoted by channel assembly. The furin gene family encodes proprotein convertases that are expressed in various cellular compartments of the exocytic pathway. These proconvertases can activate their substrates in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, as well as at the plasma membrane. The anthrax toxin receptor is a well described example of furin-mediated cleavage at the cell surface (see review in Ref. 13Abrami L. Reig N. van der Goot F.G. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 72-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We readily detected the 65-kDa fragment in the biotinylated pool, but not in the non-biotinylated pool, even when enriched for membrane proteins. In our work and as broadly recognized in other studies, only a small percentage of total ENaC is typically present at the cell surface. Thus, the α subunit is cleaved by an active enzyme at the plasma membrane or in a rapid turning-over membrane pool very near the plasma membrane. Kinetic experiments are needed to answer this question. The disappearance of the 65-kDa fragment and decreased INa with αmut suggest a causal relationship between α cleavage and partial ENaC activation. Interestingly, αmut did not inhibit ENaC activation upon assembly of heteromeric αmutβ complexes but, if anything, enhanced INa above WT αβ, reaching 50% of αβγ maximal activation. We propose that the β subunit (which does not undergo any proteolytic cleavage) plays a significant role in ENaC activation and may contribute to furin-independent activation of ENaC. Moreover, these data further indicate that significant INa is possible in complexes containing the α subunit with furin sites disabled. Role of the 76-kDa γ Fragment—We show here that the 76-kDa γ fragment is observed at the cell surface upon αβγ assembly. This observation parallels that of the 65-kDa α furin fragment and may relate to the co-chaperone effects that the ENaC subunits exert upon each other (discussed below). However, our results do indicate differences between the behaviors of the 76-kDa γ and 65-kDa α fragments that may reflect the complexity of interplay between the α, β, and γ subunits. For example, in contrast to the α fragment, the γ fragment was readily detected in the non-biotinylated membrane-enriched fraction (compare Figs. 1 and 5). Although this observation does not provide a specific interpretation, it does suggest that the α and γ ENaC subunits are processed differently. In a further contrast between furin-mediated cleavage of α and γ, the 76-kDa γ fragment was not required for full ENaC activation (Figs. 5 and 6). Although this result is somewhat at variance with Hughey et al. (10Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), who reported a significant (nearly 40%) inhibition of INa, both studies agree that furin-mediated cleavage of the γ subunit is less significant for basal INa than is furin-specific cleavage of α. The reason for the apparent discrepancy is not clear, but our experimental protocol differs notably from theirs. In their experiments, a direct correlation between the cleaved subunit and activation at the membrane was not studied because the 76-kDa γ fragment was identified by Western blotting of the total cell lysate and was not quantified. Our semi-quantitative approach permits the quantitation of relative changes that occur upon preferential assembly and correlation with INa. Importantly, we can correlate INa with the only biochemical pool relevant to function, i.e. the biotinylated surface-expressed pool. This approach demonstrated that although γmut did not reduce INa, there was a marked decrease in full-length subunits at the surface. Interestingly, mutation of the furin sites in the α subunit had no such effect on surface expression. Thus, we speculate that the furin site in γ ENaC plays an important, but not yet understood, role in overall ENaC biosynthesis and/or stability. In summary, we propose that ENaC activation upon assembly from homomer to heteromultimer complexes involves furin-dependent and furin-independent mechanisms in a complex interplay of interactions between the α, β, and γ subunits. The relationship of γ cleavage to heteromeric complexes remains unclear. It is tempting to speculate that cleavage at the furin site is a necessary first step to set the channel in a conformation sensitive for a second cleavage either by other endogenous proteases (CAP1/prostasin, CAP2, and CAP3) or by exogenous serine proteases, such as trypsin and elastase. This second-hit hypothesis is supported by recent experimental evidence of such a mechanism (12Harris M. Firsov D. Vuagniaux G. Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 58-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Bruns J.B. Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Maarouf A.B. Weisz O.A. Pilewski J.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6153-6160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Physiological Relevance—Our observations highlight several significant issues regarding proteolytic regulation of ENaC. First, our study further defines and emphasizes the distinct and non-equivalent roles of individual subunits that have been previously noted, even from the initial cloning studies. Each subunit clearly undergoes a different extent of furin-mediated proteolysis, and the differences we observed in subcellular location of the 65-kDa α and 76-kDa γ fragments suggest that proteolysis at the “furin” sites may occur in different compartments. In addition, the participation of cleaved subunits in heteromeric complexes is already felt to influence critical channel characteristics, such as open probability, but other characteristics, such as dwell time at the cell surface, could be influenced. Second, we observed robust residual current of mutant channels that cannot be efficiently cleaved by furin or furin family members that share the same canonical RXXR cleavage sites. Our data do not allow us to choose among several interesting interpretations for this observation. For example, our data are formally consistent with the idea that cleavage by furin or furin-like enzymes is not required for channel activity. As the P1 arginine is a stringent requirement for furin and furin family members, this may turn out to be narrowly true. However, it is also likely that other proteases can act on ENaC subunits at other residues within the furin sequence or at nearby residues. More detailed mutagenesis and single channel studies may address these possibilities. What is the in vivo physiological relevance of our findings? The cleavage of the γ subunit was first observed in vivo by Masilamani et al. (15Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: R19-R23Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In their study, long-term salt deprivation of rats caused a 60-fold increase in plasma aldosterone and a shift in molecular mass of the γ ENaC subunit in the kidney that was consistent with a physiological proteolytic clipping of the extracellular loop. This finding was confirmed using a 15-h salt deprivation, causing a 2-fold increase in plasma aldosterone. Recently Ergonul et al. (16Ergonul Z. Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F683-F693Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were able to quantitate this effect under experimental maneuvers (sodium deprivation, potassium loading, aldosterone infusion, and resalination) that induce a large physiological range of plasma aldosterone concentrations. The authors concluded that changes in the processing and maturation of the channel involving the α and γ subunits occur rapidly enough to be involved in the daily regulation of ENaC activity and sodium reabsorption by the kidney (17Frindt G. McNair T. Dahlmann A. Jacobs-Palmer E. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F717-F726Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Of interest, the processing of the γ subunit measured in the total protein pool of kidney cortex in vivo is consistent with the changes we observed here upon channel assembly in vitro. It is known that in vivo aldosterone promotes rapid assembly and translocation of channel subunits from an intracellular vesicular pool to the apical pole and apical membrane of the connecting tubule and early collecting duct (18Loffing J. Zecevic M. Feraille E. Kaissling B. Asher C. Rossier B.C. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F675-F682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased transcription/translation of the α subunit would rapidly favor its assembly with a pool of preformed β and γ subunits and promote their translocation to the apical pole or apical membrane of the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron, which is composed of the late distal convoluted tubule, the connecting tubule, and the collecting duct. The critical role of the α subunit in this process is underscored by the lack of channel translocation in the collecting duct and by the normal translocation in the connecting tubule of mice genetically engineered to lack the α subunit of ENaC in the collecting duct but with ENaC expression in the connecting tubule left intact (19Rubera I. Loffing J. Palmer L.G. Frindt G. Fowler-Jaeger N. Sauter D. Carroll T. McMahon A. Hummler E. Rossier B.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Obviously, it will be technically challenging to identify the molecular species expressed in vivo in the apical membrane of aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron cells. We thank Nicole Fowler Jaeger for technical help."

https://openalex.org/W1979708251,"The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a popular genetic model organism with powerful experimental tools. The thiamine-regulatable nmt1 promoter and derivatives, which take >15 hours for full induction, are most commonly used for controlled expression of ectopic genes. Given the short cell cycle of fission yeast, however, a promoter system that can be rapidly regulated, similar to the GAL system for budding yeast, would provide a key advantage for many experiments.We used S. pombe microarrays to identify three neighbouring genes (urg1, urg2, and urg3) whose transcript levels rapidly and strongly increased in response to uracil, a condition which otherwise had little effect on global gene expression. We cloned the promoter of urg1 (uracil-regulatable gene) to create several PCR-based gene targeting modules for replacing native promoters with the urg1 promoter (Purg1) in the normal chromosomal locations of genes of interest. The kanMX6 and natMX6 markers allow selection under urg1 induced and repressed conditions, respectively. Some modules also allow N-terminal tagging of gene products placed under urg1 control. Using pom1 as a proof-of-principle, we observed a maximal increase of Purg1-pom1 transcripts after uracil addition within less than 30 minutes, and a similarly rapid decrease after uracil removal. The induced and repressed transcriptional states remained stable over 24-hour periods. RT-PCR comparisons showed that both induced and repressed Purg1-pom1 transcript levels were lower than corresponding P3nmt1-pom1 levels (wild-type nmt1 promoter) but higher than P81nmt1-pom1 levels (weak nmt1 derivative).We exploited the urg1 promoter system to rapidly induce pom1 expression at defined cell-cycle stages, showing that ectopic pom1 expression leads to cell branching in G2-phase but much less so in G1-phase. The high temporal resolution provided by the urg1 promoter should facilitate experimental design and improve the genetic toolbox for the fission yeast community."
https://openalex.org/W2064641233,"The interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP/IRF8) is an interferon regulatory factor that is expressed in myeloid and B-cells. ICSBP-deficient mice develop a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by cytokine hypersensitivity and apoptosis resistance. To identify ICSBP target genes involved in these effects, we screened a CpG island microarray with chromatin that co-immunoprecipitated with ICSBP from myeloid cells. Using this technique, we identified PTPN13 as an ICSBP target gene. PTPN13 encodes Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap-1), a ubiquitously expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase. This was of interest because interaction of Fap-1 with Fas results in Fas dephosphorylation and inhibition of Fas-induced apoptosis. In this study, we found that ICSBP influenced Fas-induced apoptosis in a Fap-1-dependent manner. We also found that ICSBP interacted with a cis element in the proximal PTPN13 promoter and repressed transcription. This interaction increased during myeloid differentiation and was regulated by phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in the interferon regulatory factor domain of ICSBP. ICSBP deficiency was present in human myeloid malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia. Therefore, these studies identified a mechanism for increased survival of mature myeloid cells in the ICSBP-deficient murine model and in human myeloid malignancies with decreased ICSBP expression.

ICSBP was cloned by homology to interferon regulatory factors 1 and 2 (IRF1 and IRF2) (1Nelson N. Marks M.S. Driggers P.H. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, unlike these ubiquitous proteins, ICSBP is expressed exclusively in myeloid and B-cells. Similar to other IRF proteins, ICSBP interacts with cis elements containing ISRE, PRDI, or composite ets/IRF consensus sequences (2Tamura T. Thaotkura P. Tanaka T.S. Ko M.S.H. Ozato K. Blood. 2005; 106: 1938-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ICSBP either activates or represses target gene transcription, depending upon the sequence of the cis element and the cellular context (3Sharf R. Meraro D. Azriel A. Thornton A.M. Ozato K.

The first identified ICSBP target genes encoded proteins involved in the inflammatory response. For example, ICSBP activates transcription of genes encoding the NADPH oxidase proteins gp91PHOX and p67PHOX, the Toll-like receptor 4, IL18, and IL12 in differentiating myeloid cells (4Eklund E.A.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 2000-2007PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation involves binding of ICSBP to the cis elements of these genes via DNA-bound PU.1 and/or another IRF. This interaction requires phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in the IRF domain of ICSBP (9Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because ICSBP is tyrosine-phosphorylated during myelopoiesis, this provides a mechanism for differentiation stage-specific transcription of such genes (9Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ICSBP also represses transcription of the gene encoding 3′,5′-oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) during macrophage differentiation (11Kuwata T. Gongora C. Kanno Y. Sakaguchi K. Tamura T. Kanno T. Basrur V. Martinex R. Appella E. Golub T. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7439-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, ICSBP may down-regulate some phagocyte functions during differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, a process necessary to prevent tissue damage. To better understand the role of ICSBP in myelopoiesis, an ICSBP-deficient murine model was generated (12Holtchke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K.P.

These mice exhibit specific defects in immune function as anticipated. In addition, 100% of homozygous ICSBP knock-out mice develop a myeloproliferative disorder. This MPD is characterized by leukocytosis with mature appearing neutrophils that accumulate in the bone marrow and tissues (12Holtchke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) develops in 80% of ICSBP-/- mice by 6 months (12Holtchke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K.P. Gabriele L. Waring J.F. Bachmann M.F.

Further studies indicate that myeloid cells from ICSBP-/- mice are resistant to apoptosis and hypersensitive to various cytokines, including GM-CSF, M-CSF, and stem cell factor (13Scheller M.

These results imply the existence of a set of ICSBP target genes that regulate proliferation and apoptosis. ICSBP expression was also investigated in human myeloid malignancies. A decrease in ICSBP mRNA is found in bone marrow cells from subjects with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in comparison with normal (15Schmidt M. Nagel S. Proba J. Thiede C. Ritter M. Waring J.F.

Blood. 2001; 97: 3648-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ICSBP-expression is also decreased in CD34+ bone marrow cells from a poor prognosis subset of subjects with therapy-related myelodysplasia and AML (17Qian Z. Fernald A.A. Godley L.A. Larson R.A. Le Beau M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14925-14930Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To identify target genes involved in the leukemia-suppressor function of ICSBP, we screened a CpG island microarray with chromatin that co-immunoprecipitated with ICSBP from myeloid cells (14Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50874-50885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As reported previously, we identified the gene encoding neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) as an ICSBP target (10Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol.

Because Nf1 is a Ras-GAP, these results provide a mechanism for cytokine hypersensitivity in ICSBP-deficient cells. In this study, we identified PTPN13 as an ICSBP target gene. PTPN13 encodes Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (Fap-1), a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that antagonizes Fas-induced apoptosis (19Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 20Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Abe T. Druck T. Ohta M. Huebner K. Yanagisawa J. Reed J.C. Sato T. Genomics. 1996; 31: 240-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because Fas is important for apoptosis of mature phagocytic cells, this result had potential significance for ICSBP-deficient myelopoiesis (21Gabriele L. Phung J. Fukumoto J. Segal D. Wang I.M. Giannakakou P. Geise N.A. Ozato K. Morse H.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that Fap-1 inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis by dephosphorylating Fas and by inhibiting cell membrane trafficking (22Ivanov V.N. Bergami P.L. Maulit G. Sato T.A. Sasson D. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3623-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). If ICSBP represses PTPN13 transcription, Fap-1 expression would increase in ICSBP-deficient cells. The resultant Fas resistance might provide a mechanism for accumulation of phagocytes in the ICSBP-deficient murine model and in human diseases such as CML. Fas resistance correlates with increased Fap-1 expression in some leukemia cell lines (23Komada Y. Inaba H. Zhou Y.W. Zhang X.L. Tanaka S. Azuma E. Sakurai M. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fas expression and/or function is associated with treatment resistance and prognosis in AML (24Otten H.G. van Ginkel W.G. Hagenbeek A. Petersen E.J. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2004; 18: 1401-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Also, Fas resistance may result in persistence of malignant clones during treatment of CML (25Michor F. Hughes T.P. Iwasa Y. Branford S. Shah N.P. Sawyers C.L. Nowak M.A. Nature. 2005; 435: 1267-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of PTPN13 as an ICSBP target gene would have implications for understanding the phenotype of ICSBP-deficient myeloid malignancies and might suggest therapeutic approaches to such diseases. Protein Expression Vectors—The ICSBP cDNA was obtained from Dr. Ben Zion-Levi (Technion, Haifa, Israel); the full-length cDNA was generated by PCR and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA and the pMSCVpuro retroviral vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (14Zhu C.

A mutant form of ICSBP with conserved IRF domain tyrosine residues changed to phenylalanine has been described previously (Y92F/Y95F ICSBP) (9Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). shRNA Expression Vectors—ICSBP-specific shRNA and scrambled control sequences were designed with the assistance of the Promega website. Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the complementary sequences separated by a hairpin loop were subcloned into the pLKO.1puro vector (a gift from Dr. Kathy Rundell, Northwestern University, Chicago). Several sequences were tested, and the most efficient for ICSBP suppression (and scrambled negative control) was used in the experiments. PTPN13 Reporter Constructs—Various fragments of the PTPN13 5′ flank were obtained from U937 chromatin by genomic PCR. The fragments were sequenced on both strands to ensure identity with the published sequence and subcloned into the pCATE reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by MWG Biotec (Piedmont, NC). Double-stranded oligonucleotides used in EMSA and/or DNA affinity purification experiments represented the -587- to -627-bp sequence of the PTPN13 promoter (5′-CTCCCGGAGTCTGTTTCTAATTTCTGCAAATGATTGTGG-3′, the ISRE-like sequence is underlined), an ISRE consensus sequence (5′-GGATCCAGAAAGCGAAAGTGGTCTGTAAATCCCTCGAG-3′), a mutant form of the PRDI consensus that does not bind ICSBP (5′-TGTCTTTGTCTTTGTCTT-3′), and an irrelevant oligonucleotide with a CCAAT box from the β-globin gene (5′-CCTGGTAAGGGCCAATCTGCTCAC-3′). Oligonucleotides used to amplify PTPN13 sequences by quantitative real time PCR were -627 to -613 (5′-CTCCCGGAGTCTG-3′) and -602 to -587 (5′-TGCAAATGATTGTGG-3′). The human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line U937 (26Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Andrew Kraft (Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). The human myeloblastic cell line KG1 was obtained from Dr. Leon Platanias (Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago). Cells were maintained as described (14Zhu C.

U937 or KG1 cells were treated for 48 h with 500 units per ml of human recombinant IFNγ for differentiation (Roche Applied Science). Animal studies were performed according to a protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of North-western University and Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were obtained from the femurs of WT or ICSBP-/- C57/BL6 mice. Sca1+ cells were separated using the Miltenyi magnetic bead system (Miltenyi Biotechnology, Auburn, CA). Bi-potential myeloid progenitor cells were cultured (at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells per ml) for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ng/ml murine GM-CSF (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and 10 ng/ml murine recombinant IL3 (R & D Systems). Some ICSBP-/- myeloid progenitors were transduced with a retroviral vector to express ICSBP or Y92F/Y95F ICSBP or empty vector control, as described (10Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were either maintained in GM-CSF + IL3 for 48 h, or were differentiated over 72 h in 10 ng/ml of G-CSF (granulocyte) or 10 ng/ml of murine M-CSF (monocyte) ± 500 units/ml of murine IFNγ for the last 24 h. U937 cells were cultured with or without IFNγ for 48 h (14Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50874-50885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated briefly in media supplemented with formaldehyde, and cell lysates were sonicated to generate chromatin fragments with an average size of 2.0 kb (27Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with either ICSBP antiserum or preimmune serum (10Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Antibody to ICSBP (and control preimmune serum) was a kind gift of Dr. Stephanie Vogel (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD). Chromatin was PCR-amplified, as described (27Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several batches of immunoprecipitated, amplified chromatin were combined for each experiment. Aliquots of ICSBP-specific and preimmune serum control precipitated and amplified chromatin were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 by the random primer method (with dye swapping to control for differences in incorporation efficiency). Labeled DNA was used to probe a CpG island microarray, as described (27Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Microarrays were obtained from the Microarray Center, University Health Network (Ontario Cancer Institute, Ontario, Canada). “Spots” with 3-fold enhancement in ICSBP specific versus control serum precipitated chromatin in three independent hybridization experiments were further considered. Arrays were scanned using an Agilent microarray scanner (G2565BA, Wilmington, DE), and feature intensity statistics were extracted using GenePix (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). The GenBank™ accession number from the array was used to search the NCBI human genome data base for adjacent genes. Some co-precipitated chromatin was analyzed by PCR for co-precipitation of the PTPN13 gene. For these experiments, total input chromatin (not precipitated) was a positive control, and chromatin precipitated by preimmune serum was a negative control. PCR products were analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis or real time PCR. For Determining mRNA Expression—RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and tested for integrity by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Primers were designed with Applied Biosystems software, and real time PCR was performed using SYBR green according to the “standard curve” method. Result were normalized to 18 S. For Quantifying Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin which co-precipitated with ICSBP antibody or preimmune serum was amplified with primers flanking the ICSBP-binding cis element in the PTPN13 promoter (-669 to -646, 5′-GTCGTGCTTGCACAGCTCCGCTCT-3′, and -512 to -489, 5′-ACCTTGCATCAGACAGTGTCTCTC-3′). Results were normalized to PCRs with total nonprecipitated chromatin to control for differences in DNA abundance between samples. Stable Transfectant Cell Lines—KG1 cells were transfected by electroporation with equal amounts of an ICSBP expression vector or empty vector control (ICSBP/pcDNAamp or pcDNAamp) plus a vector with a neomycin phosphotransferase cassette (pSRα) (30 μg each). Stable pools of cells were selected in G418 (0.5 mg/ml), and aliquots of cells were tested for ICSBP expression by Western blot. Other KG1 cells were transfected by electroporation with a construct to express an ICSBP-specific shRNA or scrambled control shRNA using the pLKO.1puro vector. Stable pools of transfected cells were selected in puromycin (1.2 μg/ml) and tested for ICSBP expression by Western blot. Transient Transfections for Reporter Gene Assays—U937 cells (32 × 106/ml) were transfected with a vector to express ICSBP or vector control (50 μg) and reporter constructs with 2.0 kb, 1.3 kb, 670 bp, or 500 bp of PTPN13 3′ flank in the pCATE reporter vector or empty vector control (70 μg). Cells were co-transfected with CMV/β-gal reporter to control for transfection efficiency. Transfectants were assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase expression after 48 h, as described (10Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50874-50885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Apoptosis assays were performed using annexin V/propidium iodide double staining. The cells were washed with culture medium and adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, incubated with annexin-V/fluorescein isothiocyanate solution (2.5 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (12.5 μg/ml) on ice for 15 min, and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). U937 and KG1 Cells—Cells were cultured for 48 h with or without IFNγ (500 units/ml). Cells were incubated with Fas-agonist antibody CH11 or control, as described (28Garrone P. Neidhardt E.M. Garcia E. Galibert L. van Kooten C. Banchereau J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were incubated for the last 12 h with SLV peptide (or control VLS peptide) to disrupt Fas-Fap-1 interaction (29Yanagisawa J. Takahashi M. Kanki H. Yano-Yanagisawa H.

Murine Bone Marrow Myeloid Cells—Murine bone marrow myeloid progenitors from WT or ICSBP-/- cells were incubated in GM-CSF or differentiated with M-CSF or G-CSF as described above ±500 units/ml of IFNγ for the last 24 h. Cells were incubated with Fas-agonist antibody, as above. In some experiments, Fas antibody-treated cells were incubated with SLV peptide or VLS peptide. Western Blots of Lysates Proteins—U937, KG1, or murine bone marrow cells were lysed by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer. Lysate proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were serially probed with antibodies to ICSBP and GAPDH or tubulin (to control for loading). Each experiment was repeated at least three times with different batches of lysate proteins. A representative blot is shown. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—Lysate proteins were isolated from U937, KG1, or murine bone marrow cells, with or without differentiation, and immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions with antibody to Fap-1 or Fas (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA). Precipitated proteins were collected with Staph protein A-Sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots of Fap-1 antibody-precipitated proteins were probed with Fap-1 antibody. Western blots of Fas antibody-precipitated proteins were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). In other experiments, lysates proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fas antibody under nondenaturing conditions. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blots serially probed with antibodies to Fas, Fap-1, and phosphotyrosine. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with different batches of lysate proteins. A representative blot is shown. Isolation of Nuclear Proteins, Nuclear Protein Extraction—Nuclear proteins were extracted from U937 or KG1 cells by the method of Dignam (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar) with protease inhibitors, as described (10Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell.

DNA Affinity Purification Assays—Nuclear proteins (300 μg) were incubated with biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe representing the -587- to -627-bp PTPN13 promoter sequence or a non-ICSBP-binding PRDI mutant sequence overnight in DAPA buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25% Triton X-100). The DNA-protein complexes were precipitated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of neutravidin-coated agarose beads (Pierce). Proteins bound to the beads were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were probed with an antibody to ICSBP obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Electrophoretic Mobility Assays—Oligonucleotides probes were prepared, and EMSA and antibody supershift assays were performed as described (10Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S.

Each assay was repeated with at least three different batches of nuclear proteins, and representative experiments are shown. In some experiments, binding assays were preincubated with unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors. In other experiments, binding reactions were preincubated with an ICSBP antibody or an irrelevant antibody to the DNA binding domain of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Each experiment was repeated several times with at least three different batches of nuclear proteins. Equal loading for nuclear proteins was determined in control EMSA with a probe representing a classical CCAAT box from the α-globin gene. Conserved genomic sequences and consensus sequences for IRF protein DNA binding were identified using the VISTA software (Genomics Division of the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory (Berkeley, CA) (31Dubchak I.

Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test and analysis of variance methods using the SigmaPlot and Sigma-Stat software. Identification of PTPN13 as an ICSBP Target Gene—To identify target genes involved in the leukemia-suppressor function of ICSBP, we screened a CpG island microarray with ICSBP co-immunoprecipitating chromatin. We used the U937 myeloid leukemia cell line in these studies. These cells undergo differentiation in response to various cytokines, including IFNγ (26Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over a 24-h period, differentiating U937 cells acquire characteristics of mature phagocytes, including respiratory burst activity and phagocytosis (4Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiation of U937 cells is also characterized by cell cycle arrest by 24 h and programmed cell death over 48-96 h. U937 cells express a number of interferon regulatory factors, including ICSBP. Previous studies demonstrated that IRF1, IRF2, and ICSBP are tyrosine-phosphorylated during differentiation of either U937 cells or primary myeloid progenitor cells (9Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, U937 cells represented a reasonable model to study events that are influenced by ICSBP during myelopoiesis. To identify differentiation stage-specific interactions of ICSBP with potential target genes, human CpG island microarrays were screened with chromatin that co-immunoprecipitated with ICSBP from U937 cells with or without 48 h of IFNγ differentiation. Prior to immunoprecipitation, lysates were sonicated to generate chromatin fragments of 2.0 kb or less (27Oberl"
https://openalex.org/W2074008904,"Background Adr1 and Cat8 co-regulate numerous glucose-repressed genes in S. cerevisiae, presenting a unique opportunity to explore their individual roles in coactivator recruitment, chromatin remodeling, and transcription. Methodology/Principal Findings We determined the individual contributions of Cat8 and Adr1 on the expression of a cohort of glucose-repressed genes and found three broad categories: genes that need both activators for full derepression, genes that rely mostly on Cat8 and genes that require only Adr1. Through combined expression and recruitment data, along with analysis of chromatin remodeling at two of these genes, ADH2 and FBP1, we clarified how these activators achieve this wide range of co-regulation. We find that Adr1 and Cat8 are not intrinsically different in their abilities to recruit coactivators but rather, promoter context appears to dictate which activator is responsible for recruitment to specific genes. These promoter-specific contributions are also apparent in the chromatin remodeling that accompanies derepression: ADH2 requires both Adr1 and Cat8, whereas, at FBP1, significant remodeling occurs with Cat8 alone. Although over-expression of Adr1 can compensate for loss of Cat8 at many genes in terms of both activation and chromatin remodeling, this over-expression cannot complement all of the cat8Δ phenotypes. Conclusions/Significance Thus, at many of the glucose-repressed genes, Cat8 and Adr1 appear to have interchangeable roles and promoter architecture may dictate the roles of these activators."
https://openalex.org/W2097261161,"A powerful way to identify genes for complex traits it to combine genetic and genomic methods. Many trait quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for complex traits are sex specific, but the reason for this is not well understood.RNA was prepared from bone marrow derived macrophages of 93 female and 114 male F(2) mice derived from a strain intercross between apoE-deficient mice on the AKR and DBA/2 genetic backgrounds, and was subjected to transcriptome profiling using microarrays. A high density genome scan was performed using a mouse SNP chip, and expression QTLs (eQTLs) were located for expressed transcripts. Using suggestive and significant LOD score cutoffs of 3.0 and 4.3, respectively, thousands of eQTLs in the female and male cohorts were identified. At the suggestive LOD threshold the majority of the eQTLs were trans eQTLs, mapping unlinked to the position of the gene. Cis eQTLs, which mapped to the location of the gene, had much higher LOD scores than trans eQTLs, indicating their more direct effect on gene expression. The majority of cis eQTLs were common to both males and females, but only approximately 1% of the trans eQTLs were shared by both sexes. At the significant LOD threshold, the majority of eQTLs were cis eQTLs, which were mostly sex-shared, while the trans eQTLs were overwhelmingly sex-specific. Pooling the male and female data, 31% of expressed transcripts were expressed at different levels in males vs. females after correction for multiple testing.These studies demonstrate a large sex effect on gene expression and trans regulation, under conditions where male and female derived cells were cultured ex vivo and thus without the influence of endogenous sex steroids. These data suggest that eQTL data from male and female mice should be analyzed separately, as many effects, such as trans regulation are sex specific."
https://openalex.org/W1994193012,"While epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dysregulation is known to play a critical role in prostate carcinogenesis, there has been no direct evidence indicating EGFR mutations induce tumorigenesis in prostate cancer. We previously identified four novel EGFR somatic mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain of prostate cancer patients: G735S, G796S, E804G and R841K. In this study, we investigated the oncogenic potential of these somatic mutations by establishing stable clonal NIH3T3 cells expressing these four mutations and WT EGFR to determine their ability to increase cell proliferation and invasion. In the absence of the EGF ligand, cell proliferation was readily increased in G735S, G796S and E804G mutants compared to WT EGFR. The addition of EGF ligand greatly increased cell growth and transforming ability of these same EGFR mutants. Matrigel invasion assays showed enhanced invasion with G735S, G796S and E804G mutants. Western blot analysis showed that these EGFR mutations enhanced cell growth and invasion via constitutive and hyperactive tyrosine phosphorylation and led to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Akt pathways. Our findings demonstrate the oncogenic activation of three novel EGFR somatic missense mutations in prostate cancer. Molecules that regulate the mechanisms of their oncogenic activation represent novel targets for limiting tumor cell progression, and further elucidation of these mutations will have utility in prostate cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1986518231,"For decades, the chimpanzee, phylogenetically closest to humans, has been analyzed intensively in comparative cognitive studies. Other than the accumulation of behavioral data, the neural basis for cognitive processing in the chimpanzee remains to be clarified. To increase our knowledge on the evolutionary and neural basis of human cognition, comparative neurophysiological studies exploring endogenous neural activities in the awake state are needed. However, to date, such studies have rarely been reported in non-human hominid species, due to the practical difficulties in conducting non-invasive measurements on awake individuals.We measured auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) of a fully awake chimpanzee, with reference to a well-documented component of human studies, namely mismatch negativity (MMN). In response to infrequent, deviant tones that were delivered in a uniform sound stream, a comparable ERP component could be detected as negative deflections in early latencies.The present study reports the MMN-like component in a chimpanzee for the first time. In human studies, various ERP components, including MMN, are well-documented indicators of cognitive and neural processing. The results of the present study validate the use of non-invasive ERP measurements for studies on cognitive and neural processing in chimpanzees, and open the way for future studies comparing endogenous neural activities between humans and chimpanzees. This signifies an essential step in hominid cognitive neurosciences."
https://openalex.org/W2062319160,"SET domain-containing methyltransferases post-translationally modify a variety of cellular proteins, such as histones, cytochrome c, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, and ribosomal proteins. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, at least 13 SET domain-containing proteins have been identified in the genome, four of which are involved in transcriptional regulation through their modification of histone tails. However, the roles played by the other SET domain proteins in cellular processes and their physiological substrates remain unresolved. We show here that S. pombe Set11, a SET domain-containing protein encoded by SPCC1223.04c, specifically modifies Rpl12 (ribosomal protein L12). Recombinant Set11 prepared from Escherichia coli had catalytic activity and methylated a 17-kDa polypeptide in cellular extracts of set11 mutant cells. The methylated protein was isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or by reverse-phase chromatography and was identified as Rpl12 by mass spectrometry. In vitro methylation experiments using wild-type and mutant Rpl12 proteins verified that Set11 modified recombinant Rpl12 and suggested that its potential target site was lysine 3. The methylation site modified by Set11 was also confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis, which also revealed other unique methylation sites of Rpl12. Finally, we found that Set11 predominantly localized to the nucleolus and that the overproduction of Set11 caused a severe growth defect. These results suggest that Rpl12 methylation occurs during the ribosomal assembly processes and that control of the Set11 expression level is important for its cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W2083139002,"Oxidative stress causes retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell dysfunction and is a major risk factor leading to the development of dry-type age-related macular degeneration. Taking pharmacological and genetic approaches, we address the mechanisms by which sublethal oxidative stress inhibits RPE cell phagocytosis. Sublethal oxidative stress dose-dependently inhibited RPE cell phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as determined by increased Thr172 and Ser79 phosphorylation of AMPKα and its substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase, respectively. Similar to oxidative stress, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), a pharmacological activator of AMPK, inhibited RPE cell phagocytosis of POS in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis by AICAR was fully reversed by blockade of AICAR translocation into cells by dipyridamole or inhibition of AICAR conversion to ZMP by adenosine kinase inhibitor 5-iodotubercidin. In agreement, AICAR-induced activation of AMPK was abolished by preincubation with dipyridamole or 5-iodotubercidin. Knock-out experiments further revealed that α2 but not α1 AMPK was involved in RPE cell phagocytosis and that activation of α2 AMPK contributed to the inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis by oxidative stress. Inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis by activation of α2 AMPK was associated with a dramatic increase in acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation. In comparison, AMPK had no role in oxidative stress-induced breakdown of RPE barrier function. Taken together, reduction in POS load under oxidative stress might direct RPE cells to a self-protected status.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Basal membrane of the RPE is in contact with Bruch membrane, whereas the apical membrane faces the photoreceptor outer segments. The close structural interactions of RPE cells with the outer retina indicate that the major functions of the RPE layer are to maintain the survival and normal functioning of photoreceptors by controlling nutrients/waste products exchange (2Steinberg R.H. Doc. Ophthalmol. 1985; 60: 327-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), phagocytosing shed outer segments (3Strauss O. Stumpff F. Mergler S. Wienrich M. Wiederholt M.

Ophthalmol. 2003; 37: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and producing trophic factors necessary for photoreceptor survival. Failure of any one of these functions can result in degeneration of the retina, loss of visual function, and blindness.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an idiopathic retinal degenerative disease that predominates in the elderly in the Western world as a cause of irreversible, profound vision loss (5Young R.W. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1987; 31: 291-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 6Evans J.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 227-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The pathogenic mechanisms whereby environmental factors contribute to the development of AMD remain elusive. However, growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress injury to the RPE plays an important role in the etiology of AMD. The RPE is at high risk for oxidative injury due to its location in a highly oxygenated environment, its high levels of light exposure, and generation of reactive oxygen species during POS phagocytosis (7Tate Jr., D.J. Miceli M.V. Newsome D.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1271-1279PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dorey C.K. Khouri G.G. Syniuta L.A. Curran S.A. Weiter J.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Most studies have focused on oxidative injury-induced death of RPE (10Beatty S. Koh H. Phil M. Henson D. Boulton M. Surv.

Vis. 1999; 5: 32PubMed Google Scholar), a very late stage of dry AMD. In comparison, in the early stage of AMD development, oxidative insult induces a set of profound physiological responses in RPE leading to dysfunction without initiation of cell death (12Honda S. Hjelmeland L.M. Handa J.T. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 63-70PubMed Google Scholar). However, minimal data are available regarding the effects of sublethal oxidative injury on RPE functions such as phagocytosis and blood-retinal barrier as well as their mechanisms of action.AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic-sensing Ser/Thr kinase expressed in all cell types examined to date (13Hardie D.G.

AMPK exists as a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits (15Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of AMPKα has two major isoforms, α1 and α2. The α1 isoform is primarily cytoplasmic, whereas α2 is predominantly nuclear and plays a role in transcriptional regulation (16Turnley A.M. Stapleton D. Mann R.J. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Bartlett P.F.

AMPK is activated by energy deficiency to coordinate a switch from ATP-consuming pathways to catabolic pathways to produce a positive energy balance. AMP activates AMPK via an allosteric effect, by stimulation of Thr172 phosphorylation in the activation domain through an upstream kinase LKB1 (19Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol.

All three effects of AMP on AMPK are antagonized by ATP, so AMPK monitors any small changes in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio (20Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). AMPK is also activated by a variety of cellular stresses that deplete ATP such as glucose deprivation (21Carling D.

This suggests that AMPK, in addition being a key regulator of physiological energy dynamics, may affect RPE cell function under oxidative stress conditions.Sensing ATP levels may be important in the cell response to oxidative stress, but the consequences of persistent activation of AMPK that have compromised energy supplies are unknown. In an attempt to return cells to homeostasis, numerous damage-repairing processes that consume ATP are activated (25Szabo C. Dawson V.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Overactivation of these pathways during oxidative stress can lead to energy failure and cell dysfunction (26Du L. Zhang X. Han Y.Y. Burke N.A. Kochanek P.M. Watkins S.C. Graham S.H. Carcillo J.A. Szabo C. Clark R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18426-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). At present, it is unclear whether AMPK in RPE cells is activated by sublethal oxidative stress. If so, whether its activation would be protective or damaging? In the present study we utilize an in vitro sublethal oxidative stress model to delineate changes in AMPK activity incurred during environmental stress and to determine the effects on RPE cell phagocytosis and barrier integrity. AMPK activation by oxidative insult and by a pharmacological activator reduces RPE cell phagocytosis, whereas no effect of AMPK on oxidative stress-induced breakdown of RPE barrier function is detected. α2-isoform mediates oxidative stress inhibition of phagocytosis. These data suggest that AMPK activation during oxidative stress might switch RPE cells to a self-protected status.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), FITC-labeled dextran (70 kDa), and anti-β-actin were from Sigma.

Tissue culture-treated polycarbonate transwells (12 mm in outer diameter and 0.4 μm in pore size) were purchased from Costar (Corning, NY).RPE Cell Culture and siRNA Transfection—Human RPE cell line ARPE19 was obtained from ATCC, and the cells were cultured in 1:1 of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. The cells were passed every 3∼4 days by digestion with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. 10 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish were seeded for 24 h and transfected with control siRNA, and validated siRNAs targeting human AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 (Ambion) were diluted in Opti-MEM1 at a concentration of 25 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 8 h after transfection, medium was exchanged with fresh complete medium, and cells were cultivated overnight before being re-seeded for experiments.Cell Viability Assay—ARPE19 (1.5 X 10 4/well) cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom micro-culture plates for 4 days, treated with 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, washed twice with medium, and then continued culture for 24 h. Untreated control cells were handled in a similar fashion without hydrogen peroxide. Viable cells were then determined by the addition of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) for 4 h following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science).Isolation and FITC Labeling of POS—Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from local slaughterhouse. POS were isolated by discontinuous sucrose density (25∼60%) centrifugation (27Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Before use, POS were thawed, spun down, and suspended in 900 μl of serum-free medium. POS were dyed by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0, and 10 μl of 10 mg/ml FITC (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark (28McLaren M.J. Inana G. Li C.Y.

POS were washed 3 times with serum-free medium at 7000 rpm for 5 min and re-suspended in growth medium at the concentration of 10 × 107 particles/ml. POS preparation was positive for immunostaining with anti-rhodopsin antibody.POS Feeding and Quantification of Phagocytosis—RPE cells were placed in an individual well of a 24-well tissue culture plate (1 × 105/well) and grown for 4 days to reach complete confluence. Each well of confluent RPE cells was layered with 300 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% serum and 5 × 106 POS particles and was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated lengths of time. After POS challenge, the cells were washed 3 times by vigorous agitation with PBS containing CaCl2 and MgSO4 to remove unbound POS, detached using 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, washed twice with of PBS, and then re-suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS for the flow cytometric assay. FITC-labeled POS uptake was measured using a fluorescenceactivated cell sorter (FACScan; BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed with 488-nm excitation and a 530 ± 15-nm band-pass filter in the emission path. Untreated RPE cells were used as the negative control to set the gate in each experiment. Each flow cytometry run consisted of 5000 scattering events. A logarithmic scale of relative fluorescence intensity was used, and POS phagocytosis was calculated by subtracting the cellular autofluorescence from the mean fluorescence of cells challenged with FITC-POS. The data are presented as the mean of three independent experiments.For signal transduction pathway inhibition, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 2 mm AICAR only or for 30 min of exposure to 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide. After treatment, hydrogen peroxide was washed out. FITC-labeled POS was then added to the cells and incubated for another 4 h. Flow cytometry for analysis of phagocytosis was performed as above.Cell Extraction and Immunoblotting—Confluent ARPE19 cells were stimulated with the chemicals as described in the legends of Figs. 1, B and C, 2C, and 4 in media with 0.5% FBS. After treatment, cells were washed twice with cold PBS containing 2 mm NaF and 2 mm vanadate and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Santa Cruz, SC-29130)). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and detected with appropriate primary antibodies. The blots were subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and images were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare). Band intensities were determined using computer program Image-J and were presented as the mean ± S.D. (n = 3) of the x-fold change over the respective control that was arbitrarily defined as 1.FIGURE 2Inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis by activation of AMPK. A, inhibitory effect of AICAR on phagocytosis. Confluent ARPE19 cells in 24-well plate were preincubated with various concentrations of AICAR for 1 h followed by 4 h of incubation with 5 × 106 POS particles in 300 μl of growth medium in the presence of AICAR. Data shown are the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. Phagocytosis was determined by flow cytometer. B, restoration of AICAR-inhibited phagocytosis by inhibitors of AICAR functions through inhibition of AMPK activity. Cells were treated with 2 μm DPY or 0.5 μm IODO for 30 min before exposure to 2 mm AICAR. p < 0.01 (**) and p < 0.001 (***) versus control. C, inhibition of AICAR-dependent activation of AMPKα by DPY and IODO. Confluent cells were treated with DPY or IODO for 30 min and then stimulated with 2 mm AICAR for 30 min. AMPKα activation was assessed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-Ser(P)79 ACC. Results of one immunoblot were shown with densitometric quantitation of three experiments. p < 0.01 (**) and p < 0.001 (***) versus the samples treated with AICAR only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Measurement of Barrier Functions—Approximately 1.78 × 105 cells/cm2 were seeded in individual transwell filters in 0.5 ml of growth medium (0.4 μm pore size, 12 mm diameter). 1 ml of medium was added at the basal chamber to level the height of the liquid for preventing hydrostatic pressure. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured using an epithelial voltmeter (EVOM; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were taken from the incubator and placed at room temperature for 30 min of equilibration before the measurements. The TER (in ohms/cm2) of the filter alone was measured as background and subtracted from the TERs obtained with the filters and the RPE cells. Confluent RPE cells grown in transwell filter inserts were switched to serum-free medium and were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide. Measurements were made at 3 and 6 h and were repeated at least 3 times for each well, and 3 different wells were used for each treatment.Paracellular permeability of ARPE19 monolayer was determined by measuring the apical-to-basolateral movements of FITC-dextran (70 kDa). After 6 h of exposure to hydrogen peroxide, 10 μg/ml FITC-dextran was added to the apical chamber. 100 μl of medium was removed from the basal chamber at 60 min after adding the molecules, and fluorescence intensity was measured with a fluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm.Statistical Analysis—Experimental data were first analyzed by one-way analysis of variance for significant variance among groups. Comparisons between selected groups were made using the Bonferroni test. p < 0.05 was considered significant for all experiments. The values are presented as the mean ± S.D.RESULTSInhibition of Phagocytosis of POS by Hydrogen Peroxide—To address the effect of oxidative stress on RPE cell phagocytosis, cells were treated with up to 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide for 30 min in growth medium and then were cultivated in fresh complete medium. This sublethal oxidative stress condition did not cause RPE cell death but dose-dependently inhibited RPE cell phagocytosis of POS (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Thr172 phosphorylation of catalytic subunit AMPKα is required for AMPKα activation, and activated AMPKα can phosphorylate Ser79 of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), one of the AMPK substrates. Oxidative stress with 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide dramatically activated AMPKα, reached the peak within 15 min, and declined 1 h later (Fig. 1B) as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Thr172 of AMPKα. Hydrogen peroxide even stimulated a quicker Ser79 phosphorylation of ACC (Fig. 1C). Equal loadings were demonstrated as similar AMPKα and ACC proteins were presented in all samples (Fig. 1, B and C). These observations clearly suggest that AMPK is activated by oxidative stress and might be a player in RPE cell dysfunction under oxidative stress conditions.Inhibition of RPE Cell Phagocytosis by AMPK Activator AICAR—AICAR is a specific AMPK activator that is taken up into cells by nucleoside transporter, is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase to the monophosphorylated form (ZMP), and then activates AMPK by mimicking AMP (30Henin N. Vincent M.F. den Berghe Van G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We first took advantage of AICAR to test whether treatment with AICAR inhibited RPE cell phagocytosis of POS. Fig. 2A showed that similar to hydrogen peroxide, AICAR inhibited RPE cell phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. Blockade of AICAR translocation into cells by adenosine transporter blocker dipyridamole (DPY, 2 μm) fully restored RPE cell phagocytosis in the presence of AICAR (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, inhibition of AICAR conversion to ZMP by adenosine kinase inhibitor, 5-iodotubercidin (IODO, 0.5 μm), also restored RPE cell phagocytosis inhibited by AICAR (Fig. 2B), suggesting that activation of AMPK by AICAR causes the inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis. To investigate if AMPK activation is responsible for the inhibitory effect on RPE cell phagocytosis observed by AICAR treatment, the phosphorylation of ACC was taken as a marker of AMPK activation. Immunoblotting revealed that treatment with AICAR led to an increase in Ser79 phosphorylation of ACC (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that AICAR activates AMPK signaling in RPE cells. Preincubation with DPY or IODO did abolish AICAR-induced AMPK activation (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that AMPKα activation is well correlated with inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis by AICAR.Regulation of Phagocytosis by AMPKα2 but Not by AMPKα1—To confirm if AMPKα is of functional relevance in RPE cell phagocytosis and evaluate possible AMPKα isoform-specific activity, we used RNA interference technology to knock down AMPKα. Validated siRNA constructs complementary to AMPKα1 or -α2 (Applied Biosystems) were transfected into ARPE19 cells. AMPKα expression was measured 72 h post-transfection by Western blot analysis using isoform-specific antibodies. α1 and α2 AMPK siRNAs selectively suppressed AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 protein, respectively. Optical density analysis of the data from three independent experiments revealed that AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 proteins were reduced to 6 and 1% of respective controls (Fig. 3A). AMPKα1 repression caused a 37% compensational increase in AMPKα2 protein. Combined treatment with both α1 and α2 AMPK siRNAs led to 66 and 92% reduction of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 protein, respectively. AMPKα1 siRNA had no effect on POS phagocytosis. AMPKα2 siRNA, however, significantly inhibited the phagocytosis of POS by 40%. Combined knockdown of both α1 and α2 did not make further reduction in RPE cell phagocytosis (Fig. 3B). These observations revealed that RPE cell phagocytosis depends, at least in part, on AMPKα2 but not AMPKα1 in normal conditions. Under stress conditions, oxidative stress-induced inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis was not effected by silencing AMPKα1, as POS phagocytosis by RPE cells transfected with control siRNA and AMPKα1 siRNA was inhibited to a similar extent by hydrogen peroxide treatment (Fig. 3C). However, knockdown of AMPKα2 reversed the inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis induced by hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that oxidative stress-induced activation of AMPKα2 mediated the inhibition of RPE cell phagocytosis.FIGURE 3Knockdown of AMPKα2 reduces POS phagocytosis and becomes resistant to oxidative stress. A, AMPK knockdown by siRNA. Human RPE cells were transfected with either control siRNA or siRNAs directed against AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 (final siRNA concentration 25 nm), respectively.

Confluent RPE cells in a 24-well plate were incubated with 5 × 106 POS in 300 μl of complete medium for 4 h.

We first differentiated the contribution of α-isoforms to the level of total phosphorylated AMPKα, which detects both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 phosphorylated at Thr172. Hydrogen peroxide increased Thr172 phosphorylation of AMPKα, and application of siRNA targeted to AMPKα1 reduced total phosphorylated AMPKα to a very low level (Fig. 4A). In comparison, AMPKα2 siRNA very weakly repressed hydrogen peroxide-induced Thr172 phosphorylation of total AMPKα, indicating that α1 AMPK is the dominant isoform in RPE cells.FIGURE 4Distinctive regulation of ACC phosphorylation by AMPKα1 and α2 in RPE cell oxidative stress signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2034270241,"BIM and tBID are two BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins with a particularly strong capacity to trigger BAX-driven mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, a crucial event in mammalian apoptosis. However, the means whereby BIM and tBID fulfill this task is controversial. Here, we used a reconstituted liposomal system bearing physiological relevance to explore systematically how the BAX-permeabilizing function is influenced by interactions of BIM/BID-derived proteins and BH3 motifs with multidomain BCL-2 family members and with membrane lipids. We found that nanomolar dosing of BIM proteins sufficed to reverse completely the inhibition of BAX permeabilizing activity exerted by all antiapoptotic proteins tested (BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, MCL-1, and A1). This effect was reproducible by a peptide representing the BH3 motif of BIM, whereas an equivalent BID BH3 peptide was less potent and more selective, reversing antiapoptotic inhibition. On the other hand, in the absence of BCL-2-type proteins, BIM proteins and the BIM BH3 peptide were inefficient, directly triggering the BAX-permeabilizing function. In contrast, tBID alone potently assisted BAX to permeabilize membranes at least in part by producing a structural distortion in the lipid bilayer via BH3-independent interaction of tBID with cardiolipin. Together, these results support the notion that BIM and tBID follow different strategies to trigger BAX-driven mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization with strong potency.

The BCL-2 protein family has emerged as the master regulator of this crucial step in the intracellular apoptotic cascade (Refs. 1Green D.R. Kroemer G.

Based on sequence homology and functional criteria, this family can be divided into three main subclasses (2Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3465) Google Scholar). One subclass includes the antiapoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-W, BCL-XL, MCL-1, BFL-1/A1, and BCL-B, all of which possess four BCL-2 homology domains (BH1–4) and inhibit MOMP. A second subclass is represented by proapoptotic BAX and BAK, which contain BH1–3 domains and are directly responsible for MOMP. Finally, members of the more distantly related BH3-only subclass (tBID, BIM, PUMA, BAD, NOXA, HRK, BIK, and BMF) display sequence homology only within the third BH domain and promote apoptosis by triggering BAX-driven MOMP.It is agreed that BAX-type proteins exist in an inactive state in healthy cells and that BH3-only proteins funnel multiple apoptotic signals to activate the permeabilizing function of BAX/BAK. However, the means whereby BH3-only members perform this task is a subject of current debate (2Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

BIM and tBID are two well known BH3-only members with a particularly high potency for triggering BAX-driven MOMP and apoptotic cell death. Two main models evolved in the last few years to explain the highly lethal activity of BIM and tBID. On the one hand, the so-called “displacement model” postulates that BIM and tBID physically interact with all five BCL-2-type proteins to competitively displace BAX/BAK, thereby indirectly activating the permeabilizing function of BAX-type proteins (7Willis S.N.

However, although it is firmly established that BIM binds the whole panel of antiapoptotic proteins with low nanomolar affinity constants via its BH3 domain, evidence indicating that tBID engages the complete set of BCL-2-type proteins with strong affinity is tenuous. Alternatively, according to the “direct model” the potent proapoptotic activity of BIM and tBID originates from the exclusive capacity of their BH3 domains to directly bind to and activate the permeabilizing function of BAX/BAK (9Letai A.

In support of this view, in vitro studies demonstrated that hydrocarbon-stapled BIM/BID BH3 peptides can interact with BAX with nanomolar affinity constants (16Walensky L.D. Pitter K. Morash J.

Yet, it remains to be clarified how closely the behavior of such chemically modified peptides reflects that of parent proteins as well as the exact molecular pathway by which the BIM/BID BH3-BAX interaction leads to MOMP.Albeit for completely different reasons, the aforementioned two models share the view that BIM and tBID are mechanistically equivalent, triggering the functional activation of BAX. However, evidence exists contradicting this notion. First, pioneering work by Martinou and co-workers (19Terradillos O. Montessuit S. Huang D.C. Martinou J.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that recombinant BIML and tBID did not elicit the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria in the same manner. In addition, structural studies revealed that tBID displays a helical globular fold similar to that found in multidomain BCL-2 family members and certain pore-forming toxins, whereas BIM is an intrinsically disordered protein (2Youle R.J.

Thus, taken together, these studies leave open the question as to whether BIM and tBID trigger the functional activation of BAX-type proteins through the same mechanism or whether their mode of action is manifold.Studies of the mode of BCL-2 protein action with intact cells are difficult to interpret at the molecular level mainly due to the complexity of the apoptotic network.

Here, we have attempted to elucidate the apoptotic mode of BIM and tBID action by thoroughly characterizing the effects of various recombinant BCL-2 family proteins and selected BH3 peptides on a reconstituted liposomal system bearing physiological significance. The results obtained indicate that BIM and tBID use different molecular mechanisms to effectively trigger the permeabilizing function of BAX.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—KCl, HEPES, EDTA, MgCl2, dodecyl octaethylene glycol monoether (C12E8), melittin, Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (α-toxin), tetanolysin, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextrans of 70 kDa (FD70) were obtained from Sigma.

(Alabaster, AL). Disuccinimidyl suberate was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Protein Production—All proteins, including BAX, were purified from soluble fractions of bacterial extracts obtained in the absence of detergents and were >90% pure electrophoretically (supplemental Fig. 1). Recombinant His6-tagged full-length monomeric human BAX (BAX) (36Roucou X. Montessuit S. Antonsson B. Martinou J-C. Biochem.

To obtain caspase-8-cleaved BID (tBID), granzyme B-cleaved BID (tgBID), and calpain-cleaved BID (tcalBID), indicated proteases were incubated with BID in appropriate buffers at 1/100 (mol/mol) ratio for 1 h at 37°C. Recombinant murine BIML (BIMLΔC) was either (i) purchased from R&D systems with a His6 tag and lacking the C-terminal 20 amino acids (assays corresponding to results shown in Figs. 2, B and C) or (ii) obtained from bacterial expression with a glutathione S-transferase tag and lacking the C-terminal 27 amino acids (all other assays). Recombinant His6-tagged human BCL-W lacking the C-terminal 29 amino acids (BCL-WΔC), human glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged BCL-XL lacking the C-terminal 24 amino acids (BCL-XLΔC), mouse GST-tagged A1 lacking the C-terminal 20 amino acids (A1ΔC), and mouse GST-tagged MCL-1 lacking the N-terminal 151 amino acids and the C-terminal 23 amino acids (MCL-1ΔC) were obtained as described previously (8Chen L.

High performance liquid chromatography-purified 21-mer BIM/BID BH3 peptides and the 29-mer BID BH3 peptide were obtained from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Peptide identity was confirmed by electrospray mass spectroscopy.Cytochrome c Release Assays—Mitochondria were isolated from livers of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (30Basañez G. Zhang J. Chau B.N. Maksaev G.I. Frolov V.A. Brandt T.A. Burch J. Hardwick J.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31083-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and used within 3 h. Isolated mitochondria (500 μg of protein/ml) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with recombinant proteins in 50 μl of 125 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 25 μm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, 5 μm rotenone, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to isolate the pellet and supernatant fractions, and cytochrome c contents were determined quantitatively using a colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems). The percentage of cytochrome c released into the supernatant (% cytochrome c) was calculated according to the equation, % cytochrome c = ([cytochrome csup - cytochrome cbackgr]/[cytochrome ctotal - cytochrome cbackgr)] × 100, where background release represents cytochrome c detected in the supernatant of buffer-treated samples, and total release represents cytochrome c measured in Triton X-100-treated samples. Absorbance measurements were carried on a Biotek Synergy HT fluorescence microplate reader (Winooski, VT).Liposome Preparation—Unless otherwise stated, liposomes were prepared with lipid composition resembling that of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) contact sites ((40 PC/35 PE/10 PI/15 CL (mol/mol)] (MOM-mimetic liposomes)). Organic solvents were removed by evaporation under a N2 stream followed by incubation under vacuum for 2 h. Dry lipid films were resuspended by vigorous vortexing in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA (KHE buffer) resulting in the generation of multilamellar vesicles. For assays of vesicle contents, release KHE buffer was supplemented with 100 mg/ml FD70. Multilamellar vesicles were then subjected to five freeze/thaw cycles. These frozen/thawed liposomes were used in assays of direct protein binding assays and lipid morphological and structural studies. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were produced by extrusion through two polycarbonate membranes of 0.2-μm pore size (Nucleopore, San Diego, CA). Untrapped FD70 was removed by gel filtration in Sephacryl S-500 HR columns.Fluorimetric Measurements of Vesicular Contents Release—Release of LUV-encapsulated FD70 was monitored in an SLM-2 Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) in a thermostatted 1-cm path length cuvette with constant stirring at 37 °C (Vfinal = 1 ml). λex was 490, and λem was 530 nm (slits, 4 nm). A 515-nm cut-off filter was placed between the sample and the emission monochromator to avoid scattering interferences. The extent of marker release was quantified on a percentage basis according to the equation (Ft - F0/F100 - F0) = 100 where Ft is the measured fluorescence of protein-treated LUV at time t, F0 is the initial fluorescence of the LUV suspension before protein addition, and F100 is the fluorescence value after complete disruption of LUV by addition of C12E8 (final concentration, 0.5 mm). Lipid concentration was 50 μm.Binding of Proteins to MOM-mimetic Liposomes—To examine the binding of different BCL-2-family members to liposomes in a direct manner, proteins and freeze/thawed MOM-mimetic liposomes (500 μm lipid) were incubated in KHE buffer for 20 min at 37 °C (Vfinal = 100 μl). The mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g, 4 °C. Supernatant and pellet fractions contained 14 ± 4 and 83 ± 7% of the total lipid content. Equivalent aliquots were taken from supernatant (corresponding to free protein) and pellet fractions (corresponding to liposome-bound protein), then samples were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE on 15% Tris-glycine gels. After electrophoresis, proteins from the gel were electroblotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes followed by visualization by Western blotting using appropriate primary antibodies, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and enhanced-chemiluminescent (ECL) kit substrates (Pierce). Primary antibodies used for BIM, tBID, and BAX detection were anti-BIM B7929 polyclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-BID MAB860 monoclonal antibody (R&D systems), and anti-BAX N20 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), respectively.Assays of BAX Oligomerization at MOM-mimetic LUV—For studies of BAX oligomerization, apoptotic proteins were first incubated with MOM-mimetic LUV (100 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C (Vfinal = 100 μl). Then, the amine-reactive disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linker was added at a 0.1 mm concentration followed by incubation of the mixture for 30 min at room temperature and quenching of free cross-linker by the addition of 0.1 volume of 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Finally, samples were examined for BAX immunoreactivity as described above.Monolayer Surface Pressure Measurements—Surface pressure measurements were carried out with a MicroTrough-S system from Kibron (Helsinki, Finland) at 37 °C with constant stirring. Lipid monolayers resembling the composition of MOM contact sites were used ((40 PC/35 PE/10 PI/15 CL (mol/mol)) (MOM-mimetic monolayers). The lipid, dissolved in chloroform and methanol (2:1), was gently spread over the surface of 1 ml of KHE buffer and kept at a constant surface area. The desired initial surface pressure was attained by changing the amount of lipid applied to the air-water interface. After 10 min to allow for solvent evaporation, the protein/peptide was injected through a hole connected to the subphase. The change in surface pressure was recorded as a function of time until a stable signal was obtained. Maximal surface pressures obtained after injecting an excess of protein/peptide in the absence of a lipid monolayer were below initial monolayer pressure values examined.Far-UV Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 37 °C on a Jasco J-810 spectrapolarimeter (Jasco Spectroscopic Co. Ltd., Hachioji City, Japan) equipped with a Jasco PTC-423S temperature control unit using a 1-mm path length cell. Data were collected every 0.2 nm at 50 nm/min from 250 to 200 nm with a bandwidth of 2 nm, and results were averaged from 20 scans. All samples were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min before measurement. Peptides (5 μm) were mixed with MOM liposomes (500 μm) in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm KCl, pH 7.0. Each spectrum represents the average of three distinct spectral recordings. The contribution of buffer and lipid to the measured ellipticity was subtracted as blank.Measurements of LUV Size by Quasi-elastic Light Scattering—Vesicle size was determined by quasi-elastic light scattering at a fixed angle of 90° and room temperature using a Malvern Zetasizer 4 instrument (Malvern, UK). A 64-channel correlator was used capable of estimating particle sizes in the range from 5 to 5000 nm. Data were analyzed by the cumulant method using Malvern Application Software. The hydrodynamic radius of the particle was obtained from the first cumulant.31P NMR Measurements—Samples for 31P NMR were prepared by dispersing 15 μmol of dry MOM-mimetic lipid mixtures in either 0.5 ml of KHE buffer alone or 0.5 ml of KHE buffer containing the protein/peptide of interest at 150 μm concentration. Multilamellar vesicle suspensions were freezethawed 3 times in liquid N2 to disperse the added proteins in the lipid membranes, and the liposomes were spun down in an Eppendorf centrifuge (14,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). Pellets were loaded directly into 5-mm Pyrex NMR tubes. Samples were equilibrated for 20 min at each temperature before data acquisition. High power, proton noise-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-500 spectrometer operating at 202.4 MHz using 5-mm broadband inverse probes with z-gradient equipment. 1024 free induction decays were averaged using a 2-s recycle delay. Spectra were processed and evaluated using TOPSPIN 1.3 (Bruker) and plotted with 80-kHz line broadening.RESULTSTruncated BID but Not BIM Potently Triggers the Permeabilizing Function of BAX at Nanomolar Dosing—We previously showed that the BAX-driven MOM permeabilization pathway triggered by tBID can be reconstituted in MOM-mimetic LUV containing entrapped FD70 (32Terrones O.

Further, whether other components of RNA polymerase II are degraded in response to DNA damage remains unknown. Here, we show that the Rpb1p subunit of the elongating, but not initiating, form of RNA polymerase II is degraded at the active genes in response to 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-induced DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, other subunits of RNA polymerase II are not degraded in response to DNA damage. Further, we show that Rpb1p is essential for RNA polymerase II assembly at the active gene, and thus, the degradation of Rpb1p following DNA damage disassembles elongating RNA polymerase II. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Rpb1p but not other subunits of elongating RNA polymerase II is specifically degraded in response to DNA damage, and such a degradation of Rpb1p is critical for the disassembly of elongating RNA polymerase II at the DNA lesion in vivo.

Fortunately, the cell employs a specific repair mechanism to efficiently remove lesions from the transcribing strands of the active genes for normal cellular activities. Such a repair mode is referred to as transcription-coupled DNA repair (6Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

Transcription-coupled DNA repair is present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (26Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, transcription repair coupling factor displaces the stalled RNA polymerase, facilitating recruitment of the DNA repair machinery to the lesion. However, the mechanisms, regulation, and intricate connections of the events involved in eukaryotic transcription-coupled DNA repair are considerably more complex and poorly understood. Several studies (16Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat.

Two models have been postulated for the accessibility step of the repair machinery in eukaryotic transcription-coupled DNA repair. The first one is backward displacement of RNA polymerase II from the damaged site to facilitate the access of DNA repair machinery to the DNA lesion. Following DNA repair, RNA polymerase II continues elongation to finish the incomplete mRNA (29den Boom van V. Jaspers N.G. Vermeulen W.

The second model involves the ubiquitination of Rpb1p, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, upon transcriptional arrest and subsequent proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome complex (17Woudstra E.C.

In this model, the incomplete mRNA is discarded, and transcription is reinitiated to generate a new transcript. The occurrence of both models in vitro has been reported in the literature (30Svejstrup J.Q. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting that both options are perhaps present in living eukaryotic cells. However, what exactly occurs at the DNA lesions in the transcriptionally active genes in vivo remains mostly unknown. Here, we have analyzed the fate of RNA polymerase II at the transcriptionally active genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to 4NQO (a UV-mimetic agent)-induced DNA damage in vivo. Our data demonstrate that only Rpb1p, and not other subunits, of elongating RNA polymerase II is degraded to disassemble RNA polymerase II at the coding sequences of the active genes in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage, thus supporting the second model in vivo. Plasmids—The plasmid pFA6a-13Myc-KanMX6 (34Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini III D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pingle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4221) Google Scholar) was used for genomic Myc epitope tagging of the proteins of interest. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast strain harboring a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in RPB1 was obtained from the Young laboratory (Richard A. Young, MIT). The DEF1 deletion mutant and its isogenic wild-type equivalent were gifts from Ali Shilatifard (Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO). Multiple Myc epitope tags were added at the original chromosomal loci of RPB1, RPB2, RPB3, RPB4, RPB6, RPB7, RPB8, RPB9, RPB10, and RPB11 in W303a to generate ZDY4 (Rpb1p-myc, KAN), ZDY5 (Rpb2p-myc, KAN), NSY17 (Rpb3p-myc, KAN), ZDY6 (Rpb4p-myc, KAN), ZDY8 (Rpb6p-myc, KAN), ZDY9 (Rpb7p-myc, KAN), ZDY10 (Rpb8p-myc, KAN), ZDY11 (Rpb9p-myc; KAN), ZDY12 (Rpb10p-myc; KAN), and ZDY13 (Rpb11p-myc, KAN), respectively. The strains ZDY15 (Rpb3p-myc, KAN; rpb1-ts) and ZDY16 (Rpb4p-myc, KAN; rpb1-ts) were generated by adding multiple Myc epitope at the C termini of Rpb3p and Rpb4b, respectively, in the rpb1-ts strain. The DEF1 deletion mutant and its isogenic wild-type equivalent were grown in YPR (yeast extract-peptone plus 2% raffinose) up to an A600 of 0.8 at 30 °C and then transferred to YPG (yeast extract-peptone plus 2% galactose) for 90 min to induce GAL1 prior to 4NQO treatment. Similarly, the GAL7 and GAL10 genes were induced before 4NQO treatment. The 4NQO-treated cells were grown in YPG for different time points at 30 °C prior to formaldehyde cross-linking. For ts mutant and its wild-type equivalent, yeast cells were grown in YPG up to an A600 of 0.85 at 23 °C and then transferred to 37 °C for 1 h before cross-linking. For analysis of the global levels of the Rpb1p, Rpb2p, Rpb3p, Rpb4p, Rpb6p, Rpb7p, Rpb8p, Rpb9p, Rpb10p, and Rpb11p subunits of RNA polymerase II, the yeast strains carrying Myc epitope-tagged Rpb1p, Rpb2p, Rpb3p, Rpb4p, Rpb6p, Rpb7p, Rpb8p, Rpb9p, Rpb10p, and Rpb11p were grown in YPG up to an A600 of 0.8 prior to 4NQO treatment. ChIP Assay—The ChIP assay was performed as described previously (35Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7365-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde and harvested. Following sonication, 100 μl of whole cell lysates (400 μl of lysate from 50 ml of yeast culture) was used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of TE 8.0 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA), and 1 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA was used for PCR analysis. PCRs contained [α-32P]dATP (2.5 μCi for each 25-μl reaction), and the PCR products were detected by autoradiography after separation on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. As a control, “input” DNA was isolated from 5 μl of lysate without going through the immunoprecipitation step and suspended in 100 μl of TE 8.0. To compare PCR signal arising from the immunoprecipitated DNA with the input DNA, 1 μl of the input DNA was used in PCR analysis. Serial dilutions of the input and immunoprecipitated DNAs were used to assess the linear range of PCR amplification as described previously (36Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7365-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All of the PCR data presented in this paper are within the linear range of PCR analysis. Primer pairs used for PCR analysis were as follows: GAL1 (UAS), 5′-CGCTTAACTGCTCATTGCTATATTG-3′ and 5′-TTGTTCGGAGCAGTGCGGCGC-3′; GAL1 (Core), 5′-ATAGGATGATAATGCGATTAGTTTTTTAGCCTT-3′ and 5′-GAAAATGTTGAAAGTATTAGTTAAAGTGGTTATGCA-3′; GAL1 (ORF), 5′-CAGAGGGCTAAGCATGTGTATTCT-3′ and 5′-GTCAATCTCTGGACAAGAACATTC-3′; GAL7 (Core), 5′-CTATGTTCAGTTAGTTTGGCTAGC-3′ and 5′-TTGATGCTCTGCATAATAATGCCC-3′; GAL7 (ORF), 5′-TGAGACCTTGGTCATTTCAAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-ATGGATACCCATTGAGTATGGGAAA-3′; GAL10 (Core), 5′-GCTAAGATAATGGGGCTCTTTACAT-3′ and 5′-TTTCACTTTGTAACTGAGCTGTCAT-3′; GAL10 (ORF), 5′-TTAATGCGAATCATAGTAGTATCGG-3′ and 5′-TTACCAATAGATCACCTGGAAATTC-3′. Autoradiograms were scanned and quantitated by NIH Image version 1.62 (National Institutes of Health). The ratio of immunoprecipitated DNA over the input was presented as %IP. For mutant strains, DNA immunoprecipitated relative to wild type is presented as %WT. DNA Damage Protocol—Yeast cells were grown to a desired A600, and then a concentrated solution of 4NQO in ethanol (0.4 mg/ml) was added to the growing yeast culture to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. The 4NQO-treated cells in liquid YPG medium were allowed to grow at 30 °C for different times and then these cells were processed for either ChIP or Western blot analysis. Genomic DNA Preparation—Five ml of 4NQO-treated yeast cells was harvested at different time points. The genomic DNAs were extracted from the 4NQO-treated yeast cells. Briefly, the harvested cells were suspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) with a 200-μl volume equivalent of glass beads and then were vortexed for 30 min at 4 °C using a Tommy vortexer. The whole cell extract (WCE) was collected by punching a hole at the bottom of the Eppendorf tube and then was extracted with 200 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. The aqueous phase following phenol/chloroform extraction was treated with ethanol to precipitate genomic DNA. The genomic DNAs were analyzed for 4NQO-induced DNA damage at GAL1, GAL7, and GAL10 loci, using the following primer pairs: GAL1 (whole gene), 5′-CGCTTAACTGCTCATTGCTATATTG-3′ and 5′-TTTTGTCCCTGTGTTTTAAAGTTTGTGG-3′; GAL1 (promoter), 5′-CGCTTAACTGCTCATTGCTATATTG-3′ and 5′-GAAAATGTTGAAAGTATTAGTTAAAGTGGTTATGCA-3′; GAL1 (ORF), 5′-CAGTGGATTGTCTTCTTCGGCCGC-3′ and 5′-GTCAATCTCTGGACAAGAACATTC-3′; GAL7 (whole gene), 5′-TCATACATTCTTAAATTGCTTTGCCTCTCC-3′ and 5′-CTTACAAGCTGCATTGTATTCCTAA-3′; GAL10 (whole gene), 5′-TTGTTCGGAGCAGTGCGGCGC-3′ and 5′-AATTTTTGATGTCTCCATGGTGGTA-3′. Analysis of Global Levels of RNA Polymerase II Subunits—The yeast culture (5 ml) was harvested following 4NQO treatment. The harvested cells were lysed to prepare the WCE following the protocol as described previously for the ChIP assay (35Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The WCE was run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then analyzed by Western blot. The anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-TBP antibodies against Myc epitope-tagged subunits of RNA polymerase II and TBP, respectively, were used in the Western blot analysis. The antibody against the C-terminal domain of Rpb1p (8WG16; Covance) was used to detect the global level of Rpb1p. Degradation of Rpb1p but Not Other Subunits of RNA Polymerase II in 4NQO-treated Yeast Cells—To analyze the fate of RNA polymerase II at the DNA lesions in the transcriptionally active genes in vivo, we developed a protocol to cause and analyze 4NQO-induced DNA damage in living yeast cells. 4NQO forms bulky adducts primarily with guanine bases and to a lesser extent with adenine bases in DNA. The bulky 4NQO adducts are processed by nucleotide excision repair. To analyze the formation of 4NQO-induced lesions in the yeast genomic DNA, we extracted genomic DNA from yeast cells following 4NQO treatment (+). As a control, the genomic DNA was also isolated from 4NQO-untreated (-) yeast cells. These genomic DNAs were analyzed by PCR at the GAL1 gene locus. The DNA lesions caused by 4NQO will inhibit PCR at the GAL1 locus; thus, the PCR signal would be significantly reduced or completely lost, depending on the extent of DNA damage at GAL1. Fig. 1A shows a strong PCR signal in the agarose gel just before 4NQO treatment (0 min) of yeast cells. The intensity of the PCR signal was significantly reduced at 10 min after 4NQO treatment, indicating the presence of DNA lesions at the GAL1 gene. The PCR signal at GAL1 was almost lost at a later time point (70 min) following 4NQO treatment. As a control, we show that the PCR signals at the GAL1 locus at the corresponding post-4NQO treatment time points were not reduced or lost in the yeast cells that were not treated with 4NQO (Fig. 1A). Thus, the data presented in Fig. 1A demonstrate that 4NQO induced DNA damage at GAL1 within 10 min following 4NQO treatment. However, severe DNA damage was observed at a later time point. We next analyzed the global level of Rpb1p in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage in yeast cells. In this direction, we treated the growing yeast cells in YPG with 4NQO, and then these cells were allowed to grow for different times as mentioned in the legend to Fig. 1B. These time points were chosen based on the previous studies that demonstrated global degradation of yeast Rpb1p at around 1 h in dextrose-containing growth medium in response to DNA damage (17Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 37Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The WCEs were prepared from the yeast cultures of different post-treatment time points and were analyzed by a Western blot assay using an anti-Myc antibody (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against Myc epitope-tagged Rpb1p. Fig. 1, B and C, shows that Rpb1p began to degrade 10 min after 4NQO treatment, and a dramatic decrease of Rpb1p level was observed at the 100 and 130 min post-NQO treatment time points. The TBP level was monitored as a loading control using an anti-TBP antibody (obtained from Michael R. Green, University of Massachusetts Medical School). Indeed, the TBP level was not significantly changed following 4NQO treatment of yeast cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, the data presented in Fig. 1B demonstrate that Rpb1p is globally degraded at around 2 h following 4NQO treatment in galactose-containing growth medium. However, the loss of Rpb1p could be due to the degradation of Myc epitope that is attached to the C terminus of Rpb1p. To rule out this possibility, we analyzed the level of Myc-tagged Rpb2p subunit of RNA polymerase II at 130 min after 4NQO treatment of yeast cells using an anti-Myc antibody against the Myc epitope in the Western blot assay. Fig. 1D shows that Myc-tagged Rpb2p was not degraded following 4NQO treatment. Thus, Rpb1p itself, but not Myc epitope, was degraded in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage. Further, several studies have previously demonstrated that Rpb1p is globally degraded in response to DNA damage (16Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q.

Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine whether other components of RNA polymerase II were degraded in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage, we analyzed the global levels of the nine representative subunits (such as Rpb2p, Rpb3p, Rpb4p, Rpb6p, Rpb7p, Rpb8p, Rpb9p, Rpb10p, and Rpb11p) of RNA polymerase II in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage in yeast cells. Fig. 1D shows that the global levels of Rpb2p, Rpb3p, Rpb4p, Rpb6p, Rpb7p, Rpb8p, Rpb9p, Rpb10p, and Rpb11p remained unaltered in 4NQO-treated (+) yeast cells when compared with 4NQO-untreated (-) cells. Thus, our data demonstrate that Rpb1p, but not other subunits, of RNA polymerase II is specifically degraded in response to DNA damage. An Elongating Form of Rpb1p Is Degraded at the Active Genes in 4NQO-treated Yeast Cells—Rpb1p is globally degraded in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage. Rpb1 is present within the initiating and elongating RNA polymerase II. However, it is not clear in vivo which form of Rpb1p gets degraded in response to DNA damage. To address this question, we performed a ChIP assay to analyze the level of Rpb1p within the initiating and elongating RNA polymerase II at a transcriptionally active gene, GAL1, at early time points (10 and 40 min) following 4NQO treatment of yeast cells, since the GAL1 gene at the later time point is severely damaged, which might inhibit preinitiation complex formation and hence transcriptional initiation. Fig. 2 shows a nearly 2-fold reduction in TBP recruitment at the GAL1 core promoter at 10 min post-4NQO treatment, possibly due to partial damage at the core promoter by 4NQO. Consistently, recruitment of the initiating Rpb1p (and hence RNA polymerase II) at the GAL1 core promoter was reduced by around 2-fold (Fig. 2). Strikingly, a nearly 7-fold reduction in the association of elongating Rpb1p with the GAL1 ORF was observed at 10 min post-4NQO treatment (Fig. 2). Such a dramatic decrease of Rpb1p association with the GAL1 ORF indicates the degradation of the elongating form of Rpb1p at GAL1 in vivo. Next, we analyzed the association of initiating and elongating Rpb1p as well as TBP with GAL1 at 40 min post-4NQO treatment. Recruitment of TBP at the GAL1 core promoter was almost lost (Fig. 2). This might be due to severe damage of the GAL1 core promoter 40 min after 4NQO treatment, leading to the inhibition of the preinitiation complex (TBP and RNA polymerase II are the two important components of the preinitiation complex) formation and hence transcriptional initiation. Consistently, association of initiating and elongating Rpb1p with GAL1 was dramatically lost (Fig. 2). Collectively, our data indicate that elongating Rpb1p is degraded at the GAL1 gene at the 10 min time point following 4NQO treatment. However, at the later post-4NQO treatment time point (40 min), preinitiation complex was not formed due to severe damage of the core promoter, and hence RNA polymerase II was unable to enter the elongation cycle. Thus, we next performed a time course for the association of Rpb1p with GAL1 within the first 20 min (0, 5, 10, and 20 min) following 4NQO treatment. The whole GAL1 gene was significantly damaged in yeast cells within 20 min of 4NQO treatment (Fig. 3A). Similarly, whole promoter and ORF of GAL1 were also damaged within 20 min (Fig. 3A). However, the smaller regions (termed as ChIP fragments) at GAL1 that were used for PCR analysis in the ChIP experiments (see below) were not damaged within 20 min of 4NQO treatment (Fig. 3A), thus allowing the ChIP analysis following 4NQO treatment. Fig. 3, B and C, shows that the association of Rpb1p with the GAL1 coding sequence was dramatically reduced as compared with that with the core promoter. Likewise, the reduction of TBP association with the GAL1 core promoter is much less than that of the elongating Rpb1p following 4NQO treatment (Fig. 3D), consistent with the recruitment pattern of initiating Rpb1p in response to DNA damage (Fig. 3, B and C). However, recruitment of factors upstream of TBP binding, namely activator (Gal4p) and co-activator (SAGA-TAF12p), was not significantly altered following 4NQO treatment (Fig. 3E). Together, these results suggest that Rpb1p in the GAL1 coding sequence is preferentially degraded in response to DNA damage. However, the decrease in the level of Rpb1p at the GAL1 coding sequence could be due to the defect in the promoter clearance or indirect effect of the changes in general transcription patterns. To rule out this possibility, we analyzed recruitment of Rpb1p to the GAL1 coding sequence at 20 min post-4NQO treatment in the presence and absence of Def1p that is essential for Rpb1p degradation (17Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). If the degradation of elongating Rpb1 occurs in response to DNA damage, the level of Rpb1p at the GAL1 coding sequence would increase in Δdef1 in comparison with that in the isogenic wild-type equivalent. Indeed, Fig. 3F shows a significant increase in the level of Rpb1p at the GAL1 coding sequence in the absence of Def1p. Thus, our data clearly demonstrate that the elongating Rpb1p is degraded at GAL1 in response to DNA damage in vivo. Next, we asked whether elongating Rpb1p is also degraded at other active genes in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage. To address this question, we analyzed association of Rpb1p with the core promoters and coding sequences of two other active GAL genes, such as GAL7 and GAL10, at 20 min following 4NQO treatment. These genes were significantly damaged when yeast cells were treated with 4NQO for 20 min (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4, B–D, shows that the recruitment of Rpb1p as well as TBP at the core promoters of the GAL7 and GAL10 genes was modestly reduced following 4NQO treatment. Strikingly, the association of Rpb1p with the coding sequences of these genes was dramatically reduced following 4NQO treatment (Fig. 4, B and C), consistent with the results obtained at the GAL1 coding sequence (Fig. 3, B and C). Collectively, our data demonstrate that the elongating Rpb1p is degraded at the active genes in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage. Rpb1p Is Essential for the Assembly of RNA Polymerase II at the Active Gene—We next inquired into the fate of RNA polymerase II following degradation of its Rpb1p subunit at the active gene in response to DNA damage. To address this question, we analyzed association of the Rpb3p and Rpb4p subunits of RNA polymerase II with the GAL1 ORF in the RPB1 wild-type and ts mutant strains at the nonpermissive temperature. Both of the subunits of RNA polymerase II were associated with the GAL1 ORF in the wild-type strain (Fig. 5, A and B). However, association of these subunits with the GAL1 ORF was almost lost in the rpb1-ts mutant strain (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that Rpb1p is essential for the assembly of RNA polymerase II subunits at the active gene in vivo. Elongating RNA Polymerase II Is Disassembled at the Active Genes in 4NQO-treated Yeast Cells—RNA polymerase II is disassembled at the active gene when rpb1-ts strain was grown at nonpermissive temperature for 1 h (Fig. 5, A and B). This observation indicates that the degradation of Rpb1p at the DNA lesion would disassemble RNA polymerase II. To test this possibility, we analyzed association of the Rpb4p subunit of RNA polymerase II with the core promoter and coding sequence of the GAL1 gene following 4NQO treatment. Fig. 6A shows that the association of Rpb4p with the GAL1 ORF was dramatically more reduced as compared with the core promoter following 4NQO treatment, consistent with the association pattern of Rpb1p with GAL1 in response to DNA damage (Fig. 3, B and C). However, unlike Rpb1p, Rpb4p was not globally degraded following 4NQO treatment (Fig. 1D). Together, these observations support the fact that the association of Rpb4p with the GAL1 ORF was lost following degradation of the elongating Rpb1p in response to DNA damage, consistent with the results obtained with the rpb1-ts mutant strain (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, elongating RNA polymerase II is disassembled at GAL1 following degradation of Rpb1p in response to DNA damage. Similar results were also obtained at other genes, such as GAL7 and GAL10 (Fig. 6, B and C). Several studies have demonstrated that the Rpb1p subunit of RNA polymerase II is globally degraded in response to DNA damage (16Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it is not known whether the initiating or elongating form of Rpb1p is degraded in response to DNA damage. Recently, Somesh et al. (37Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have biochemically demonstrated that the Rpb1p subunit of the elongating, but not initiating, form of RNA polymerase II is ubiquitinated in response to DNA damage, which subsequently becomes the target for proteasomal degradation. Further, they have demonstrated that Rpb1p is globally ubiquitinated when yeast cells are treated with 6-azauracil, suggesting the ubiquitination of elongating Rpb1p in vivo. However, there is no direct demonstration of the degradation of elongating Rpb1p at the DNA lesion in the active gene in vivo. Here, we provide direct in vivo evidence for the degradation of Rpb1p within the elongating, but not initiating, form of RNA polymerase II in response to DNA damage. The degradation of elongating Rpb1p eventually leads to global decrease of the Rbp1p level following DNA damage. Elongating RNA polymerase II along with several associated transcription factors stalls at the DNA lesion, thus making it inaccessible to the DNA repair machinery. However, it remains unclear how DNA repair machinery can access the DNA lesion. One possibility would be to disassemble RNA polymerase II and associated factors from the damage site, making it accessible to the DNA repair machinery. Indeed, our data show that RNA polymerase II is disassembled in the absence of Rpb1p. Further, RNA polymerase II has been shown to be the loading dock for several transcription factors at the coding sequences of the active genes (38Buratowski S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 39Buratowski S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 40Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of RNA polymerase II at the coding sequence following Rpb1p degradation in response to DNA damage would disassemble transcription elongation machinery, allowing the DNA repair factors to access the damage site, as suggested previously (16Lee K.B.

Although the Rpb1p subunit of RNA polymerase II is degraded in response to DNA damage, it remains unknown whether only Rpb1p or the other subunits of RNA polymerase II is targeted for degradation. To address this question, we have analyzed in this study the global levels of the Rpb2p, Rpb3p, Rpb4p, Rpb6p, Rpb7p, Rpb8p, Rpb9p, Rpb10p, and Rpb11p subunits of RNA polymerase II following 4NQO-induced DNA damage. Interestingly, the levels of these RNA polymerase II subunits remain unaltered in response to DNA damage. Thus, our data demonstrate that only Rpb1p, and not the whole RNA polymerase II complex, is degraded following DNA damage. Such a highly selective degradation of Rpb1p provides the cell an economical way to efficiently recycle other RNA polymerase II subunits. Consistent with our results, Chen et al. (42Chen X. Ruggiero C. Li X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4617-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that Rpb2p and Rpb9p subunits of RNA polymerase II are not degraded in response to UV-induced DNA damage. In summary, we have demonstrated in vivo that only Rpb1p and not the other subunits of the elongating RNA polymerase II is degraded at the transcriptionally active genes in response to 4NQO-induced DNA damage. Following Rpb1p degradation, elongating RNA polymerase II is disassembled at the DNA lesion (Fig. 7). However, whether such a disassembly of RNA polymerase II promotes DNA repair machinery to access the DNA lesion in vivo remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, our study provides the direct in vivo evidence for degradation of the elongating, but not initiating, form of Rbp1p to disintegrate RNA polymerase II in response to DNA damage.

https://openalex.org/W1989320965,"Background Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), catalysing demethylation of mono- and di-methylated histone H3-K4 or K9, exhibits diverse transcriptional activities by mediating chromatin reconfiguration. The telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, encoding an essential component for telomerase activity that is involved in cellular immortalization and transformation, is silent in most normal human cells while activated in up to 90% of human cancers. It remains to be defined how exactly the transcriptional activation of the hTERT gene occurs during the oncogenic process. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we determined the effect of LSD1 on hTERT transcription. In normal human fibroblasts with a tight hTERT repression, a pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 led to a weak hTERT expression, and a robust induction of hTERT mRNA was observed when LSD1 and histone deacetylases (HDACs) were both inhibited. Small interference RNA-mediated depletion of both LSD1 and CoREST, a co-repressor in HDAC-containing complexes, synergistically activated hTERT transcription. In cancer cells, inhibition of LSD1 activity or knocking-down of its expression led to significant increases in levels of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that LSD1 occupied the hTERT proximal promoter, and its depletion resulted in elevated di-methylation of histone H3-K4 accompanied by increased H3 acetylation locally in cancer cells. Moreover, during the differentiation of leukemic HL60 cells, the decreased hTERT expression was accompanied by the LSD1 recruitment to the hTERT promoter. Conclusions/Significance LSD1 represses hTERT transcription via demethylating H3-K4 in normal and cancerous cells, and together with HDACs, participates in the establishment of a stable repression state of the hTERT gene in normal or differentiated malignant cells. The findings contribute to better understandings of hTERT/telomerase regulation, which may be implicated in the development of therapeutic strategies for telomerase dysregulation-associated human diseases including cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2026642422,"BRCA1 has been implicated in numerous DNA repair pathways that maintain genome integrity, however the function responsible for its tumor suppressor activity in breast cancer remains obscure. To identify the most highly conserved of the many BRCA1 functions, we screened the evolutionarily distant eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae for mutants that suppressed the G1 checkpoint arrest and lethality induced following heterologous BRCA1 expression. A genome-wide screen in the diploid deletion collection combined with a screen of ionizing radiation sensitive gene deletions identified mutants that permit growth in the presence of BRCA1. These genes delineate a metabolic mRNA pathway that temporally links transcription elongation (SPT4, SPT5, CTK1, DEF1) to nucleopore-mediated mRNA export (ASM4, MLP1, MLP2, NUP2, NUP53, NUP120, NUP133, NUP170, NUP188, POM34) and cytoplasmic mRNA decay at P-bodies (CCR4, DHH1). Strikingly, BRCA1 interacted with the phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) carboxy terminal domain (P-CTD), phosphorylated in the pattern specified by the CTDK-I kinase, to induce DEF1-dependent cleavage and accumulation of a RNAPII fragment containing the P-CTD. Significantly, breast cancer associated BRCT domain defects in BRCA1 that suppressed P-CTD cleavage and lethality in yeast also suppressed the physical interaction of BRCA1 with human SPT5 in breast epithelial cells, thus confirming SPT5 as a relevant target of BRCA1 interaction. Furthermore, enhanced P-CTD cleavage was observed in both yeast and human breast cells following UV-irradiation indicating a conserved eukaryotic damage response. Moreover, P-CTD cleavage in breast epithelial cells was BRCA1-dependent since damage-induced P-CTD cleavage was only observed in the mutant BRCA1 cell line HCC1937 following ectopic expression of wild type BRCA1. Finally, BRCA1, SPT5 and hyperphosphorylated RPB1 form a complex that was rapidly degraded following MMS treatment in wild type but not BRCA1 mutant breast cells. These results extend the mechanistic links between BRCA1 and transcriptional consequences in response to DNA damage and suggest an important role for RNAPII P-CTD cleavage in BRCA1-mediated cancer suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1993203517,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has emerged as an attractive cytokine that selectively targets cancer cells, however its efficacy has been challenged by a number of resistance mechanisms. Therefore, the current study investigated the potential of dipyridamole to enhance TRAIL efficacy and the probable underlying mechanisms. Dipyridamole dramatically sensitized p53-mutant human cancer cell lines: SW480, MG63 and DU145, to the antitumor activity of TRAIL, as evidenced by enabling TRAIL to efficiently cleave initiator and executioner caspases. Although dipyridamole upregulated both DR4 and DR5 and increased their cell surface expression, RNA interference revealed a preferential dependence on DR5. Moreover, dipyridamole inhibited survivin expression and its important consequences were confirmed by small interfering RNA. Mechanistically, dipyridamole induced transcriptional shutdown of survivin expression accompanying G1 arrest that was characterized by downregulation of D-type cyclins and cdk6. In addition, a transcriptional mechanism powered by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) induction was responsible for DR5 upregulation by dipyridamole. Importantly, dipyridamole-induced enhancement of TRAIL efficacy and alterations of protein expression were independent of either protein kinase A or protein kinase G. In conclusion, findings of the present study described novel mechanisms of dipyridamole action and highlighted its promising use as a potential enhancer of TRAIL efficacy."

The relative orientation of this ligand-receptor pair is investigated here using the novel technique of disulfide trapping by random mutagenesis (DTRM) and molecular modeling. In the DTRM technique, an unpaired cysteine is introduced in the ligand, and a library of randomly mutagenized receptors is screened to identify mutants that introduce a cysteine at a position in the receptor that allows functional interactions with the ligand. By repeating this analysis at six positions of C5a, we identify six unique sets of intermolecular interactions for the C5a-C5aR complex, which are then compared with an independently developed computational three-dimensional model of the complex. This analysis reveals that the interface of the receptor N terminus with the cysteine-containing ligand molecules is selected from a variety of possible receptor conformations that exist in dynamic equilibrium.

In contrast, DTRM identifies a single position in the second extracellular loop of the receptor that interacts specifically with a cysteine probe placed in the C-terminal tail of the C5a ligand. One of the most biologically important families of receptors is the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorC5acomplement factor 5aC5aRcomplement factor 5a receptorTMtransmembrane helixECextracellular loopNTN terminusDTRMdisulfide trapping by random mutagenesisPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. which eukaryotic cells use to sense signals as diverse as light, odorants, small molecules, and polypeptide hormones (1Bockaert J.

Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1414-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), have a shared topology made up of seven transmembrane domains (TMs) linked by intracellular and extracellular (EC) loops, along with an extracellular N terminus and intracellular C terminus (Fig. 1). These receptors also have a shared mechanism of action, whereby the activated receptor serves as a guanosine exchange factor on the α subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein, thus transmitting the signal to the interior of the cell. Many drugs are directed against GPCRs, including adrenergic, muscarinic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and histaminergic receptors. Taken together, drugs acting on GPCRs make up an estimated 50% of the current pharmacopoeia (3Drews J. Science. 2000; 287: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptor complement factor 5a complement factor 5a receptor transmembrane helix extracellular loop N terminus disulfide trapping by random mutagenesis 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. The structural basis of receptor-ligand interaction is of great interest in both basic and applied pharmacology. In the case of GPCRs, a central question is how receptors with a single common topology can be activated by such a wide variety of ligands. A related question is how specificity is built into these receptors, so that each is activated only by the appropriate ligands. Many GPCRs are activated by polypeptide ligands, including chemokines such as SDF-1 (CXCL12), physiologic modulators such as angiotensin II, glycoprotein hormones such as luteinizing hormone, and chemotactic factors such as complement factor 5a (C5a). These ligands are too large to fit entirely in an interhelical cleft of a GPCR, so their bulk must serve some adaptive function other than receptor activation per se. In some cases, the ligand is recruited by its affinity for the receptor extracellular domains, and a second discrete domain of the ligand then activates the switch mechanism. Alternatively, some large ligands activate their receptors by interacting with large extracellular domains (as in the case of glycoprotein hormone receptors) (4Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), or by serving as a protease to cleave the N terminus of the receptor (as in the case of the thrombin receptor) (5Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In this study we examine the nature of the interaction between C5a and the N-terminal segment of its receptor, C5aR. C5a is a 74-amino acid polypeptide that is proteolytically elaborated by the serum complement cascade at sites of inflammation; it serves as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils, which express the C5aR (6Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). As a potent anaphylatoxin, C5a has been examined as a possible therapeutic target in sepsis, arthritis, and other inflammatory states (7Allegretti M. Moriconi A. Beccari A.R. Di Bitondo R. Bizzarri C. Bertini R. Colotta F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The C5a/C5aR interaction has previously been described by a two-site model (8Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 9Mollison K.W. Mandecki W. Zuiderweg E.R. Fayer L. Fey T.A. Krause R.A. Conway R.G. Miller L. Edalji R.P.

Molineaux C.J. Konteatis Z.D. Rosen H. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14446-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first interaction is between the N terminus of the C5aR and undetermined components of the C5a ligand; the C-terminal tail of C5a then enters an interhelical pocket of the C5aR to form the second-site interaction. As evidence for the role of the first-site interaction, truncation of the N terminus reduces the affinity of the receptor for full-length ligand, but preserves the efficacy of hexapeptide analogs of the C5a C-terminal tail (8Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Conversely, the small molecule L-584,020 competes with full-length C5a but not with hexapeptides (8Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), suggesting that L-584,020 inhibits binding but not activation. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy has shown that the structure of the isolated C5aR N terminus is altered by incubation with C5a, suggesting that the N terminus of the receptor interacts with the ligand (11Chen Z.

Because hexapeptide analogs such as W5Cha are full agonists for the C5aR, the first site is apparently not a key component of the switch mechanism (8Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J.

Instead, the first site confers “address”-like specificity on the interaction. The second site involves the C terminus of C5a and an interhelical pocket of the C5aR (15Gerber B.O. Meng E.C. Dotsch V.

Hexapeptide analogs of the C5a C terminus can serve as full agonists or as antagonists for the receptor, albeit with decreased potency (17Kawai M. Quincy D.A. Lane B. Mollison K.W. Or Y.S. Luly J.R. Carter G.W. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and this activity can be modulated by making mutations in the interhelical pocket (15Gerber B.O. Meng E.C.

Lu B. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18077-18082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we used random saturation mutagenesis of the C5aR to demonstrate that no single residue of the N terminus is responsible for ligand affinity. Rather, the affinity is built from multiple individually weak interactions (12Hagemann I.S. Narzinski K.D. Floyd D.H. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36783-36792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In our random mutagenesis experiments, mutations were introduced into multiple positions within the receptor region of interest; receptors that retained signaling ability despite their multiple mutations were selected by a functional screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Surprisingly, we found that positions 24–30 of the C5aR showed a marked propensity to change to cysteine in functional mutants. Because human C5a contains an unpaired cysteine that is solvent-accessible, we reasoned that the cysteine in the ligand could serve as a disulfide-trapping “bait” to identify interacting regions of the receptor, using a library of mutant receptors containing cysteines as “prey.” We refer to this technique as “disulfide trapping by random mutagenesis,” or DTRM. In principle, it should be generally applicable to a wide range of protein-protein interactions. In the work described here, we use DTRM to study the interaction between C5a and the C5aR. Specifically, we introduce an unpaired cysteine at various positions in the C5a ligand, then identify regions of the receptor that are susceptible to forming disulfide bonds with the mutant ligand. The results provide a series of constraints on the receptor-ligand interaction, allowing it to be described at a new level of molecular detail. Yeast Strains—Yeast strain BY1142 (20Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

This strain expresses a chimeric Gα subunit: the first 41 residues of the endogenous yeast Gα subunit Gpa1 are substituted for the first 33 residues of human Gαi3. The result is a predominantly human Gα subunit that can be activated by mammalian receptors, but can also signal to downstream components of the yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (21Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mitogen-activated protein kinase mating cascade is engineered so that G protein activation causes transcription of the PFUS1-HIS3 reporter. Thus, G protein or receptor activity allows the yeast to grow on histidine-deficient medium. Strain BY1173 has the genotype MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 can1 gpa1Δ:ade2Δ::3xHA far1Δ::ura3Δ fus1::PFUS1-HIS3 LEU2::PFUS1-LacZ sst2Δ::ura3Δ ste2Δ::G418R trp1::GPA1/Gαi1 (22Brown A.J. Dyos S.L.

The integrated PFUS1-LacZ reporter causes G protein activation to elicit β-galactosidase expression. Yeast were transformed by the standard lithium acetate procedure and grown at 30 °C. Construction of Mutant Ligands—Point mutations were introduced into the wild-type C5a ligand by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene). Plasmid construction was verified by sequencing (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). β-Galactosidase Assay—Yeast BY1173 transformed with wild-type C5aR and ligand plasmids or empty vector was grown in suspension at 30 °C under selective conditions. To assess yeast density after overnight growth, the A600 of each culture was measured using a Spectronic-20 spectrophotometer (Bausch & Lomb). All cultures were assayed at A600 of ∼0.15. For each culture, a standard quantity of yeast (15 μl divided by the A600) was seeded into a 96-well microtiter plate containing yeast growth medium (to 100 μl) and lysis/substrate buffer containing the final concentrations of 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside, and 25 mm PIPES, pH 6.8. The quantity of yeast was sufficiently small that there was no turbidity visible in the wells. The assay plate was sealed and incubated at 37 °C. After 1 h, color development was halted by addition of Na2CO3 to 0.2 m, and A570 was measured on a Bio-Rad Model 680 microplate reader. Library Construction and Screening—Libraries of mutant C5aRs were generated as described previously (12Hagemann I.S. Narzinski K.D. Floyd D.H. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36783-36792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, the nucleotide sequence of the region of interest (NT or EC2) was flanked by silent restriction sites, then replaced by a noncoding “stuffer” sequence to prevent wild-type contamination of the library. Double-stranded oligonucleotides doped with mutations at a frequency of 20% (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were subcloned into the appropriate sites of C5aR to create libraries of >105 mutant receptors. For the NT library, residues 2–32 of the C5aR were mutagenized; for the EC2 library, the mutations spanned residues 175–199. We screened the libraries for receptors whose behavior suggested that they made disulfide interactions with cysteine-containing ligands. To accomplish this, yeast BY1142 was cotransformed with a receptor library (ADE2 vector) and with a C5a mutant ligand plasmid (URA3 vector), then grown under Ade-Ura- selection. After 2 days of growth, colonies were replica-plated onto His-Ura- plates with 1 mm Ade to assay them for receptor signaling. Functional receptors conferred histidine prototrophy and allowed growth on this medium; furthermore, the strength of signaling was assessed by replica plating on media containing increasing concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product. Growth on 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was considered to be receptor-dependent if colonies maintained their white color, indicating continued adenine prototrophy. Colonies that lost their receptor plasmid became reliant on scarce environmental adenine, therefore either failing to grow or producing a red pigment that was cause for exclusion from our screen. Plasmids conferring ligand-dependent growth on 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole were selected for further analysis. The mutant receptor plasmids were isolated from these colonies by plasmid rescue, sequenced, and resubjected to the growth assay to confirm their phenotypes. Receptors were also assayed for their ability to be activated by C5a C27R. Those receptors that were activated by the cysteine-containing ligand but not by the “Cys-less” ligand C5a C27R were considered to be hits in our screen. Statistical Methods—The number of cysteines expected at each position under the null hypothesis (absence of any selective pressure favoring cysteine) was calculated as described in the supplementary materials. Expected and actual values were compared by the two-tailed Fisher's exact test (GraphPad Software) with expectation values rounded to the nearest integer. Molecular Modeling—The building of the three-dimensional model of the complex between C5aR and C5a, which followed general procedures developed earlier (24Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R.

(2008) Biochemistry, in press. Briefly, energy calculations were performed by minimizing the energy of atom-atom interactions between the molecular fragments, such as fragments of C5a or C5aR, involved in each calculation. During minimization, the fragments were allowed to move as rigid bodies in six dimensions each (three rotations and three translations). The dihedral angles of the side chains (but not of the backbone) were also involved in minimization. Also, at each step of minimization (several times during the process), the side chains were repacked to yield optimal positions before starting minimization itself. C5aR—A three-dimensional model of the TM region of human C5aR was developed earlier (26Matsumoto M.L. Narzinski K. Kiser P.D. Nikiforovich G.V. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3105-3121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using the x-ray structure of rhodopsin as a template with the transmembrane helices defined as Ile38–Ala63 (TM1), Asn71–Glu98 (TM2), Ala107–Val138 (TM3), Ala150–Phe172 (TM4), Glu199–Phe224 (TM5), Arg236–Phe267 (TM6), and Leu281–Tyr300 (TM7). All realistic low-energy conformations of the EC loops were restored independently according to a modeling procedure developed earlier (25Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3780-3789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The EC loops were defined as EC1 (His99–Gly106), EC2 (Leu173–Arg198), and EC3 (Leu268–Lys280); a total of 29 low-energy options for the conformers of the “package” EC1 + EC2 + EC3 were found. The package was mounted onto the TM region of C5aR and the “most open” conformation of the loops (that with the largest distance between the “tips” of EC2 (Cα177) and EC3 (Cα276)) was selected for the three-dimensional model of the TM region + EC loops of C5aR used in further docking of C5a and its fragments. C5a-(59–74) and Docking—First, fragment C5a-(65–69) was docked within an opening in the three-dimensional model that allowed access to Glu199, Arg206, and Asp282, which are the residues suggested as possible contacts to C5a by site-directed mutagenesis (see e.g. Ref. 7Allegretti M.

The backbone conformation of C5a-(65–69) was extracted from the NMR/calculation data on YSFKPMPLaR, a known agonist of C5aR (27Finch A.M. Vogen S.M. Sherman S.A. Kirnarsky L. Taylor S.M.

Res. 1999; 53: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Docking was performed by a systematic search on the six-dimensional grid (three translations and three rotations) that covered a total of 2,268 starting orientations of C5a-(65–69) within the TM region of C5aR. Twenty low-energy orientations of C5a-(65–69) without steric clashes with the EC loops (Cα-Cα distances ≥ 4 Å) were selected for further consideration. Then, all low-energy conformations of fragment C5a-(59–74) were obtained assuming that (i) backbone conformations of C5a-(65–69) remained the same; (ii) the backbone conformation of C5a-(59–62) was the same as revealed by NMR data for C5a (the PDB entry 1KJS (29Zuiderweg E.R. Nettesheim D.G. Mollison K.W. Carter G.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Zhang X. Boyar W. Galakatos N. Gonnella N.C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)); (iii) the backbone conformations of C5a-(63–65) and -(70–74) might vary, but the distance between Cα59 and Cα74 was kept greater than about 22 Å (otherwise it would be impossible to extend the structure to the entire C5a). The obtained conformations of C5a-(59–74) were checked as to possible steric clashes with C5aR for all selected low-energy orientations of C5a-(65–69) and, in turn, subjected to energy minimization. Four types of low-energy orientations of C5a-(59–74) possessed no steric clashes with C5aR and were used for placing the entire C5a within C5aR. Entire Complex of C5a and C5aR—Independently, energy calculations were performed for the N-terminal segment 8–41 of C5aR (NT 8–41) resulting in 185 low-energy conformations of the peptide backbone. (The N-terminal segment 1–7 was not included due to difficulties in modeling the carbohydrate moiety at the N-glycosylated site.) When mounted onto the three-dimensional model of C5aR (onto the N-terminal residues 38–41 of TM1), only 44 conformations of NT 8–41 possessed no steric clashes with C5aR. Then, possible orientations of the entire structure of C5a were restored by overlapping the rigid core C5a-(1–62) from PDB entry 1KJS with each of the four selected orientations of C5a-(59–74) within C5aR. It was found that only one specific orientation of C5a satisfied the requirements of spatial proximity of positions 15, 18, 19, 20, 27, and 46 in C5a to specific residues in the N-terminal segment 8–41 of C5aR, as was suggested by available site-directed mutagenesis data (31Bubeck P.

Seventeen conformations of NT 8–41 (out of 185) and 11 conformations of the EC1 + EC2 + EC3 loop package (out of 29) did not show steric clashes with this particular orientation of C5a; all these conformations together with the selected orientation of C5a and the TM region of C5aR make up the final model of the C5a-C5aR complex. Generation of Mutant C5a Ligands with Unpaired Sulfhydryls—The wild-type C5a ligand contains seven cysteine residues, of which six (Cys-21, -22, -34, -47, -54, and -55) are involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds that stabilize an α-helical bundle (Fig. 2A). The seventh cysteine (Cys27) has an outwardly directed side chain (29Zuiderweg E.R. Nettesheim D.G. Mollison K.W. Carter G.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Zhang X. Boyar W. Galakatos N. Gonnella N.C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that was previously used for disulfide trapping analysis (12Hagemann I.S. Narzinski K.D. Floyd D.H. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36783-36792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The data in our earlier study showed that in the receptor-ligand complex, Cys27 of C5a is positioned close to residues 24–30 of the C5aR. To apply DTRM to this system, we moved the unpaired cysteine to eight positions in C5a (Fig. 2, B and C). In each of these bait mutants, Cys27 was replaced with Arg; this residue was chosen because it replaces Cys27 in rodent C5a sequences, which are otherwise highly conserved relative to human. The sites in the C5a ligand were chosen based on their surface accessibility, previous data demonstrating potential roles in receptor binding, and inspection of our initial models of the docked C5a ligand (12Hagemann I.S. Narzinski K.D. Floyd D.H. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36783-36792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To verify that the ligands were functional, we coexpressed them with the C5aR in a S. cerevisiae expression system with a LacZ (β-galactosidase) reporter. The mutants were generally able to activate the C5aR with efficacy similar to the wild-type ligand (Fig. 2B), suggesting that they were properly folded and directed through the secretory pathway in yeast. In particular, the C27R/N64C ligand showed full functionality, indicating that N-linked glycosylation is not essential for C5a function. The C27R/D24C and C27R/S66C ligands showed some decrease in efficacy relative to wild-type. Immunoblotting showed the ligands to be expressed at levels roughly similar to wild-type, although differences in the level of expression could account for some of the variation in function (data not shown). Individual mutant ligands were used to screen libraries of C5aR mutants generated by random saturation mutagenesis (denoted by letters from “A”to“E”), where changes had been randomly introduced into receptor regions of interest. We hypothesized that some randomly mutated receptors would contain cysteine side chains at positions suitable for forming a disulfide bond with the mutant ligand, thereby complementing the affinity lost via receptor mutagenesis. Use of C5a C27R/D24C to Trap Interactions with the C5aR NT—As an initial test of the DTRM technique, we screened a library of N-terminal mutant C5aRs with the ligand C5a C27R/D24C (Fig. 3). Relative to our earlier work with the wild-type ligand (12Hagemann I.S. Narzinski K.D. Floyd D.H. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36783-36792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we predicted that moving the unpaired cysteine by a small number of amino acid positions would cause a correspondingly small displacement in the receptor positions where a disulfide cross-link could form. When the N-terminal library was screened against ligand C27R/D24C in yeast BY1142 (an engineered yeast strain in which C5a receptor signaling allows growth on selective media; see “Experimental Procedures”), we identified 11 receptors meeting our screening criteria, in that they were activated by C5a C27R/D24C but were much less strongly activated by C5a C27R (Fig. 3, the A series of receptors). We interpret these receptors as being those whose ligand affinity depends upon the presence of a cysteine in the ligand. We noted that all of the A receptors, with the exception of A20, contained at least one and usually two cysteine residues. These cysteines were concentrated in two bands within the N terminus: positions 10–12 and 23–27 (Fig. 3). We wished to determine whether these cysteines exceeded the number that would have arisen by chance in the absence of selective pressure favoring cysteine insertion. To this end, we calculated the probability of incorporating a cysteine at each position, and multiplied this by the number of selected receptors to estimate the expected number of cysteines in the set as a whole. At receptor positions 10–12, most of the cysteines were able to arise via a single nucleotide mutation, making them somewhat likely to occur even by chance. In the absence of selective pressure favoring cysteines, a set of 11 randomly selected receptors would have been expected"
https://openalex.org/W2006311296,"The Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP) belongs to the subfamily of adapter proteins that negatively regulate cellular signalling initiated by tyrosine kinases. SLAP has a unique, myristylated N-terminus, followed by SH3 and SH2 domains with high homology to Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK) and a unique C-terminal tail, which is important for c-Cbl binding. We have previously shown that SLAP negatively regulates platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced mitogenesis in fibroblasts and we now report that it regulates F-actin assembly for dorsal ruffles formation. c-Cbl mediated SLAP inhibition towards actin remodelling. Moreover, SLAP enhanced PDGF-induced c-Cbl phosphorylation by SFK. In contrast, SLAP mitogenic inhibition was not mediated by c-Cbl, but it rather involved a competitive mechanism with SFK for PDGF-receptor (PDGFR) association and mitogenic signalling. Accordingly, phosphorylation of the Src mitogenic substrates Stat3 and Shc were reduced by SLAP. Thus, we concluded that SLAP regulates PDGFR signalling by two independent mechanisms: a competitive mechanism for PDGF-induced Src mitogenic signalling and a non-competitive mechanism for dorsal ruffles formation mediated by c-Cbl."
https://openalex.org/W2033485136,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic disorder, which begins as indolent chronic phase but inevitably progresses to fatal blast crisis. p210BCR/ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, is responsible for disease initiation but molecular mechanism(s) underlying disease evolution remains largely unknown. To explore this process, we employed retroviral insertional mutagenesis to CML-exhibiting p210BCR/ABL transgenic mice (Tg). Virus infection induced acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in p210BCR/ABL Tg with a higher frequency and in a shorter latency than wild-type littermates, and inverse PCR detected two retrovirus common integration sites (CISs) in p210BCR/ABL Tg tumors. Interestingly, one CIS was the transgene itself, where retrovirus integrations induced upregulation of p210BCR/ABL and production of truncated BCR/ABL with an enhanced kinase activity. Another CIS was Notch1 gene, where retrovirus integrations resulted in overexpression of Notch1 and generation of Notch1 lacking the C-terminal region (Notch1DeltaC) associated with stable expression of its activated product, C-terminal-truncated Notch intracellular domain (NICD Delta C). In addition, generation of Tg for both p210BCR/ABL and Notch1DeltaC developed ALL in a shortened period with Stat5 activation, demonstrating the cooperative oncogenicity of Notch1DeltaC/NICD Delta C with p210BCR/ABL involving Stat5-mediated pathway. These results demonstrated that overexpression/enhanced kinase activity of BCR/ABL and altered expression of Notch1 induces acute leukemia in a transgenic model for CML."

Although SCT constructs have been reported for several different mouse and human MHC-I complexes, only the Kb/OVA SCT (Ovalbumin257–264-[G4S]3-β2m-[G4S]4-Kb) has been rigorously characterized (10Yu Y.Y.

Specifically, in initial studies, the Kb/OVA SCT was found to remain biochemically intact when expressed in cells because all three SCT components were linker-attached as detected in Western blots. Cellular proteases did not sever the antigenic peptide sequence from the SCT, making it unlikely that a cleaved peptide could rebind to the severed SCT or other endogenous Kb molecules. This important finding verified a necessary condition of the SCT approach: direct presentation of the covalently bound SCT peptide to bypass the normal inefficiencies of MHC-I processing, presentation, or cross-presentation (20Princiotta M.F.

Reits E. Neefjes J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 952-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Cross-presentation is a major pathway by which DNA vaccines elicit T cell responses, but the inefficiency of cross-presentation can be a contributing factor to relatively weak T cell responses after DNA vaccination. In addition, recent studies have documented the cross-presentation of synthetic peptides from recombinant MHC-I tetramers used to activate T cells (22Ge Q. Stone J.D. Thompson M.T. Cochran J.R. Rushe M. Eisen H.N. Chen J. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13729-13734Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Schott E. Bertho N. Ge Q. Maurice M.M. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13735-13740Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus biochemical stability of the SCT is a requirement for improved DNA vaccination or MHC-I tetramer approaches. Furthermore in these initial characterizations, the Kb/OVA SCT was found to have a significantly prolonged cell surface half-life compared with native Kb/OVA complexes or Kb loaded with endogenous peptides (18Lybarger L. Yu Y.Y. Miley M.J. Fremont D.H. Myers N. Primeau T. Truscott S.M. Connolly J.M. Hansen T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27105-27111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given that peptide occupancy determines the surface half-life of MHC-I, SCT were presumed to have superior peptide occupancy compared with native Kb/OVA. Unexpectedly, however, the Kb/OVA SCT was found to be more susceptible to exogenous peptide binding than Kb loaded with free ovalbumin peptide. The clear implication of these findings was that the superior surface stability of the SCT compared with native Kb/OVA was not due to continuous peptide binding, but rather the ability to rebind the linker-attached peptide. Subsequent crystallographic studies of the Kb/OVA SCT demonstrated that the linker extending from the OVA peptide moiety disrupted a highly conserved H-bonding network that normally serves to anchor peptide at the C terminus (24Mitaksov V. Truscott S.M. Lybarger L. Connolly J.M. Hansen T.H. Fremont D.H. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 909-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Specifically, the heavy chain residue Tyr-84 forced the linker to protrude above from the peptide binding platform, thereby disrupting the H-bonding network of the peptide C terminus with the heavy chain. This provided a structural explanation for the increased susceptibility of the SCT to exogenous peptide binding. To better accommodate linker extension and also improve C-terminal peptide anchoring, we recently engineered a disulfide trap into murine SCT molecules (dtSCTs) between position 84 of the MHC-I heavy chain and the second position on the SCT linker extending from the C terminus of the peptide (24Mitaksov V. Truscott S.M. Lybarger L. Connolly J.M. Hansen T.H. Fremont D.H. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 909-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Truscott S.M. Lybarger L.

Not only did the dtSCT constructs fold efficiently in cells, but the disulfide trap oxidized in a reliable manner and displayed a tenacious ability to prevent the binding of exogenous peptides. More importantly, these same properties were observed when dtSCT constructs incorporated peptides that were relatively poor MHC binders. Thus the dtSCT technology provided a mechanism to stably anchor a relative weak binding peptide into a single chain format. Because several known antigenic peptides are not particularly tight binders (26Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 51-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), incorporating traps could increase the general applications of SCTs as vaccines and diagnostic reagents. However, the proof of concept thus far for SCT biochemical stability, incorporation of disulfide traps, and exclusion of exogenous peptides has been almost exclusively with the Kb/OVA SCT. In this report, we study SCTs made from several different clinically relevant HLA-I complexes. Our findings show that HLA-I SCTs fold efficiently in cells and, similar to the Kb/OVA prototype, maintain their covalent attachments in cells. Furthermore, HLA-I SCTs can be secured using disulfide trap technology, as measured by their remarkable capacity to exclude high affinity competitor peptides. In all cases, these HLA-I dtSCT molecules are recognized by human cytotoxic T cells specific for native MHC-I complexes. These observations validate the use of SCTs as vaccines for the treatment of human diseases or for the production of tetramers for isolating and enumerating human disease-specific T cells. These and other applications of HLA-I SCTs are discussed. DNA Clones and Mutagenesis—PCR-generated inserts with appropriate DNA restriction sites flanking mature HLA-A0201 (A2) and -B2705 (B27) heavy chain sequences replaced the mature H2-Kb sequence of the previously constructed murine SCT (10Yu Y.Y.

The mature human β2m sequence was spliced into these constructs in place of the mouse β2m sequence. Thus, HLA-I SCTs retained the subunit order and linker lengths [G4S]3 and [G4S]4 found in the original SCT design (10Yu Y.Y. Netuschil N. Lybarger L. Connolly J.M. Hansen T.H. J.

DNA sequencing confirmed the correct sequence of all constructs. Cell Lines and Transfections—HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma) transfected with 64-3-7 epitope-tagged HLA-B27 have been described (32Harris M.R. Lybarger L. Myers N.B. Hilbert C. Solheim J.C. Hansen T.H. Yu Y.Y. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transfection of HeLa cells with cDNAs encoding A2 and B27 SCTs was performed using FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Stable transfectants were selected and maintained in 0.6–1.2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), identified by flow cytometry, and cloned by limiting dilution. All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.25 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all from the Tissue Culture Support Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Antibodies—mAb BB7.2 is specific for folded A2 molecules (33Brodsky F.M. Parham P. Barnstable C.J. Crumpton M.J. Bodmer W.F. Immunol. Rev. 1979; 47: 3-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), and mAb ME-1 is specific for folded B27 (34Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A. Hum.

This antibody was also used for immunoprecipitations and immunoblots of epitope-tagged A2 and B27 and the corresponding SCT constructs. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometric analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Dead cells and debris were excluded from analysis on the basis of forward angle and side-scatter light gating. A minimum of 10,000 gated events was collected for analysis. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For surface staining, ∼5 × 105 cells per sample were incubated on ice in microtiter plates with culture supernatant from the appropriate hybridoma. After washing, PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) was used to visualize MHC-I staining. In some experiments, flow cytometry followed incubation (1 × 106 cells/ml) with exogenous peptides TAX (A2-specific) (3Kannagi M. Shida H. Igarashi H. Kuruma K. Murai H. Aono Y. Maruyama I. Osame M.

Nature. 1989; 337: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) at indicated concentrations. Immunoprecipitations—Cells were lysed in PBS, 1.0% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 20 mm iodoacetamide, protease inhibitors, and a saturating concentration of precipitating mAb. After lysis for 30 min on ice, postnuclear lysates were incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h. Beads were washed four times in PBS, 0.1% detergent, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For nonreducing gels, β2-mercaptoethanol was excluded. For some samples, endoglycosidase H treatment followed immunoprecipitation. Bound proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose by boiling in 10 mm TrisCl, pH 6.8, 0.5% SDS, 1% β2-mercaptoethanol. Eluates were mixed with an equal volume of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4, and either digested (or mock-digested) at 37 °C for >1 h with 1 milliunit of endoglycosidase H (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) that was reconstituted in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed following SDS-PAGE separation of precipitated proteins and transfer to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked (1 h to overnight) with PBS, 10% dried milk, 0.05% Tween 20. Primary Abs were added and incubated for 1 h, followed by washing in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. As a second step, membranes were incubated for 1 h with biotin-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Caltag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). In some cases, biotin-conjugated mAb 64-3-7 was used, which obviated the second step. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories) was added for 1 h, followed by three washes. Specific proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Boston, MA). CTL Generation and Chromium Release CTL Assays—HeLa cell targets expressing A2 and B27 SCTs were tested against specific CTL lines. Protocols for the generation of these CTLs and chromium release assays to measure specific lysis have been described (37Carreno B.M. Anderson R.W. Coligan J.E. Biddison W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The RR10 CTL was generated from a patient immunized with G280-9V pulsed DC as described (42Linette G.P. Zhang D. Hodi F.S. Jonasch E.P. Longerich S. Stowell C.P. Webb I.J. Daley H. Soiffer R.J.

The CMV pp65-specific CTL line was generated from a CMV seropositive healthy donor using purified CD8+ T cells, peptide-pulsed irradiated autologous DC, and 10 units/ml IL-2 added on the second day of culture. Primed CD8+ T cells were repeatedly stimulated with antigen to generate CTL lines. Peptide competition assays were performed by incubating targets with competitor peptide at the indicated concentrations. On the following day, targets were trypsinized, washed twice, and used in a standard chromium release assay. Design and Characterization of HLA-I SCTs—The SCT format encodes the MHC-I heterotrimer as a single polypeptide (Fig. 1), and the prototype SCT made from Kb/OVA has been well characterized in terms of assembly and expression in cells, biochemical stability, structure, T cell recognition, and incorporation of a disulfide trap to secure peptide (10Yu Y.Y.

Although there are now several reports of SCTs made with HLA-I complexes (Table 1), these SCTs have not been characterized for biochemical stability, incorporation of disulfide traps, and exclusion of exogenous peptides.

In previous studies a few hydrophobic residues that are critical for lipid binding and Golgi localization were identified, but the precise topology of the amphipathic motifs has not been determined. Here we present a detailed analysis of the Golgi targeting and in vitro folding features of the region encompassing the amphipathic motifs (residues 199-294). Point mutation analysis revealed that most hydrophobic residues within this region contribute to Golgi localization, whereas analysis by proline replacements and alanine insertions revealed that Golgi interaction depends on folding into two amphipathic helices with a short interrupting sequence. Analysis of splice isoforms containing 10-residue in-frame insertions within their first amphipathic motifs revealed that the insertion causes a truncation of the amphipathic helix that does not extend beyond the insertion sequence. Lastly, a lysine replacement mutant recently reported to bind to negatively charged liposomes in a curvature-independent manner showed normal cellular distribution, suggesting that Golgi targeting of Arf-GAP1 may involve factors other than sensing lipid packing.

Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) GTPases serve as regulators of membrane traffic at multiple cellular compartments (reviewed in Refs. 1D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

At the Golgi, the Arf1 GTPase regulates the recruitment of the COPI coat to cisternal membranes (3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Arf1 is converted to the GTP-bound form by the action of guanine nucleotide exchange proteins (5Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), whereupon it translocates from cytosol to the Golgi membrane. The COPI coat is then recruited to the membrane through its interaction with the activated Arf1 (6Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. J. Biol.

The subsequent hydrolysis of GTP on Arf1, driven by a GTPase-activating protein, is a prerequisite for coat protein dissociation (9Teal S.B. Hsu V.W. Peters P.J. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Biol.

Among several ArfGAPs that may function at the Golgi, the best characterized is ArfGAP1, a 415-residue protein with a conserved 130-residue catalytic domain at its amino terminus and a unique noncatalytic part (14Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 15Goldberg J.

In addition to its GAP function, ArfGAP1 was proposed to play a role in processes such as cargo sorting (20Lee S.Y. Yang J.S. Hong W. Premont R.T. Hsu V.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Lanoix J. Ouwendijk J. Stark A. Szafer E. Cassel D. Dejgaard K. Weiss M. Nilsson T. J.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4133-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An important indication of how ArfGAP1 might regulate the sequence of GTP binding and hydrolysis during COPI vesicle formation came from studies by Antonny and co-workers (24Bigay J. Gounon P. Robineau S. Antonny B. Nature. 2003; 426: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These investigators observed that GAP activity on liposome-bound Arf1 is dramatically increased with decreasing liposome size, apparently because of increased avidity of ArfGAP1 to these liposomes and the resulting proximity to its substrate. This has led to a model whereby GTP hydrolysis is restricted to curved regions of the bud where the coat has already been stabilized due to lateral interaction, whereas the negative curvature at the base of the bud prevents ArfGAP1 binding, allowing efficient recruitment of new coat by binding to Arf1-GTP. A subsequent study (25Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) showed that ArfGAP1 interacts with the loosely packed lipids found in highly curved liposomes through a motif in the noncatalytic part that was termed ArfGAP1 lipid packing sensor (ALPS). This motif is unstructured in solution, but upon binding to liposomes it folds into an amphipathic helix that is stabilized by the insertion of bulky hydrophobic residues into open spaces in the outer lipid bilayer. A role of the ALPS motif in vivo was demonstrated by our finding that Golgi localization of Arf-GAP1 is abrogated by point mutations of hydrophobic residues near the amino side of ALPS (19Parnis A. Rawet M. Regev L. Barkan B. Rotman M. Gaitner M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3785-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). More recently, a second amphipathic motif (ALPS2) with similar physicochemical characteristics was identified in ArfGAP1. The ALPS2 motif was shown to function in cooperation with the originally identified motif (ALPS1) in conferring liposome interaction, and a point mutation in an ALPS2 hydrophobic residue (V279D) was found to abrogate Golgi localization (26Mesmin B. Drin G. Levi S. Rawet M. Cassel D. Bigay J. Antonny B. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the precise extent and topology of the ALPS motifs and the role of the multiple hydrophobic residues along their sequence in Golgi localization have not been defined.ArfGAP1 is expressed in several isoforms that present variations in the ALPS motifs. In addition to a ubiquitous form expressed in all rat tissues examined so far, there are tissue-specific isoforms (19Parnis A. Rawet M. Regev L. Barkan B. Rotman M. Gaitner M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3785-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One isoform expressed in heart tissue contains an in-frame 10-residue insertion in proximity to the ALPS1 motif, whereas a second isoform that constitutes the major form of ArfGAP1 in the rat brain contained the same insertion together with a 22-residue deletion within the ALPS2 motif. Even though this deletion diminishes the ability of the modified ALPS2 motif to support Golgi localization, the brain isoform is Golgi localized, apparently because of an enhanced Golgi-localizing propensity conferred on the ALPS1 motif by the insertion sequence.In this study, we carried out a detailed investigation of the structure-function relationship of the region containing the ALPS motifs in ArfGAP1 and its splice isoforms. The combined results of Golgi localization and in vitro experiments indicate that the first amphipathic helix is considerably longer than previously thought and that a short nonhelical segment separates the two amphipathic motifs. We also show that the insertion peptide in the splice isoform creates a break that truncates the first amphipathic helix. Based on these and additional data, we discuss the mechanism of ArfGAP1 interaction with the Golgi.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs, Transfection, and Western Blot Analysis—GFP fusion proteins were prepared by cloning PCR-amplified fragments of ArfGAP1 cDNA into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) using the EcoRI and BamHI sites; full-length ArfGAP1 cloned into the pmCherry-C1 vector was provided by J. Bigay. Mutations were introduced by PCR and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids (0.2 μg) were transfected into HeLa cells grown on 13-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates using 1 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GFP fused to nuclear export signal from the HTLV-2 Tax protein was generated as described (27Chevalier S.A. Meertens L. Calattini S. Gessain A. Kiemer L. Mahieux R. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 70Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein expression was monitored by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibodies, confirming that all constructs gave rise to a fusion protein with the expected size.Labeling with Antibodies and Fluorescence Microscopy—The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 20-22 h following transfection. For immunostaining, the coverslips were transferred into PSS (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% saponin and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against GM130 (from Transduction Laboratories, 1:500) or against the Myc epitope (clone 9E10 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100), followed by CY3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:400). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Mowiol as glue and were visualized under a Leica DMIRE2 inverted fluorescent microscope at a 40× or 63× magnification.Quantitation of ArfGAP1 Cellular Distribution—Digital images of cells that have been transfected with GFP-ArfGAP1 constructs and counter-stained with anti-GM130 were analyzed by marking the GM130-stained area and determining the average pixel intensity of the GFP fluorescence in this area (defined as the Golgi GFP fluorescence). A thin area of cytoplasm near the Golgi was manually marked, and the average GFP fluorescence was determined (cytosolic fluorescence; see Fig. 1). Cells in which the Golgi image overlapped with the nuclear area were excluded from the analysis. Following subtraction of background from cell-free areas of the image, the ratio of Golgi to cytoplasmic fluorescence was calculated. For each mutant the entire experiment from transfection to counting was repeated at least twice, and the combined data from a total of 30-50 cells were averaged; the results are presented as the means with error bars indicating the standard deviation.Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of data sets was tested and established by the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks (28Kruskal W.H. Wallis W.A. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1952; 47: 583-621Crossref Scopus (6861) Google Scholar). The significance of differences between wild type and mutants was estimated by a one-sided multiple comparison test implemented in function kruskalmc of the R-package pgirmess. Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical system.Preparation of Recombinant ArfGAP1 Fragments—ArfGAP1 cDNA containing silent mutations avoiding rare codons (20Lee S.Y. Yang J.S. Hong W. Premont R.T. Hsu V.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was subjected to PCR amplification with primers that included a5′ XbaI site and a 3′ BamHI site, and the PCR products were cloned into the T7 polymerase-driven pKM260 vector between the NheI and the BamHI sites. Proteins were expressed in the BL21/DE3 Escherichia coli harboring pLysS by induction for 3 h at 30 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. For GAP activity assay, bacterial pellets were extracted with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were purified by nickelnitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, eluted with 200 mm imidazole, dialyzed, and further purified by Resource Q chromatography as previously described (29Szafer E. Pick E. Rotman M. Zuck S. Huber I. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23615-23619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Proteins to be used for CD measurements were prepared by lysing a pellet of a 400-ml induced bacterial culture by freezing and thawing three times. The pellets were resuspended at room temperature in 12 ml of 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2 containing 0.5 mg of DNase I and left at room temperature for a few minutes, followed by the addition of 1% Triton X-100. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation (9,000 rpm for 15 min), washed, and resuspended in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and solubilized in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 8. Proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography in the presence of 5 m guanidine followed by elution with 0.2 m imidazole in the guanidine solution, overnight dialysis against 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm KCl, and centrifugation to remove any insoluble material. Purity of the recombinant proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.GAP Activity Assay—Measurement of GAP activity on Golgi membranes was carried out as previously described (30Szafer E. Rotman M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47834-47839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant myristoylated Arf1 (31Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP onto rat liver Golgi membranes using the guanine nucleotide exchange activity that is present in the membrane. Exchange was stopped by the addition of 0.3 mm brefeldin A, followed by the addition of GAP. After different incubation times at 30 °C, the samples were filtered through a nitrocellulose filter, and the amount of radioactivity remaining on the filter (representing Arf1-bound GTP) was determined. The data were fitted to an exponential decay curve (y = ae-bx) using the algorithm provided by SigmaPlot 9.0; the b value of the control without GAP was subtracted from b values of the samples, and the percentage of activity of mutants was calculated by comparing their corrected b values with that of wild type GAP. For each mutant assays were repeated two to three times, and the variation of the b values ranged between 13 and 19% of the mean.Liposome Preparation and Circular Dichroism Measurements—Liposomes used in circular dichroism measurements were produced by sonication. The composition of the liposomes was 70 mol % dioleoyl-PC, 30 mol % dioleoyl-PS. A dried film was prepared by evaporation of a mixture of the lipids in chloroform and was resuspended in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, to a final lipid concentration of 15 mm. The mixture was sonicated for 5 min using a Microson sonicator set to low intensity and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min to remove debris. The liposomes were stored at room temperature under nitrogen and used within 2 days. Average liposome size, determined by dynamic light scattering, ranged between 21 and 30 nm in different experiments.CD spectroscopy was performed on a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics). The experiments were performed at room temperature in a Hellma quartz cell with an optical path length of 0.05 cm in the presence or absence of 2 mm liposomes. Each spectrum was obtained by averaging several scans recorded from 200 to 260 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm, a step of 1 nm, and a scan speed of 50 nm/min. Control spectra of liposomes in buffer were subtracted from the protein spectra. The data were analyzed by the CDPro software (32Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar).RESULTSDefinition of Amphipathic Helices Mediating ArfGAP1 Golgi Localization—Previously, the role of the ALPS motifs in targeting ArfGAP1 to the Golgi was inferred from the effect of a few mutations in selective regions of these motifs (19Parnis A. Rawet M. Regev L. Barkan B. Rotman M. Gaitner M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3785-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For a mutagenesis study aimed at defining the extent of the motifs mediating Golgi localization, it was necessary to design a quantitative analysis of ArfGAP1 interaction with the Golgi. Among several approaches, we obtained the best results by the method described in Fig. 1 and under “Experimental Procedures.” The cellular distribution of GFP fusions of ArfGAP1 and mutants thereof was determined as the ratio of the average pixel intensity at the Golgi to that of a thin section of cytosol in the close proximity of the Golgi. Because Golgi staining was faint in many ArfGAP1 mutants, the Golgi area was defined in all experiments by counter-staining with GM130, a cis-Golgi marker that shows a good colocalization with ArfGAP1 (19Parnis A. Rawet M. Regev L. Barkan B. Rotman M. Gaitner M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3785-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the data for the noncatalytic fragment (residues 143-415) of the wild type protein showed a good fit to a linear curve, indicating that the amount of Golgi-bound GFP-ArfGAP1 is proportional to that of the cytosolic protein. This was also true for a localization-defective mutant (V268A; Fig. 1), as well as for all other mutants tested, as revealed by R2 values above 0.75 (average = 0.85 ± 0.07). We therefore used the Golgi/cytosol ratio as a measure of the extent of Golgi localization of the mutants, averaging ratios measured in multiple cells.To analyze the amphipathic motifs, we first tested the effect of alanine replacements of hydrophobic residues all along the region where the presence of two amphipathic motifs (ALPS1 and ALPS2) was previously indicated (19Parnis A. Rawet M. Regev L. Barkan B. Rotman M. Gaitner M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3785-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 26Mesmin B. Drin G. Levi S. Rawet M. Cassel D. Bigay J. Antonny B. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, single or double alanine replacements of most of the hydrophobic residues in the region encompassing residues Met204-Phe294 caused a decrease in ArfGAP1 Golgi localization. GFP with a nuclear export signal that served as a negative control gave a ratio of 1.18, apparently reflecting a greater thickness of the cell in the perinuclear Golgi area; this value is taken as the base line of the assay (Fig. 2B, dashed line). Taking the difference between wild type GAP and GFP with a nuclear export signal as the range of the measurement, inhibition by 18-81% was observed in different hydrophobic residue mutants. Statistical analysis by a one-sided multiple comparison test (see under “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that the inhibition of Golgi localization is highly significant (significance at p value of 1 × 10-6) for all mutants with the exception of V259A and V279A, where significance was indicated at p values of 0.001 and 0.01, respectively. Importantly, hydrophobic residues in the region between the previously defined ALPS motifs (Fig. 2A, shaded) were also required for Golgi interaction. Thus, alanine replacement of residues Leu243, Leu247, Val251, and Leu252 caused a decrease in Golgi localization that was comparable with that caused by alanine replacements of residues in the 204-214 range, where mutations were previously shown to abrogate Golgi localization (19Parnis A. Rawet M. Regev L. Barkan B. Rotman M. Gaitner M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3785-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and liposome interaction (25Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A relatively small inhibition was observed in alanine replacement mutants of residues Val259 and Val279; in the latter case, an aspartate replacement (V279D) was previously reported to abrogate Golgi localization (26Mesmin B. Drin G. Levi S. Rawet M. Cassel D. Bigay J. Antonny B. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Unlike the hydrophobic residues, the localization of an E249A mutant tested as a control was not significantly affected and resembled that of the nonmutated construct.FIGURE 2Mutation analysis of ArfGAP1 amphipathic motifs. Mutations were introduced into the GFP-fused noncatalytic fragment of ArfGAP1 (residues 143-415), and their effect on Golgi localization was assessed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and under “Experimental Procedures.” A, sequence of the ArfGAP1 region under study. Hydrophobic residues that have been subjected to alanine replacement are highlighted in bold type, replacements introduced in the experiment shown in C are indicated on top of the sequence, and points of dialanine insertions (D) are marked by arrowheads.

C, effect of replacement of hydrophilic residues with helix-disrupting residues. Residue 255 was replaced with Gly to generate a Pro-Gly sequence with endogenous Pro254.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The finding that the region between the previously defined ALPS motifs contains hydrophobic residues that are required for Golgi localization raised the possibility that this region also folds into an amphipathic helix, possibly by extending one of the ALPS motifs. To probe for helical structures mediating Golgi interaction, we tested the effect of the replacement of nonhydrophobic residues along the region encompassing the amphipathic motifs by helix-disrupting residues (Pro or Pro-Gly). As shown in Fig. 2C, proline (or Pro-Gly) replacements introduced at different positions between residues 216 and 285 of the noncatalytic ArfGAP1 fragment diminished Golgi localization. A much smaller inhibition was observed with proline replacement of residue Glu261, suggesting that this residue may not take part in a helical conformation. We also tested the requirement for helix amphipathicity by inserting at different points a pair of alanine residues, mutations that should alter the register of the helix and thus prevent the formation of a continuous hydrophobic face. As shown in Fig. 2D, dialanine insertions at different points between residues 217-276 of the noncatalytic fragment caused a decrease in Golgi localization. Quantitatively similar inhibitory effects of dialanine insertion between positions 229 and 230, as well as diproline replacement of residues 222 and 223 and residues 236 and 237, were observed when the mutations were introduced in the full-length Arf-GAP1 (Fig. 2E). The effect of dialanine insertions (Fig. 2D) was smaller at several positions between residues 259 and 267, with a minimal effect between positions 263 and 264. Together with the proline replacement analysis, these findings indicate that a region including residues 259-267 may not adopt a helical conformation; however, because alanine replacement of residues Ile264/Phe265 strongly decreased localization, we assume that these residues may be at the beginning of an amphipathic helix, such that the nonhelical segment includes residues 260-263. Accordingly, the region required for Golgi localization appears to be made up of two amphipathic motifs separated by a short break (see Fig. 7). Somewhat unexpectedly, our findings suggest that the proline residue that is present at position 254 of ArfGAP1 does not constitute a helix break, because mutations introduced immediately following this residue (A255G, A255P, and a dialanine insertion between residues 254 and 255; Fig. 2, C and D) strongly diminished Golgi localization. Residue Pro254 is conserved in mammalian ArfGAP1 proteins, but an equivalent residue is not found in orthologues from organisms such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. Indeed, this residue does not seem to be essential, because a P254A mutation had only a small effect on Golgi localization (Fig. 2C, rightmost bar).FIGURE 7A model of the folded state of the amphipathic helices. The structure of the ubiquitous form is deduced from the data in Figs. 2, 4, and 5. The 10-residue insertion of the brain isoform (marked in black) forms on its amino side a continuous helix with the ALPS1 motif; for simplicity, the entire insertion is depicted as helical, although it is not known how many insertion residues take part in this conformation. In comparison with the ubiquitous form, the isoform ALPS1 motif is truncated because of interruption of the helix introduced by the isoform insertion (assumed to take place at the carboxyl proline residue of the insertion), whereas the second amphipathic motif of the rat brain isoform is truncated because of deletion of 22 residues; whether the remaining sequence folds onto membranes is uncertain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Remodeling of the First Amphipathic Helix in Splice Isoforms—We have previously described two splice isoforms of ArfGAP1 that are expressed in rat heart and brain.

https://openalex.org/W2046675638,"The EGF-CFC factor Oep/Cripto1/Frl1 has been implicated in embryogenesis and several human cancers. During vertebrate development, Oep/Cripto1/Frl1 has been shown to act as an essential coreceptor in the TGFbeta/Nodal pathway, which is crucial for germ layer formation. Although studies in cell cultures suggest that Oep/Cripto1/Frl1 is also implicated in other pathways, in vivo it is solely regarded as a Nodal coreceptor. We have found that Rasl11b, a small GTPase belonging to a Ras subfamily of putative tumor suppressor genes, modulates Oep function in zebrafish independently of the Nodal pathway. rasl11b down regulation partially rescues endodermal and prechordal plate defects of zygotic oep(-/-) mutants (Zoep). Rasl11b inhibitory action was only observed in oep-deficient backgrounds, suggesting that normal oep expression prevents Rasl11b function. Surprisingly, rasl11b down regulation does not rescue mesendodermal defects in other Nodal pathway mutants, nor does it influence the phosphorylation state of the downstream effector Smad2. Thus, Rasl11b modifies the effect of Oep on mesendoderm development independently of the main known Oep output: the Nodal signaling pathway. This data suggests a new branch of Oep signaling that has implications for germ layer development, as well as for studies of Oep/Frl1/Cripto1 dysfunction, such as that found in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1980077757,"Activation of cell surface receptors transduces extracellular signals into cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation and survival. However, as important as the activation of these receptors is their appropriate spatial and temporal down-regulation for normal development and tissue homeostasis. The Cbl family of E3-ubiquitin ligases plays a major role for the ligand-dependent inactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), most notably the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) through ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation.Here, we report the mutant phenotypes of Drosophila cbl (D-cbl) during eye development. D-cbl mutants display overgrowth, inhibition of apoptosis, differentiation defects and increased ommatidial spacing. Using genetic interaction and molecular markers, we show that most of these phenotypes are caused by increased activity of the Drosophila EGFR. Our genetic data also indicate a critical role of ubiquitination for D-cbl function, consistent with biochemical models.These data may provide a mechanistic model for the understanding of the oncogenic activity of mammalian cbl genes."
https://openalex.org/W1971764100,"Presenting the eyes with spatially mismatched images causes a phenomenon known as binocular rivalry-a fluctuation of awareness whereby each eye's image alternately determines perception. Binocular rivalry is used to study interocular conflict resolution and the formation of conscious awareness from retinal images. Although the spatial determinants of rivalry have been well-characterized, the temporal determinants are still largely unstudied. We confirm a previous observation that conflicting images do not need to be presented continuously or simultaneously to elicit binocular rivalry. This process has a temporal limit of about 350 ms, which is an order of magnitude larger than the visual system's temporal resolution. We characterize this temporal limit of binocular rivalry by showing that it is independent of low-level information such as interocular timing differences, contrast-reversals, stimulus energy, and eye-of-origin information. This suggests the temporal factors maintaining rivalry relate more to higher-level form information, than to low-level visual information. Systematically comparing the role of form and motion-the processing of which may be assigned to ventral and dorsal visual pathways, respectively-reveals that this temporal limit is determined by form conflict rather than motion conflict. Together, our findings demonstrate that binocular conflict resolution depends on temporally coarse form-based processing, possibly originating in the ventral visual pathway."

A national survey was conducted in all public and private sectors in Malawi that provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) to determine the uptake of ART by army personnel, their outcomes while on treatment, and the impact of ART on mortality in the Malawi Defence Force. Methodology/Principal Findings A retrospective cohort analysis was carried out, collecting data on access and retention on treatment from all 103 public and 38 private sector ART clinics in Malawi, using standardised patient master cards and clinic registers. Observations were censored on December 31st 2006. Independent data on mortality trends in army personnel from all causes between 2002 and 2006 were available from army records. By December 31st 2006, there were 85,168 patients ever started on ART in both public and private sectors, of whom 547 (0.7%) were army personnel. Of these, 22% started ART in WHO clinical stage 1 or 2 with a CD4-lymphocyte count of ≤250/mm3 and 78% started in stage 3 or 4. Treatment outcomes of army personnel by December 31st 2006 were:−365 (67%) alive and on ART at their registration facility, 98 (18%) transferred out to another facility, 71 (13%) dead, 9 (2%) lost to follow-up, and 4 (<1%) stopped treatment. The probability of being alive on ART at 6-, 12- and 18-months was 89.8%, 83.4% and 78.8% respectively. All-cause mortality in army personnel declined dramatically over the five year period from 2002–2006.

https://openalex.org/W1999557216,"The effectiveness of recombinant vaccines encoding full-length M2 protein of influenza virus or its ectodomain (M2e) have previously been tested in a number of models with varying degrees of success. Recently, we reported a strong cytotoxic effect exhibited by M2 on mammalian cells in vitro. Here we demonstrated a decrease in protection when M2 was added to a DNA vaccination regimen that included influenza NP. Furthermore, we have constructed several fusion proteins of conserved genes of influenza virus and tested their expression in vitro and protective potential in vivo. The four-partite NP-M1-M2-NS1 fusion antigen that has M2 sequence engineered in the middle part of the composite protein was shown to not be cytotoxic in vitro. A three-partite fusion protein (consisting of NP, M1 and NS1) was expressed much more efficiently than the four-partite protein. Both of these constructs provided statistically significant protection upon DNA vaccination, with construct NP-M1-M2-NS1 being the most effective. We conclude that incorporation of M2 into a vaccination regimen may be beneficial only when its apparent cytotoxicity-linked negative effects are neutralized. The possible significance of this data for influenza vaccination regimens and preparations is discussed."

TBP is required for nearly all nuclear gene transcription as it is an integral subunit of the RNAP I-, II-, and III-specific initiation factors SL1, TFIID, and TFIIIB (11Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is not surprising that TBP function is subject to tight regulation by non-GTF transcription factors such as NC2, Mot1p, and SAGA and NOT that all directly bind TBP and modulate its activity (12Pugh B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Pereira L.A. Klejman M.P. Timmers H.T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 315: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Yeast Rap1p is encoded by a single-copy essential gene and plays multiple roles in vivo (14Shore D.

Botstein D. Brown P.O. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and glycolytic enzyme-encoding genes (19Buchman A.R. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell.

Brown P.O. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Additionally, Rap1p participates in transcriptional repression (21Kyrion G. Liu K. Liu C. Lustig A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1146-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), telomere length modulation (22Marcand S. Gilson E. Shore D.

The only essential domain of Rap1p is its DNA-binding domain (DBD), which is composed of two Myb-like motifs. Yeast expressing only the Rap1p DBD grow, albeit extremely slowly (26Graham I.R. Haw R.A. Spink K.G. Halden K.A. Chambers A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal BRCT-DNA bending domain has minimal effects on viability (27Muller T. Gilson E. Schmidt R. Giraldo R. Sogo J. Gross H. Gasser S.M. J. Struct.

Chambers A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7481-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A C-terminal activation domain, fused to a heterologous DBD, weakly activates transcription of a reporter gene (29Hardy C.F. Balderes D. Shore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); by contrast, lexA full-length Rap1p fusions fail to activate (30Zhao Y. McIntosh K.B. Rudra D. Schawalder S. Shore D. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4853-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The C-terminal silencing domain represses mating-type, telomere-proximal, and RP genes under certain circumstances (31Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D.

Finally, a 34-amino acid (aa) Tox domain inhibits cell growth when overexpressed fused to the DBD (17Pina B. Fernandez-Larrea J. Garcia-Reyero N. Idrissi F.Z. Mol. Genet.

First, Rap1p-upstream activating sequence/enhancer (UASRAP1) binding may exclude nucleosomes and stimulate transcription by increasing local DNA ciselement accessibility (30Zhao Y. McIntosh K.B. Rudra D. Schawalder S. Shore D. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4853-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Yu L. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and in vivo UASRAP1 DNA is deficient in nucleosomes (30Zhao Y. McIntosh K.B. Rudra D. Schawalder S. Shore D. Warner J.R. Mol.

Tripathi M.K. Cencki B. Layer J.H. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Third, Rap1p interacts with Rif and Sir proteins, which contribute to transcriptional repression of telomere-proximal and HML/HMR genes, as well as telomere-length modulation (31Moretti P. Freeman K.

Despite the fact that Rap1p has been studied extensively, the exact molecular mechanisms through which these myriad Rap1p protein-protein interactions lead to transcription activation and repression remain to be deciphered. In this report we describe the results of our continuing investigations into how Rap1p interacts with the transcription machinery. We have found that Rap1p directly and specifically binds TBP, and have molecularly dissected this interaction. We discuss the implications of Rap1p-TBP binding vis à vis the regulation of TBP activity.

Rap1p variants were cloned in pET42a as EcoRI-XhoI inserts for the production of GST-Rap1p; His6-GST-Rap1p and Rap1p variants were produced from Rap1p forms cloned in pBGMB1 (a version of pBG101 with BamHI and EcoRI sites inverted) as EcoRI-XhoI inserts.

TFIIA, TFIIB, His6-TBP, His6-TAND, and NC2 proteins were produced as described as listed above. His6-GST-TBP and His6-GST-Rap1p variants were expressed and prepared as for His6-TBP. His6-GST fusion variants were bound to glutathione-agarose beads, glutathione-eluted, and treated with His6-tagged precission protease on Ni-nitriloacetic acid-agarose beads for 1 h at room temperature and centrifuged to remove the beads.

RAP1 variants were cloned as EcoRI-ClaI inserts either in pESC vectors (UASGAL-dependent expression), in pRS415 vector (ADH1-enhancer/promoter) for the production of Rap1p-FLAG forms, or pRS414, controlled by RAP1 enhancer/promoter and RAP1 terminator. Wild type TBP was cloned in the same pESC vector ± RAP1 as an XhoI-flanked insert for the expression of MYC-TBP (Fig. 5, B and C); TBP variants (Fig. 6) were cloned as BamHI-XhoI inserts in pRS413 (ADH1-dependent expression) for the production of HA3-TBP. Yeast were grown, transformed, plated, and subjected to 5-fluoroorotic acid plasmid shuffle growth tests using standard methods.FIGURE 6Rap1p DBD modulates mRNA reporter gene transcription in vivo.

GST Pulldown Assay—100-μl binding reactions were performed in binding buffer: 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 70 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgAc, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, plus 10 μl of beads (300 ng of GST fusion protein/reaction), and the proteins to be tested for binding. Reactions were mixed 30 min at room temperature, then beads were washed 3 times with binding buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heat denatured, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on NuPAGE 4-12% polyacrylamide gels followed by Sypro Ruby staining or immunoblotting.

Cross-linking was quenched by addition of 3 μl of 2.5 m glycine and incubation for 5 min at room temperature. 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and samples were loaded, without heating, on 4-12% NuPAGE gels followed by Sypro Ruby staining or immunoblotting. Whole Cell Extract (WCE) Preparation, Immunoprecipitations (IPs), and Immunoblotting—WCE preparation, IPs, immunoblotting, and chemiluminescent detection were performed as described (65Sanders S.L.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) except ChIP PCR products were fractionated by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE buffer and DNA quantified by staining with Sypro Gold (Invitrogen). While conducting footprinting experiments to examine the binding of yeast TFIID to a battery of Rap1p-dependent and Rap1p-independent genes, control reactions showed that Rap1p addition blocked TBP-TATA DNA binding. Given the central role of TBP in nuclear gene transcription, the potency of inhibition of TBP-DNA binding by nanomolar concentrations of Rap1p, the nuclear abundance, and high concentration of both proteins (≥100 μm), we examined this phenomenon in more detail. Rap1p Inhibits TATA DNA Binding by TBP—The inhibitory effect of Rap1p upon the binding of TBP (see Fig. 1A for purity of proteins) to the Adenovirus 2 major late promoter (Ad2 MLP), a heterologous DNA devoid of RAP1 sites, is shown in Fig. 1B (left panel, Ad2 MLP). As expected, TBP bound to the Ad2 MLP TATA box (lane 1 versus 4), and at the TBP concentration used here, also bound to two TA-rich regions up- and downstream of TATA (TA-I, TA-II) (5Sanders S.L. Garbett K.A. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6000-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 66Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13850-13859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 67Schroeder S.C. Wang C.K. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28335-28346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas Rap1p did not bind to the Ad2 MLP (lane 3), TBP binding at all three sites was potently inhibited when Rap1p and TBP were added simultaneously (lane 4 versus 5). However, either pre-binding of TBP to DNA (lane 9) or TFIIA addition (lane 7) protected TBP from the negative action of Rap1p. Similar results were observed with RPS1A DNA, a yeast gene containing consensus (RAP1) and non-consensus (RAP1*) Rap1p binding sites (Fig. 1B, right, RPS1A). In this case, Rap1p both bound to RAP1 sites (lane 13) and blocked TBP-DNA binding to RPS1A TA-rich sequences (TA-I,-II, -III, -IV; lane 15). Again, TFIIA addition (lane 17) and TBP-DNA complex formation (lane 19) prevented Rap1p inhibition. The extent of inhibition of TBP-DNA binding by Rap1p was dependent on the concentration of both proteins, consistent with a direct, bimolecular Rap1p-TBP interaction (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19). Notably, TFIIB failed to block Rap1p from inhibiting TBP-TATA binding (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 20-22 with lanes 2-19 and 23-25). (Note that the apparent protection of DNA observed when both TBP and TFIIB are added to the footprinting assays is not reproducible (data not shown), and likely results from enhanced nuclease digestion of the probe when these two proteins are added simultaneously.) Together, these data suggested that Rap1p and TBP directly interacted, and that a specific domain(s) of TBP was targeted. Mapping Rap1p Domains That Inhibit TATA DNA Interaction through Direct TBP Binding—To map the TBP inhibitory region(s), we generated a family of Rap1p variants (Fig. 2, A and B) and assessed their ability to prevent TBP binding to Ad2 MLP (Fig. 2C, lanes 3-12) and RPS1A (Fig. 2C, lanes 26-35). The Rap1p DBD specifically (Fig. 2C, lanes 36-46 versus 13-23) inhibited TBP-DNA binding to the TATA regions of both DNAs (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 28, 29, 31, 33, 35 versus lanes 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 26, 27, 30, 32, 34). To test whether the Rap1p DBD directly bound TBP we performed GST-Rap1p pulldowns. We found that all GST-Rap1p variants that contained the Rap1p DBD specifically bound TBP (Fig. 2D, lanes 7, 9, 16, 21, 25 versus 12, 14, 18, 23, 27). Collectively these data demonstrated that the Rap1p DBD interacted with TBP directly, and suggested a molecular explanation for our observation that Rap1p blocked TBP-TATA binding. Mapping TBP Surfaces That Interact with Rap1p—To map the portions of TBP that interacted with Rap1p we performed pulldown competition assays to test whether well studied TBP-binding partners (TATA DNA, TFIIA, TFIIB, NC2 (Ncb1p and Ncb2p) and the Taf1p-TAND; Fig. 3A) inhibited TBP-Rap1p interaction. As expected from our previous work (58Banik U. Beechem J.M. Klebanow E. Schroeder S. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49100-49109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 59Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8005-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), all of the purified proteins (Fig. 3B) avidly bound TBP (Fig. 3C, lane 1 versus 2-6), indicating that these proteins were all highly active. When added along with TBP to GST-Rap1p binding reactions, neither TFIIB nor Ncb1p efficiently blocked TBP-Rap1p binding. By contrast, TFIIA, the NC2 Ncb2p subunit, and the Taf1p TAND all were able to block TBP-Rap1p complex formation quite efficiently (Fig. 3D, compare control lane 4, with lanes 7, 16, 19 versus lanes 10, 13). Similarly, double stranded WT (GGCTATAAAAGGGG), but not double stranded mutant (GGCTAAGAAAGGGG) Ad2 MLP TATA DNA prevented TBP-Rap1p complex formation (Fig. 3D, lane 21 versus 23). (We assume that neither Ncb1p nor TFIIB were GST-Rap1p-TBP associated due to a shorter half-life of these TBP complexes.) These data indicated that the DNA, NC2, TAND, and TFIIA interaction domains of TBP contributed importantly to Rap1p-TBP binding. Identification of TBP Residues That Interact with Rap1p—To more precisely map the Rap1p interaction domain we used a family of truncation and point mutant forms of TBP (Fig. 4A). To document the published activities of these TBP mutants (Fig. 4B), and to demonstrate that all variants had some definable biochemical activity and hence were not inactive in Rap1p binding due to the fact that they were, for example, just unfolded, we measured both dimerization (Fig. 4B, lanes 2-19, X-linked, anti-TBP IgG I-BLOT) and DNA binding, ±Rap1p and ±TFIIA (Fig. 4C). As reported (69Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 70Kou H. Pugh B.F. J. Biol.

In every case when DNA binding was observed TATA binding was sensitive to Rap1p and protected by TFIIA (Fig. 4C). When tested via GST-TBP pulldown, all TBP"
