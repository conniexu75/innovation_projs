https://openalex.org/W2901570581,"Loot boxes are items in video games that can be paid for with real-world money and contain randomised contents. In recent years, loot boxes have become increasingly common. There is concern in the research community that similarities between loot boxes and gambling may lead to increases in problem gambling amongst gamers. A large-scale survey of gamers (n = 7,422) found evidence for a link (η2 = 0.054) between the amount that gamers spent on loot boxes and the severity of their problem gambling. This link was stronger than a link between problem gambling and buying other in-game items with real-world money (η2 = 0.004), suggesting that the gambling-like features of loot boxes are specifically responsible for the observed relationship between problem gambling and spending on loot boxes. It is unclear from this study whether buying loot boxes acts as a gateway to problem gambling, or whether spending large amounts of money on loot boxes appeals more to problem gamblers. However, in either case these results suggest that there may be good reason to regulate loot boxes in games."

Specialized software and personalized input devices can improve access, but often provide only limited functionality. In this study, three research participants with tetraplegia who had multielectrode arrays implanted in motor cortex as part of the BrainGate2 clinical trial used an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) to control an unmodified commercial tablet computer. Neural activity was decoded in real time as a point-and-click wireless Bluetooth mouse, allowing participants to use common and recreational applications (web browsing, email, chatting, playing music on a piano application, sending text messages, etc.). Two of the participants also used the iBCI to “chat” with each other in real time. This study demonstrates, for the first time, high-performance iBCI control of an unmodified, commercially available, general-purpose mobile computing device by people with tetraplegia."

https://openalex.org/W2901761663,"Despite the prevalence of inhalation therapy in the treatment of pediatric respiratory disorders, most prominently asthma, the fraction of inhaled drugs reaching the lungs for maximal efficacy remains adversely low. By and large drug delivery devices and their inhalation guidelines are typically derived from adult studies with child dosages adapted according to body weight. While it has long been recognized that physiological (e.g. airway sizes, breathing maneuvers) and physical transport (e.g. aerosol dynamics) characteristics are critical in governing deposition outcomes, such knowledge has yet to be extensively adapted to younger populations. Motivated by such shortcomings, the present work leverages in a first step in silico computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to explore opportunities for augmenting aerosol deposition in children based on respiratory physiological and physical transport determinants. Using an idealized, anatomically-faithful upper airway geometry, airflow and aerosol motion are simulated as a function of age, spanning a five year old to an adult. Breathing conditions mimic realistic age-specific inhalation maneuvers representative of Dry Powder Inhalers (DPI) and nebulizer inhalation. Our findings point to the existence of a single dimensionless curve governing deposition in the conductive airways via the dimensionless Stokes number (Stk). Most significantly, we uncover the existence of a distinct deposition peak irrespective of age. For the DPI simulations, this peak (∼ 80%) occurs at Stk ≈ 0.06 whereas for nebulizer simulations, the corresponding peak (∼ 45%) occurs in the range of Stk between 0.03-0.04. Such dimensionless findings hence translate to an optimal window of micron-sized aerosols that evolves with age and varies with inhalation device. The existence of such deposition optima advocates revisiting design guidelines for optimizing deposition outcomes in pediatric inhalation therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2901740859,"We present here a newly developed software package named Artifact GeoMorph Toolbox 3-D (AGMT3-D). It is intended to provide archaeologists with a simple and easy-to-use tool for performing 3-D landmarks-based geometric morphometric shape analysis on 3-D digital models of archaeological artifacts. It requires no prior knowledge of programming or proficiency in statistics. AGMT3-D consists of a data-acquisition procedure for automatically positioning 3-D models in space and fitting them with grids of 3-D semi-landmarks. It also provides a number of analytical tools and procedures that allow the processing and statistical analysis of the data, including generalized Procrustes analysis, principal component analysis, a warp tool, automatic calculation of shape variabilities and statistical tests. It provides an output of quantitative, objective and reproducible results in numerical, textual and graphic formats. These can be used to answer archaeologically significant questions relating to morphologies and morphological variabilities in artifact assemblages. Following the presentation of the software and its functions, we apply it to a case study addressing the effects of different types of raw material on the morphologies and morphological variabilities present in an experimentally produced Acheulian handaxe assemblage. The results show that there are statistically significant differences between the mean shapes and shape variabilities of handaxes produced on flint and those produced on basalt. With AGMT3-D, users can analyze artifact assemblages and address questions that are deducible from the morphologies and morphological variabilities of material culture assemblages. These questions can relate to issues of, among others, relative chronology, cultural affinities, tool function and production technology. AGMT3-D is aimed at making 3-D landmarks-based geometric morphometric shape analysis more accessible to archaeologists, in the hope that this method will become a tool commonly used by archaeologists."
https://openalex.org/W2900999490,"Ganglioside GD3 is widely expressed in human malignant melanomas, and has been reported to be involved in the increased cell proliferation and invasion. In this study, we established GM3-, GM2-, GM1-, GD3-, or GD2-expressing melanoma cell lines by transfecting cDNAs of glyscosyltransferases, and effects of individual gangliosides on the cell phenotypes and signals were examined. The phenotypes of established ganglioside-expressing cells were quite different, i.e. cell growth increased as following order; GD2+, GD3+ > GM1+, GM2+, GM3+ cells. Cell invasion activity increased as GD3+ ≧ GM2+ > GM1+, GM3+, GD2+ cells. Intensity of cell adhesion to collagen I (CL-I) and spreading increased as GD2+ >> GD3+, GM1+ > GM2+, GM3+ cells. In particular, cell adhesion of GD2+ cells was markedly strong. As for cell migration velocity, GD2+ cells were slower than all other cells. The immunocytostaining revealed close localization of gangliosides and F-actin in lamellipodia. Immunoblotting of phosphorylated p130Cas and paxillin by serum treatment reveled that these phosphorylations were more increased in GD3+ cells than in GD2+ or GM3+ cells, while phosphorylation of Akt underwent similarly increased phosphorylation between GD3+ and GD2+ cells compared with GM3+ cells. While GD2 and GD3 enhanced cell growth, GD3 might also contribute in cell invasion. On the other hand, GD2 might contribute in the solid fixation of melanoma cells at metastasized sites. These results suggested that individual gangliosides exert distinct roles in the different aspects of melanomas by differentially regulating cytoskeletons and signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2901800184,"The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex necessary for the onset of inflammation. The adapter protein ASC assembles inflammasome components by acting as a molecular glue between danger-signal sensors and procaspase-1. The assembly is mediated by ASC self-association and protein interactions via its two Death Domains, PYD and CARD. Truncated versions of ASC have been shown to form filaments, but information on the filaments formed by full-length ASC is needed to construct a meaningful model of inflammasome assembly. To gain insights into this system, we used a combination of transmission EM, NMR, and computational analysis to investigate intact ASC structures. We show that ASC forms ∼6–7-nm-wide filaments that stack laterally to form bundles. The structural characteristics and dimensions of the bundles indicate that both PYD and CARD are integral parts of the filament. A truncated version of ASC with only the CARD domain (ASCCARD) forms different filaments (∼3–4-nm width), providing further evidence that both domains work in concert in filament assembly. Ring-shaped protein particles bound to pre-existing filaments match the size of ASC dimer structures generated by NMR-based protein docking, suggesting that the ASC dimer could be a basic building block for filament formation. Solution NMR binding studies identified the protein surfaces involved in the ASCCARD–ASCCARD interaction. These data provide new insights into the structural underpinnings of the inflammasome and should inform future efforts to interrogate this important biological system.

Death Domains typically fold into a six-helical bundle arranged in a Greek-key topology known as the Death fold (1Park H.H. Logette E. Raunser S. Cuenin S. Walz T. Tschopp J. Wu H.

Structural differences between subfamilies within this fold are likely responsible for the observed homotypic binding specificity (5Chu L.H. Gangopadhyay A. Dorfleutner A. Stehlik C.

ASC (apoptosis-associated specklike protein containing a CARD) is a member of the Death Domain superfamily that self-oligomerizes to form large molecular assemblies such as the inflammasome and the pyroptosome (9Lu A.

The latter is described as a supramolecular complex composed of oligomerized ASC dimers that induces inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) via the activation of procaspase-1 (10Fernandes-Alnemri T.

The inflammasome is composed of sensor proteins (NLRs, 2The abbreviations used are: NLRNod-like receptor3Dthree-dimensional2Dtwo-dimensionalPDBProtein Data BankTEMtransmission EMSEMscanning EMSUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifierHSQCheteronuclear single-quantum coherenceHMQCheteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence. also members of the Death Domain superfamily), ASC, and procaspase-1. ASC bears two Death Domains, PYD and CARD, and functions as an adapter for PYD-containing sensors by bridging them with the CARD of procaspase-1 via homotypic interactions. ASC is a regulator of inflammation by recruiting procaspase-1 (12Stehlik C. Lee S.H. Dorfleutner A. Stassinopoulos A. Sagara J. Reed J.C.

The oligomerization process involved in inflammasome assembly is critical for procaspase-1 autoactivation, which in turn matures interleukin-1β and interleukin-18, thus triggering the inflammatory response (13Rathinam V.A.

Recently, we contributed to increase our understanding of the role of Death Domains in inflammasome assembly by determining the 3D solution structure of NLRP3PYD (PDB code 2NAQ (14Oroz J.

We found that the ASCPYD–ASCPYD and ASCPYD–NLRP3PYD complexes share similar binding interfaces and that the heteromolecular interaction shows higher affinity. Based on these data, we built models of the supramolecular complexes formed by ASCPYD self-association, and of the intermolecular ASCPYD–NLRP3PYD oligomerization, providing insight into potential first stages of inflammasome assembly. EM studies have revealed critical structural characteristics of inflammasomes formed by sensors with CARDs (15Faustin B. Lartigue L. Bruey J.-M. Luciano F. Sergienko E. Bailly-Maitre B. Volkmann N.

The molecular bases of the activation of disc-type inflammasomes have also been unveiled by cryo-EM. Specifically, it has been found that the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome is a nucleated oligomerization (16Halff E.F. Diebolder C.A. Versteeg M. Schouten A. Brondijk T.H. Huizinga E.G.

However, other types of inflammasomes, particularly those formed by NLRP3, without a CARD, appear as large micrometer-size filamentous rings in the cytosol, that concentrically bind to analogous rings formed by the adapter ASC, leaving oligomerized caspase in the center of this cytosolic micrometer-size structure (19Man S.M.

It has also been shown by cryo-EM that a truncated version of human ASC, consisting only of its PYD, forms a hollow right-handed helix with outer and inner diameters of ∼9 and 2 nm, respectively (8Lu A.

More recently, cryo-EM combined with solid-state NMR data has been used to determine the structure of the mouse version of the truncated protein (ASCPYD) (20Sborgi L. Ravotti F. Dandey V.P. Dick M.S.

In this study, solid-state NMR data on filaments formed by full-length mouse ASC indicate that the CARD is unfolded. An unfolded CARD is a surprising result, taking into account that the NMR solution structure of full-length human ASC shows a properly folded CARD adopting the expected six-helix bundle motif (21de Alba E.

According to this model, solely the PYDs of ASC oligomerize to form the helical ultrastructure, whereas the folded CARDs protrude from the helix connected by the semiflexible linker, ready to interact with the CARDs of procaspase-1 molecules (8Lu A.

These structures could be very relevant to understand the inflammasome assembly of micrometer-size filamentous rings that are >100 nm in width (19Man S.M. Hopkins L.J. Nugent E. Cox S. Glück I.M.

U.S.A. 2014; 111: 7403-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, there is currently no structural information on the filaments formed by full-length ASC. Thus, the role of the ASCCARD in filament formation is not well understood. As a result, there are currently large gaps in our understanding of how these structures are formed and scarce information on the structural characteristics and dimensions of the different filaments. Here, we use TEM to show that full-length ASC tends to form filament bundles of dimensions that can only be explained if both CARD and PYD form integral parts of the filament. Thus, our data deviate from the current model for inflammasome assembly in which the CARDs protrude from the polymerized PYDs forming the filament core. Moreover, our TEM images show ring-shaped structures of ∼7-nm diameter that are attached to pre-existing filaments, suggesting a mode of lateral growth for filament stacking. This information could have important implications to explain the assembly of micrometer-size rings formed by ASC in the cytosol of active macrophages (19Man S.M. Hopkins L.J. Nugent E. Cox S. Glück I.M. Tourlomousis P. John A. Wright J.A. Cicuta P. Monie T.P. Bryant C.E. Inflammasome activation causes dual recruitment of NLRC4 and NLRP3 to the same macromolecular complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 7403-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The size of the ring-shaped structures observed in TEM images agrees with the size of ASC dimers calculated with protein docking based on experimental NMR data, which suggests that this oligomer could be the building block in filament assembly. This result is in agreement with previously reported data indicating that the ASC dimer is the minimal oligomer unit in pyroptosome assembly (10Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S. Zhang J. Alnemri E.S. The pyroptosome: a supramolecular assembly of ASC dimers mediating inflammatory cell death via caspase-1 activation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14 (17599095): 1590-160410.1038/sj.cdd.4402194Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that filament and filament stacking can be controlled by pH, pointing to a potential role of pH in inflammasome assembly. Because of the existing controversy in relation to the role played by ASCCARD in filament formation, we have studied by TEM the oligomerization properties of this Death Domain in the absence of the PYD. We found that ASCCARD assembles into filaments with two different ultrastructures, which in turn tend to associate to form highly dense, directional bundles. More importantly, these filaments have significantly different structural characteristics from those of full-length ASC. Finally, we show by solution NMR that ASCCARD, while folded as a six-helix bundle, is able to self-associate, and we identify the binding interfaces responsible for this interaction and estimate the apparent dissociation constant. The influence of pH on the aggregation properties of full-length human ASC in solution has been reported in a previous NMR structural study (21de Alba E. Structure and interdomain dynamics of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC).J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19759015): 32932-3294110.1074/jbc.M109.024273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). ASC cannot be detected by SDS-PAGE in the supernatant of a solution of the protein at pH 7, indicating very low solubility at neutral pH. However, solubility increases greatly at acidic pH (pH ∼4); thus, the 3D solution structure of human full-length ASC at atomic resolution was determined at this pH (12Stehlik C. Lee S.H. Dorfleutner A. Stassinopoulos A. Sagara J. Reed J.C. Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain is a regulator of procaspase-1 activation.J. Immunol. 2003; 171 (14634131): 6154-616310.4049/jimmunol.171.11.6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) (PDB code 2KN6). Both PYD and CARD of ASC are properly folded into the six-helix bundle motif typical of Death Domains and are connected by a semiflexible 23-amino acid-long linker. To improve our understanding on the effect of pH on the oligomerization capabilities of ASC, we have used TEM to analyze the potential formation of filaments under different conditions. Starting with a protein solution at pH 3, human full-length ASC mainly forms amorphous aggregates as well as few rough-edged filaments by rapid pH increase to less acidic values. However, a slow pH increase by dialysis and constant stirring favors filament formation, as observed by better-defined filament and filament bundles and a significantly higher population of these structures (Fig. 2). The filaments formed by human ASC are typically several hundreds of nm long (∼600–800 nm), although filaments longer than 1 μm have also been observed. To study the influence of pH on ASC filament formation, we obtained TEM images at pH values 4.1, 5.1, 6.5, and 7.5. At the more acidic pH, some filaments seem to be already starting to form (Fig. 2A). At pH 5.1, filaments are already visible (data not shown), and at pH 6.5 and 7.5, the number of filaments significantly increases (Fig. 2, B and C). Filaments are observed within a 3-h period after slow pH change by dialysis, and no increase in filament population is apparent after 24 h when checked by TEM after 3 and 4 days of dialysis. Acidification of the filament environment results in partial disassembly of human ASC filaments, as some filaments were still observed after pH decrease to 4.1 (Fig. 2D). Only by lowering the pH to 3.5 are all filaments disassembled, probably due to protein unfolding under these acid conditions. To provide a qualitative evaluation of filament formation, we have counted the number of filaments observed in 10 images obtained under different pH conditions. Once filaments were observed at low magnification, typically 10 images at high magnification were obtained. Images of protein material were obtained in the case where no fully formed filaments were observed (pH 4.1). The number of filaments at the remaining pH conditions was as follows: pH 5.1, 22 filaments; pH 6.5, 76 filaments; pH decrease to 4.1 (after 6.5), 19 filaments. Inspection of additional images supports the conclusion that the great majority of filaments are formed at neutral or close to neutral pH. ASC filaments show a high tendency to stack laterally, forming bundles, and appear in isolation less frequently (Figs. 2 (B and C) and 3 (A and B)). Bundles are typically composed of 2–7 filaments, the three- and four-filament arrangements being more abundant. We used scanning EM (SEM) to analyze larger filament bundles formed by full-length ASC. Our SEM data show higher-order structural organizations seemingly held together through cross-linking, with bundles >100 nm in width (Fig. 3B). To further characterize full-length ASC ultrastructures, we show in Table 1 measurements of the dimensions of bundles composed of different numbers of laterally stacked filaments. Individual filaments, whether in isolation or within a bundle, are ∼6–7 nm wide. Surprisingly, the total width of the different bundles is multiple of the width of one filament, and the multiplication factor coincides with the number of filaments in the bundle (Table 1). This is a striking result in light of the current model for ASC filament formation.Table 1Full-length human ASC filament and bundle dimensionsFilament number in bundleAverage bundle widthaMeasured average and S.D. from a population of 208 (1 filament/bundle), 34 (2 filaments/bundle), 42 (3 filaments/bundle), 16 (4 filaments/bundle), and 6 (5 filaments/bundle).Expected bundle widthbExpected value according to the model derived from the ASCPYD helical tube and assuming filament width values of 6–7 nm.Average filament widthcCalculated average filament width from bundle width divided by number of filaments.nmnmnm16.4 ± 0.86–76.4 ± 0.8214.0 ± 1.116–187.0 ± 0.6322.5 ± 1.326–297.5 ± 0.4429.9 ± 1.836–407.5 ± 0.4535.9 ± 1.246–517.2 ± 0.2a Measured average and S.D. from a population of 208 (1 filament/bundle), 34 (2 filaments/bundle), 42 (3 filaments/bundle), 16 (4 filaments/bundle), and 6 (5 filaments/bundle).b Expected value according to the model derived from the ASCPYD helical tube and assuming filament width values of 6–7 nm.c Calculated average filament width from bundle width divided by number of filaments. Open table in a new tab The cryo-EM structure of human ASCPYD indicates that this domain oligomerizes into a helical tube with an outer diameter of 9 nm (Fig. 4, A and B), a similar result to the width of the filament formed by full-length ASC (Table 1). In principle, a larger diameter for an individual filament of the full-length protein could be expected because of the presence of the CARD (Fig. 4, C and D). However, if the CARD is mobile within the filament as a result of the flexible linker connecting the PYD and CARD in ASC, the TEM images would probably reflect only the PYD tube, and thus ASCPYD and full-length ASC filaments would be similar in size. Nonetheless, the width of the stacked filaments should be larger than the sum of the width of the individual filaments, as the filaments are assumed to bind by CARD–CARD interactions (Fig. 4E). Therefore, the bundle width should"

During the progression of the disorder, phagocytic clearance of dead photoreceptor cell bodies has a protective role by preventing additional retinal damage from accumulation of cellular debris. However, the cells responsible for the clearance remain unidentified. Taking advantage of a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa (RhoP23H/P23H), we clarified the roles of Müller glia in the phagocytosis of rod photoreceptor cells. During the early stage of retinal degeneration, Müller glial cells participated in the phagocytosis of dying or dead rod photoreceptors throughout the outer nuclear layer. Nearly 50% of Müller glia engaged in phagocytosis. Among the Müller phagosomes, >90% matured into phagolysosomes. Those observations indicated that Müller glial cells are the primary contributor to phagocytosis. In contrast, macrophages migrate to the inner part of the outer nuclear layer during photoreceptor degeneration, participating in the phagocytosis of a limited population of dying or dead photoreceptor cells. In healthy retinas of wild-type mice, Müller glial cells phagocytosed cell bodies of dead rod photoreceptors albeit at a lower frequency. Taken together, the phagocytic function of Müller glia is responsible for retinal homeostasis and reorganization under normal and pathologic conditions.—Sakami, S., Imanishi, Y., Palczewski, K.

Indeed, recent advances in chromosome conformation capture and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture methods significantly increase our understanding of CTCF roles in mediating long-range interactions as the basis of the genome partitioning into topologically associating domains (TADs), defined as units of chromosomes exhibiting a high frequency of interaction within domains compared with the adjacent domains. Interestingly, CTCF-binding sites have been found to be enriched at TAD boundaries along with transcription start sites (TSSs), further supporting its role as a chromatin organizer (18Dixon J.R.

In particular, a DNA-guided chromatin assembly model has been proposed based on the recognition of boundary elements by specific proteins, which help loading TADs assembly factors onto chromatin (19Ramírez F.

By these approaches, it has been demonstrated that CTCF exerts its function by specific co-associations with a plethora of other proteins belonging to distinct functional groups such as DNA-binding proteins (e.g. Ying yang YY-1, YB1, and Kaiso), DNA and RNA helicases (e.g. CHD8 and DEAD box RNA helicases p68), histones (e.g. H2A and H2A.Z), and other regulatory proteins including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, nucleophosmin, topoisomerase II, RNA polymerase II, and transcription factor II-I (15Wallace J.A.

It is therefore clear that the identification of novel CTCF-binding partners is of central interest to shed light on mechanisms driving well-known CTCF functions and to open novel perspectives on still unexplored roles of this multivalent transcription factor. Indeed, despite the biological importance of CTCF, our general knowledge of the human CTCF interaction network is limited to selected CTCF protein partners, mainly involved in specific functions such as binding and modification of DNA or chromatin. Recent advances in MS instrumentation and computational tools resulted in the identification of high-confidence interaction proteomes of several biologically relevant protein groups by large-scale affinity purification of proteins coupled to MS (AP-MS) approaches, markedly improving our knowledge of protein interaction networks and functions (28Köcher T.

Here we present a global interaction study of human CTCF by high-resolution nano-LC– electrospray ionization–MS/MS. We identified 90 high confidence protein–protein interactions that constitute a network of proteins with specific functions in chromatin binding, promoter-specific chromatin binding, transcription, and more. In addition to confirming a number of well-known CTCF interactors, our study reveals co-associations of CTCF with still uncharacterized protein partners that are important for genome organization such as BRG1, the major ATPase subunit of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF. This work significantly expands the current knowledge of the human CTCF interactome and represents an important resource to direct future studies aimed at uncovering molecular mechanisms modulating CTCF pleiotropic functions throughout the genome. Despite the master role of CTCF in regulating gene expression and genome structure, a large-scale study to identify CTCF interaction partners by high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis has not been previously reported. Here, we applied an AP-MS approach to characterize the human CTCF interactome in WiT49 cell lines overexpressing CTCF. A schematic outline of the AP-MS procedure used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. Following the transfection of the WiT49 cell line with the pcDNA3 bearing the full-length CTCF DNA encoding sequence, CTCF overexpression was verified by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. S1). Protein complexes were purified by immunoprecipitation on whole cell lysates and protein A affinity pulldown. Then, after tryptic digestion, peptides were subjected to MS/MS in technical replicates by using a nano-LC Orbitrap system. By applying very stringent filtering criteria including the presence in replicate injections and/or identification with more than one unique peptide, 90 high-confidence proteins, putatively belonging to the CTCF interactome, were identified (Table 1).

Brick K. Evrard Y. Xiao T. Camerini-Otero R.D. Felsenfeld G.

We also identified several other known CTCF interactors such as DNA topoisomerase 2 (TOP2B), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, and Cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1 (CAND1) that were not further considered lacking the filtering criteria used in this study. Other previously known CTCF-binding partners were not identified in our screen, likely because of their low abundance that could have prevented their detection by MS. However, we cannot exclude that the failure to identify these proteins could be due to the association of CTCF with different binding partners more relevant in our cell model. The clustering and visualization of protein–protein interaction networks is critical for the functional interpretation of MS data and for targeting validation on novel binding partners of biological relevance. To this aim, candidate CTCF-interacting proteins were mapped on a single interconnected network by the NetworkAnalyst software using the literature-curated IMEx Interactome database. The ClusterMaker2 Cytoscape plug-in was used for clustering and visualizing network nodes into modules for the detection of previously annotated complexes. By this approach, 76 of the 91 candidate proteins were mapped on a network including a large cluster containing several ribosomal proteins (Fig. 2, blue) connected to several smaller ones including a cluster of several ATP-dependent RNA helicases (Fig. 2, yellow).

https://openalex.org/W2951872635,"Although phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSBs) are used in agricultural production, comprehensive research on PSB that colonize the rhizosphere of different plants and promote plant growth is lacking. This study was conducted to examine the growth-promoting effects and colonizing capacity of strain YL6, a PSB. YL6 not only increased the biomass of soybean and wheat in pot experiments but also increased the yield and growth of Chinese cabbage under field conditions. The observed growth promotion was related to the capacity of YL6 to dissolve inorganic and organic phosphorus and to produce indole-3-acetic (IAA) and gibberellin (GA). After applying YL6 to soybean, wheat and Chinese cabbage, the rhizosphere soil available phosphorus (available P) content increased by 120.16%, 62.47% and 7.21%, respectively, and the plant total phosphorus content increased by 198.60%, 6.20% and 78.89%, respectively, compared with plants not treated with YL6. To examine plant colonization, YL6 labeled with green fluorescent protein (YL6-GFP) was inoculated into the plant rhizosphere and found to first colonize the root surface and hairs and then to penetrate into the intercellular spaces and vessels. Collectively, these results demonstrate that YL6 promotes the growth of three different crops and colonizes them in a similar manner. The findings therefore provide a solid foundation for probing the mechanisms by which PSB affect plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2900949525,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, currently lacks effective targeted therapy options. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid and constituent of fish oil, is a common supplement with anti-inflammatory properties. Although it is not a mainstream treatment, several preclinical studies have demonstrated that EPA exerts anti-tumor activity in breast cancer. However, against solid tumors, EPA as a monotherapy is clinically ineffective; thus, we sought to develop a novel targeted drug combination to bolster its therapeutic action against TNBC. Using a high-throughput functional siRNA screen, we identified Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EPHA2), an oncogenic cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase, as a therapeutic target that sensitizes TNBC cells to EPA. EPHA2 expression was uniquely elevated in TNBC cell lines and patient tumors. In independent functional expression studies in TNBC models, EPHA2 gene-silencing combined with EPA significantly reduced cell growth and enhanced apoptosis compared with monotherapies, both in vitro and in vivo. EPHA2-specific inhibitors similarly enhanced the therapeutic action of EPA. Finally, we identified that therapy-mediated apoptosis was attributed to a lethal increase in cancer cell membrane polarity due to ABCA1 inhibition and subsequent dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis. This study provides new molecular and preclinical evidence to support a clinical evaluation of EPA combined with EPHA2 inhibition in patients with TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2901778278,"This study assessed the distribution, abundance, and viability of pre- and post-overwintering Microcystis sediment seed stocks in Western Lake Erie and how these variables are potentially related to past and subsequent bloom formation. We conducted a two-year spatiotemporal survey of vegetative seed stocks in Western Lake Erie, the region where annual algal blooms generally develop. Sediment was collected from 16 sites covering an area of 375 km2 and water column depths ranging from 3-9 meters. Sample collection occurred in November 2014, April 2015, November 2015, and April 2016. The abundance of total and potentially-toxic Microcystis cell equivalents were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A series of laboratory experiments using lake sediment were conducted to assess the viability of Microcystis vegetative seed stocks. Across all sampling periods, the abundance of total Microcystis in the sediment ranged from 6.6 x 10(4) to 1.7 x 10(9) cell equivalents g-1, and potentially-toxic Microcystis ranged from 1.4 x 10(3) to 4.7 x 10(6) cell equivalents g-1. The percent potentially-toxic Microcystis in the sediment ranged from <1% to 68% across all samples. Total Microcystis abundance diminished significantly over winter with densities in spring nearly 10 times less than the previous fall. However, despite cell loss from fall to spring, lab experiments demonstrated that remaining non-toxic and potentially-toxic cells were viable after the overwintering period. Further, lab grow-out experiments indicate that potentially-toxic strains recruited at a slightly higher rate than non-toxic strains, and may in part, contribute to the pattern of higher relative toxicity during early stages of the blooms. The abundance and distribution of overwintering cells did not correlate strongly to areas in the lake where subsequent summer blooms were most persistent. However, numerical analysis suggests that recruitment of benthic overwintering populations could help explain a portion of the initial rapid increase in bloom biomass and the spatial extent of this bloom initiation, particularly when recruitment is paired with subsequent growth in appropriate water column conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2901192685,"Background Few comprehensive data exist regarding the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in low income countries. This study aimed at identifying etiologies and describing clinical features of SARI-associated hospitalization in Madagascar. Methods It is a prospective surveillance of SARI in 2 hospitals for 3 years. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, and blood were collected from SARI patients enrolled and tested for viruses and bacteria. Epidemiological and clinical information were obtained from case report forms. Results Overall, 876 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 83.1% (728/876) were tested positive for at least one pathogen. Viral and bacterial infections occurred in 76.1% (667/876) and 35.8% (314/876) of tested samples, respectively. Among all detected viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common (37.7%; 348/924) followed by influenza virus A (FLUA, 18.4%; 170/924), rhinovirus (RV, 13.5%; 125/924), and adenovirus (ADV, 8.3%; 77/924). Among bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae, 50.3%, 189/370) was the most detected followed by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib, 21.4%; 79/370), and Klebsiella (4.6%; 17/370). Other Streptococcus species were found in 8.1% (30/370) of samples. Compared to patients aged less than 5 years, older age groups were significantly less infected with RSV. On the other hand, patients aged more than 64 years (OR = 3.66) were at higher risk to be infected with FLUA, while those aged 15-29 years (OR = 3.22) and 30-64 years (OR = 2.39) were more likely to be infected with FLUB (influenza virus B). Conclusion The frequency of influenza viruses detected among SARI patients aged 65 years and more highlights the need for health authorities to develop strategies to reduce morbidity amongst at-risk population through vaccine recommendation. Amongst young children, the demonstrated burden of RSV should guide clinicians for a better case management of children. These findings reveal the need to develop point-of-care tests to avoid overuse of antibiotics and to promote vaccine that could reduce drastically the RSV hospitalizations."

However very little is known about how the therapy is experienced by individuals with BPD including which specific elements of ST are helpful or unhelpful from their perspectives. The aim of this study is to explore BPD patients’ experiences of receiving ST, in intensive group or combined group-individual format. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 36 individuals with a primary diagnosis of BPD (78% females) who received ST for at least 12 months. Participants were recruited as part of an international, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). Interview data (11 Australian, 12 Dutch, 13 German) were analyzed following the procedures of qualitative content analysis. Patients’ perceptions of the benefits gained in ST included improved self-understanding, and better awareness and management of their own emotional processes. While some aspects of ST, such as experiential techniques were perceived as emotionally confronting, patient narratives informed that this was necessary. Some recommendations for improved implementation of ST include the necessary adjunct of individual sessions to group ST and early discussion of therapy termination. Implications of the findings are also discussed, in particular the avenues for assessing the suitability of patients for group ST; management of group conflict and the optimal format for delivering treatment in the intensive group versus combined group-individual formats."
https://openalex.org/W2900836368,"Poly (ADP-ribosylation), known as PARylation, is a post-translational modification catalyzed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and primarily removed by the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). While the aberrant removal of post-translation modifications including phosphorylation and methylation has known tumorigenic effects, deregulation of PARylation has not been widely studied. Increased hydrolysis of PARylation chains facilitates cancer growth through enhancing estrogen receptor (ER)-driven proliferation, but oncogenic transformation has not been linked to increased PARG expression. In this study, we find that elevated PARG levels are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancers, especially in HER2-positive and triple-negative subtypes. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that heightened expression of catalytically active PARG facilitates cell transformation and invasion of normal mammary epithelial cells. Catalytically inactive PARG mutants did not recapitulate these phenotypes. Consistent with clinical data showing elevated PARG predicts poor outcomes in HER2+ patients, we observed that PARG acts in synergy with HER2 to promote neoplastic growth of immortalized mammary cells. In contrast, PARG depletion significantly impairs the growth and metastasis of triple-negative breast tumors. Mechanistically, we find that PARG interacts with SMAD2/3 and significantly decreases their PARylation in non-transformed cells, leading to enhanced expression of SMAD target genes. Further linking SMAD-mediated transcription to the oncogenicity of PARG, we show that PARG-mediated anchorage-independent growth and invasion are dependent, at least in part, on SMAD expression. Overall, our study underscores the oncogenic impact of aberrant protein PARylation and highlights the therapeutic potential of PARG inhibition in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2901285059,"Eggplant or brinjal (Solanum melongena) is a popular vegetable grown throughout Asia where it is attacked by brinjal fruit and shoot borer (BFSB) (Leucinodes orbonalis). Yield losses in Bangladesh have been reported up to 86% and farmers rely primarily on frequent insecticide applications to reduce injury. Bangladesh has developed and released four brinjal varieties producing Cry1Ac (Bt brinjal) and is the first country to do so. We report on the first replicated field trials comparing four Bt brinjal varieties to their non-Bt isolines, with and without standard insecticide spray regimes. Results of the two-year study (2016–17) indicated Bt varieties had increased fruit production and minimal BFSB fruit infestation compared with their respective non-Bt isolines. Fruit infestation for Bt varieties varied from 0–2.27% in 2016, 0% in 2017, and was not significantly affected by the spray regime in either year. In contrast, fruit infestation in non-Bt lines reached 36.70% in 2016 and 45.51% in 2017, even with weekly spraying. An economic analysis revealed that all Bt lines had higher gross returns than their non-Bt isolines. The non-sprayed non-Bt isolines resulted in negative returns in most cases. Maximum fruit yield was obtained from sprayed plots compared to non-sprayed plots, indicating that other insects such as whiteflies, thrips and mites can reduce plant vigor and subsequent fruit weight. Statistically similar densities of non-target arthropods, including beneficial arthropods, were generally observed in both Bt and non-Bt varieties. An additional trial that focused on a single Bt variety and its isoline provided similar results on infestation levels, with and without sprays, and similarly demonstrated higher gross returns and no significant effects on non-target arthropods. Together, these studies indicate that the four Bt brinjal lines are extremely effective at controlling BFSB in Bangladesh without affecting other arthropods, and provide greater economic returns than their non-Bt isolines."
https://openalex.org/W2894666520,"Introduction In cancer care, do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decisions are made frequently; i.e., decisions not to start the heart in the event of a cardiac arrest. A DNR decision can be a complex process involving nurses and physicians with a wide variety of experiences and perspectives. Previous studies have shown different perceptions of the DNR decision process among nurses and physicians, e.g. concerning patient involvement and information. DNR decisions have also been reported to be unclear and documentation inconsistent. Objective The aim was to investigate how important and how likely to happen nurses and physicians considered various aspects of the DNR decision process, regarding participation, information and documentation, as well as which attributes they found most important in relation to DNR decisions. Methods A descriptive correlational study using a web survey was conducted, including 132 nurses and 84 physicians working in hematology and oncology. Results Almost half of the respondents reported it not likely that the patient would be involved in the decision on DNR, and 21% found it unimportant to inform patients of the DNR decision. Further, 57% reported that providing information to the patient was important, but only 21% stated that this was likely to happen. There were differences between nurses and physicians, especially regarding participation by and information to patients and relatives. The attributes deemed most important for both nurses and physicians pertained more to medical viewpoints than to ethical values, but a difference was found, as nurses chose patient autonomy as the most important value, while physicians rated non-maleficence as the most important value in relation to DNR decisions. Conclusion Nurses and physicians need to be able to talk openly about their different perspectives on DNR decisions, so that they can develop a deeper understanding of the decisions, especially in cases where they disagree. They should also be aware that what they think is important is not always likely to happen. The organization needs to support such discussions through providing an environment that allows ethical discussions on regular basis. Patients and relatives will also benefit from receiving the same information from all caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W2900718358,"The little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata, native to the Neotropics, has become a serious pest worldwide over the past 100 years. It was originally distributed from Mexico to northern Argentina and new evidence suggests a recent southern range expansion during the last 60 years reaching central Argentina. This supercolonial ant species has a polymorphic reproductive system. Some populations, mostly found in undisturbed natural environments, are characterised by a classical sexual haplodiploid reproductive system. In other populations, which mainly occur in human-modified habitats, diploid queens and haploid males are produced clonally while workers are produced sexually. Here we studied the association between the recent southern range expansion of W. auropunctata in relation to human activity and clonality. We carried out an extensive survey within the southern limit of the species’ native distribution and characterised the type of habitat where populations were found. Moreover, we genetically determined the type of reproductive system in 35 populations by genotyping at 12 microsatellite loci a total of 191 reproductive individuals (i.e. queens and/or males). Clonality was the most common reproductive system, occurring in 31 out of 35 populations analysed. All the populations found in the recently colonised area in central Argentina were clonal and established in human-modified habitats, suggesting that clonality together with human activity might have facilitated the southwards expansion of W. auropunctata."

In order to solve the problem of Laplace noise randomness which causes the center point to deviate, especially when poor availability of clustering results appears because of small privacy budget parameters, an improved differential privacy protecting K-means clustering algorithm was raised in this paper. The improved algorithm uses the contour coefficients to quantitatively evaluate the clustering effect of each iteration and add different noise to different clusters. In order to be adapted to the huge number of data, this paper provides an algorithm design in MapReduce Framework. Experimental finding shows that the new algorithm improves the availability of the algorithm clustering results under the condition of ensuring individual privacy without significantly increasing its operating time."

We investigated the role of FABP4 in host defense in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, FABP4-deficient (FABP4-/-) mice exhibited decreased bacterial clearance and increased mortality when challenged intranasally with P. aeruginosa. These findings in FABP4-/- mice were associated with a delayed neutrophil recruitment into the lungs and were followed by greater acute lung injury and inflammation. Among leukocytes, only macrophages expressed FABP4 in WT mice with P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Chimeric FABP4-/- mice with WT bone marrow were protected from increased mortality seen in chimeric WT mice with FABP4-/- bone marrow during P. aeruginosa pneumonia, thus confirming the role of macrophages as the main source of protective FABP4 against that infection. There was less production of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) in FABP4-/- alveolar macrophages and lower airway CXCL1 levels in FABP4-/- mice. Delivering recombinant CXCL1 to the airways protected FABP4-/- mice from increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Thus, macrophage-FABP4 has a novel role in pulmonary host defense against P. aeruginosa infection by facilitating crosstalk between macrophages and neutrophils via regulation of macrophage CXCL1 production.-Liang, X., Gupta, K., Rojas Quintero, J., Cernadas, M., Kobzik, L., Christou, H., Pier, G.

Using tissue-specific SCAP knockdown in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mice, we sought to search the mechanism through which SCAP signaling affects VSMC foam cell development. VSMC-specific SCAP knockdown mice were generated by Cre/LoxP-mediated gene targeting in ApoE-/- mice. Breeding SCAPflox/flox mice with SM22α-Cre mice resulted in no viable offspring with the homozygote SM22-Cre: SCAPflox/flox genotype due to embryonic lethality. We found that the heterozygote SM22α-Cre:SCAPflox/+:ApoE-/- mice fed a Western diet for 12 wk had significantly fewer atherosclerotic plaques in their aortas than the control mice due to reduced cholesterol uptake and synthesis. Furthermore, we found that autophagy in VSMCs was increased in SM22α-Cre:SCAPflox/+:ApoE-/- mice. Similarly, in vitro, SCAP knockdown in human coronary artery VSMCs by RNA interference reduced lipid accumulation and increased autophagy under LDL cholesterol loading. SCAP knockdown in VSMCs reduced oxidative stress and increased AMPK phosphorylation, which contributed to the up-regulation of autophagy in vivo and in vitro. VSMC-specific SCAP knockdown decreased the lipid accumulation and intracellular oxidative stress, increased excessive lipid clearance by enhancing lipid autophagy mediated by the reactive oxygen species/AMPK pathway in VSMCs, and consequently alleviated atherosclerosis plaque formation.-Li, D., Chen, A., Lan, T., Zou, Y., Zhao, L., Yang, P., Qu, H., Wei, L., Varghese, Z., Moorhead, J.

https://openalex.org/W2901425762,"Reducing neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is a challenge in many low- and middle-income countries including Bangladesh. In 2014, the estimated NMR in this country was 28 per 1,000 live births. This rate is higher in rural regions compared to the national average. Currently, Sylhet Division has the highest NMR in Bangladesh. Investigating rates and determinants of neonatal mortality in rural regions of this high-risk division is particularly important to implement evidence-based programs. This study examined rates and determinants of neonatal deaths in a large rural cohort in Sylhet Division.We analyzed data from a multi-country cohort study, Aetiology of Neonatal Infections in South Asia. From November 2011 to December 2013, this study was conducted in two rural sub-districts in Sylhet Division. Community health workers followed 28,960 pregnant women and their newborns up to two months postpartum and collected data on pregnancy outcomes and newborns' survival status. The NMR was obtained by dividing total number of neonatal deaths with all studied newborns. Logistic regression was employed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with neonatal mortality. Stata 14.0 was used for data analysis.This study analyzed data of 21,227 newborns. The NMR was 43.4 (95% CI: 39.3-48.0) per 1,000 live births (N = 922). Multivariable analysis showed that the odds of neonatal mortality were significantly higher among male newborns (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8), babies born before 34 weeks of gestation (AOR: 5.0, 95% CI: 4.1-6.1), those who were twins or triplets (AOR: 6.2, 95% CI: 3.6-10.9), and first-born child (AOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6-5.3). Additionally, maternal age 30-35 years (AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.-1.8), history of child death (AOR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.2), and delivery complications (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.6-2.6) had positive associations with neonatal deaths.Public health programs in Bangladesh need to adopt a comprehensive strategy to address the individual, maternal, and intrapartum factors associated with neonatal mortality in rural regions.

We aim to investigate changes in salivary immunity after a marathon and its relationship with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in healthy non-elite marathon runners.Forty seven healthy marathon runners (28 males and 19 females) who completed the 42.195 km of the 2016 Barcelona marathon were studied. Saliva and blood samples were collected the day before the marathon and two days after the end of the race. Salivary IgA, antimicrobial proteins (lactoferrin, lysozyme) and chemokines (Groα, Groβ, MCP-1) were determined using ELISA kits in saliva supernatant. Blood biochemistry and haemogram were analyzed in all participants. The presence of LRTI was considered in those runners who reported infectious lower respiratory tract symptoms during a minimum of 3 consecutive days in the 2 weeks after the race.Eight participants (17%) presented a LRTI during the 2 weeks of follow-up. Higher lysozyme levels were detected after the race in runners with LRTI when compared with those without infection. A decrease in salivary lysozyme, Groα and Groβ levels after the race were observed in those runners who did not develop a LRTI when compared to basal levels. Salivary Groα levels correlated with basophil blood counts, and salivary lysozyme levels correlated with leukocyte blood counts.LRTI are common after a marathon race in non-elite healthy runners. Changes in salivary antimicrobial proteins and chemokines are related to the presence of LRTI and correlate with systemic defense cells, which suggest an important role of salivary immunity in the development of LRTI in non-elite marathon runners."

The mechanism how LRP1 modulates cancer progression is poorly understood. In this study we found that LRP1 and one of its ligands, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), are expressed in melanoma cells and control melanoma growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic studies were performed on 2 melanoma cancer cell lines, B16F10 and the B16F1 cells, both of which form primary melanoma tumors, but only B16F10 cells metastasize to the lungs. Tumor-, but not niche cell-derived tPA, enhanced melanoma cell proliferation in tPA-/- mice. Gain-of-function experiments revealed that melanoma LRP1 is critical for tumor growth, recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells into the tumor bed, and metastasis. Melanoma LRP1 was found to enhance ERK activation, resulting in increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 RNA, protein, and secreted activity, a well-known modulator of melanoma metastasis. Restoration of LRP1 and tPA in the less aggressive, poorly metastatic B16F1 tumor cells enhanced tumor cell proliferation and led to massive lung metastasis in murine tumor models. Antimelanoma drug treatment induced tPA and LRP1 expression. tPA or LRP1 knockdown enhanced chemosensitivity in melanoma cells. Our results identify the tPA-LRP1 pathway as a key switch that drives melanoma progression, in part by modulating the cellular composition and proteolytic makeup of the tumor niche. Targeting this pathway may be a novel treatment strategy in combination treatments for melanoma.-Salama, Y., Lin, S.-Y., Dhahri, D., Hattori, K., Heissig, B.

https://openalex.org/W2900704955,"Age-related changes in memory are not uniform, even in the absence of dementia. Characterization of non-disease associated cognitive changes is crucial to gain a more complete understanding of brain aging. Episodic memory was investigated in 13,037 ethnically diverse elderly (ages 72 to 85 years) with two to 15 years of follow-up, and with known dementia status, age, sex, education, and APOE genotypes. Adjusted trajectories of episodic memory performance over time were estimated using Latent Class Mixed Models. Analysis was conducted using two samples at baseline evaluation: i) non-cognitively impaired individuals, and ii) all individuals regardless of dementia status. We calculated the age-specific annual incidence rates of dementia in the non-demented elderly (n = 10,220). Two major episodic memory trajectories were estimated: 1) Stable—consisting of individuals exhibiting a constant or improved memory function, and 2) Decliner—consisting of individuals whose memory function declined. The majority of the study participants maintain their memory performance over time. Compared to those with Stable trajectory, individuals characterized as Decliners were more likely to have non-white ethnic background, fewer years of education, a higher frequency of ε4 allele at APOE gene and five times more likely to develop dementia. The steepest decline in episodic memory was observed in Caribbean-Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites (p = 4.3 x 10−15). The highest incident rates of dementia were observed in the oldest age group, among those of Caribbean-Hispanics ancestry and among Decliners who exhibited rates five times higher than those with Stable trajectories (11 per 100 person-years versus 3 per 100 person-years. Age, education, ethnic background and APOE genotype influence the maintenance of episodic memory. Declining memory is one of the strongest predictors of incident dementia."

Methods This retrospective study included 229 patients who underwent whole-body MRI as part of a routine health examination and cancer screening. The WB MRIs and radiologic reports were evaluated by a musculoskeletal radiologist, a neuroradiologist, and an abdominal radiologist. The consensus of their findings was characterized into three categories, as follows: suspicion of malignancy (category I); need for follow-up (category II); and no need for follow-up (category III). Any correlations between the abnormal findings and each study group were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test. Results There were six category I lesions, among which two cases were found to involve malignancy. The most common category II findings were annular tears of the disc (14% of category II findings) and severe disc bulging or protrusion, followed by shoulder bursitis and uterine myoma. The most common category III finding was mild disc bulging or protrusion (47% of category III findings). Conclusions WB MRI can be used in cancer screening and for regular health evaluations. WB MRI not only provides information about potential malignancy, but also provides information regarding nonmalignant abnormalities that require further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2901812574,"Background Globally, there were 2.7 million neonatal deaths in 2015. Significant mortality reduction could be achieved by improving care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where the majority of deaths occur. Determining the physical readiness of facilities to identify and manage complications is an essential component of strategies to reduce neonatal mortality. Methods We developed clinical cascades for 6 common neonatal conditions then utilized these to assess 23 health facilities in Kenya and Uganda at 2 time-points in 2016 and 2017. We calculated changes in resource availability over time by facility using McNemar’s test. We estimated mean readiness and loss of readiness for the 6 conditions and 3 stages of care (identification, treatment, monitoring-modifying treatment). We estimated overall mean readiness and readiness loss across all conditions and stages. Finally, we compared readiness of facilities with a newborn special care unit (NSCU) to those without using the two-sample test of proportions. Results The cascade model estimated mean readiness of 26.3–26.6% across the 3 stages for all conditions. Mean readiness ranged from 11.6% (respiratory distress-apnea) to 47.8% (essential newborn care) across both time-points. The model estimated overall mean readiness loss of 30.4–31.9%. There was mild to moderate variability in the timing of readiness loss, with the majority occurring in the identification stage. Overall mean readiness was higher among facilities with a NSCU (36.8%) compared to those without (20.0%). Conclusion The cascade model provides a novel approach to quantitatively assess physical readiness for neonatal care. Among 23 facilities in Kenya and Uganda, we identified a consistent pattern of 30–32% readiness loss across cascades and stages. This aggregate measure could be used to monitor and compare readiness at the facility-, health system-, or national-level. Estimates of readiness and loss of readiness may help guide strategies to improve care, prioritize resources, and promote neonatal survival in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W2900578400,"The influence of loading on muscular hypertrophy has previously been studied in rodents by removal of synergistic muscles or various weight-lifting regimes. We present a novel model, evoking hypertrophy in the ratʹs tibialis anterior (TA) muscle by means of an implanted single channel electrical nerve stimulator. The amount of load experienced by the TA was measured in acute experiments in anaesthetized rats with contractions over a range of stimulation frequency and amplitude. A novel electrode configuration allowed us to elicit concentric, isometric and eccentric contractions within the same setup. This was achieved by ‘SpillOver’ stimulation in which we adjusted the amount of co-activation of the stronger antagonistic plantarflexors by increasing the stimulus above the level that caused full recruitment of the dorsiflexor muscles. The effect of loading on hypertrophy of the TA was tested in 3–4 week stimulation experiments in two groups of freely-moving rats, with a protocol that resembles typical resistance-training in humans. One group performed concentric contractions with no antagonistic co-contraction (unloaded, UNL, n = 5). In the other group the TA was loaded by simultaneous co-contraction of the antagonistically acting plantarflexors (SpillOver, n = 5). The wet mass of the stimulated TA increased in both groups; by 5.4 ± 5.5% for the UNL-group and 13.9 ± 2.9% for the SpillOver-group, with significantly greater increase in the SpillOver-group (p<0.05). Our results correlate well with values reported in literature, demonstrating that SpillOver-stimulation is a suitable model in which to study muscular hypertrophy. Even higher gains in muscle-mass may be possible by optimizing and adjusting the stimulation parameters according to the principles of progressive resistance training."

Figure skating may also benefit from this technology, but the inherent movements present some unique challenges. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to monitor three aspects of figure skating jumping performance: jump count, jump height, and rotation speed. Seven competitive figure skaters, outfitted with a waist-mounted IMU, performed a total of 59 isolated multi-revolution jumps and their competition routines, which consisted of 41 multi-revolution jumps along with spins, footwork, and other skills. The isolated jumps were used to develop a jump identification algorithm, which was tested on the competition routines. Four algorithms to estimate jump height from flight time were then evaluated using calibrated video as a gold standard. The identification algorithm counted 39 of the 41 program jumps correctly, with one false positive. Flight time and jump height errors under 7% and 15% respectively were found using a peak-to-peak scaling algorithm. Rotation speeds up to 1,500°/s were noted, with peak speeds occurring just over halfway between takeoff and landing. Overall, jump monitoring via IMUs may be an efficient aid for figure skaters training multi-revolution jumps."
https://openalex.org/W2900557581,"In the southern Brazilian highlands, pre-Columbian societies created domesticated landscapes through the use and management of forests, including nurse Araucaria angustifolia trees, a common conifer in these regions. Nowadays, local smallholders still use traditional practices, such as burning, to promote vegetation for cattle grazing in highland grasslands. Even though burning is normally of small extent and low frequency, such management can slow down natural forest expansion and contribute to the maintenance of grasslands, by opposing the facilitative effect of nurse araucaria trees. To comprehend the interplay between human cultural management, species interactions and the environment, it is important to better understand how these relations affect diversity and composition. Our goal was to investigate how land management, biotic interactions and abiotic factors affect saplings species richness, abundance and composition. We hypothesized that (1) land management would decrease sapling richness and abundance and change sapling composition, (2) nurse araucaria trees would increase species richness and abundance and change sapling composition, and (3) the interactive effect between land management and nurse araucaria trees would shape sapling richness, abundance and composition. Data were collected in unmanaged and managed conditions, both beneath araucaria crowns and in nearby treeless areas. Our results indicate that abundance and species composition are affected by land management and araucaria crown influence. The highest values of sapling abundance were found beneath crowns in unmanaged areas. Species composition changed between all assessed combinations of land management and crown influence. Our study demonstrates the major roles of land management and facilitation in structuring communities, despite the effects of rock and grass cover. Moreover, our results clarify patterns and processes that may emerge in natural highland grasslands, such as the conversion of grasslands into forests and the loss of cultural landscapes when the main local management actions are excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2901616957,"Air pollution is the single most important environmental health risk, causing about 7 million premature deaths annually worldwide. China is the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic air pollutants, which causes major negative health consequences. The Chinese government has implemented several policies to reduce air pollution, with success in some but far from all sectors. In addition to the health benefits, reducing air pollution will have side-benefits, such as an increase in the electricity generated by the solar photovoltaic panels via an increase in surface solar irradiance through a reduction of haze and aerosol-impacted clouds. We use the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM6-HAM2 with the bottom-up emissions inventory from the Community Emission Data System and quantify the geographically specific increases in generation and economic revenue to the Chinese solar photovoltaic fleet as a result of reducing or eliminating air pollution from the energy, industrial, transport, and residential and commercial sectors. We find that by 2040, the gains will be substantial: the projected solar photovoltaic fleet would produce between 85–158 TWh/year of additional power in clean compared to polluted air, generating US$6.9–10.1 billion of additional annual revenues in the solar photovoltaic sector alone. Furthermore, we quantify the cost of adopting best-practice emission standards in all sectors and find that the revenue gains from the increased solar photovoltaic generation could offset up to about 13–17% of the costs of strong air pollution control measures designed to reach near-zero emissions in all sectors. Hence, reducing air pollution in China will not only have clear health benefits, but the side-effect of increased solar power generation would also offset a sizeable share of the costs of air pollution control measures."

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether brusatol also promotes beneficial effects in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and if so, to study the mechanisms by which brusatol acts. In vivo, we observed that the impaired glucose tolerance of HFD-fed male C57BL/6 mice was counteracted by a 2 wk treatment with brusatol. Brusatol treatment improved both β-cell function and peripheral insulin sensitivity of HFD-fed mice. In vitro, brusatol inhibited β-cell total protein and proinsulin biosynthesis, with an ED50 of ∼40 nM. In line with this, brusatol blocked cytokine-induced iNOS protein expression via inhibition of iNOS mRNA translation. Brusatol may have affected protein synthesis, at least in part, via inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) hypusination, as eIF5A spermidine association and hypusination in RIN-5AH cells was reduced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The eIF5A hypusination inhibitor GC7 promoted a similar effect. Both brusatol and GC7 protected rat RIN-5AH cells against cytokine-induced cell death. Brusatol reduced eIF5A hypusination and cytokine-induced cell death in EndoC-βH1 cells as well. Finally, hypusinated eIF5A was reduced in vivo by brusatol in islet endocrine and endothelial islet cells of mice fed an HFD. The results of the present study suggest that brusatol improves glucose intolerance in mice fed an HFD, possibly by inhibiting protein biosynthesis and eIF5A hypusination.-Turpaev, K., Krizhanovskii, C., Wang, X., Sargsyan, E., Bergsten, P., Welsh, N.

https://openalex.org/W2901934095,"There has been increasing concern for Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) populations in North America due to current and future projections of mortality risk and habitat loss from anthropogenic sources. Identification of high-use movement corridors and bottlenecks for the migratory portion of the eagle population in western North America is an important first step to help habitat conservation and management efforts to reduce the risk of eagle mortality. We used dynamic Brownian Bridge movement models to estimate utilization distributions of adult eagles migrating across the western North America and identified high-use areas by calculating the overlap of individuals on population and regional levels. On a population level, the Rocky Mountain Front from east-central British Columbia to central Montana and southwestern Yukon encompassed the most used migration corridors with our study extent for both spring and fall. Regional analysis on a 100 x 200 km scale revealed additional moderate and high-level use corridors in the central British Columbia plateaus. Eagles were more dispersed in the spring until their routes converged in southern Alberta. High-use fall corridors extended farther south into central Wyoming. Knowledge of these high-use areas can aid in conservation and site planning to help maintain and enhance migratory Golden Eagle populations in western North America."

However, there exist a number of applications in neuroscience research that require firing rate to be estimated on a single trial basis. Estimating firing rate from a single trial is a challenging problem and current state-of-the-art methods do not perform well. To address this issue, we develop a new method for estimating firing rate based on a kernel smoothing technique that considers the bandwidth as a random variable with prior distribution that is adaptively updated under an empirical Bayesian framework. By carefully selecting the prior distribution together with Gaussian kernel function, an analytical expression can be achieved for the kernel bandwidth. We refer to the proposed method as Bayesian Adaptive Kernel Smoother (BAKS). We evaluate the performance of BAKS using synthetic spike train data generated by biologically plausible models: inhomogeneous Gamma (IG) and inhomogeneous inverse Gaussian (IIG). We also apply BAKS to real spike train data from non-human primate (NHP) motor and visual cortex. We benchmark the proposed method against established and previously reported methods. These include: optimized kernel smoother (OKS), variable kernel smoother (VKS), local polynomial fit (Locfit), and Bayesian adaptive regression splines (BARS). Results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to competing methods. This suggests that the proposed method could be useful for understanding the encoding mechanism of neurons in cognitive-related tasks. The proposed method could also potentially improve the performance of brain-machine interface (BMI) decoder that relies on estimated firing rate as the input."
https://openalex.org/W2951318181,"The significance of the relationship between the nervous and immune systems with respect to disease course is increasingly apparent. Immune cells in the liver and spleen are responsible for the development of acute liver injury, yet the regulatory mechanisms of the interactions remain elusive. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is released from the sensory nervous system, regulates innate immune activation via receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), a subunit of the CGRP receptor. Here, we show that RAMP1 in Kupffer cells (KCs) plays a critical role in the etiology of immune-mediated hepatitis. RAMP1-deficient mice with concanavalin A (ConA)-mediated hepatitis, characterized by severe liver injury accompanied by infiltration of immune cells and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by KCs and splenic T cells, showed poor survival. Removing KCs ameliorated liver damage, while depleting T cells or splenectomy led to partial amelioration. Adoptive transfer of splenic T cells from RAMP1-deficient mice led to a modest increase in liver injury. Co-culture of KCs with splenic T cells led to increased cytokine expression by both cells in a RAMP1-dependent manner. Thus, immune-mediated hepatitis develops via crosstalk between immune cells. RAMP1 in KCs is a key regulator of immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2978277871,"The effect of dose-delivery time with flattening filter (FF) and flattening filter-free (FFF) photon beams based on microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM) was investigated in this study. Monte Carlo simulation with the particle and heavy ion transport code system (PHITS) was performed to calculate the dose-mean lineal energy yD (keV/μm) of FF and FFF 6 MV photon beams using the IAEA phase-space files of Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator. Human non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H460 cells were used to determine the MKM parameters under the condition that dose-delivery times with continuous irradiation were 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, and the adsorbed dose was 2, 4, and 8 Gy in this study. In addition, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of FF and FFF photon beams were calculated for evaluating the effect of dose delivery time. The RBE of FF decreased to 99.8% and 97.5% with 5 and 60 min for 2 Gy in comparison to 99.6% and 95.1% for 8 Gy, respectively. Meanwhile, that of FFF decreased to 99.5% and 94.9% with 5 and 60 min for 2 Gy in comparison to 99.5% and 94.9% for 8 Gy, respectively. Dose-delivery time has an effect on the RBE with photon beams. In other words, the dose-delivery time should be considered during radiation therapy. Furthermore, FFF photon beams were an effective irradiation method compared to FF in dose-delivery time on account of improving clinic throughput."
https://openalex.org/W2900583301,"FoxO proteins are major targets of insulin action, and FoxO1 mediates the effects of insulin on hepatic glucose metabolism. We reported previously that serpinB1 is a liver-secreted factor (hepatokine) that promotes adaptive β-cell proliferation in response to insulin resistance in the liver-specific insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mouse. Here we report that FoxO1 plays a critical role in promoting serpinB1 expression in hepatic insulin resistance in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Mice lacking both the insulin receptor and FoxO1 (LIRFKO) exhibit reduced β-cell mass compared with LIRKO mice because of attenuation of β-cell proliferation. Although hepatic expression of serpinB1 mRNA and protein levels was increased in LIRKO mice, both the mRNA and protein levels returned to control levels in LIRFKO mice. Furthermore, liver-specific expression of constitutively active FoxO1 in transgenic mice induced an increase in hepatic serpinB1 mRNA and protein levels in refed mice. Conversely, serpinB1 mRNA and protein levels were reduced in mice lacking FoxO proteins in the liver. ChIP studies demonstrated that FoxO1 binds to three distinct sites located ∼9 kb upstream of the serpinb1 gene in primary mouse hepatocytes and that this binding is enhanced in hepatocytes from LIRKO mice. However, adenoviral expression of WT or constitutively active FoxO1 and insulin treatment are sufficient to regulate other FoxO1 target genes (IGFBP-1 and PEPCK) but not serpinB1 expression in mouse primary hepatocytes. These results indicate that liver FoxO1 promotes serpinB1 expression in hepatic insulin resistance and that non-cell-autonomous factors contribute to FoxO1-dependent effects on serpinB1 expression in the liver. FoxO proteins are major targets of insulin action, and FoxO1 mediates the effects of insulin on hepatic glucose metabolism.

Previously, we reported that, in addition to restoring the ability of insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis and suppress hepatic glucose production, disrupting FoxO1 expression in the liver also reverses β-cell hyperplasia in LIRKO mice (25O-Sullivan I.

Here we report that hepatic FoxO1, a major target of insulin action in the liver (25O-Sullivan I. Zhang W. Wasserman D.H. Liew C.W. Liu J. Paik J. DePinho R.A. Stolz D.B. Kahn C.R. Schwartz M.W.

We first asked whether hepatic FoxO1 plays a critical role in promoting islet β-cell proliferation in the setting of hepatic insulin resistance using LIRKO and LIRFKO mice. We measured islet mass and β-cell replication in 10-week-old male insulin receptor–floxed (IRfl/fl), LIRKO, and LIRFKO mice by insulin and Ki67 co-immunostaining. As shown in Fig. 1, A–D, islet area, islet mass, and β-cell proliferation were increased 3- to 4-fold in LIRKO compared with IRfl/fl littermate controls, consistent with previous studies (6El Ouaamari A.

In contrast, islet mass and β-cell proliferation were not increased in LIRFKO mice compared with floxed controls (Fig. 1, A–D), indicating that FoxO1 plays an important role in promoting β-cell proliferation in the setting of hepatic insulin resistance. In agreement with changes in islet β-cell proliferation and area, LIRKO mice exhibited 11-fold higher insulin levels compared with control mice, and this effect was also largely reversed in LIRFKO mice (Fig. 1E). Next, we assessed the abundance of serpinB1 mRNA and protein levels in the liver of LIRKO, LIRFKO, and IRfl/fl mice. For comparison, we also assessed the expression of insulin-like growth factor–binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), a canonical FoxO1 target gene that is directly regulated by FoxO proteins through well-characterized cis-acting FoxO-binding sites located within the proximal IGFBP-1 promoter (33Guo S.

As expected, IGFBP-1 mRNA levels were increased ∼50-fold in LIRKO livers compared with IRfl/fl or IR/FoxO1-floxed (IRfl/flFfl/fl) mice, whereas IGFBP-1 mRNA levels were not increased in LIRFKO-derived livers relative to IRfl/fl and IRfl/flFfl/fl mice (Fig. 1F). Gene expression studies showed that liver serpinB1 mRNA levels also were increased ∼70-fold in LIRKO compared with IRfl/fl mice (Fig. 1G), consistent with previous studies (6El Ouaamari A. Dirice E.

In contrast, LIRFKO mice displayed no increase in serpinB1 gene expression compared with floxed controls, indicating that FoxO1 plays a critical role in promoting the expression of serpinB1 in the liver when hepatic insulin signaling is disrupted, suggesting effects on gene transcription, although effects on pre-mRNA or mRNA stability cannot be ruled out. Similarly, Western blotting showed that the level of serpinB1 protein was markedly increased in the livers of LIRKO but not LIRFKO mice compared with floxed controls (Fig. 1, H and I). To better characterize the effects of FoxO1 on serpinB1 expression, we also examined hepatic expression of serpinB1 (and IGFBP-1) in WT mice and FoxO1 transgenic mice (Tgn), which express a constitutively active form of FoxO1 (TSS/A-FoxO1) in the liver (34Zhang W.

https://openalex.org/W2900682125,"Sterols play critical roles in various membrane fusion events, including soluble NSF attachment protein receptor-mediated membrane fusion, mainly by modulating the physical properties of biologic membranes; however, it remains unclear whether they also function in atlastin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane fusion. Although ergosterol, the major sterol in yeast, is essential for fusion of Sey1p (yeast atlastin)-containing liposomes with an ER-mimicking lipid composition, fusion of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine liposomes does not require sterols. Here, we examined whether sterols are important for Sey1p-mediated ER fusion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using an in vitro ER fusion assay with isolated yeast ER microsomes. Ergosterol-specific ligands inhibited microsome fusion, indicating that ergosterol is critical for ER fusion. However, microsomes isolated from yeast strains lacking genes that encode enzymes involved in synthesis of ergosterol from lanosterol still fused, suggesting that other sterols can replace ergosterol and support Sey1p-mediated ER fusion. Importantly, disruption of sterol-binding motifs in the transmembrane regions of Sey1p markedly reduced ER fusion. Sey1p physically interacted with Erg11p and Erg4p, which function in ergosterol biosynthesis, suggesting that Sey1p recruits ergosterol-synthesizing enzymes to fusion sites and thereby enriches ergosterol, which, in turn, may recruit more Sey1p. This positive feedback loop may facilitate ER membrane fusion by concentrating fusion factors at fusion sites.—Lee, M., Moon, Y., Lee, S., Lee, C., Jun, Y.

Both populations showed a highly similar morphology, however different ontogenetic pattern in between. The study confirms the validity of the species S. tricirrata which was considered to be a species within the Sterkiella histriomuscorum complex. The main ontogenetic difference between S. tricirrata and other species of the genus Sterkiella is the different mode of formation of anlagen V and VI of the proter in the former. In the phylogenetic analyses, Sterkiella tricirrata clusters with Sterkiella sinica within the stylonychine oxytrichids, in a clade away from the type species (Sterkiella cavicola) of the genus Sterkiella. The study highlights the importance of ontogenetic as well as molecular data in shedding light on the polyphyletic behavior of the genus Sterkiella. A detailed description of S. tricirrata based on morphology, ontogenesis and molecular phylogenetic methods is presented. Further, the improved diagnosis has been provided for the genus Sterkiella and the poorly known species S. tricirrata."
https://openalex.org/W2901240638,"The centromere is an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic protein machinery essential for precision segregation of the parental genome into two daughter cells during mitosis. Centromere protein A (CENP-A) organizes the functional centromere via a constitutive centromere-associated network composing the CENP-T complex. However, how CENP-T assembles onto the centromere remains elusive. Here we show that CENP-T binds directly to Holliday junction recognition protein (HJURP), an evolutionarily conserved chaperone involved in loading CENP-A. The binding interface of HJURP was mapped to the C terminus of CENP-T. Depletion of HJURP by CRISPR-elicited knockout minimized recruitment of CENP-T to the centromere, indicating the importance of HJURP in CEPN-T loading. Our immunofluorescence analyses indicate that HJURP recruits CENP-T to the centromere in S/G2 phase during the cell division cycle. Significantly, the HJURP binding-deficient mutant CENP-T6L failed to locate to the centromere. Importantly, CENP-T insufficiency resulted in chromosome misalignment, in particular chromosomes 15 and 18. Taken together, these data define a novel molecular mechanism underlying the assembly of CENP-T onto the centromere by a temporally regulated HJURP-CENP-T interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2949794883,"Flagella, the primary means of motility in bacteria, are helical filaments that function as microscopic propellers composed of thousands of copies of the protein flagellin. Here, we show that many bacteria encode “giant” flagellins, greater than a thousand amino acids in length, and that two species that encode giant flagellins, the marine γ-proteobacteria Bermanella marisrubri and Oleibacter marinus, produce monopolar flagellar filaments considerably thicker than filaments composed of shorter flagellin monomers. We confirm that the flagellum from B. marisrubri is built from its giant flagellin. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the mechanism of evolution of giant flagellins has followed a stepwise process involving an internal domain duplication followed by insertion of an additional novel insert. This work illustrates how “the” bacterial flagellum should not be seen as a single, idealised structure, but as a continuum of evolved machines adapted to a range of niches."
https://openalex.org/W2900685780,"Introduction International criteria for the interpretation of the athlete’s electrocardiogram (ECG) have been proposed. We aimed to evaluate the inter-observer agreement among observers with different levels of expertise. Methods Consecutive ECGs of Swiss elite athletes (≥14 years), recorded during routine pre-participation screening between 2013 and 2016 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Sports were analysed. A medical student (A), a cardiology fellow (B) and an electrophysiologist (C) interpreted the ECG’s independently according to the most recent criteria. The frequencies and percentages for each observer were calculated. An inter-observer reliability analysis using Cohen Kappa (κ) statistics was used to determine consistency among observers. Results A total of 287 ECGs (64.1% males) were analysed. Mean age of the athletes was 20.4±4.9 years. The prevalence of abnormal ECG findings was 1.4%. Both, normal and borderline findings in athletes showed moderate to good agreement between all observers. κ scores for abnormal findings resulted in excellent agreement (κ 0.855 in observer A vs C and B vs C to κ 1.000 in observer A vs B). Overall agreement ranged from moderate (κ 0.539; 0.419–0.685 95% CI) between observer B vs C to good agreement (κ 0.720; 0.681–0.821 95% CI) between observer A vs B. Conclusions Our cohort of elite athletes had a low prevalence of abnormal ECGs. Agreement in abnormal ECG findings with the use of the recently published International recommendations for ECG interpretation in athletes among observers with different levels of expertise was excellent. ECG interpretation resulted in moderate to good overall agreement."

Such stereotypes have been argued to not be grounded in the actual personality traits of members of nations, yet they are also prolific and reliable. Stereotypes of Canadians and Americans exemplify the paradox; people in both nations strongly believe that the personality profiles of typical Canadians and Americans diverge, yet aggregated self-reports of personality profiles of Canadians and Americans show no reliable differences. We present evidence that the linguistic behavior of nations mirrors national character stereotypes. Utilizing 40 million tweets from the microblogging platform Twitter, in Study 1A we quantify the words and emojis diagnostic of Canadians and Americans. In Study 1B we explore the positivity of national language use. In Studies 2A and 2B, we present the 120 most nationally diagnostic words and emojis of each nation to naive participants, and ask them to assess personality of a hypothetical person who uses either diagnostically Canadian or American words and emojis. Personality profiles derived from the diagnostic words of each nation bear close resemblance to national character stereotypes.

https://openalex.org/W2951243153,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to influence plant community structure and diversity. Studies based on single plant-single AMF isolate experiments show that within AMF species variation leads to large differential growth responses of different plant species. Because of these differential effects, genetic differences among isolates of an AMF species could potentially have strong effects on the structure of plant communities. We tested the hypothesis that within species variation in the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis significantly affects plant community structure and plant co-existence. We took advantage of a recent genetic characterization of several isolates using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). This allowed us to test not only for the impact of within AMF species variation on plant community structure but also for the role of the R. irregularis phylogeny on plant community metrics. Nine isolates of R. irregularis, belonging to three different genetic groups (Gp1, Gp3 and Gp4), were used as either single inoculum or as mixed diversity inoculum. Plants in a mesocosm representing common species that naturally co-exist in European grasslands were inoculated with the different AMF treatments. We found that within-species differences in R. irregularis did not strongly influence the performance of individual plants or the structure of the overall plant community. However, the evenness of the plant community was affected by the phylogeny of the fungal isolates, where more closely-related AMF isolates were more likely to affect plant community evenness in a similar way compared to more genetically distant isolates. This study underlines the effect of within AMF species variability on plant community structure. While differential effects of the AMF isolates were not strong, a single AMF species had enough functional variability to change the equilibrium of a plant community in a way that is associated with the evolutionary history of the fungus."
