Rangel et al. simulated the past 800,000 years of evolution in South America, incorporating these factors into a spatially explicit dynamic model to explore the geographical generation of diversity. Their simulations, based on a paleoclimate model on a 5° latitude-longitude scale, result in shifting maps of speciation, persistence, and extinction (or cradles, museums, and graves). The simulations culminate in a striking resemblance to contemporary distribution patterns across the continent for birds, mammals, and plants—despite having no target patterns and no empirical data parameterizing them.

https://openalex.org/W2883826315,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant global public health problem. Understanding risk factors is crucial for developing prevention programmes. Yet, little evidence exists on population-based prevalence and risk factors for IPV in West Africa. Our objective was to measure both lifetime and past year prevalence of IPV and to determine factors associated with past year physical or sexual IPV experience. This population-based survey involved 2000 randomly selected women aged 18 to 49 years living in 40 localities within four districts of the Central Region of Ghana. Questionnaires were interviewer-administered from February to May 2016. Respondents were currently or ever-partnered, and resident in study area ≥12months preceding the survey. Data collected included: socio-demographics; sexual behavior; mental health and substance use; employment status; 12-month and lifetime experience of violence; household food insecurity; gender norms/attitudes; partner characteristics and childhood trauma. Logistic regression modelling was used to determine factors associated with sexual or physical IPV, adjusting for age and survey design. About 34% of respondents had experienced IPV in the past year, with 21.4% reporting sexual and or physical forms. Past year experience of emotional and economic IPV were 24.6% and 7.4% respectively. Senior high school education or higher was protective of IPV (AOR = 0.51[0.30-0.86]). Depression (AOR = 1.06[1.04-1.08], disability (AOR = 2.30[1.57-3.35]), witnessing abuse of mother (AOR = 2.1.98[1.44-2.72]), experience of childhood sexual abuse (AOR = 1.46[1.07-1.99]), having had multiple sexual partners in past year (AOR = 2.60[1.49-4.53]), control by male partner (AOR = 1.03[1.00-1.06]), male partner alcohol use in past year (AOR = 2.65[2.12-3.31]) and male partner infidelity (AOR = 2.31[1.72-3.09]) were significantly associated with increased odds of past year physical or sexual IPV experience. Male perpetrated IPV remains a significant public health issue in Ghana. Evidence-based interventions targeting women's mental health, disabilities, exposure to violence in childhood, risky sexual behavior and unequal power in relationships will be critical in reducing IPV in this setting."

These include an increase in global annual temperatures, growing heat content of the oceans, and sea level rise owing to the melting of the polar ice sheets and glaciers. Now, Santer et al. report that a human-caused signal in the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature can also be measured (see the Perspective by Randel). They use satellite data and the anthropogenic “fingerprint” predicted by climate models to show the extent of the effects and discuss how these changes have been caused.

https://openalex.org/W2883271696,"The purpose of the study was to identify and compare validity parameters of different absolute intensity thresholds in METs, using relative intensity classification as criterion measure. Convenience sampling was used to recruit total of 112 adults. The participants carried out an incremental maximal cycle ergometer test and asked to perform nine free-living activities. The oxygen uptake was measured by a VO2000® gas analyser throughout the tests. The intensity thresholds were identified using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, having relative intensity categories as criterion measure. A total of 103 participants attended the two visits. Among 54 men and 49 women, the mean (± SD) ages were 36.1 (± 11.1) and 33.9 (± 10.6) years, respectively. The intensity thresholds identified were 4.9 METs for moderate and 6.8 METs for vigorous physical activity. In conclusion, the physical activity thresholds, generated according to the entire sample, were higher and presented improved specificity when compared to thresholds currently recommended. Moreover, these parameters presented relatively high accuracy, even when applied to specific groups such as sex, age, nutritional status and physical fitness."

https://openalex.org/W2883689767,"Numerous studies have reported a potential role for circulating microRNAs as biomarkers in a wide variety of diseases. However, there is a critical reproducibility challenge some of which might be due to differences in preanalytical and/or analytical factors. Thus, in the current study we systematically investigated the impact of selected preanalytical and analytical variables on the measured microRNA levels in plasma. Similar levels of microRNA were found in platelet-poor plasma obtained by dual compared to prolonged single centrifugation. In contrast, poor correlation was observed between measurements in standard plasma compared to platelet-poor plasma. The correlation between quantitative real-time PCR and droplet digital PCR was found to be good, contrary to TaqMan Low Density Array and single TaqMan assays where no correlation could be demonstrated. Dependent on the specific microRNA measured and the normalization strategy used, the intra- and inter-assay variation of quantitative real-time PCR were found to be 4.2–6.8% and 10.5–31.4%, respectively. Using droplet digital PCR the intra-assay variation was 4.4–20.1%, and the inter-assay variation 5.7–26.7%. Plasma preparation and microRNA purification were found to account for 39–73% of the total intra-assay variation, dependent on the microRNA measured and the normalization strategy used. In conclusion, our study highlighted the importance of reporting comprehensive methodological information when publishing, allowing others to perform validation studies where preanalytical and analytical variables as causes for divergent results can be minimized. Furthermore, if microRNAs are to become routinely used diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, the differences in plasma microRNA levels between health and diseased subjects must exceed the high preanalytical and analytical variability."
https://openalex.org/W2883492520,"Bacterial secondary metabolites are naturally produced to prevail amongst competitors in a shared habitat and thus represent a valuable source for antibiotic discovery. The transformation of newly discovered antibiotic compounds into effective drugs often requires additional surfactant components for drug formulation. Nature may also provide blueprints in this respect: A cocktail of two compounds consisting of the antibacterial red pigment prodigiosin and the biosurfactant serrawettin W1 is naturally produced by the bacterium Serratia marcescens, which occurs in highly competitive habitats including soil. We show here a combinatorial antibacterial effect of these compounds, but also of prodigiosin mixed with other (bio)surfactants, against the soil-dwelling bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum taken as a model target bacterium. Prodigiosin exerted a combinatorial inhibitory effect with all tested surfactants in a disk diffusion assay which was especially pronounced in combination with N-myristoyltyrosine. Minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) of the individual compounds were 2.56 μg/mL prodigiosin and 32 μg/mL N-myristoyltyrosine, and the MIC of prodigiosin was decreased by 3 orders of magnitude to 0.005 μg/mL in the presence of 16 μg/mL N-myristoyltyrosine, indicative of synergistic interaction. Investigation of bacterial survival revealed similar combinatorial effects; moreover, antagonistic effects were observed at higher compound concentrations. Finally, the investigation of microcolony formation under combined application of concentrations just below the MBC revealed heterogeneity of responses with cell death or delayed growth. In summary, this study describes the combinatorial antibacterial effects of microbial biomolecules, which may have ecological relevance by inhibiting cohabiting species, but shall furthermore inspire drug development in the combat of infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2883921719,"Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, the causative agent of sexually transmitted syphilis, detected in clinical samples from France, was subjected to molecular typing using the recently developed Multilocus Sequence Typing system. The samples (n = 133) used in this study were collected from 2010–2016 from patients with diagnosed primary or secondary syphilis attending outpatient centers or hospitals in several locations in France. Altogether, 18 different allelic profiles were found among the fully typed samples (n = 112). There were five allelic variants identified for TP0136, 12 for TP0548, and eight for TP0705. Out of the identified alleles, one, seven, and three novel alleles were identified in TP0136, TP0548, and TP0705, respectively. Partial allelic profiles were obtained from 6 samples. The majority of samples (n = 110) belonged to the SS14-like cluster of TPA isolates while 7 clustered with Nichols-like isolates. Patients infected with Nichols-like samples were more often older (p = 0.041) and more often diagnosed with secondary syphilis (p = 0.033) compared to patients infected with SS14-like samples. In addition, macrolide resistance caused by the A2058G mutation was found to be associated with allelic profile 1.3.1 or with strains belonging to the 1.3.1 lineage (p<0.001). The genetic diversity among TPA strains infecting the European population was surprisingly high, which suggests that additional studies are needed to reveal the full genetic diversity of TPA pathogens infecting humans."
https://openalex.org/W2884876445,"Amyloid aggregates of Tau protein have been implicated in etiology of many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). When amyloid growth is induced by seeding with preformed fibrils assembled from the same protein, structural characteristics of the seed are usually imprinted in daughter generations of fibrils. This so-called conformational memory effect may be compromised when the seeding involves proteins with non-identical sequences leading to the emergence of distinct structural variants of fibrils (amyloid ‘strains’). Here, we investigate cross-seeding of full-length human Tau (FL Tau) with fibrils assembled from K18 and K18ΔK280 fragments of Tau in the presence of poly-L-glutamate (poly-Glu) as an enhancer of Tau aggregation. To study cross-seeding between Tau polypeptides and the role of the conformational memory effect in induction of Tau amyloid polymorphism, kinetic assays, transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and limited proteolysis have been employed. The fastest fibrillization was observed for FL Tau monomers seeded with preformed K18 amyloid yielding daughter fibrils with unique trypsin digestion patterns. Morphological features of daughter FL Tau fibrils induced by K18 and K18ΔK280 seeds were reminiscent of the mother fibrils (i.e. straight paired fibrils and paired helical filaments (PHFs), respectively) but disappeared in the following generations which became similar to unpaired FL Tau amyloid fibrils formed de novo. The structural evolution observed in our study was accompanied by disappearance of the unique proteolysis profile originated from K18. Our findings may have implications for understanding molecular mechanisms of the emergence and stability of Tau amyloid strains."
https://openalex.org/W2883041676,"Constant global warming is one of the most detrimental environmental factors for agriculture causing significant losses in productivity as heat stress (HS) conditions damage plant growth and reproduction. In flowering plants such as tomato, HS has drastic repercussions on development and functionality of male reproductive organs and pollen. Response mechanisms to HS in tomato anthers and pollen have been widely investigated by transcriptomics; on the contrary, exhaustive proteomic evidences are still lacking. In this context, a differential proteomic study was performed on tomato anthers collected from two genotypes (thermo-tolerant and thermo-sensitive) to explore stress response mechanisms and identify proteins possibly associated to thermo-tolerance. Results showed that HS mainly affected energy and amino acid metabolism and nitrogen assimilation and modulated the expression of proteins involved in assuring protein quality and ROS detoxification. Moreover, proteins potentially associated to thermo-tolerant features, such as glutamine synthetase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase and polyphenol oxidase, were identified."
https://openalex.org/W2883322149,"MADS-box transcription factors are important for plant growth and development, and hundreds of MADS-box genes have been functionally characterized in plants. However, less is known about the functions of these genes in the economically important allopolyploid oil crop, Brassica napus. We identified 307 potential MADS-box genes (BnMADSs) in the B. napus genome and categorized them into type I (Mα, Mβ, and Mγ) and type II (MADS DNA-binding domain, intervening domain, keratin-like domain, and C-terminal domain [MIKC]c and MIKC*) based on phylogeny, protein motif structure, and exon-intron organization. We identified one conserved intron pattern in the MADS-box domain and seven conserved intron patterns in the K-box domain of the MIKCc genes that were previously ignored and may be associated with function. Chromosome distribution and synteny analysis revealed that hybridization between Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea, segmental duplication, and homologous exchange (HE) in B. napus were the main BnMADSs expansion mechanisms. Promoter cis-element analyses indicated that BnMADSs may respond to various stressors (drought, heat, hormones) and light. Expression analyses showed that homologous genes in a given subfamily or sister pair are highly conserved, indicating widespread functional conservation and redundancy. Analyses of BnMADSs provide a basis for understanding their functional roles in plant development."
https://openalex.org/W2883281219,"Background This study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors of vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D ≤ 50 nmol/L) among 15-year-old Malaysian adolescents. By identifying potential risk factors, prevention strategies and interventions can be carried out to improve the vitamin D status in adolescents. Methods and findings Stratified random sampling design was used to select adolescents from 15 urban and rural secondary schools in Selangor, Perak and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Data collection was carried out from 1st April 2014 to 30th June 2014. Information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, sun exposure and sun protective behaviours, clinical data and environmental factors were collected. Blood for total vitamin D was sampled. Descriptive and multivariate logistic regressions were performed. Total 1061 participants were analyzed (62% were female; mean age 15.1 ± 0.4 years). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 33%. Mean vitamin D was lower in female (53 ± 15 nmol), obese (body fat percentage (≥25%m; ≥33.8%f) (56 ± 16 nmol/L), Malays (58 ± 18 nmol/L) and Indians (58 ± 15 nmol/L). In multivariate analysis, female (OR = 5.5; 95% CI: 3.4–7.5), Malay (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.3–8.0), Indian (OR = 4.3; 95% CI: 1.6–12.0) and those always wearing long sleeve (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1–5.4) were more likely to have vitamin D deficiency. For female participants, ethnicity {Malays (OR = 6.7; 95% CI: 2.0–18.5), Indian (OR = 4.5; 95% CI: 1.8–19.3)} was an important risk factors. Cloud cover, school residence, skin pigmentation, sun-exposure and sun-protective behaviours were not significant risk factors. The limitation of this study was recall bias as it relied on self-reported on the sun exposure and protective behaviours. The diet factors were not included in this analysis. Conclusions The prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency among Malaysian adolescents was considerable. Gender, ethnicity and clothing style were important risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2884144490,"The transmission of Salmonella enterica within a vertically integrated poultry operation was investigated longitudinally over an 18-month period (2013-2014). Thirty six percent of all samples collected (1503 of 4219) were positive for salmonellae with seven Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars, and one Salmonella enterica subsp. salamae serovar detected. Both Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars Infantis and Typhimurium were detected in all locations sampled. Salmonella Typhimurium was the most frequently detected serovar (63% of serotyped samples) with 8 phage types (PT) and 41 multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) profiles identified. The most frequently identified phage types were PT135a and DT135. A total of 62 PT/MLVA combinations were observed. MLVA profiles 03-14-10-09-525 and 03-15-11-11-525 were the most frequently identified and 83% of the isolates shared at least one MLVA profile with an isolate from another phage type. The use of phage typing and MLVA profiling, on their own or in combination, were insufficient to understand the complexity of the epidemiological relationships between locations within this production system. Despite the high level of apparent diversity, cluster analysis was unable to differentiate the transmission pathways of all S. Typhimurium variants detected within the integrated enterprise. Using additional epidemiological information, the parent breeder rearing site was identified as the most likely point of introduction of two S. Typhimurium isolates into the production system with subsequent dissemination to the broiler flocks via the hatchery. This complexity is unable to be resolved in the absence of intensive sampling programs at all generations of the production system."

https://openalex.org/W2883168810,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is very popular with patients frequently combining it with orthodox health care. The high prevalence of CAM use and satisfaction with CAM reported by patients directly challenges an orthodox system that can only approve such use if it results from the application of biomedical concepts and science. Studies highlighting this as a cultural, sociological and historical phenomenon emphasise the value of choice for consumers of health care. Musculoskeletal conditions typify common problems for which the effectiveness of orthodox care is often unclear. We postulated that the reasons people give for using or not using CAM for musculoskeletal conditions, would therefore indicate the full range of expectations that people have of health care. Furthermore, these reasons would indicate how much people feel orthodox health care is or is not meeting their expectations. Therefore, this study aims to investigate people's reasons for choosing or avoiding CAM for non-traumatic musculoskeletal conditions.A systematic search and narrative synthesis was conducted of published qualitative and quantitative studies related to CAM and non-traumatic musculoskeletal conditions.We identified 169 relevant papers detailing 152 separate studies, from which 1486 justifications were extracted concerning CAM use. Content analysis resulted in 11 distinct categories across four themes: practical aspects of care, clinical effectiveness, non-clinical outcomes of care, and a person's philosophy of illness and care. People provided similar rationales for both using and avoiding CAM, emphasising that, whilst CAM is perceived by many patients with musculoskeletal conditions to fill gaps in care (such as practitioner time or quality of the therapeutic relationship), orthodox care also seeks to deliver these aspects of care. However, people who used CAM also highlighted its alignment with their general philosophy and ideas about illness and health care, and often emphasised CAM's capacity to give them control over their condition and its treatment.Currently, CAM appears to have a significant role for patients with common painful long-term conditions in providing choices to enable individual needs to be met."
https://openalex.org/W2883790676,"In Australia, turnip weed has been rapidly emerging as one of the major weeds in conservation agricultural systems. Germination and emergence of turnip weed were examined for two populations collected from Gatton and St George regions of Australia; two locations with high and low rainfall, respectively. The seeds of turnip weed germinated at all the tested temperatures, but germination was the lowest at 15/5°C, intermediate at 20/10°C and highest at 25/15°C and 30/20°C. The results indicated a high adaptability of turnip weed to warm environmental conditions, although it is a major problem in the winter season. Germination was higher in dark than light/dark regimes except at 30/20°C. Three was a concomitant reduction in germination as the osmotic potential values decreased from 0 to -1.0 MPa. There was 2 and 4% germination at -0.8 MPa for Gatton and St George populations, respectively, and no germination occurred at an osmotic potential of -1.0 MPa. There was a reduction in germination when the sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration was increased from 0 to 150 mM, and no germination was observed at 200 and 250 mM of NaCl. Turnip weed germinated over a broad range of pH (4 to 10). Seedling emergence was higher at 1 cm depth compared to 0.5 cm or at the soil surface. There was 28 and 33% emergence at the surface for the Gatton and St George populations, respectively, compared to 48 and 56% emergence from 1 cm depth for the Gatton and St George populations, respectively and no emergence was observed from 6 cm depth. The results indicated that tillage leading to shallow burial would promote the emergence of turnip weed; on the contrary, tillage that could bury seeds deep into the soil profile might minimise the emergence. Under ideal conditions and lack of integrated weed management programmes, this weed will emerge, set seeds and enrich the soil seed bank and thereby continue to be a problem in the northern grain region of Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2884044310,"GABAergic dysfunction has been implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are the most common type of psychiatric disorder during adolescence. There is a deficiency of GABAergic transmission in anxiety, and enhancement of GABA transmission through pharmacological means reduces anxiety behaviors. GAD67—the enzyme responsible for GABA production–has been linked to anxiety disorders. One class of GABAergic interneurons, Neuropeptide Y (NPY) expressing cells, is abundantly found in brain regions associated with anxiety and fear learning, including prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Additionally, NPY itself has been shown to have anxiolytic effects, and loss of NPY+ interneurons enhances anxiety behaviors. A previous study showed that knockdown of Gad1 from NPY+ cells led to reduced anxiety behaviors in adult mice. However, the role of GABA release from NPY+ interneurons in adolescent anxiety is unclear. Here we used a transgenic mouse that reduces GAD67 in NPY+ cells (NPYGAD1-TG) through Gad1 knockdown and tested for effects on behavior in adolescent mice. Adolescent NPYGAD1-TG mice showed enhanced anxiety-like behavior and sex-dependent changes in locomotor activity. We also found enhancement in two other innate behavioral tasks, nesting construction and social dominance. In contrast, fear learning was unchanged. Because we saw changes in behavioral tasks dependent upon prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, we investigated the extent of GAD67 knockdown in these regions. Immunohistochemistry revealed a 40% decrease in GAD67 in NPY+ cells in prefrontal cortex, indicating a significant but incomplete knockdown of GAD67. In contrast, there was no decrease in GAD67 in NPY+ cells in hippocampus. Consistent with this, there was no change in inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampus. Our results show the behavioral impact of cell-specific interneuron dysfunction and suggest that GABA release by NPY+ cells is important for regulating innate prefrontal cortex-dependent behavior in adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2884539429,"Influenza viruses can cause severe life threatening infections in high-risk patients, including young children, the elderly and patients with compromised immunity due to underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive treatment. The impaired immunity of these patients causes prolonged virus infection and combined with antiviral treatment facilitates the emergence of viruses with resistance mutations. The diverse nature of their immune status makes them a challenging group to study the impact of influenza virus infection and the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Immunocompromised ferrets may represent a suitable animal model to assess influenza virus infection and antiviral treatment strategies in immunocompromised hosts. Here, ferrets were given a daily oral solution of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and prednisolone sodium phosphate to suppress their immune system. Groups of immunocompromised and immunocompetent ferrets were inoculated with an A/H3N2 influenza virus and were subsequently treated with Oseltamivir or left untreated. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed on the throat and nose specimens to study virus replication during the course of infection. All immunocompromised ferrets had prolonged presence of viral RNA and a higher total amount of virus shedding compared to the immunocompetent ferrets. Although Oseltamivir reduced the total amount of virus shedding from the nose and throat of treated ferrets, it also resulted in the emergence of the neuraminidase R292K resistance substitution in all these animals, as determined by mutation specific RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. No additional mutations that could be associated with the emergence of the R292K resistance mutation were detected. The immunocompromised ferret model can be used to study A/H3N2 virus shedding and is a promising model to study new antiviral strategies and the emergence of antiviral resistance in immunocompromised hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2884875345,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) offers potential cure to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, infections with commensal bacteria are an important cause for non-relapse mortality (NRM). We have previously described the impact of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization on the survival of allo-HSCT patients. In the aforementioned publication, according to consensus, we there did not consider the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) to be an MDRO. Since rate of S. maltophilia colonization is increasing, and it is not known whether this poses a risk for allo-HSCT patients, we here analyzed here its effect on the previously described and now extended patient cohort. We report on 291 AML patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Twenty of 291 patients (6.9%) were colonized with S. maltophilia. Colonized patients did not differ from non-colonized patients with respect to their age, remission status before allo-HSCT, donor type and HSCT-comorbidity index. S. maltophilia colonized patients had a worse overall survival (OS) from 6 months up to 60 months (85% vs. 88.1% and 24.7% vs. 59.7%; p = 0.007) due to a higher NRM after allo-HSCT (6 months: 15% vs. 4.8% and 60 months: 40.1% vs. 16.2% p = 0.003). The main cause of mortality in colonized patients was infection (46.2% of all deaths) and in non-colonized patients relapse (58.8% of all deaths). 5/20 colonized patients developed an invasive infection with S. maltophilia. The worse OS after allo-HSCT due to higher infection related mortality might implicate the screening of allo-HSCT patients for S. maltophilia and a closer observation of colonized patients as outpatients."
https://openalex.org/W2883094392,"Seed exudates are plant-derived natural bioactive compounds consisting of a complex mixture of organic and inorganic molecules. Plant seed exudates have been poorly studied against parasite nematodes. This study was undertaken to identify proteins in the Myracrodruon urundeuva seed exudates and to assess the anthelmintic activity against Haemonchus contortus, an important parasite of small ruminants. M. urundeuva seed exudates (SEX) was obtained after immersion of seeds in sodium acetate buffer. SEX was fractionated with ammonium sulfate at 0–90% concentration to generate the ressuspended pellet (SEXF1) and the supernatant (SEXF2). SEX, SEXF1, and SEXF2 were exhaustively dialyzed against distilled water (cut-off: 12 kDa) and the protein contents determined. Mass spectrometry analyses of SEX, SEXF1, and SEXF2 were done to identify proteins and secondary metabolites. The seed exudates contained protease, protease inhibitor, peptidase, chitinase, and lipases as well as the low molecular weight secondary compounds ellagic acid and quercetin rhamnoside. SEX inhibited H. contortus larval development (LDA) (IC50 = 0.29 mg mL-1), but did not affect larval exsheathment (LEIA). On the other hand, although SEXF1 and SEXF2 inhibited H. contortus LEIA (IC50 = 1.04 and 0.93 mg mL-1, respectively), they showed even greater inhibition efficiency of H. contortus larval development (IC50 = 0.29 and 0.42 mg mL-1, respectively). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show the anthelmintic activity of plant exudates against a gastrointestinal nematode. Moreover, it suggests the potential of exuded proteins as candidates to negatively interfere with H. contortus life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2883732557,"Fas/Fas ligand system was shown to be related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the role of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in functioning of immune cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been studied yet. The aim of the present study was to determine in vitro effects of sFasL on neutrophil activation and apoptosis. We demonstrate here that sFasL exhibited proinflammatory effect and induced mRNA levels of caspase-1, NF-κB, IL-1β and CD18 expression. At the same time, sFasL induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Activation of caspase-1 activity abolished sFasL-dependent apoptosis, and suppressed Fas expression and mRNA levels of caspase-3 in neutrophils from T2DM patients. Collectively, our findings identify a novel proinflammatory role of sFasL in T2DM neutrophils that is dependent of caspase activity. Thus, sFasL enhances inflammatory response of neutrophils from T2DM patients without increasing apoptosis suggesting its triggering role in T2DM inflammation."

New noninvasive markers are still needed for the early detection of DN before identifiable alternations in kidney function or urine albumin excretion occurs. A C18 plate and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) were used to compare the urinary protein profiles of 238 subjects from the following 4 groups: patients with type 2 diabetic (T2D) with microalbuminuria, patients with DM without micro- or macroalbuminuria, patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria due to nondiabetic disease, and healthy controls. β2-microglobulin (B2M) and Clara-cell protein (CC16) were found to be highly released in the urine of patients with proteinuria due to nondiabetic or diabetic diseases. In differentiating nephropathy from healthy subject, the B2M and CC16 markers have a combined sensitivity and specificity of 77.3% and 91.8%, respectively. In distinguishing T2D with microalbuminuria from T2D patients, the combined markers have sensitivity and specificity of 66% and 73%, respectively. The predictive ability of B2M and CC16 for early renal functional decline (ERFD) was validated in 125 T2D patients with a follow-up times. The odds ratio (OR) of combined B2M and CC16 markers for developing ERFD was 7.59 (95% CI: 1.97-29.24). The detection of B2M and CC16 with the C18 plate-MALDI-TOF MS approach could be an attractive and practical assay for rapid diagnosis of nephropathy in nondiabetic/diabetic patients and as a predictor of ERFD among T2D patients who had not manifested significant kidney disease at baseline."
https://openalex.org/W2883021756,"We report the isolation and characterization of two Elizabethkingia anophelis strains (OSUVM-1 and OSUVM-2) isolated from sources associated with horses in Oklahoma. Both strains appeared susceptible to fluoroquinolones and demonstrated high MICs to all cell wall active antimicrobials including vancomycin, along with aminoglycosides, fusidic acid, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. Typical of the Elizabethkingia, both draft genomes contained multiple copies of β-lactamase genes as well as genes predicted to function in antimicrobial efflux. Phylogenetic analysis of the draft genomes revealed that OSUVM-1 and OSUVM-2 differ by only 6 SNPs and are in a clade with 3 strains of Elizabethkingia anophelis that were responsible for human infections. These findings therefore raise the possibility that Elizabethkingia might have the potential to move between humans and animals in a manner similar to known zoonotic pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2883194082,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether blocking of G protein βγ (Gβγ) signaling halts heart failure (HF) progression by macrophage phenotype manipulation. Cardiac Gβγ signaling plays a crucial role in HF pathogenesis. Previous data suggested that inhibiting Gβγ signaling reprograms T helper cell 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines, suggesting that Gβγ might be a useful drug target for treating HF. We investigated the efficacy of a small molecule Gβγ inhibitor, gallein, in a clinically relevant, experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) model of HF as well as in human macrophage phenotypes in vitro. In the myocardium of HF patients, we observed that G protein coupled receptor kinase (GRK)2 levels were down-regulated compared with healthy controls. In rat EAM, treatment with gallein effectively improved survival and cardiac function, suppressed cardiac remodeling, and further attenuated myocardial protein expression of GRK2 as well as high mobility group box (HMGB)1 and its cascade signaling proteins. Furthermore, gallein effectively inhibited M1 polarization and promoted M2 polarization in vivo in the EAM heart and in vitro in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Taken together, these data suggest that the small molecule Gβγ inhibitor, gallein, could be an important pharmacologic therapy for HF as it can switch the phenotypic reprogramming from M1 to M2 phenotype in a rat model of EAM heart and in human macrophages."

The intracellular polysaccharopeptides of Trametes versicolor (TV) have been used as immunologic and oncologic adjuvants. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential activities and mechanisms of extracellular polysaccharopeptides (ePSP) obtained from TV strain LH-1 on regulating glucose homeostasis. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells incubated with normal glucose (5.5 mM, NG model), high glucose (33 mM, HG model), or high glucose (33 mM) plus high insulin (10-7 M, HGI model) concentrations were administered with TV LH-1 ePSP (50, 100, and 1000 μg/ml) for 24 hr. Glucose uptake of HepG2 cells, determined by flow cytometry, was significantly decreased in the HG and HGI models with insulin stimulation, suggesting insulin resistance of these cells; however, ePSP reversed this decrease in a dose-dependent manner (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05). In the HG and HGI models, ePSP significantly increased glycogen content, insulin receptor substrate-2 protein and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), as determined by western blot analysis. In addition, ePSP significantly increased glucokinase in the NG and HG models, increased membrane glucose transporter-1 and decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3β in the HGI model, and increased glucose-6-phosphatase in the NG and HGI models (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05). In summary, TV LH-1 ePSP may elevate cellular glucose uptake to regulate glucose homeostasis via the activation of AMPK and glycogen synthesis in an insulin-independent manner. These results suggest that TV LH-1 ePSP may be a nutraceutical with anti-hyperglycemic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2883202660,"Macrophages (MØs) are sentinels of the immune system that use pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) to detect invading pathogens and immune receptors such as FcγR to sense the host’s immune state. Crosstalk between these two signaling pathways allows the MØ to tailor the cell’s overall response to prevailing conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TLR-FcγR crosstalk are only partially understood. Therefore, we employed an immunologically-relevant MØ stimulus, an inactivated gram-negative bacterium that bears TLR2 agonists but no TLR4 agonist (iBTLR2) opsonized with a monoclonal antibody (mAb-iBTLR2), as a tool to study FcγR regulation of TLR2-driven production of IL-6, a key inflammatory cytokine. We chose this particular agonist as an investigational tool because MØ production of any detectable IL-6 in response to mAb-iBTLR2 requires both TLR2 and FcγR signaling, making it an excellent system for the study of receptor synergy. Using genetic, pharmacological and immunological approaches, we demonstrate that the murine MØ IL-6 response to mAb-iBTLR2 requires activation of both the TLR/NF-κB and FcγR/ITAM signaling pathways. mAb-iBTLR2 engagement of TLR2 drives NF-κB activation and up-regulation of IL-6 mRNA but fails to result in IL-6 cytokine production/release. Here, Src family kinase-driven FcγR ITAM signaling is necessary to enable IL-6 mRNA incorporation into polysomes and translation. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which FcγR ITAM signaling synergizes with TLR signaling, by “licensing” cytokine mRNA ribosome binding/translation to drive a strong murine MØ cytokine response."
https://openalex.org/W2883404811,"The tourist-based economy of Belize, a tropical hub for eco-tourism, is at high risk to be disproportionately impacted by established and emerging mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika. An online survey was used to probe economic stakeholders working in the Belize tourism industry about their mosquito control practices and perceptions. Responses demonstrated that the respondents have good working knowledge of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne illnesses. Most businesses surveyed engage in some means of mosquito control, either through larval source reduction or use of insecticides on the premises. Larvicide use was significantly correlated with a general willingness to use insecticides, as well as belief that treatment of water will reduce mosquito densities and disease transmission. A majority of the respondents agreed that they would be interested in buying a new larvicide to be used on the business premises if it were shown to be safe and effective. The safety of mosquito control products for humans, animals, plants, and the environment in general, followed by product effectiveness, are the most critical determinants of mosquito control purchasing decisions. A majority of respondents agreed that control of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne illnesses is central to the success of their tourist-based industry. Respondents expressed significant concern that the Zika epidemic was over-sensationalized by the media, and that this negatively impacted their livelihoods. The respondents, many of whom are associated with eco/sustainable businesses, also voiced concerns that chemical pesticides could have a negative impact on human health and the environment and expressed a desire for balance between effective mosquito control and preservation of the rich biodiversity of Belize. This study provided a framework for further engagement activities in Belize and other Caribbean nations, uncovered both concerns and support for emerging mosquito control technologies, and revealed opportunities for further debate and educational outreach efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2883518075,"Objective Adherence to medications among patients with rheumatic diseases is often suboptimal. Patient navigators, individuals trained in care coordination, motivational interviewing and basic rheumatology and pharmacology, have not been employed to explore and address this issue. We piloted a single-site, single arm intervention to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using rheumatology-specific navigators to understand and reduce barriers to adherence to oral disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). We analyzed our qualitative findings from navigator-patient interactions as well as patient satisfaction with the intervention. Methods We recruited patients ≥18 years with a systemic rheumatic disease who initiated an oral DMARD within the prior 6 months. Navigators conducted baseline needs assessments and 2–4 week follow-up calls to understand and address issues related to medication adherence. We analyzed patient-navigator encounters qualitatively using content analysis to identify key themes related to barriers to adherence and navigator actions performed in response to the barriers described. We also categorized intentional and unintentional nonadherent behavior and assessed satisfaction with the navigator experience (range 0–5, 5 = most satisfied). Results 107 rheumatology patients were followed for up to 6 months. Mean patient age was 55 years (+17) and 93% were female; 36% described one or more episode of intentional or unintentional nonadherence. The three most common themes identified as barriers to adherence were fear of adverse events (raised by 54%), concerns about medication effectiveness (43%), and challenges with medication acquisition (32%). 86% of participants described at least one adherence-related barrier. Frequent navigator actions included facilitation of patient-doctor communication (38%), medication and diagnosis education (27%), and development of individualized strategies to improve adherence (16%). Patients were satisfied with the navigator experience (mean 4.4 + 0.9). Conclusion Navigators uncovered and addressed a number of medication adherence-related concerns and patients were satisfied with the services provided."
https://openalex.org/W2883524549,"Objectives The aim was to investigate associations between caregiving and adiposity using a representative UK longitudinal study. We also investigated whether associations differed by age, gender and caregiving characteristics. Methods Data on 9,421 participants aged 16+ from three waves (2009–2012) of the UK Household Longitudinal Study were used. Body mass index, waist circumference and percentage body fat were assessed. Caregiving and caregiving characteristics (hours per week, number of people cared for, co-resident caregiving and combining working and caregiving) was available from the prior wave. Gender-stratified associations between caregiving/caregiving characteristics with adiposity were tested. Covariates included caregiver’s health, socioeconomic position, parenthood and partnerships. Results Caregiving was associated with higher adiposity for women but not men. Younger women caregivers had particularly higher levels of adiposity. Men combining part-time paid work with caregiving had higher levels of adiposity than men working full-time and not caregiving. Women aged 16–44 or 65+ had particularly high levels of adiposity when combining full-time work and caregiving, compared to full-time work alone. Conclusion The health of caregivers should be a public health priority, particularly for younger women and those combining paid work with caregiving responsibilities."
https://openalex.org/W2884629788,"Pain management is a huge challenge in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and central sensitization is reportedly involved in the development of pain. The current study was undertaken to explore the possible role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the spinal mechanism of central sensitization in RA using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model.Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed in C57BL/6 mice, before and after the induction of CIA via administration of chick type II collagen. Analgesic drugs, receptor antagonist, and kinase inhibitor were administrated intrathecally in the spinal cord. Protein expression and phosphorylation changes were detected via immunoblotting.CIA mice developed significant mechanical hypersensitivity, and spinal administration of the NMDAR antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV) effectively attenuated peripheral pain hypersensitivity. There was specific enhancement of synaptic NR2B-containing NMDAR (NR2BR) expression in the spinal dorsal horns of the mice. Both the increased total protein expression of NR2B subunit and the enhanced total phosphorylation level of NR2B subunit at 1472 tyrosine promoted the synaptic expression of NMDAR in the mice. Intrathecal injection of tramadol suppressed synaptic NMDAR expression mainly by changing the synaptic phosphorylation state of NR2B subunit at Tyr1472. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 2 (ERK2) activity synchronized with the synaptic expression of NR2BR, which was downregulated by the action of tramadol.Specific enhancement of NR2BR in the spinal dorsal horn may be vital for central sensitization in the CIA model of RA. The NR2BR/ERK2 pathway may be a promising target for pain management in RA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2884120736,"Paulinella micropora is a rhizarian thecate amoeba, belonging to a photosynthetic Paulinella species group that has a unique organelle termed chromatophore, whose cyanobacterial origin is distinct from that of plant and algal chloroplasts. Because acquisition of the chromatophore was quite a recent event compared with that of the chloroplast ancestor, the Paulinella species are thought to be model organisms for studying the early process of primary endosymbiosis. To obtain insight into how endosymbiotically transferred genes acquire expression competence in the host nucleus, here we analyzed the 5′ end sequences of the mRNAs of P. micropora MYN1 strain with the aid of a cap-trapper cDNA library. As a result, we found that mRNAs of 27 genes, including endosymbiotically transferred genes, possessed the common 5′ end sequence of 28–33 bases that were posttranscriptionally added by spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing. We also found two subtypes of SL RNA genes encoded by the P. micropora MYN1 genome. Differing from the other SL trans-splicing organisms that usually possess poly(A)-less SL RNAs, this amoeba has polyadenylated SL RNAs. In this study, we characterize the SL trans-splicing of this unique organism and discuss the putative merits of SL trans-splicing in functional gene transfer and genome evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2883600842,"Postoperative agitation frequently occurs after general anesthesia and may be associated with serious consequences. However, studies in neurosurgical patients have been inadequate. We aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors for early postoperative agitation in patients after craniotomy, specifically focusing on the association between postoperative pneumocephalus and agitation. Adult intensive care unit admitted patients after elective craniotomy under general anesthesia were consecutively enrolled. Patients were assessed using the Sedation-Agitation Scale during the first 24 hours after operation. The patients were divided into two groups based on their maximal Sedation-Agitation Scale: the agitation (Sedation-Agitation Scale ≥ 5) and non-agitation groups (Sedation-Agitation Scale ≤ 4). Preoperative baseline data, intraoperative and intensive care unit admission data were recorded and analyzed. Each patient’s computed tomography scan obtained within six hours after operation was retrospectively reviewed. Modified Rankin Scale and hospital length of stay after the surgery were also collected. Of the 400 enrolled patients, agitation occurred in 13.0% (95% confidential interval: 9.7–16.3%). Body mass index, total intravenous anesthesia, intraoperative fluid intake, intraoperative bleeding and transfusion, consciousness after operation, endotracheal intubation kept at intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation, hyperglycemia without a history of diabetes, self-reported pain and postoperative bi-frontal pneumocephalus were used to build a multivariable model. Bi-frontal pneumocephalus and delayed extubation after the operation were identified as independent risk factors for postoperative agitation. After adjustment for confounding, postoperative agitation was independently associated with worse neurologic outcome (odd ratio: 5.4, 95% confidential interval: 1.1–28.9, P = 0.048). Our results showed that early postoperative agitation was prevalent among post-craniotomy patients and was associated with adverse outcomes. Improvements in clinical strategies relevant to bi-frontal pneumocephalus should be considered. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02318199)."
https://openalex.org/W2883628667,"The concepts of 340 university freshmen concerning urban water cycles include various misconceptions (or intuitive conceptions) which severely contrast with correct scientific ones. Almost no student knew the correct urban water cycle in total, including cycle steps in the appropriate sequence: consumer (given), sewage-plant, nature and waterworks. Concepts mainly omit nature and waterworks, only the sewage plant is included in almost all concepts. This reflects an exaggeration of the importance of the cycle-step sewage plant relative to the other steps, when the topic is taught in school. Students acquired knowledge from two main sources: School and media. Most students are aware of the origin of drinking water, although several concepts reflect a pipe-to-pipe system, where wastewater is cleared in sewage plants and brought back to consumers, skipping the roles of nature and waterworks. Everyday matters with an important impact on our life-standards, like the urban water cycle, need specific attention during school time. Currently, only primary school syllabi include the issue of urban water cycles in Germany. More effort is needed to explain wastewater and drinking water issues in order to correct misconceptions."
https://openalex.org/W2883777688,"When they do not meet norms related to sexuality and reproduction, Bangladeshi women often face abandonment and are thus deprived of an active sexual life, a marital relationship, and motherhood. Little is known about how a stigmatised disease such as tuberculosis (TB) may constrain the reproductive health and sexual lives of women. This article, derived from a larger study on the impact of TB on women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights in Narsingdi district and Dhaka, Bangladesh, aims to fill this gap. Based on interviews with nine married women who have or had TB, four husbands, and two mothers-in-law, this article highlights that the ways in which TB impedes on the sexual and reproductive lives of women depends on the stigma within their family and community, their relationships with their husbands, motherhood, their living arrangements, their economic contribution to the family and/or their disclosure of their TB diagnosis. Women with children and supportive husbands retain a stronger position among their in-laws and are less likely to be isolated or rejected. The patients’ narratives revealed that the instructions of health workers influenced their decisions about intercourse or abstinence. Future studies should examine the instructions patients receive from health workers regarding their living and sleeping arrangements, sexual intercourse, and pregnancy, as well as policy documents on TB treatment and prevention."

https://openalex.org/W2883945727,"Generally, prognostication of coma outcome currently combines behavioral, reflex, and possibly neuroimaging tests that are interpreted by an attending physician. Electroencephalography, particularly, event-related brain potentials (ERP) have received attention due to evidence demonstrating the positive predictive value of certain ERP including the mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P3a, for coma emergence. We describe a set of ERP paradigms designed to require and reflect increasing levels of cognitive processing with the added objective of determining the influence of each paradigm’s context strength on its ability to elicit ERPs. These paradigms were then used without explicit instructions to participants to attend to the stimuli to determine which paradigms possessed sufficient context “strength” to elicit ERPs in the absence of active participation on the part of the subject; a circumstance often encountered in brain injury patients. These paradigms were then validated on two groups of adults–younger and older, and the difference due to active participation was validated on another group of younger adults. Results show that paradigms with stronger stimulus context features performed better than those with weaker contexts, and that older adults generally had significantly attenuated and delayed responses compared to younger adults. Based on these findings, it is recommended the use of the auditory oddball paradigm that includes novel stimuli to elicit the mismatch negativity and P300, and semantic violation sentences to elicit the N400. These findings also reinforce the procedure of instructing participants about the requirements of a protocol–regardless of the patient’s diagnosis or apparent state–in order to help those who are able to attend to show the most robust responses possible."
https://openalex.org/W2884039570,"Information elaboration-the act of exchanging, discussing, and integrating information and perspectives through verbal communication-tends to be considered as the silver bullet that drives the performance of diverse teams. We challenge this notion by proposing that the effect of information elaboration on team performance depends on the accuracy of within-group competence attributions, i.e. the extent to which attributions of task competence among team members correspond with members' actual task competence. We argue that information elaboration may actually harm performance when within-group competence attributions are inaccurate, given that in such teams decisions are likely to be based on suggestions from members who have much influence but little competence. We conducted an experiment with 97 gender-heterogeneous teams working on gender-typical problems and coded their interactions. Our findings support our hypotheses that members who are perceived as more competent are more influential in the information elaboration process, and that information elaboration harms performance when competence attributions are not accurate. In contrast to our expectations, pro-diversity beliefs did not mitigate this negative effect of inaccurate competence attributions. We argue that this speaks to the robustness of our findings regarding the detrimental effects of information elaboration when competence attributions are inaccurate."
https://openalex.org/W2884910640,"When Lambs are weaned off ewe's milk, metabolic, structural, and functional changes often occur in the small intestine. Because information on the effects of weaning stress on the proteome of the intestine is limited, an animal model was established with eight pairs of twin lambs divided into artificially reared and ewe-reared groups, which was followed by proteome analysis using iTRAQ technology. Changes occurred in the morphology of the intestine and 5,338 proteins in three biological replicates with less than a 1.2% false discovery rate were identified and quantified. Among them, a subset of 389 proteins were screened as significantly up- (143) and down-regulated (246) in artificially reared compared with ewe-reared. According to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis, the differentially expressed proteins that were strongly down-regulated were enriched in immune system processes, biological adhesion, and metabolic processes. The up-regulated proteins were enriched in gene expression, cellular biosynthetic processes, ribosome and RNA binding in response to weaning stress. A series of proteins associated with intestine morphology and immune function were identified, and levels of the mRNAs encoding these proteins were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The results of this study increased our understanding of the response of lambs weaned off ewe's milk and helped to determine the mechanisms underlying weaning stress."
https://openalex.org/W2883910491,"Recent advances in biotelemetry techniques, especially positioning methods, have revealed the detailed behaviour and movement of aquatic organisms. Behavioural intermittence in animal locomotion, such as the Lévy walk, is a popular topic in the field of movement ecology. Previous attempts to describe intermittent locomotion quantitatively have been constrained by the spatial and temporal resolution possible with conventional biotelemetry systems. This study developed a fine-scale spatiotemporal three-dimensional positioning method using a new biotelemetry system with a positional precision of <10 cm and positioning interval of <10 s. Using this proposed positioning method, the intermittent stop-and-go locomotion of Siebold’s wrasses (Pseudolabrus sieboldi) was observed during travel from an unsuitable to a suitable location following displacement. The fish displayed behavioural intermittence in relocating to a suitable location. Initially, their movement halted for reorientation, after which they moved intermittently yet in a straight line to the suitable location. To test the positioning ability of the proposed method, data sets were resampled at intervals of 5, 10, 30, 60, and 300 s. Longer sampling intervals failed to identify reorientations and underestimated the number of stops, distance travelled, and speed. Overall, the results highlighted the adequacy and ability of the proposed positioning method to observe the intermittent locomotion of fish, such as stop-and-go behaviour, in a natural environment."
https://openalex.org/W2883130021,"Whether the association of work disability with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is mainly due to the disease, i.e. the number and frequency of apneas-hypoapneas, or to coexisting factors independent from the disease, is not well-established. In this study, we aim to evaluate work ability in a group of subjects undergoing OSA workup and to identify the major contributors of impaired work ability. In a cross-sectional study, we enrolled 146 consecutive subjects who have been working for the last five years and referred to the sleep disorders outpatients' clinic of the University-Hospital of Ferrara, Italy, with suspected OSA. After completing an interview in which the Work Ability Index (WAI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaires were administered to assess work ability and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively, subjects underwent overnight polysomnography for OSA diagnosing and spirometry. Of the 146 subjects, 140 (96%) completed the tests and questionnaires and, of these, 66 exhibited work disability (WAI < 37). OSA was diagnosed (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5) in 45 (68%) of the 66 subjects. After controlling for confounders, a lower level of forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), [odds ratio 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-1.00)], older age [1.09 (95% CI 1.03-1.15)], excessive daytime sleepiness [3.16 (95% CI 1.20-8.34)] and a worse quality of life [0.96 (95% CI 0.94-1.00)], but not OSA [1.04 (95% CI 0.41-2.62)], were associated with work disability. Patients with a higher number of diseases, in which OSA was not included, and a lower quality of life had an increased probability of absenteeism in the previous 12 months. In subjects with suspected OSA, FEV1 can be an important predictor of work disability."
https://openalex.org/W2884011033,"The interruption of oral anticoagulation therapy (OAC) after CA of atrial fibrillation (AF) is controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between successful long-term outcomes of catheter resection and SR maintenance and ischemic stroke risk in Korea. We studied 1,548 consecutive patients who were followed up for more than 2 years after CA of AF. We investigated the incidence of ischemic stroke during long-term follow-up. Compared to the AF recurrence group (n = 619), the sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance group (n = 929) had more paroxysmal AF (74.6% versus 44.4%, p<0.001), smaller LA size (39.9±5.7mm versus 42.3±6.0mm, p<0.001), and younger age (54.2±10.9 years versus 56.4±10.6 years, p<0.001). However, CHA2DS2-VASc scores were not significantly different between the two groups (0.9 vs. 1.1, p = 0.053). The overall incidence of ischemic stroke during the mean follow-up period of 54 months after CA was 0.6%, and was significantly lower in the SR group than the AF recurrence group (0.3% vs. 1.1%, log-rank test p<0.001). However, in sub-analysis in the SR group, the rate of ischemic stroke was significantly increasing in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 4 compared to those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score < 4 (4.3% vs. 0.2%, log-rank test p<0.001). In conclusion, this long-term follow-up data in patients with AF who underwent successful CA showed that SR maintenance was correlated with a lower rate of ischemic stroke in Korea. However, it was only observed in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≤3."
https://openalex.org/W2883398052,"Behavioral and neurophysiological findings in vision suggest that perceptual grouping is not a unitary process and that different grouping principles have different processing requirements and neural correlates. The present study aims to examine whether the same occurs in the haptic modality using two grouping principles widely studied in vision, spatial proximity and texture similarity. We analyzed behavioral responses (accuracy and response times) and conducted an independent component analysis of brain oscillations in alpha and beta bands for haptic stimuli grouped by spatial proximity and texture similarity, using a speeded orientation detection task performed on a novel haptic device (MonHap). Behavioral results showed faster response times for patterns grouped by spatial proximity relative to texture similarity. Independent component clustering analysis revealed the activation of a bilateral network of sensorimotor and parietal areas while performing the task. We conclude that, as occurs in visual perception, grouping the elements of the haptic scene by means of their spatial proximity is faster than forming the same objects by means of texture similarity. In addition, haptic grouping seems to involve the activation of a network of widely distributed bilateral sensorimotor and parietal areas as reflected by the consistent event-related desynchronization found in alpha and beta bands."

https://openalex.org/W2884179492,"Interspecific hybridization (i.e. mating between species) occurs frequently in animals. Among cyclical parthenogens, hybrids can proliferate and establish through parthenogenetic reproduction, even if their sexual reproduction is impaired. In water fleas of the Daphnia longispina species complex, interspecific hybrids hatch from sexually produced dormant eggs. However, fewer hybrid genotypes contribute to the dormant egg bank and their hatching rate from dormant eggs is reduced, compared to eggs resulting from intraspecific crosses. Therefore, Daphnia hybrids would benefit from adaptations that increase their survival over winter as parthenogenetic lineages, avoiding the need to re-establish populations after winter from sexually produced dormant eggs. Here, we constructed a mathematical model to examine the conditions that could explain the frequently observed establishment of hybrids in the D. longispina species complex. Specifically, we compared the outcome of hybrid and parental taxa competition given a reduced contribution of hybrids to hatchlings from the sexually produced dormant egg bank, but their increased ability to survive winter as parthenogenetic lineages. In addition, different growth rates of parental species and differences in average annual temperatures were evaluated for their influence on hybrid production and establishment. Our model shows that increased overwinter performance as parthenogenetic females can compensate for reduced success in sexual reproduction, across all tested scenarios for varying relative growth rates of parental species. This pattern holds true for lower annual temperatures, but at higher temperatures hybrids were less successful. Consequently, hybrids might become less abundant as temperatures rise due to climate change, resulting in reduced diversity and faster differentiation of the parental species."

Yaws is not deadly, but if untreated it can lead to severe bone and skin damage and cause permanent pain and disfigurement. The campaign slashed cases by 95% or more, but eventually fizzled out, in part because curing yaws required penicillin injections that weren9t suitable to give to entire populations at risk. By the 1990s, yaws was forgotten but the bacterium that causes it, Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue , wasn9t eradicated, and it bounced back. But in 2012, a Spanish doctor and scientist named Oriol Mitja, working on a very remote island in Papua New Guinea, showed that a single dose of a cheap antibiotic named azithromycin cures yaws as well. The discovery put yaws back on the international agenda, led to a wave of new research, and revived the dream of eradication."
