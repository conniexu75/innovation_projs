https://openalex.org/W2082729958,"We analyze the passengers' traffic pattern for 1.58 million taxi trips of Shanghai, China. By employing the non-negative matrix factorization and optimization methods, we find that, people travel on workdays mainly for three purposes: commuting between home and workplace, traveling from workplace to workplace, and others such as leisure activities. Therefore, traffic flow in one area or between any pair of locations can be approximated by a linear combination of three basis flows, corresponding to the three purposes respectively. We name the coefficients in the linear combination as traffic powers, each of which indicates the strength of each basis flow. The traffic powers on different days are typically different even for the same location, due to the uncertainty of the human motion. Therefore, we provide a probability distribution function for the relative deviation of the traffic power. This distribution function is in terms of a series of functions for normalized binomial distributions. It can be well explained by statistical theories and is verified by empirical data. These findings are applicable in predicting the road traffic, tracing the traffic pattern and diagnosing the traffic related abnormal events. These results can also be used to infer land uses of urban area quite parsimoniously."
https://openalex.org/W2154155138,"We present the results of a global study of dysregulated miRNAs in paired samples of normal mucosa and tumor from eight patients with colorectal cancer. Although there is existing data of miRNA contribution to colorectal tumorigenesis, these studies are typically small to medium scale studies of cell lines or non-paired tumor samples. The present study is to our knowledge unique in two respects. Firstly, the normal and adjacent tumor tissue samples are paired, thus taking into account the baseline differences between individuals when testing for differential expression. Secondly, we use high-throughput sequencing, thus enabling a comprehensive survey of all miRNAs expressed in the tissues. We use Illumina sequencing technology to perform sequencing and two different tools to statistically test for differences in read counts per gene between samples: edgeR when using the pair information and DESeq when ignoring this information, i.e., treating tumor and normal samples as independent groups. We identify 37 miRNAs that are significantly dysregulated in both statistical approaches, 19 down-regulated and 18 up-regulated. Some of these miRNAs are previously published as potential regulators in colorectal adenocarcinomas such as miR-1, miR-96 and miR-145. Our comprehensive survey of differentially expressed miRNAs thus confirms some existing findings. We have also discovered 16 dysregulated miRNAs, which to our knowledge have not previously been associated with colorectal carcinogenesis: the following significantly down-regulated miR-490-3p, -628-3p/-5p, -1297, -3151, -3163, -3622a-5p, -3656 and the up-regulated miR-105, -549, -1269, -1827, -3144-3p, -3177, -3180-3p, -4326. Although the study is preliminary with only eight patients included, we believe the results add to the present knowledge on miRNA dysregulation in colorectal carcinogenesis. As such the results would serve as a robust training set for validation of potential biomarkers in a larger cohort study. Finally, we also present data supporting the hypothesis that there are differences in miRNA expression between adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors of the colon."
https://openalex.org/W2079647703,"Chromatin remodeling factors are becoming known as crucial facilitators of recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Multiple chromatin remodeling protein complexes are now known to be required for efficient double strand break repair. In a screen for microRNAs (miRNAs) that modulate the DNA damage response, we discovered that expression of the miR-99 family of miRNAs correlates with radiation sensitivity. These miRNAs were also transiently induced following radiation. The miRNAs target the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factor SNF2H/SMARCA5, a component of the ACF1 complex. We found that by reducing levels of SNF2H, miR-99a and miR-100 reduced BRCA1 localization to sites of DNA damage. Introduction of the miR-99 family of miRNAs into cells reduced the rate and overall efficiency of repair by both homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Finally, induction of the miR-99 family following radiation prevents an increase in SNF2H expression and reduces the recruitment of BRCA1 to the sites of DNA damage following a second dose of radiation, reducing the efficiency of repair after multiple rounds of radiation, as used in fractionated radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2080431493,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent data suggest that cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are relevant in various cancer pathologies. Pathophysiological role of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) with possible therapeutic prospects in lung cancer was investigated. We exposed 10 different lung cancer cell lines (adenocarcinoma, squamous and large cell carcinoma) to hypoxia and assessed expression and activity of PDE4 by real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, western blotting and PDE activity assays. Expression and activity of distinct PDE4 isoforms (PDE4A and PDE4D) increased in response to hypoxia in eight of the studied cell lines. Furthermore, we analyzed various in silico predicted hypoxia-responsive elements (p-HREs) found in in PDE4A and PDE4D genes. Performing mutation analysis of the p-HRE in luciferase reporter constructs, we identified four functional HRE sites in the PDE4A gene and two functional HRE sites in the PDE4D gene that mediated hypoxic induction of the reporter. Silencing of hypoxia-inducible factor subunits (HIF1α and HIF2α) by small interfering RNA reduced hypoxic induction of PDE4A and PDE4D. Vice versa, using a PDE4 inhibitor (PDE4i) as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -elevating agent, cAMP analogs or protein kinase A (PKA)-modulating drugs and an exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) activator, we demonstrated that PDE4-cAMP-PKA/EPAC axis enhanced HIF signaling as measured by HRE reporter gene assay, HIF and HIF target genes expression ((lactate dehydrogenase A), LDHA, (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) PDK1 and (vascular endothelial growth factor A) VEGFA). Notably, inhibition of PDE4 by PDE4i or silencing of PDE4A and PDE4D reduced human lung tumor cell proliferation and colony formation. On the other hand, overexpression of PDE4A or PDE4D increased human lung cancer proliferation. Moreover, PDE4i treatment reduced hypoxia-induced VEGF secretion in human cells. In vivo, PDE4i inhibited tumor xenograft growth in nude mice by attenuating proliferation and angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that PDE4 is expressed in lung cancer, crosstalks with HIF signaling and promotes lung cancer progression. Thus, PDE4 may represent a therapeutic target for lung cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2039028514,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a valuable model for regenerative medicine and human disease research. To date, however, the reprogramming efficiency of human adult cells is still low. Recent studies have revealed that cell cycle is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency. As is well known, retroviruses such as the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) require cell division to integrate into the host genome and replicate, whereas the target primary cells for reprogramming are a mixture of several cell types with different cell cycle rhythms. Whether cell cycle synchronization has potential effect on retrovirus induced reprogramming has not been detailed. In this study, utilizing transient serum starvation induced synchronization, we demonstrated that starvation generated a reversible cell cycle arrest and synchronously progressed through G2/M phase after release, substantially improving retroviral infection efficiency. Interestingly, synchronized human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and adipose stem cells (ASC) exhibited more homogenous epithelial morphology than normal FBS control after infection, and the expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and Epcam were strongly activated. Futhermore, synchronization treatment ultimately improved Nanog positive clones, achieved a 15–20 fold increase. These results suggested that cell cycle synchronization promotes the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and facilitates retrovirus mediated reprogramming. Our study, utilization of serum starvation rather than additional chemicals, provide a new insight into cell cycle regulation and induced reprogramming of human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2076896786,"Life expectancy at birth, estimated from United States period life tables, has been shown to vary systematically and widely by region and race. We use the same tables to estimate the probability of survival from birth to age 70 (S(70)), a measure of mortality more sensitive to disparities and more reliably calculated for small populations, to describe the variation and identify its sources in greater detail to assess the patterns of this variation. Examination of the unadjusted probability of S(70) for each US county with a sufficient population of whites and blacks reveals large geographic differences for each race-sex group. For example, white males born in the ten percent healthiest counties have a 77 percent probability of survival to age 70, but only a 61 percent chance if born in the ten percent least healthy counties. Similar geographical disparities face white women and blacks of each sex. Moreover, within each county, large differences in S(70) prevail between blacks and whites, on average 17 percentage points for men and 12 percentage points for women. In linear regressions for each race-sex group, nearly all of the geographic variation is accounted for by a common set of 22 socio-economic and environmental variables, selected for previously suspected impact on mortality; R(2) ranges from 0.86 for white males to 0.72 for black females. Analysis of black-white survival chances within each county reveals that the same variables account for most of the race gap in S(70) as well. When actual white male values for each explanatory variable are substituted for black in the black male prediction equation to assess the role explanatory variables play in the black-white survival difference, residual black-white differences at the county level shrink markedly to a mean of -2.4% (+/-2.4); for women the mean difference is -3.7% (+/-2.3)."
https://openalex.org/W2034220305,"Allelic deletion of the RPS14 gene is a key effector of the hypoplastic anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chromosome 5q deletion (del(5q)). Disruption of ribosome integrity liberates free ribosomal proteins to bind to and trigger degradation of mouse double minute 2 protein (MDM2), with consequent p53 transactivation. Herein we show that p53 is overexpressed in erythroid precursors of primary bone marrow del(5q) MDS specimens accompanied by reduced cellular MDM2. More importantly, we show that lenalidomide (Len) acts to stabilize MDM2, thereby accelerating p53 degradation. Biochemical and molecular analyses showed that Len inhibits the haplodeficient protein phosphatase 2A catalytic domain alpha (PP2Acα) phosphatase resulting in hyperphosphorylation of inhibitory serine-166 and serine-186 residues on MDM2, and displaces binding of RPS14 to suppress MDM2 autoubiquitination whereas PP2Acα overexpression promotes drug resistance. Bone marrow specimens from del(5q) MDS patients resistant to Len overexpressed PP2Acα accompanied by restored accumulation of p53 in erythroid precursors. Our findings indicate that Len restores MDM2 functionality in the 5q- syndrome to overcome p53 activation in response to nucleolar stress, and therefore may warrant investigation in other disorders of ribosomal biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2140630557,"Recent studies suggest that anhedonia, an inability to experience pleasure, can be measured as an enduring trait in non-clinical samples. In order to examine trait anhedonia in a non-clinical sample, we examined the properties of a range of widely used questionnaires capturing anhedonia.887 young adults were recruited from colleges. All of them were administered a set of checklists, including Chapman Scale for Social Anhedonia (CRSAS) and the Chapman Scale for Physical Anhedonia Scale (CPAS), The Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale(TEPS), and The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ).Males showed significantly higher level of physical (F = 5.09, p<0.001) and social (F = 4.38, p<0.005) anhedonia than females. As expected, individuals with schizotypal personality features also demonstrated significantly higher scores of physical (t = 3.81, p<0.001) and social (t = 7.33, p<0.001) trait anhedonia than individuals without SPD features, but no difference on self-report anticipatory and consummatory pleasure experience.Concerning the comparison on each item of physical and social anhedonia, the results indicated that individuals with SPD feature exhibited higher than individuals without SPD features on more items of social anhedonia than physical anhedonia scale. These preliminary findings suggested that trait anhedonia can be identified a non-clinical sample. Exploring the demographic and clinical correlates of trait anhedonia in the general population may provide clues to the pathogenesis of psychotic disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2038498901,"The DNA damage response is crucial for bacterial survival. The transcriptional repressor LexA is a key component of the SOS response, the main mechanism for the regulation of DNA repair genes in many bacteria. In contrast, in mycobacteria gene induction by DNA damage is carried out by two mechanisms; a relatively small number of genes are thought to be regulated by LexA, and a larger number by an alternate, independent mechanism. In this study we have used ChIP-seq analysis to identify 25 in vivo LexA-binding sites, including nine regulating genes not previously known to be part of this regulon. Some of these binding sites were found to be internal to the predicted open reading frame of the gene they are thought to regulate; experimental analysis has confirmed that these LexA-binding sites regulate the expression of the expected genes, and transcriptional start site analysis has found that their apparent relative location is due to misannotation of these genes. We have also identified novel binding sites for LexA in the promoters of genes that show no apparent DNA damage induction, show positive regulation by LexA, and those encoding small RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2037834137,"Bv8, also known as prokineticin 2, has been characterized as an important mediator of myeloid cell mobilization and myeloid cell-dependent tumor angiogenesis. Bv8 expression is dramatically enhanced by G-CSF, both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms involved in such up-regulation remain unknown. Using pharmacological inhibitors that interfere with multiple signaling pathways known to be activated by G-CSF, we show that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) activation is required for Bv8 up-regulation in mouse bone marrow cells, whereas other Stat family members and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation are not involved. We further identified CD11b(+) Gr1(+) myeloid cells as the primary cell population in which Stat3 signaling is activated by G-CSF. Bv8 expression induced by G-CSF was also significantly reduced by siRNA-mediated Stat3 knockdown. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicate that G-CSF significantly induces binding of phospho-Stat3 to the Bv8 promoter, which was abolished by pretreatment with the Stat3 inhibitor WP1066. Luciferase assay confirmed that the phospho-Stat3 binding site is a functional enhancer of the Bv8 promoter. The key role of Stat3 signaling in regulating G-CSF-induced Bv8 expression was further confirmed by in vivo studies. We show that the regulation of Bv8 expression in human bone marrow cells is also Stat3 signaling-dependent. Stat3 is recognized as a key regulator of inflammation-dependent tumorigenesis. We propose that such a role of Stat3 reflects at least in part its ability to regulate Bv8 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2010886455,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common form of malignant glioma, characterized by unpredictable clinical behaviors that suggest distinct molecular subtypes. With the tumor metabolic phenotype being one of the hallmarks of cancer, we have set upon to investigate whether GBMs show differences in their metabolic profiles. 1H NMR analysis was performed on metabolite extracts from a selection of nine glioblastoma cell lines. Analysis was performed directly on spectral data and on relative concentrations of metabolites obtained from spectra using a multivariate regression method developed in this work. Both qualitative and quantitative sample clustering have shown that cell lines can be divided into four groups for which the most significantly different metabolites have been determined. Analysis shows that some of the major cancer metabolic markers (such as choline, lactate, and glutamine) have significantly dissimilar concentrations in different GBM groups. The obtained lists of metabolic markers for subgroups were correlated with gene expression data for the same cell lines. Metabolic analysis generally agrees with gene expression measurements, and in several cases, we have shown in detail how the metabolic results can be correlated with the analysis of gene expression. Combined gene expression and metabolomics analysis have shown differential expression of transporters of metabolic markers in these cells as well as some of the major metabolic pathways leading to accumulation of metabolites.

Obtained lists of marker metabolites can be leveraged for subtype determination in glioblastomas. Tumor cells have a remarkably different metabolism than the tissues they derive from. Many key oncogenic signaling pathways converge to create this change to support growth and survival of cancer cells (1Cairns R.A. Harris I.S. Mak T.W. Regulation of cancer cell metabolism.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). The unique metabolic phenotype associated with cancer is in general characterized by (a) high glucose uptake; (b) increased glycolytic activity; (c) decreased mitochondrial activity for energy production; (d) low bioenergetic expenditure; (e) increased phospholipid turnover, altered lipid profile, and increase of de novo lipid synthesis; (f) increased amino acid transport along with elevated protein and DNA synthesis; (g) increased hypoxia; and (h) increased tolerance to reactive oxygen species (1Cairns R.A.

Understanding how cancer subtypes derive energy and necessary building blocks, even from a nutrient-depleted environment, is of fundamental importance for the development of appropriate therapies and diagnostic approaches (2Kroemer G.

About the metabolism of tumors.Biochem. Z. 1924; 152: 319-344Google Scholar). Cancer metabolic phenotype has been explored for several years in cancer diagnostics performed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as PET scanning. With better description of metabolic differences among tumor subtypes, these methods can be used for noninvasive subtyping of tumors and thus improved patient stratification. One of the major applications of noninvasive diagnosis and follow-up is in brain tumors. Metabolic profiling of brain normal and tumor samples has been performed for a number of years with early studies published more than three decades ago (Ref. 5Zaner K.S. Damadian R. NMR in cancer: VIII. Phosphorus-31 as a nuclear probe for malignant tumors.Physiol. Chem. Phys. 1977; 9: 473-483PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Recent studies have further highlighted the possibility of diagnosing major brain tumor types in a noninvasive manner (6Griffin J.L. Kauppinen R.

Several groups have turned to high dimensional profiling studies to better describe GBMs. Recent work performed as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas Network has analyzed genomic abnormalities in GBM samples (8Verhaak R.G. Hoadley K.A. Purdom E. Wang V. Qi Y. Wilkerson M.D. Miller C.R. Ding L. Golub T. Mesirov J.P. Alexe G. Lawrence M. O'Kelly M. Tamayo P. Weir B.A. Gabriel S. Winckler W. Gupta S. Jakkula L.

This analysis has identified four clinically relevant subtypes of GBMs that were characterized by abnormalities in PDGFRA, IDH1, EGFR, and NF1 among other alterations. Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) are catalytic receptors that have intracellular tyrosine kinase activity. They regulate many biological processes including embryonic development, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) function at a crossroad of cellular metabolism and are involved in lipid synthesis, cellular defense against oxidative stress, oxidative respiration, and oxygen-sensing signal transduction. IDHs catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate and the reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. Mutated IDH1 and IDH2 possess a different active site that appears to promote metabolism of α-ketoglutarate (product of wild-type IDH1 and IDH2) into the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that binds to epidermal growth factor. Among its many functions, EGFR has been linked to the mechanism that reduces cell membrane permeability to choline (9Peter Y. Comellas A. Levantini E. Ingenito E.P. Shapiro S.D.

Sci. 2011; 2: 2263-2270Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One of the most common oncogenic events observed in GBMs is the amplification and overexpression of EGFR kinase that occurs in 40–60% of primary GBMs (11Ohgaki H. Dessen P. Jourde B. Horstmann S.

Genetic pathways to glioblastoma: a population-based study.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a truncated version of this kinase (EGFRvIII) is expressed in 20–30% of GBM patients and results in constitutive activation of this signaling pathway (12Chakravarti A. Dicker A. Mehta M. The contribution of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway to radioresistance in human gliomas: a review of preclinical and correlative clinical data.Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2004; 58: 927-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene is suggested to act as a negative regulator of the Ras signaling transduction pathway (13Brennan C. Momota H. Hambardzumyan D. Ozawa T. Tandon A. Pedraza A. Holland E. Glioblastoma subclasses can be defined by activity among signal transduction pathways and associated genomic alterations.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7752Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar).

High throughput metabolite profiling (metabolomics) provides unbiased analysis of metabolic differences. Metabolomics is particularly important in the search for biomarkers that can eventually be used for in vivo diagnosis and prognosis with methods such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Currently, magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the only available method for in vivo molecular analysis of brain tumors and is gaining an increasing role in clinical assessment of patients (6Griffin J.L. Kauppinen R. A metabolomics perspective of human brain tumors.FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The first step toward devising a metabolite-based noninvasive glioblastoma subtyping method is to identify metabolite-based subtypes and to determine major metabolic markers in cancer subtypes. Cell culture analysis provides an excellent, controlled, homogeneous setting for initial identification of metabolic profiles and is a prerequisite to the analysis of more complex tumor tissue or biopsy samples. NMR analysis of brain tumor cell cultures has been performed for number of years with some of the first detailed studies appearing in the early 1990s (14Howells S.L. Maxwell R.J. Griffiths J.R. Classification of tumor 1H NMR spectra by pattern recognition.NMR Biomed. 1992; 5: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Brain tumor cell cultures provide a way for creating a sufficient amount of sample through passaging of cells while avoiding problems caused by heterogeneity and confounders. In 1995, Florian et al. (7Florian C.L. Preece N.E. Bhakoo K.K. Williams S.R Noble M.

Obtained spectra from meningiomas (six lines), neuroblastomas (three lines), and glioblastomas (five lines) displayed some similarities such as the presence of signals from leucine-, isoleucine-, valine-, threonine-, lactate-, acetate-, glutamate-, glycine-, and choline-containing compounds. Meningioma spectra featured relatively high signals from alanine. Intense signals from creatine were present in neuroblastoma but not in glioblastoma spectra. Statistically significant differences were found in the amounts of alanine, glutamate, creatine, phosphorylcholine, and threonine among the types of tumors examined. Overall, it has been observed that neuroblastoma, glioma, and meningioma cells display a low concentration of normal neural metabolites, such as N-acetylaspartate, γ-amino butyrate (GABA), and taurine. The most discriminatory metabolites for tumor cell types include total creatine (creatine and phosphocreatine), total choline (phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, and choline), alanine, taurine, and glutamate. In this work, we have included nine different glioblastoma cell lines and explored the hypothesis that GBM subtypes can be determined from metabolic profiles. To this end, we have analyzed in detail the specific metabolic characteristics of different glioblastoma cell lines and determined significant metabolic differences among metabolically resolved GBM subtypes. Metabolic profiles were compared with publicly available gene expression data to determine relationships between metabolic and gene expression differences among proposed subtypes of GBMs. Human glioma cells A172, BS149, Hs683, LN18, LN229, LN319, LN405, U343MG, and U373 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (Invitrogen). The “BS” series was generated at the University of Basel, whereas the “LN” series was generated by Erwin Van Meir in Lausanne, Switzerland. All cell lines were a kind gift of Adrian Merlo (Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-oncology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland). Prior to metabolite isolation, 1 × 106 cells were seeded in quintuplicate in 10-cm culture dishes and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were then harvested by scraping and rinsed with 5 ml of PBS. The mixture was centrifuged at 4,000 relative centrifugal force for 1 min. Supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was again rinsed with 5 ml of PBS. Upon centrifugation at 4,000 relative centrifugal force for 1 min, cell pellets were kept on ice for 5 min before being resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 50% acetonitrile. Cell suspensions were kept on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 16,000 relative centrifugal force for 10 min at 4 °C. The aqueous acetonitrile extract solutions were dried down under a stream of N2. Total RNA isolation and subsequent cDNA synthesis from GBM cell lines were performed as described previously (16Grzmil M. Morin Jr., P. Lino M.M. Merlo A. Frank S. Wang Y. Moncayo G.

The primers listed in Table 1 were designed and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) (Table 1). PCR was conducted using the EconoTaq PLUS (Lucigen, Middleton, WI) reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cycles performed for amplification consisted of an initial step of 5 min at 94 °C followed by the amplification steps of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C (EGFR, PDGFRA, and GAPDH) or 60 °C (NF1 and IDH) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s (PDGFRA, NF1, IDH1, and GAPDH) or 90 s (EGFR); the final step was 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel. Fragments of ∼100–280 bp (PDGFRA, NF1, IDH1, and GAPDH) and ∼1000 bp (EGFR) corresponding to the expected fragment length were obtained.TABLE 1PCR primers for measurement of gene expression values for marker genesGeneForward primerReverse primerEGFR5′-ATGCGACCCTCGGGGACG-3′5′-GAGTATGTGTGAAGGAGT-3′PDGFRA5′-AGCTGATCCGTGCTAAGGAA-3′5′-ATCGACCAAGTCCAGAATGG-3′NF15′-TTGGTTATAAGCGGCCTCAC-3′5′-TTTCTGGCAGCAACTGTTTG-3′IDH15′-TGGGCCTGGAAAAGTAGAGA-3′5′-CAAAGGCCAACCCTTAGACA-3′GAPDH5′-CGGGTGATGCTTTTCCTAGA-3′5′-GACAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAG-3′ Open table in a new tab The residue obtained after drying was dissolved in 0.6 ml of deuterium oxide (Aldrich, 99.96 atom % 2H), pipetted into a 5-mm NMR tube for NMR analysis. All 1H NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer at 298 K. One-dimensional spectra were obtained using a gradient water presaturation method with 512 scans (pulse sequence zgesgp). NMR spectra were processed using Mnova with exponential apodization (exponent 1); global phase correction; Bernstein-Polynomial baseline correction; Savitzky-Golay line smoothing; and normalization using total spectral area as provided in Mnova. Spectral regions from 0 to 9 ppm were included in the normalization and analysis. Two-dimensional spectra including TOCSY, two-dimensional JRES, and HMQC using standard methods provided in TopSpin software (Bruker) were performed on one sample of each explored cell type with 70, 32, and 1,000 scans (number of transients per free induction decay, i.e. number of free induction decay acquired for each t1 data point), respectively. Mixing times for TOCSY experiments were adjusted to 80 ms. For precision and reproducibility, a total of 45 NMR experiments were carried out in quintuplicate (n = 5) on nine cell lines. Metabolite assignments were performed using two-dimensional measurements as well as one-dimensional 1H spectral data in comparison with metabolites database data and literature information. Data preprocessing including data organization, removal of undesired areas, and binning as well as data presentation was performed with Matlab vR2010b (MathWorks). Minor adjustments in peak positions (alignment) between different samples were performed using in-house alignment software. 5J. Hines and M. Cuperlovic-Culf, submitted.

MetaboHunter: an automatic approach for identification of metabolites from 1H NMR spectra of complex mixtures.BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12: 400Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Spectra for 41 metabolites used in quantification were obtained from the Human Metabolome Database or Biological Magnetic Resonance Databank and further analyzed visually and compared with the obtained spectra. An automated method for quantification based on multivariable linear regression of spectra with appropriately aligned metabolite data from databases was developed and utilized in the study. The assumption behind this approach is that the spectrum of a mixture is the same as the combination (sum) of spectra of individual components measured under the same conditions. If there are no chemical interactions among compounds in the mixture, this assumption generally holds, and the spectra of standards can be used for assignment and quantification of spectrum of a mixture measured under the same conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) and with the same NMR pulse sequence. Here relative metabolite concentrations were estimated using nonlinear curve fitting with the multivariate least squares approach. The linear regression result was used as the starting point, and the model was constrained to concentrations: c ± 0. NMR spectra of the mixtures (samples) are modeled as a sum of spectra for components (metabolites) in the mixture, i.e. I(v)=∑cnLn(v)(Eq. 1) where cn is the concentration of the component, v is the spectral frequency point, and Ln(v) is the spectrum of metabolite n at v. Each compound can result in many peaks within spectra of mixtures thus having extensive overlapping of peaks. The deconvolution of spectra of mixtures, such as in metabolomics, with many strongly overlapping lines, possibly with an unknown number of lines and atomic groups, each with a different line width, is extremely difficult, and thus, it is important to determine an optimal solver for this problem. Generally, the solution is found by minimizing the square root of difference between the model and real spectrum ‖I − ̄I‖2 while using cn and possibly minor frequency change as variables or by solving the Equation 1 for cn. Several different methods for multivariate regression analysis provided in Matlab vR2010b were tested including partial least squares regression, robust fit, Levenberg-Marquardt curve fitting, and linear programming. The best result, i.e. the model with the minimal error determined as ‖I − ̄I‖2, was obtained with the Levenberg-Marquardt curve fitting, and this method was used for quantification of metabolic data used in further analysis. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is specifically designed for solving nonlinear curve fitting problems in the least squares sense and additionally allows the inclusion of constraint that concentrations have to be non-negative. Quantification error is estimated by performing the multivariate linear regression analysis as described above but with one metabolite at the time removed from the analysis. In this way, we are estimating errors caused by omitting metabolites from the analysis and the uniqueness of spectral features for metabolite quantification. From quantitative values for each metabolite recalculated for each n − 1 metabolite subgroup, error is calculated as erri=1n−1∑k=1n(L¯F¯i−L¯F¯M¯i,k)2(Eq. 2) where n = 41 is the number of metabolites; ̄LF̄i is the mean value of concentration for metabolite i across all samples obtained when the complete set of metabolites is analyzed; and ̄LF̄̄Mi,k is the same concentration but when metabolite k is excluded from the analysis. Microarray datasets used in this work were previously published and validated for accuracy in RNA expression measurements (Ref. 16Grzmil M. Morin Jr., P. Lino M.M. Merlo A. Frank S. Wang Y.

The description of methods used for sample processing, microarray experimentation, and validation is given in the original publication. These microarray data were analyzed using TMeV2.2 and Pathway Studio 8.0 (Ariadne Inc.). TMeV is the general data analysis software that includes many features such as normalization, clustering, classification, and statistical analysis. Pathway Studio is the commercial software that determines relationships among different types of biological molecules as well as biomedical terms based on extensive literature searches. NMR metabolite analysis was performed on nine GBM cell lines. Five independent (biological) replicates of cells were grown under the same optimal conditions. Selecting cell cultures with the same growth conditions ensured that there were no differences in the metabolic profiles caused by cellular environment. The metabolites were extracted from replicates of each of the nine cell lines using the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra for 45 metabolic extracts were measured and used in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Additionally, TOCSY, two-dimensional JRES, and HMQC spectra were obtained for one replicate of each cell type, and these two-dimensional data aided in metabolite assignment. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra obtained for each cell line and each replicate are shown in Fig. 1. Spectra of biological replicates show negligible differences. One-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra allow detailed assignment of metabolites. Metabolite assignment was based on literature data (23Govindaraju V. Young K. Maudsley A.A.

In the first level of analysis, the complete spectra were normalized using the total peak area normalization method.

From 2D x-ray intensity maps that cover large areas of reciprocal space we determined the position of the ASA molecules in the phospholipid bilayers and the molecular arrangement of the molecules in the plane of the membranes. We present direct experimental evidence that ASA molecules participate in saturated lipid bilayers of DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and preferably reside in the head group region of the membrane. Up to 50 mol% ASA molecules can be dissolved in this type of bilayer before the lateral membrane organization is disturbed and the membranes are found to form an ordered, 2D crystal-like structure. Furthermore, ASA and cholesterol were found to co-exist in saturated lipid bilayers, with the ASA molecules residing in the head group region and the cholesterol molecules participating in the hydrophobic membrane core."

HS participates in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological functions, including embryonic development, inflammatory responses, blood coagulation, and viral/bacterial infections (1Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans fine-tune mammalian physiology.Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). HS consists of a disaccharide repeating unit of glucuronic acid (GlcA) or iduronic acid (IdoA) and glucosamine, each of which is capable of carrying sulfo groups. The biosynthetic pathway of HS includes HS polymerases, sulfotransferases, and C5-epi. Collective actions of these enzymes result in matured HS with biological functions (supplemental Fig. S1). Uniquely distributed sulfo groups and IdoA residues play critical roles in determining the functions of HS (2Gama C.I. Tully S.E. Sotogaku N. Clark P.M. Rawat M. Vaidehi N. Goddard 3rd, W.A. Nishi A.

Understanding the biosynthetic mechanism also aids in developing a chemoenzymatic method to synthesize HS-based drugs. Heparin, a commonly used anticoagulant drug, is a special form of HS with higher levels of sulfation and IdoA. Heparin is currently isolated from animal tissues through a long and poorly regulated supply chain. Worldwide distribution of contaminated heparin in 2007 has raised the concerns over the safety of animal-sourced heparins (3Liu H. Zhang Z. Linhardt R.J. Lessons learned from the contamination of heparin.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2009; 26: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A cost-effective method to prepare synthetic heparin is desirable. Using HS biosynthetic enzymes, we developed a chemoenzymatic approach to synthesize structurally defined HS and heparin oligosaccharides in high efficiency, which significantly expands the synthetic capability by a purely chemical approach (4Xu Y. Masuko S. Takieddin M. Xu H. Liu R. Jing J. Mousa S.A. Linhardt R.J. Liu J.

C5-epi converts a GlcA unit to an IdoA by forming a putative carbanion intermediate at the C5-position of a GlcA unit (see Fig. 1A) (6Hagner-McWhirter A. Hannesson H.H. Campbell P. Westley J.

Only a single isoform of C5-epi is in human genome, and C5-epi knock-out mice are neonatal lethal, suggesting its essential physiological roles in vivo (7Feyerabend T.B. Li J.P. Lindahl U.

C5-epi reportedly is a two-way catalytic enzyme, performing both the forward and reverse epimerization. Namely, the IdoA unit reverts back to a GlcA unit in the presence of C5-epi (8Li J.

Hydrogen/deuterium exchange-LC-MS approach to characterize the action of heparan sulfate C5-epimerase.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2011; 401: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because all these methods utilized structurally heterogeneous polysaccharide substrates and the products were identified by a disaccharide analysis, none of these approaches is capable of locating the GlcA residues participated in the epimerization beyond a disaccharide domain. Therefore, the understanding for the mechanism of action of C5-epi was limited, especially the effects of neighboring saccharide structures on the action of C5-epi. In this article, we report an advanced method to characterize C5-epi using a series of structurally defined oligosaccharide substrates coupled with tandem mass spectrometry technique. This method permits us to locate the number and position of epimerization at the oligosaccharide levels with molecular precision. On contrary to the convention view, we uncovered that C5-epi also serves as a one-way catalyst to convert a GlcA to an IdoA residue irreversibly, displaying an irreversible catalytic mode. C5-epi recognizes the N-sulfation pattern of the substrates to display reversible or irreversible catalytic mode of C5-epi. The biphasic mode of C5-epi offers a novel mechanism to regulate the biosynthesis of HS with the desired biological functions. Recombinant C5-epi was expressed and purified as described previously (10Li K. Bethea H.N. Liu J.

Briefly, a fusion protein of maltose-binding protein and the human C5-epi catalytic domain (Glu53–Asn617) was constructed in pMal c2x vector (New England BioLabs). The expression was carried out in Origami-B DE3 cells (Novagen), which contained pGro7 (Takara, Japan) plasmid expressing chaperonin proteins GroEL and GroES of Escherichia coli. The purification of C5-epi was completed using an amylose-agarose (New England Biolabs) column following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. To carry out the epimerization reaction in D2O buffer, D2O-exchanged C5-epi was prepared. To this end, the harvested bacteria pellet were suspended in the buffer that was prepared in D2O (>99% D, Spectra Stable Isotopes). In addition, the elution buffers for amylose-agarose column purification were also prepared in D2O. The activity of purified C5-epi (including D2O-exchanged C5-epi) was measured by coupling the reaction of C5-epi and 2-O-sulfotransferase (2-OST) followed by a disaccharide analysis (12Chen J. Jones C.L. Liu J. Using an enzymatic combinatorial approach to identify anticoagulant heparan sulfate structures.Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 986-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this assay, C5-epi (1.5 μg) was incubated with 2 μg of N-sulfo heparosan in the buffer containing 50 mm MES (pH 7.0), Triton X-100, and 1 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. To the reaction mixture, 0.6 μg of 2-OST and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phospho[35S]sulfate ([35S]PAPS) (5–7 × 105 cpm) were added. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for two additional hours. The 35S-labeled polysaccharide was purified by a DEAE column and was then subjected to nitrous acid degradation (at pH 1.5) to yield the disaccharides. The identities of the resultant disaccharides were determined by reverse-phase ion pairing HPLC using a C18-column as described previously (13Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J. Shworak N.W.

As a fully active C5-epi, >90% of resultant disaccharides from the degraded polysaccharide have a structure of IdoA2S-AnMan, where AnMan represents 2,5-anhydromannitol. A total of eight oligosaccharides, differing in the size of the oligosaccharides and the distribution of N-sulfo groups, were prepared in this study. The preparation of the substrates followed essentially the same procedures described in our previous work (14Bethea H.N. Xu D. Liu J. Pedersen L.C.

The synthesis initiated from a disaccharide of GlcA-AnMan, which was prepared from nitrous acid, degraded heparosan. The elongation from disaccharide to the desired size of oligosaccharide substrates was completed by KfiA (N-acetyl glucosaminyl transferase of E. coli K5 strain) and PmHS2 (heparosan synthase 2 from Pasteurella multocida). In a typical elongation reaction from the disaccharide to tetrasaccharide, 6 mg of GlcA-AnMan was incubated with 18 μmol of UDP-GlcNTFA (UDP-N-trifluoroacetyl glucosamine) and 2 mg of KfiA in 40 ml buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2 at room temperature overnight. Upon the complete consumption of UDP-GlcNTFA, 2 mg of PmHS2, and 27 μmol of UDP-GlcUA were added into the reaction mixture and allowed to incubate overnight at room temperature. The product was purified by a BioGel P-2 column (0.75 × 200 cm), which was equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 4 ml/h. The product fraction was located by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. For the additional elongation reaction to the hexa-, octa-, and decasaccharides, the conditions were identical essentially to the above, whereas the reaction volumes were adjusted to the smaller sizes depending on the amount of substrates. The conversion of GlcNTFA to GlcNS was performed under an alkaline condition to remove the trifluoroacetyl group followed by N-sulfation using N-sulfotransferase and PAPS. We completed the synthesis of milligrams of each oligosaccharide substrates. The structures of the oligosaccharides were confirmed by ESI-MS analysis. The preparation of UDP-GlcNTFA was started from glucosamine (Sigma), which was first converted to GlcNTFA by reacting with S-ethyl trifluorothioacetate (Sigma-Aldrich) followed the protocol described previously (16Liu R.

The resultant GlcNTFA was converted to GlcNTFA-1-phosphate using N-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase (17Zhao G. Guan W. Cai L. Wang P.G.

The plasmid expressing N-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase was a generous gift from Professor Peng George Wang (Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA), and the expression of the enzyme was carried out in E. coli as reported (17Zhao G.

An MS-based method to monitor the reaction was devised, which allowed us to pinpoint the epimerization site (EPS) and to examine the reversibility of C5-epi. A substrate is incubated with C5-epi and D2O, leading to an epimerized product with deuterium incorporated. One unit of increase in molecular weight (Mr) for epi-oligosaccharide suggests that one GlcA residue is converted. Using a tandem MS technique, we located the residue that carries the deuterium in the epi-oligosaccharide, thus identifying the EPS site. The reversibility of the epimerization is studied by incubating the deuterated epi-oligosaccharide with C5-epi in H2O followed by MS analysis (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Reactivity and reaction modes of C5-epi toward the substrates with different structuresNameStructure of substrate and site(s) of epimerizationaThe EPS sites are in boldface type.Calculated MrMeasured MrMr after C5-epi treatment in D2OReaction modeOcta-1bThe data from the tandem MS analysis demonstrate that Octa-2 contains two EPS sites are shown in supplemental Fig S2.GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNAc-GlcA-AnMan1554.31554.5 ± 0.41556.4 ± 0.3ReversibleOcta-2cThe data from the tandem MS analysis, which demonstrate that Octa-3 contains one irreversible EPS, are shown in Fig 3.GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-AnMan1592.31592.4 ± 0.41594.3 ± 0.5ReversibleOcta-3dThe data from the tandem MS analysis, which demonstrate that Octa-4 contains one irreversible EPS, are shown in supplemental Fig S3.GlcA-GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-AnMan1554.31554.5 ± 0.41555.4 ± 0.4IrreversibleOcta-4eThe data from the tandem MS analysis, which demonstrate that Octa-6 contains one reversible EPS, are shown in supplemental Fig S4.GlcA-GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNAc-GlcA-AnMan1516.31516.6 ± 0.41517.6 ± 0.5IrreversibleOcta-5GlcA-GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNAc-GlcA-AnMan1478.21478.5 ± 0.21478.6 ± 0.4No reactionOcta-6fOnly partial epimerization products were observed.

Open table in a new tab The reversibility of C5-epi was confirmed using Octa-1 as a substrate, which has a structure of GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNAc-GlcA-AnMan (Fig. 2). The Mr of epi-Octa-1 was increased to 1556.4 ± 0.4 from 1554.5 ± 0.3 (Table 1 and Fig. 2) when it was treated with C5-epi in the presence of D2O. Furthermore, the incubation of epi-Octa-1 with C5-epi in H2O resulted in the decrease of its Mr by 1.9 units (from 1556.4 ± 0.4 to 1554.5 ± 0.5). Our data suggest that two GlcA units in Octa-1 were susceptible to C5-epi modification, and both EPS sites were reversible. These results were consistent with the previous report by Lindahl and co-workers (8Li J. Hagner-McWhirter A. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. Biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate. cDNA cloning and expression of d-glucuronyl C5-epimerase from bovine lung.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, C5-epi displayed an irreversible reaction mode when a different substrate (Octa-3) was used, which has the structure of GlcA-GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNS-GlcA-AnMan. Incubation of Octa-3 with C5-epi in D2O resulted in d-labeled epi-Octa-3. d-labeled epi-Octa-3 exhibited the Mr of 1555.4 ± 0.4 (Fig. 3A) with an increase of 0.9 units (Fig. 3B), suggesting that a single GlcA residue was converted to IdoA. The Mr of epi-Octa-3 remained unchanged after incubation with C5-epi, suggesting that C5-epi was unable to reverse the reaction. To further confirm the structure of d-labeled epi-Octa-3, a series of experiments were conducted. Tandem MS analysis was employed to prove that the d-labeled residue is located at residue E. For example, the fragment Y5 of epi-Octa-3 (m/z value of 499.23 for the doubly charged ion) is ∼1.3 units higher than that of Octa-3 (m/z value of 498.57) (Fig. 3, C and D). NMR analyses of epi-Octa-3 confirmed the presence of IdoA at residue E (supplemental Table S1). The presence of an IdoA in epi-Octa-3 was also demonstrated after modifying epi-Octa-3 with 2-O-sulfotransferase followed by a disaccharide analysis (supplemental data). High resolution ESI-MS analysis of d-labeled epi-Octa-3 showed a signal at a mass/charge ratio of 517.1121, consistent with [M − 3H]3− of the anticipated structure (calculated mass/charge ratio, 517.1040). Subjecting additional oligosaccharides to the analysis revealed a relationship between the reaction mode of C5-epi and the structures of substrates (Table 1). C5-epi appears to recognize the flanking saccharide sequence at the nonreducing end of the EPS residue. Oligosaccharides containing a nonreducing end GlcNS residue immediately adjacent to the EPS residue are reactive to C5-epi. In contrast, when the GlcNS is replaced with GlcNAc (e.g. Octa-5), the oligosaccharide is no longer a substrate of C5-epi, proving the critical role of GlcNS at the nonreducing end of the EPS (8Li J. Hagner-McWhirter A. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. Biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate. cDNA cloning and expression of d-glucuronyl C5-epimerase from bovine lung.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether C5-epi exhibits an irreversible or a reversible mode depends on the residue at the mode of reaction recognition site (MRRS) that is three residues away from the EPS site toward the nonreducing end (Fig. 4A). If a GlcNAc is present at the MRRS site, C5-epi displays an irreversible reaction mode (as for Octa-3 and Octa-4). If a GlcNS or a GlcNH2 residue is present at the MRRS site (e.g. Ocat-1, Octa-2, and Octa-6) or the MRRS site is unoccupied (i.e. Hexa-7 or the second EPS site (EPS2) for Octa-1 and -2), C5-epi displays a reversible reaction mode (Fig. 4A). To further strengthen our conclusion, we synthesized a decasaccharide substrate (Deca-8), permitting C5-epi to display mixed reaction modes (Fig. 4B). Here, two EPS sites were constructed at the residue 0 (EPS1) and residue −2 (EPS2), respectively. Two MRRS sites were also introduced: a GlcNS and a GlcNAc residue were placed at residue −3 and residue −5, which should make a reversible EPS1 site and an irreversible EPS2 site, respectively. Indeed, our data confirmed that EPS1 is a reversible site, whereas EPS2 is irreversible (supplemental Fig. S5). Lastly, we tested the role of irreversible reaction mode of C5-epi in contributing to the biosynthesis of HS that binds to antithrombin (AT). HS or heparin forms a 1:1 complex with AT, which deactivates the activities of factor Xa and IIa in the blood coagulation cascade, to exhibit the anticoagulant activity. Anticoagulant HS and heparin isolated from natural sources have an AT-binding pentasaccharide with a structure of -GlcNAc6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S±6S-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S- (where GlcNS3S+6S represents N-sulfo glucosamine 3-O-sulfate with or without 6-O-sulfate) (19Guerrini M. Guglieri S. Casu B. Torri G. Mourier P. Boudier C. Viskov C. Antithrombin-binding octasaccharides and role of extensions of the active pentasaccharide sequence in the specificity and strength of interaction.

Selleck S.B. Order out of chaos: Assembly of ligand binding sites in heparan sulfate.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The IdoA2S residue in the pentasaccharide domain is known to be essential for high AT-binding affinity (21Das S.K. Mallet J.M. Esnault J. Driguez P.A. Duchaussoy P. Sizun P. Herault J.P. Herbert J.M. Petitou M. Sinaÿ P.

The uncovered irreversible reaction mode of C5-epi provides insight for the natural selection for a GlcNAc6S (not a GlcNS6S) residue as part of the AT-binding site for its role in positioning the IdoA residue. The GlcNAc residue is expected to serve as a MRRS site to direct C5-epi to synthesize an irreversible IdoA residue in the AT-binding pentasaccharide site, thus increasing the efficiency for the biosynthesis of AT-binding HS. To prove this assertion, the synthesis of AT-binding decasaccharides was completed using three decasaccharide substrates, including Deca-9, Deca-10, and Deca-11(supplemental Fig. S6). Deca-9 had no IdoA residue; Deca-10 contained two reversible IdoA residues; and Deca-11 had one irreversible IdoA residue at EPS2 site and one reversible IdoA residue at EPS1 site. The irreversible IdoA residue at EPS2 site in Deca-11 was achieved by exposing Deca-10 to C5-epi modification. These decasaccharides were modified by O-sulfotransferases to produce O-sulfated decasaccharides and were then fractionated by AT affinity columns to determine the amount of AT-binding site in the products. The results revealed that 40% O-sulfated Deca-11 bound to the AT affinity column, whereas the amount of the AT-binding portion for Deca-10 was determined to be 16%, a significant decrease in comparing to that of Deca-11 (Fig. 5). As expected, only 4% of O-sulfated Deca-8 bound to AT affinity column because it lacked an IdoA residue. Taken together, our data suggest that an irreversible IdoA residue at EPS2 site enhances the biosynthesis of AT-binding site. Although the biosynthesis of HS is not a template-driven process, our results support the notion that HS biosynthetic pathway adopts an exquisite way to fine tune the extents of modifications through substrate control (22Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. Interactions between heparan sulfate and proteins: The concept of specificity.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Those enzymes involved in modifying the highly sulfated substrates (supplemental Fig. S1), i.e. 3-O-sulfotransferase, are able to distinguish the saccharide sequences with complicated sulfation patterns (23Xu D. Moon A.F. Song D. Pedersen L.C. Liu J. Engineering sulfotransferases to modify heparan sulfate.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 200-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism used by those enzymes that modify the nonsulfated or low sulfated substrates, including N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase and C5-epi, is perceived to be subtle because the polysaccharide substrates have relatively simple repetitive structures. In the initial N-sulfation step, N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase introduces the GlcNS residues consecutively, rather than randomly, along the polysaccharide substrate (24Sheng J. Liu R. Xu Y. Liu J.

Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the N-sulfation step introduces the codes to direct the extent in the subsequent modification steps. Indeed, our findings demonstrate that C5-epi recognizes the distribution of GlcNS residues in the substrate and displays distinctive catalytic modes, namely translating the N-sulfation code into the positions of GlcA/IdoA residues. Our data clearly show the impact of the irreversible mode of C5-epi on the efficiency for the biosynthesis of anticoagulant HS. Further investigation will unfold the full implication of the biphasic mode possessed by C5-epi in controlling the biosynthesis of HS."

The effects of growth stage of a plant, soil type and year on the rhizosphere fungi were included in this study. To compare the effects, one GM cultivar, the parental isoline, and four non-related cultivars were planted in the fields and analysed using T-RFLP on the basis of fungal phylum specific primers combined with multivariate statistical methods. Additionally, fungal biomass and some extracellular fungal enzymes (laccases, Mn-peroxidases and cellulases) were quantified in order to gain insight into the function of the fungal communities. Plant growth stage and year (and agricultural management) had the strongest effect on both diversity and function of the fungal communities while the GM-trait studied was the least explanatory factor. The impact of cultivar and soil type was intermediate. Occasional differences between cultivars, the amylopectin-accumulating potato line, and its parental variety were detected, but these differences were mostly transient in nature and detected either only in one soil, one growth stage or one year."
https://openalex.org/W2086193647,"Fish larvae experience many environmental challenges during development such as variation in water velocity, food availability and predation. The rapid development of structures involved in feeding, respiration and swimming increases the chance of survival. It has been hypothesized that mechanical loading induced by muscle forces plays a role in prioritizing the development of these structures. Mechanical loading by muscle forces has been shown to affect larval and embryonic bone development in vertebrates, but these investigations were limited to the appendicular skeleton. To explore the role of mechanical load during chondrogenesis and osteogenesis of the cranial, axial and appendicular skeleton, we subjected zebrafish larvae to swim-training, which increases physical exercise levels and presumably also mechanical loads, from 5 until 14 days post fertilization. Here we show that an increased swimming activity accelerated growth, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during larval development in zebrafish. Interestingly, swim-training accelerated both perichondral and intramembranous ossification. Furthermore, swim-training prioritized the formation of cartilage and bone structures in the head and tail region as well as the formation of elements in the anal and dorsal fins. This suggests that an increased swimming activity prioritized the development of structures which play an important role in swimming and thereby increasing the chance of survival in an environment where water velocity increases. Our study is the first to show that already during early zebrafish larval development, skeletal tissue in the cranial, axial and appendicular skeleton is competent to respond to swim-training due to increased water velocities. It demonstrates that changes in water flow conditions can result into significant spatio-temporal changes in skeletogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2101577316,"Background At the same time as there is increasing awareness in medicine of the risks of exaggerating differences between men and women, there is a growing professional movement of ‘gender-specific medicine’ which is directed towards analysing ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ differences. The aim of this article is to empirically explore how the concepts of ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ are used in the new field of ‘gender-specific medicine’, as reflected in two medical journals which are foundational to this relatively new field. Method and Principal Findings The data consist of all articles from the first issue of each journal in 2004 and an issue published three years later (n = 43). In addition, all editorials over this period were included (n = 61). Quantitative and qualitative content analyses were undertaken by the authors. Less than half of the 104 papers used the concepts of ‘sex’ and ‘gender’. Less than 1 in 10 papers attempted any definition of the concepts. Overall, the given definitions were simple, unspecific and created dualisms between men and women. Almost all papers which used the two concepts did so interchangeably, with any possible interplay between ‘sex’ and gender’ referred to only in six of the papers. Conclusion The use of the concepts of ‘sex’ and gender’ in ‘gender-specific medicine’ is conceptually muddled. The simple, dualistic and individualised use of these concepts increases the risk of essentialism and reductivist thinking. It therefore highlights the need to clarify the use of the terms ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ in medical research and to develop more effective ways of conceptualising the interplay between ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ in relation to different diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2022343351,"The ""thrifty genotype"" hypothesis proposes that the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Native Americans and admixed Latin Americans has a genetic basis and reflects an evolutionary adaptation to a past low calorie/high exercise lifestyle. However, identification of the gene variants underpinning this hypothesis remains elusive. Here we assessed the role of Native American ancestry, socioeconomic status (SES) and 21 candidate gene loci in susceptibility to T2D in a sample of 876 T2D cases and 399 controls from Antioquia (Colombia). Although mean Native American ancestry is significantly higher in T2D cases than in controls (32% v 29%), this difference is confounded by the correlation of ancestry with SES, which is a stronger predictor of disease status. Nominally significant association (P<0.05) was observed for markers in: TCF7L2, RBMS1, CDKAL1, ZNF239, KCNQ1 and TCF1 and a significant bias (P<0.05) towards OR>1 was observed for markers selected from previous T2D genome-wide association studies, consistent with a role for Old World variants in susceptibility to T2D in Latin Americans. No association was found to the only known Native American-specific gene variant previously associated with T2D in a Mexican sample (rs9282541 in ABCA1). An admixture mapping scan with 1,536 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) did not identify genome regions with significant deviation of ancestry in Antioquia. Exclusion analysis indicates that this scan rules out ~95% of the genome as harboring loci with ancestry risk ratios >1.22 (at P < 0.05)."
https://openalex.org/W2032751847,"During the resolution of inflammatory responses, neutrophils rapidly undergo apoptosis. A direct and fast activation of caspase-8 by cathepsin D was shown to be crucial in the initial steps of neutrophil apoptosis. Nevertheless, the activation mechanism of caspase-8 remains unclear. Here, by using site-specific mutants of caspase-8, we show that both cathepsin D-mediated proteolysis and homodimerization of caspase-8 are necessary to generate an active caspase-8. At acidic pH, cathepsin D specifically cleaved caspase-8 but not the initiator caspase-9 or -10 and significantly increased caspase-8 activity in dimerizing conditions. These events were completely abolished by pepstatin A, a pharmacological inhibitor of cathepsin D. The cathepsin D intra-chain proteolysis greatly stabilized the active site of caspase-8. Moreover, the main caspase-8 fragment generated by cathepsin D cleavage could be affinity-labeled with the active site probe biotin-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, suggesting that this fragment is enzymatically active. Importantly, in an in vitro cell-free assay, the addition of recombinant human caspase-8 protein, pre-cleaved by cathepsin D, was followed by caspase-3 activation. Our data therefore indicate that cathepsin D is able to initiate the caspase cascade by direct activation of caspase-8. As cathepsin D is ubiquitously expressed, this may represent a general mechanism to induce apoptosis in a variety of immune and nonimmune cells."

Here we describe how PrPc influences oligodendrocyte proliferation in the developing and adult CNS. OPCs that lack PrPc proliferate more vigorously at the expense of a delay in differentiation, which correlates with changes in the expression of oligodendrocyte lineage markers. In addition, numerous NG2-positive cells were observed in cortical regions of adult PrPc knockout mice, although no significant changes in myelination can be seen, probably due to the death of surplus cells."

Here we reported a novel therapeutic strategy, SAHA and DDP-loaded PECE (SAHA-DDP/PECE), can improve the therapeutic effects of intratumorally chemotherapy on OSCC cell xenografts. Objective/Purpose The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the SAHA-DDP/PECE in situ controlled drug delivery system on OSCC cell xenografts. Methods A biodegradable and thermosensitive hydrogel was successfully developed to load SAHA and DDP. Tumor-beared mice were intratumorally administered with SAHA-DDP/PECE at 50 mg/kg (SAHA) +2 mg/kg (DDP) in 100 ul PECE hydrogel every two weeks, SAHA-DDP at 50 mg/kg(SAHA) +2 mg/kg(DDP) in NS, 2 mg/kg DDP solution, 50 mg/kg SAHA solution, equal volume of PECE hydrogel, or equal volume of NS on the same schedule, respectively. The antineoplastic actions of SAHA and DDP alone and in combination were evaluated using the determination of tumor volume, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and TUNEL analysis. Results The hydrogel system was a free-flowing sol at 10°C, become gel at body temperature, and could sustain more than 14 days in situ. SAHA-DDP/PECE was subsequently injected into tumor OSCC tumor-beared mice. The results demonstrated that such a strategy as this allows the carrier system to show a sustained release of SAHA and DDP in vivo, and could improved therapeutic effects compared with a simple additive therapeutic effect of SAHA and DDP on mouse model. Conclusions Our research indicated that the novel SAHA-DDP/PECE system based on biodegradable PECE copolymer enhanced the therapeutic effects and could diminished the side effects of SAHA/DDP. The present work might be of great importance to the further exploration of the potential application of SAHA/DDP-hydrogel controlled drug release system in the treatment of OSCC."

Recently, IαI was shown to inhibit mouse complement in vivo and to protect from complement-mediated lung injury but the mechanism of such activity was not elucidated. Using human serum depleted from IαI, we found that IαI is not an essential human complement inhibitor as was reported for mice and that such serum has unaltered hemolytic activity. However, purified human IαI inhibited classical, lectin and alternative complement pathways in vitro when added in excess to human serum. The inhibitory activity was dependent on heavy chains but not bikunin and detected at the level of initiating molecules (MBL, properdin) in the lectin/alternative pathways or C4b in the classical pathway. Furthermore, IαI affected formation and assembly of the C1 complex and prevented assembly of the classical pathway C3-convertase. Presence and putative interactions with TSG-6 did not affect the ability of IαI to inhibit complement thus implicating IαI as a potentially important complement inhibitor once enriched onto hyaluronan moieties in the course of local inflammatory processes.

However, purified human IαI inhibited classical, lectin and alternative complement pathways in vitro when added in excess to human serum. The inhibitory activity was dependent on heavy chains but not bikunin and detected at the level of initiating molecules (MBL, properdin) in the lectin/alternative pathways or C4b in the classical pathway. Furthermore, IαI affected formation and assembly of the C1 complex and prevented assembly of the classical pathway C3-convertase. Presence and putative interactions with TSG-6 did not affect the ability of IαI to inhibit complement thus implicating IαI as a potentially important complement inhibitor once enriched onto hyaluronan moieties in the course of local inflammatory processes. In support of this, we found a correlation between IαI/HC-containing proteins and hemolytic activity of synovial fluid from patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Inter alpha inhibitor (IαI) 2The abbreviations used are: IαIinter-alpha inhibitorTSG-6TNF-stimulated gene 6HC1heavy chain 1HC2heavy chain 2MBLmannose-binding lectinC4BPC4b-binding proteinNHSnormal human serumMACmembrane attack complexFHcomplement factor HRArheumatoid arthritis. consists of three different polypeptides: heavy chain 1 (HC1), heavy chain 2 (HC2), and bikunin, which are covalently linked together by ester bonds to a chondroitin sulfate chain (1Zhuo L. Hascall V.C. Kimata K. Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor, a covalent protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38079-38082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This complex with a molecular mass of 225 kDa is produced mainly by hepatocytes and circulates in blood reaching concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (2Zhuo L. Kimata K. Structure and function of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chains.Connect Tissue Res. 2008; 49: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Originally, IαI was recognized as a proteinase inhibitor because of its bikunin moiety, which belongs to a group of Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitors (3Proksch G.J. Lane J. Nordschow C.D. Interrelation of the urinary trypsin inhibitor to human plasma inter-α-trypsin inhibitor.Clin Biochem. 1973; 6: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and can also be found in blood in a free form (4Slota A. Sjöquist M. Wolgast M. Alston-Smith J. Fries E. Bikunin in rat plasma, lymph and bile.Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1994; 375: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Even though the serum concentration of IαI is relatively high, it has low specific activity and can be considered as a minor protease inhibitor under physiological conditions (5Potempa J. Kwon K. Chawla R. Travis J. Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor. Inhibition spectrum of native and derived forms.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15109-15114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, alternative functions of IαI have been sought and investigated. Thus, bikunin and IαI are implicated in such processes as oocyte maturation and ovulation (6Chen L. Mao S.J. McLean L.R.

Concerning the interaction with hyaluronan, TNF-stimulated gene 6 protein (TSG-6) plays an essential role as it supports two subsequent transesterification reactions: first it binds covalently HC1 or HC2 of IαI and then in such a complex transfers them to hyaluronan moieties, where heavy chains become conjugated and free TSG-6 released (10Sanggaard K.W.

Because IαI is an abundant serum protein, it was reasonable to investigate its interactions with other blood constituents such as proteins of the complement system, which forms the first line of defense from invading pathogens (14Lambris J.D. Ricklin D. Geisbrecht B.V. Complement evasion by human pathogens.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Additionally, complement guides adaptive immunity and plays a role in removal of immune complexes and dying cells. Complement activation can be triggered by three distinct pathways initiated by binding of the C1 complex to antibodies (classical pathway), mannose-binding lectin (MBL), or ficolins to carbohydrate moieties (lectin pathway) or spontaneous tick-over of C3 (alternative pathway, which may also be initiated by properdin) (15Kemper C. Atkinson J.P. Hourcade D.E. Properdin: emerging roles of a pattern-recognition molecule.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 131-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The C1 complex is composed of recognition molecule C1q and two proteinases C1r and C1s while MBL and ficolins form complexes with MBL-associated proteinases MASP-1 and MASP-2 (16Gaboriaud C. Teillet F. Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Arlaud G.J. Assembly of C1 and the MBL- and ficolin-MASP complexes: structural insights.Immunobiology. 2007; 212: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus triggered enzymatic cascades converge at the level of C3 convertases, which are built up from C4b2a in the classical and the lectin pathways or C3bBb in the alternative pathway, respectively. These enzymatic complexes process the C3 molecule to surface-bondable C3b and small anaphylatoxin C3a. By addition of further C3b molecules, convertases gain affinity to C5, which is similarly cleaved into C5b and anaphylatoxin C5a. Immobilized C5b initiates formation of the pore-forming membrane attack complex (MAC) consisting of subsequently added C6, C7, C8, and several C9 molecules. The proteolytic cascade of complement must be tightly regulated, since excessive activation contributes to pathology of such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia injury, glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer disease (17Okroj M. Heinegård D. Holmdahl R. Blom A.M. Rheumatoid arthritis and the complement system.Ann. Med. 2007; 39: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Sjöberg A.P. Trouw L.A. Blom A.M. Complement activation and inhibition: a delicate balance.Trends Immunol. 2009; 30: 83-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Self cells and tissues are protected by a panel of soluble and membrane-bound complement inhibitors. Recently, knock-out mice lacking bikunin and thus IαI were used to show that IαI inhibits mouse complement in vivo (19Garantziotis S. Hollingsworth J.W. Ghanayem R.B. Timberlake S. Zhuo L. Kimata K. Schwartz D.A. Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor attenuates complement activation and complement-induced lung injury.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4187-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments employing IαI-deficient and sufficient mouse plasma revealed that the former produced significantly more C5a following both classical and alternative pathway activation. Moreover, addition of IαI to normal mouse serum resulted in inhibition of complement activation whereas bikunin alone had no effect, implying that complement inhibitory activity was localized in the heavy chains. Importantly, the complement inhibitory activity of IαI was manifested in vivo in a complement-dependent lung injury model (19Garantziotis S. Hollingsworth J.W. Ghanayem R.B. Timberlake S. Zhuo L. Kimata K. Schwartz D.A. Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor attenuates complement activation and complement-induced lung injury.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4187-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Herein, we investigated if IαI also acts as an inhibitor of the human complement system in vitro. We investigated which complement pathways are affected by IαI and at which point of the cascade interference took place. Finally, we analyzed how interaction with TSG-6 influences complement inhibitory activity of IαI. All complement proteins were bought from Complement Technologies. For C1 complex formation/dissociation experiments, we used C1q purified in-house as described (20Tenner A.J. Lesavre P.H. Cooper N.R. Purification and radiolabeling of human C1q.J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 648-653PubMed Google Scholar). Bikunin was from ProSpec-Tany Technogene. IαI was purified from human plasma as follows: 500 ml of frozen plasma was thawed and centrifuged for 30 min at 6,000 × g, then filtered thorough 0.45 nm filter and applied onto DEAE-Sephadex A50 column (GE Healthcare). Elution was carried out stepwise in 10 mm Na-citrate buffer pH 7.0 containing increasing, non-linear NaCl concentrations of 0.23, 0.5, and 1 m, respectively. The fraction eluted by 0.5 m NaCl was diluted 4-fold with distilled water to 290 mOsm/liter, supplemented with 2.5 g/liter of l-lysine and applied onto DEAE-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 5 mm Na-citrate, 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Then, elution was continued with the same buffer containing 0.16, 0.23, 0.28, and 0.35 m NaCl, respectively. The fraction eluted with 0.28 m NaCl was diluted with distilled water 7-fold to 100 Osm/liter, pH was set at 7.45 and the sample was applied onto a heparin column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium citrate buffer pH 7.45. Elution was carried out in 40 mm Na-citrate buffer pH 7.45 containing 0.05 or 0.2 m NaCl, respectively. The fractions eluted with 0.2 m NaCl containing pure IαI were pooled, dialyzed against PBS buffer, concentrated to at least 1.5 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C until use. The yield of IαI purification was within the range of 10–40 mg of pure protein from one liter of plasma. HC1 and HC2 were prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of IαI, during which NaOH treatment of ester bonds linking its protein components to chondroitin sulfate moiety releases free heavy chains and bikunin (21Blom A.M.

Purified IαI was subjected to 0.05 m NaOH for 15 min at room temperature after which Tris pH 8.0 was added to the final concentration of 0.25 m for rapid neutralization. Subsequently, the preparation was dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.6, loaded onto MonoQ column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with linear gradient of 0–0.7 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing H1 and H2 chain were pooled and stored at −80 °C until use. TSG-6 was purified as described previously (11Colón E. Shytuhina A. Cowman M.K. Band P.A. Sanggaard K.W. Enghild J.J. Wisniewski H.G. Transfer of inter-α-inhibitor heavy chains to hyaluronan by surface-linked hyaluronan-TSG-6 complexes.J. Biol.

Blood from thirteen healthy volunteers was collected according to approval issued by the local ethical committee. After collection, blood was kept at room temperature for 30 min to coagulate, then on ice for another 60 min followed by centrifugation for 7 min at 700 × g. Normal human serum (NHS) was collected, centrifuged again to remove residual erythrocytes, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. To deplete IαI, fibronectin or to obtain serum treated with irrelevant antibody, 200 μl of serum was pre-cleared with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C, then centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g and added to another 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose previously saturated with 200 μg of anti-IαI rabbit polyclonal antibody or anti-fibronectin rabbit polyclonal antibody or rabbit anti-goat polyclonal antibody (all from Dako Cytomation). After 1 h of incubation with shaking at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged and serum collected. To assess the degree of spontaneous complement activation during the depletion process, we also compared the master stock of the original serum with depleted sera in hemolytic assays. Efficiency of depletion of IαI was examined by Western blotting, where 0.5 and 0.25 μl of both IαI-depleted and control sera were separated by electrophoresis under reducing conditions, transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with anti- IαI rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako Cytomation) diluted 1:500 followed by anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (Dako Cytomation). The intensity of IαI band in each sample was evaluated with the MultiGauge 2.0 software (Fuji Film). Synovial fluid was taken from 20 consecutive patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA and seeking care at the Department of Rheumatology at Lund University hospital due to a synovitis in one knee joint. The collection of synovial fluids upon informed consent was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund, Sweden. Material was frozen at −80 °C until being used in experiments. Albumin content in synovial fluid was analyzed by Western blotting, in which mouse anti-human albumin antibody (Abcam 1b.731, diluted 1:10,000) followed by anti-mouse HRP (Dako, 1:1000) were used for detection. We also assessed the content of IαI using Western blotting with polyclonal rabbit anti-IαI antibody (Dako Cytomation, as described above) and complement activity using the hemolytic assay described below. Intensity of protein bands in Western blots was evaluated with MultiGauge 2.0 software. 30 μg of purified IαI or C1s in PBS was mixed with two iodobeads (Pierce), 18 MBq of 125I in a total volume of 500 μl and incubated for 15 min with gentle stirring. Afterward, the reaction mixture was applied onto a PD-10 column (Pierce) and eluted with PBS. Fractions containing iodinated proteins were collected and glycerol (VWR Prolabo) added to 50% v/v followed by storage at −20 °C. Proteins and sera were tested for activity of classical or alternative complement pathways by hemolytic assays performed as described (23Okroj M. Mark L. Stokowska A. Wong S.W. Rose N. Blackbourn D.J. Villoutreix B.O. Spiller O.B. Blom A.M. Characterization of the complement inhibitory function of rhesus rhadinovirus complement control protein (RCP).J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the classical complement pathway was activated on antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes and performed in DGVB2+ buffer (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.35, 72 mm NaCl, 140 mm glucose, 0.1% gelatin, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.15 mm CaCl2) at 0.2% NHS whereas the alternative pathway was activated on rabbit erythrocytes in Mg-EGTA buffer permissive for this pathway only (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.3, 70 mm NaCl, 140 mm glucose, 0.1% gelatin, 7 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA) at 2% NHS. Additional assays, which evaluated the efficiency of 2 μm of IαI or factor H (FH) were performed at 3.5% serum to minimalize buffer and mass load effects. Hemolytic assays testing complement activity of synovial fluid were performed using sensitized sheep erythrocytes in DGVB2+ buffer at 1% synovial fluid. Deposition of particular complement components in the presence of analyzed proteins was performed and analyzed on ELISA plate (Maxisorp, Nunc). Individual complement pathways were initiated by coating the surface with 5 μg/ml of aggregated IgG (classical pathway, Biosite Immuno), 20 μg/ml of zymosan (alternative pathway, Sigma), or 100 μg/ml of mannan (lectin pathway, Sigma), respectively. Then the protein to be studied was mixed with NHS and deposited complement components were detected with specific antibodies as described (24Sjöberg A.P. Nyström S. Hammarström P. Blom A.M. Native, amyloid fibrils, and β-oligomers of the C-terminal domain of human prion protein display differential activation of complement and bind C1q, factor H and C4b-binding protein directly.Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 3213-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additionally, for detection of properdin, polyclonal goat anti human properdin antibody A239 (Complement Technologies) was used and for detection of C5 we employed mouse monoclonal anti human C5 antibody A217 (Quidel). Formation of the C1 complex was studied using Maxisorp plates coated with 5 μg/ml C1q overnight at 4 °C in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Plates were washed with 1% BSA (Sigma) in PBS. Then 4 μg/ml C1r and trace amounts of radiolabeled C1s mixed with the protein to be studied were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, then washed, and residual radioactivity was measured in gamma counter Gamamaster 1277 (LKB Wallac). Dissociation of the C1 complex was studied using plates coated with aggregated IgG at 4 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. Then 10 μg/ml C1q, 4 μg/ml C1r, and trace amounts of radiolabeled C1s were added and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Wells were washed and analyzed proteins were added and incubated for another 1 h at 37 °C following a washing step and measurement of the residual radioactivity. Cleavage of factor B, C2, and C4 was examined by Western blotting. To induce cleavage of factor B, 25 μg/ml zymosan (Sigma), 15 μg/ml of properdin, C3 and ± 1.5 μg/ml factor D and proteins to be studied were mixed in Mg-EGTA buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, then loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted onto PVDF membrane. After blotting, the membrane was probed for factor B with polyclonal goat anti-factor B antibody A235 (Complement Technologies) followed by rabbit anti-goat-HRP-conjugated antibody (Dako Cytomation). Intensities of unprocessed factor B bands were assessed by the MultiGauge software. Cleavage of C2 and C4 was induced by mixing 2.5 μg/ml of aggregated IgG, 2.5 μg/ml of C2, C4 ± 0.5 μg/ml C1, with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and proteins to be studied. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, run onto 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted. Membrane was probed with goat anti human C2 (Calbiochem/EMD Millipore) followed by rabbit anti-goat-HRP conjugated antibody (Dako Cytomation) or rabbit anti-human C4c followed by swine-anti rabbit HRP (both from Dako Cytomation), respectively. Formation of classical the C3 convertase was assessed by flow cytometry. First, 106 sheep erythrocytes (Håtunalab Ab) were sensitized with anti-sheep erythrocytes antibody (Amboceptor, Boegringer) diluted 1:2000 in 1 ml of DGVB++ buffer for 20 min at 37 °C, then washed twice and incubated for another 30 min with 2% C3-depleted serum (Quidel) ± proteins to be studied. This step should allow formation of C3 classical convertase (C4b2a) upon interference of added compounds but not further steps of the complement cascade. Afterward, the number of C4 molecules incorporated to the cell membrane was detected with rabbit anti-human C4c polyclonal antibody followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (both from Dako Cytomation). The samples were analyzed using Partec CyFlow space flow cytometer (Partec) and FlowJo software (Tri Star). Break-apart 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with 10 μg/ml of MBL, factor B, factor D, properdin, C1, C2, C3, C3b, C4, C4b, C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9 at 37 °C for 1 h in carbonate buffer pH 9.6. The plates were washed and blocked with blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS with 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+) for 1 h. Then, trace amounts of 125 Ι-labeled IαI in blocking buffer were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, washed four times in PBS buffer with 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2, and the radioactivity associated with wells was measured with a gamma counter. Ten microliters of protein A-Dynabeads (Dynal AS, Norway) slurry per experimental point was washed twice with DGVB2+ buffer. Beads were then incubated with 35 μg of anti-IαI polyclonal antibody for 10 min at 37 °C, thereafter washed twice and incubated again with 6.5 μg of IαI in total volume of 50 μl DGVB2+ for another 10 min. After washing, the beads were incubated with 2.5% NHS in the same buffer for 5 min. Serum was collected and used in hemolytic assay on sensitized sheep erythrocytes at a final concentration of 1%. Statistical analyses of the results were performed using the Prism software (Graph Pad Software). One-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA tests were used to determine the level of significance. Experimental complement activation in vitro revealed that mouse serum sufficient in IαI generates ∼20% or 70% less C5a than IαI-deficient serum via the alternative and the classical complement pathways, respectively (19Garantziotis S. Hollingsworth J.W. Ghanayem R.B. Timberlake S. Zhuo L. Kimata K. Schwartz D.A. Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor attenuates complement activation and complement-induced lung injury.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 4187-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To assess if this is true in human serum, IαI was depleted using specific antibodies. The procedure of absorption of specific serum protein introduces a risk of spontaneous complement activation by antibodies bound to protein G beads leading to complement consumption. Therefore, three independent batches of serum were prepared: one treated with specific IαI antibodies attached to beads and two other treated in a similar manner but with irrelevant antibodies of the same isotype (anti-fibronectin and anti-goat antibodies). Furthermore, we compared the hemolytic activity of depleted sera with a sample of the same batch of NHS taken before depletion, to assess the degree of spontaneous complement activation during the protein absorption process. Depletion of IαI was confirmed by Western blotting and densitometric analyses revealed that 85–90% of total IαI was retained on the beads (Fig. 1A). We found no significant differences in complement-mediated hemolysis between IαI-depleted and control sera at any tested serum concentration, neither in the classical nor the alternative pathways (Fig. 1, B and C). Spontaneous complement activation during serum treatment was noticeable at low concentrations but it was not excessive, as revealed by readout obtained for the original batch of serum. Thus, removal of the majority of IαI from human serum did not appear to affect complement activation. However, one cannot exclude a significant role of IαI in controlling complement activation when its concentration is elevated locally. Therefore, we tested whether IαI purified from plasma can inhibit human complement when added in excess to NHS. The Purity of IαI, isolated heavy chains and bikunin were evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 2A). IαI, and the heavy chains were largely free of contaminations and migrated as sharp bands while bikunin appeared as a diffused band around 40 kDa, as reported by others (25Yang L. Resnick M.I. Marengo S.R. A simple procedure for isolating microgram quantities of biologically active bikunin from human urine.BJU Int. 2005; 96: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). When intact IαI and its components were tested in hemolytic assays, statistically significant complement inhibition by IαI, HC1, HC2 but not by bikunin was detected in both classical and alternative pathways (Fig. 2, B and C). Inhibition was more pronounced in the classical pathway assay compared with the alternative one, but the latter uses higher serum concentrations and therefore a direct comparison cannot be made. To eliminate possible buffer and protein mass effects, we increased the serum concentration to 3.5% and further tested 2 μm IαI and FH for alternative pathway inhibition. These experiments resulted in almost complete inhibition of hemolysis (1.27% ± 1,16 and 2.25% ± 2.04 hemolytic activity remaining for IαI and FH, respectively). Notably, purified heavy chains were very sensitive to inactivation and showed negligible activity unless stored at −80 °C in small aliquots (data not shown). Knowing that purified IαI is able to inhibit complement, we performed a more detailed analysis to determine the exact points of the complement cascade, which are affected by IαI in each particular pathway. This approach enabled us to investigate the effect of IαI on the lectin pathway, which was not possible to study in hemolytic assays. We chose to study critical stages of all complement cascades, which determine pathway initiation (C1q, properdin, MBL), formation of convertases (C3b, C4b), and proceeding to formation of MAC (C5 and C9). For the classical pathway, the binding of the C1 complex to IgGs was not affected by IαI (Fig. 3A). However, there was a drastic decrease in deposition of C4b and the following complement factors C3b, C5, and C9 thus leading to the conclusion that inhibition of the classical pathway by IαI takes place before the stage of the classical convertase (C4b2a) formation. The alternative pathway was affected already at the level of initiation (properdin and C3b) but with a more pronounced effect at the level of deposition of MAC (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, IαI inhibited binding of MBL to mannan and entirely abolished deposition of C4b"
https://openalex.org/W2020356162,"Despite the severe fitness costs associated with sexual reproduction, its persistence and pervasiveness among multicellular organisms testifies to its intrinsic, short-term advantages. However, the reproductive assurance hypothesis predicts selection favoring asexual reproduction in sparse populations and when mate finding is difficult. Difficulties in finding mates is especially common in parasites, whose life cycles involve multiple hosts, or being released from the host into the external environment where the parasite can find itself trapped without a sexual partner. To solve this problem and guarantee reproduction, parasites in numerous phyla have evolved reproductive strategies, as predicted by the reproductive assurance hypothesis, such as hermaphroditism or parthenogenesis. However, this type of strategy has not been reported from species in the phylum Nematomorpha, whose populations have often been described as sparse. A new Nematomorpha species, Paragordius obamai n. sp., was discovered from Kenya, Africa, and appears to have solved the problem of being trapped without a mate by eliminating the need for males. Paragordius obamai n. sp. represents the first and only known species within this phylum to reproduce asexually. To determine the mechanism of this mating strategy, we ruled out the involvement of reproduction manipulating endosymbionts by use of next generation sequencing data, thus suggesting that parthenogenesis is determined genetically and may have evolved as a means to assure reproduction. Since this new parthenogenetic species and a closely related gonochoristic North American congener, P. varius, are easy to propagate in the laboratory, these gordiids can be used as model systems to test hypotheses on the genetic advantages and disadvantages of asexual reproduction and the genetic determinants of reproductive strategies in parasites."

Here, we show that small Zn(2+)-bound Aβ1-40 (Zn(2+)-Aβ40) oligomers formed in cell culture medium exhibit quasi-spherical structures similar to native amylospheroids isolated recently from Alzheimer disease patients. These quasi-spherical Zn(2+)-Aβ40 oligomers irreversibly inhibit spontaneous neuronal activity and cause massive cell death in primary hippocampal neurons. Spectroscopic and x-ray diffraction structural analyses indicate that despite their non-fibrillar morphology, the metastable Zn(2+)-Aβ40 oligomers are rich in β-sheet and cross-β structures. Thus, Zn(2+) promotes Aβ40 neurotoxicity by structural organization mechanisms mediated by coordination chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1983957561,"The complement system, an important element of both innate and adaptive immunity, is executing complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) with its C5b-9 protein complex that is assembled on cell surfaces and transmits to the cell death signals. In turn, cells, and in particular cancer cells, protect themselves from CDC in various ways. Thus, cells actively remove the C5b-9 complexes from their plasma membrane by endocytosis. Inhibition of clathrin by transfection with shRNA or of EPS-15 with a dominant negative plasmid had no effect on C5b-9 endocytosis and on cell death. In contrast, inhibition of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) by transfection with an shRNA or a dominant negative plasmid sensitized cells to CDC and inhibited C5b-9 endocytosis. Similarly, both inhibition of dynamin-2 by transfection with a dominant negative plasmid or by treatment with Dynasore reduced C5b-9 endocytosis and enhanced CDC. C5b-9 endocytosis was also disrupted by pretreatment of the cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or Filipin III, hence implicating membrane cholesterol in the process. Analyses by confocal microscopy demonstrated co-localization of Cav-1-EGFP with C5b-9 at the plasma membrane, in early endosomes, at the endocytic recycling compartment and in secreted vesicles. Further investigation of the process of C5b-9 removal by exo-vesiculation demonstrated that inhibition of Cav-1 and cholesterol depletion abrogated C5b-9 exo-vesiculation, whereas, over-expression of Cav-1 increased C5b-9 exo-vesiculation. Our results show that Cav-1 and dynamin-2 (but not clathrin) support cell resistance to CDC, probably by facilitating purging of the C5b-9 complexes by endocytosis and exo-vesiculation."
https://openalex.org/W1970734307,"Why do some people live for the present, whereas others save for the future? The evolutionary framework of life history theory predicts that preference for delay of gratification should be influenced by social economic status (SES). However, here we propose that the decision to choose alternatives in immediate and delayed gratification in poverty environments may have a psychological dimension. Specifically, the perception of environmental poverty cues may induce people alike to favor choices with short-term, likely smaller benefit than choices with long-term, greater benefit.The present study was conducted to explore how poverty and affluence cues affected individuals' intertemporal choices. In our first two experiments, individuals exposed explicitly (Experiment 1) and implicitly (Experiment 2) to poverty pictures (the poverty cue) were induced to prefer immediate gratification compared with those exposed to affluence pictures (the affluence cue). Furthermore, by the manipulation of temporary perceptions of poverty and affluence status using a lucky draw game; individuals in the poverty state were more impulsive in a manner, which made them pursue immediate gratification in intertemporal choices (Experiment 3). Thus, poverty cues can lead to short-term choices.Decision makers chose more frequently the sooner-smaller reward over the later-larger reward as they were exposed to the poverty cue. This indicates that it is that just the feeling of poverty influences intertemporal choice - the actual reality of poverty (restricted resources, etc.) is not necessary to get the effect. Furthermore, our findings emphasize that it is a change of the poverty-affluence status, not a trait change, can influence individual preference in intertemporal choice."
https://openalex.org/W2007217526,"Background Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an amphipathic molecule that displays a diversity of antitumor activities. Previous studies have demonstrated that DMSO can modulate AP-1 activity and lead to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. HLJ1 is a newly identified tumor and invasion suppressor that inhibits tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis. Its transcriptional activity is regulated by the transcription factor AP-1. However, the effects of DMSO on HLJ1 are still unknown. In the present study, we investigate the antitumor effects of DMSO through HLJ1 induction and demonstrate the mechanisms involved. Methods and Findings Low-HLJ1-expressing highly invasive CL1–5 lung adenocarcinoma cells were treated with various concentrations of DMSO. We found that DMSO can significantly inhibit cancer cell invasion, migration, proliferation, and colony formation capabilities through upregulation of HLJ1 in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas ethanol has no effect. In addition, the HLJ1 promoter and enhancer reporter assay revealed that DMSO transcriptionally upregulates HLJ1 expression through an AP-1 site within the HLJ1 enhancer. The AP-1 subfamily members JunD and JunB were significantly upregulated by DMSO in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, pretreatment with DMSO led to a significant increase in the percentage of UV-induced apoptotic cells. Conclusions Our results suggest that DMSO may be an important stimulator of the tumor suppressor protein HLJ1 through AP-1 activation in highly invasive lung adenocarcinoma cells. Targeted induction of HLJ1 represents a promising approach for cancer therapy, which also implied that DMSO may serve as a potential lead compound or coordinated ligand for the development of novel anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1965300929,"Changes in expression and localization of proteins that regulate cell and tissue polarity are frequently observed in carcinoma. However, the mechanisms by which changes in cell polarity proteins regulate carcinoma progression are not well understood. Here, we report that loss of polarity protein expression in epithelial cells primes them for cooperation with oncogenes or changes in tissue microenvironment to promote invasive behavior. Activation of ErbB2 in cells lacking the polarity regulators Scribble, Dlg1 or AF-6, induced invasive properties. This cooperation required the ability of ErbB2 to regulate the Par6/aPKC polarity complex. Inhibition of the ErbB2-Par6 pathway was sufficient to block ErbB2-induced invasion suggesting that two polarity hits may be needed for ErbB2 to promote invasion. Interestingly, in the absence of ErbB2 activation, either a combined loss of two polarity proteins, or exposure of cells lacking one polarity protein to cytokines IL-6 or TNFα induced invasive behavior in epithelial cells. We observed the invasive behavior only when cells were plated on a stiff matrix (Matrigel/Collagen-1) and not when plated on a soft matrix (Matrigel alone). Cells lacking two polarity proteins upregulated expression of EGFR and activated Akt. Inhibition of Akt activity blocked the invasive behavior identifying a mechanism by which loss of polarity promotes invasion of epithelial cells. Thus, we demonstrate that loss of polarity proteins confers phenotypic plasticity to epithelial cells such that they display normal behavior under normal culture conditions but display aggressive behavior in response to activation of oncogenes or exposure to cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1975905428,"A family of eukaryotic proline racemase-like genes has recently been identified. Several members of this family have been well characterized and are known to catalyze the racemization of free proline or trans-4-hydroxyproline. However, the majority of eukaryotic proline racemase-like proteins, including a human protein called C14orf149, lack a specific cysteine residue that is known to be critical for racemase activity. Instead, these proteins invariably contain a threonine residue at this position. The function of these enzymes has remained unresolved until now. In this study, we demonstrate that three enzymes of this type, including human C14orf149, catalyze the dehydration of trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline to Δ(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate (Pyr2C). These are the first enzymes of this subclass of proline racemase-like genes for which the enzymatic activity has been resolved. C14orf149 is also the first human enzyme that acts on trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline. Interestingly, a mutant enzyme in which the threonine in the active site is mutated back into cysteine regained 3-hydroxyproline epimerase activity. This result suggests that the enzymatic activity of these enzymes is dictated by a single residue. Presumably, human C14orf149 serves to degrade trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline from the diet and originating from the degradation of proteins that contain this amino acid, such as collagen IV, which is an important structural component of basement membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2008760127,"The genome of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has an average nucleotide composition strongly biased as compared to the human genome. The consequence of such nucleotide composition on HIV pathogenicity has not been investigated yet. To address this question, we analyzed the role of nucleotide bias of HIV-derived nucleic acids in stimulating type-I interferon response in vitro. We found that the biased nucleotide composition of HIV is detected in human cells as compared to humanized sequences, and triggers a strong innate immune response, suggesting the existence of cellular immune mechanisms able to discriminate RNA sequences according to their nucleotide composition or to detect specific secondary structures or linear motifs within biased RNA sequences. We then extended our analysis to the entire genome scale by testing more than 1300 HIV-1 complete genomes to look for an association between nucleotide composition of HIV-1 group M subtypes and their pathogenicity. We found that subtype D, which has an increased pathogenicity compared to the other subtypes, has the most divergent nucleotide composition relative to the human genome. These data support the hypothesis that the biased nucleotide composition of HIV-1 may be related to its pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2030575435,"Many antidepressants are cationic amphipaths, which spontaneously accumulate in natural or reconstituted membranes in the absence of their specific protein targets. However, the clinical relevance of cellular membrane accumulation by antidepressants in the human brain is unknown and hotly debated. Here we take a novel, evolutionarily informed approach to studying the effects of the selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline/Zoloft® on cell physiology in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), which lacks a serotonin transporter entirely. We biochemically and pharmacologically characterized cellular uptake and subcellular distribution of radiolabeled sertraline, and in parallel performed a quantitative ultrastructural analysis of organellar membrane homeostasis in untreated vs. sertraline-treated cells. These experiments have revealed that sertraline enters yeast cells and then reshapes vesiculogenic membranes by a complex process. Internalization of the neutral species proceeds by simple diffusion, is accelerated by proton motive forces generated by the vacuolar H+-ATPase, but is counteracted by energy-dependent xenobiotic efflux pumps. At equilibrium, a small fraction (10–15%) of reprotonated sertraline is soluble while the bulk (90–85%) partitions into organellar membranes by adsorption to interfacial anionic sites or by intercalation into the hydrophobic phase of the bilayer. Asymmetric accumulation of sertraline in vesiculogenic membranes leads to local membrane curvature stresses that trigger an adaptive autophagic response. In mutants with altered clathrin function, this adaptive response is associated with increased lipid droplet formation. Our data not only support the notion of a serotonin transporter-independent component of antidepressant function, but also enable a conceptual framework for characterizing the physiological states associated with chronic but not acute antidepressant administration in a model eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W2075838966,"Phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) is a key molecule in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling. Many studies have shown that the four PLC-β subtypes have different physiological functions despite their similar structures. Because the PLC-β subtypes possess different PDZ-binding motifs, they have the potential to interact with different PDZ proteins. In this study, we identified PDZ domain-containing 1 (PDZK1) as a PDZ protein that specifically interacts with PLC-β3. To elucidate the functional roles of PDZK1, we next screened for potential interacting proteins of PDZK1 and identified the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) as another protein that interacts with PDZK1. Through these interactions, PDZK1 assembles as a ternary complex with PLC-β3 and SSTRs. Interestingly, the expression of PDZK1 and PLC-β3, but not PLC-β1, markedly potentiated SST-induced PLC activation. However, disruption of the ternary complex inhibited SST-induced PLC activation, which suggests that PDZK1-mediated complex formation is required for the specific activation of PLC-β3 by SST. Consistent with this observation, the knockdown of PDZK1 or PLC-β3, but not that of PLC-β1, significantly inhibited SST-induced intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, which further attenuated subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the formation of a complex between SSTRs, PDZK1, and PLC-β3 is essential for the specific activation of PLC-β3 and the subsequent physiologic responses by SST."

By using two complementary approaches (NeuAc removal by neuraminidase or its masking by NeuAc-binding lectin from Maackia amurensis, MAA), we investigated the presence of NeuAc on endothelial αvβ3 and its role in Tat interaction, EC adhesion, and proangiogenic activation. αvβ3 immunoprecipitation with biotinylated MAA or Western blot analysis of neuraminidase-treated ECs demonstrated that NeuAc is associated with both the αv and the β3 subunits. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated that the masking of αvβ3-associated NeuAc by MAA prevents Tat/αvβ3 interaction. MAA and neuraminidase prevent αvβ3-dependent EC adhesion to Tat, the consequent FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and EC proliferation, migration, and regeneration in a wound-healing assay. Finally, MAA inhibits Tat-induced neovascularization in the ex vivo human artery ring sprouting assay. The inhibitions are specific because the NeuAc-unrelated lectin from Ulex europaeus is ineffective on Tat. Also, MAA and neuraminidase affect only weakly integrin-dependent EC adhesion and proangiogenic activation by fibronectin.

https://openalex.org/W2023031078,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are an important class of genetic marker for target gene mapping. As of yet, there is no rapid and effective method to identify SNPs linked with agronomic traits in rapeseed and other crop species.We demonstrate a novel method for identifying SNP markers in rapeseed by deep sequencing a representative library and performing bulk segregant analysis. With this method, SNPs associated with rapeseed pod shatter-resistance were discovered. Firstly, a reduced representation of the rapeseed genome was used. Genomic fragments ranging from 450-550 bp were prepared from the susceptible bulk (ten F2 plants with the silique shattering resistance index, SSRI <0.10) and the resistance bulk (ten F2 plants with SSRI >0.90), and also Solexa sequencing-produced 90 bp reads. Approximately 50 million of these sequence reads were assembled into contigs to a depth of 20-fold coverage. Secondly, 60,396 'simple SNPs' were identified, and the statistical significance was evaluated using Fisher's exact test. There were 70 associated SNPs whose -log(10)p value over 16 were selected to be further analyzed. The distribution of these SNPs appeared a tight cluster, which consisted of 14 associated SNPs within a 396 kb region on chromosome A09. Our evidence indicates that this region contains a major quantitative trait locus (QTL). Finally, two associated SNPs from this region were mapped on a major QTL region.70 associated SNPs were discovered and a major QTL for rapeseed pod shatter-resistance was found on chromosome A09 using our novel method. The associated SNP markers were used for mapping of the QTL, and may be useful for improving pod shatter-resistance in rapeseed through marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. This approach will accelerate the discovery of major QTLs and the cloning of functional genes for important agronomic traits in rapeseed and other crop species."

Ongoing adaptive evolution of ASPM, a brain size determinant in homo sapiens. Science 309; Evans P.D. et al., 2005. Microcephalin, a gene regulating brain size, continues to evolve adaptively in humans. Science 309]. Curiously, experimental attempts have failed to connect the implicated SNPs in these genes with higher-level brain functions. These results stand in contrast with a population-level study linking the population frequency of their alleles with the tendency to use lexical tones in a language [Dediu D., Ladd D.R., 2007. Linguistic tone is related to the population frequency of the adaptive haplogroups of two brain size genes, ASPM and microcephalin. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104]. In the present study, we found a significant correlation between the load of the derived alleles of ASPM and tone perception in a group of European Americans who did not speak a tone language. Moreover, preliminary results showed a significant correlation between ASPM load and hemodynamic responses to lexical tones in the auditory cortex, and such correlation remained after phonemic awareness, auditory working memory, and non-verbal IQ were controlled. As in previous studies, no significant correlation between ASPM and cognitive measures were found. MCPH1 did not correlate with any measures. These results suggest that the association between the recently derived allele of ASPM is likely to be specific and is tied to higher level brain functions in the temporal cortex related to human communication."
https://openalex.org/W1973378799,"We synthesized several novel bifunctional alkylating derivatives of 3a-aza-cyclopenta[a]indene (BO-1012, BO-1005, BO-1099 and BO-1101) that are potent DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. In in vitro cytotoxicity assay, these compounds were more cytotoxic to multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells, such as KBvin10, KBtax50 and CEM/VBL, than their parental cells. Using a xenograft model, BO-1012, at a dose of 5 mg/kg, partially suppressed the growth of parental KB cells but completely suppressed the growth of KBvin10 cells in nude mice. In exploring the possible mechanism, we found that DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair activity in MDR cells, KBvin10 and CEM/VBL, was significantly reduced compared with their parental cells, KB and CEM. Reduced DSB repair activity in KBvin10 cells was likely due to a defect in nuclear translocation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a component of the non-homologous end-joining repair machinery. Furthermore, BO-1012-induced DNA-PK translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus in KB cells is associated with the activation of the Src/nuclear epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cascade, which is defective in MDR cells. As knockdown of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) by siRNA reactivated the Src/nuclear EGFR cascade, DNA-PK translocation and DNA repair activity in MDR cells, overexpression of P-gp attenuates the activity of DNA DSB repair through suppression of Src/nuclear EGFR cascade. Therefore, DNA interstrand crosslinking agents may have potential therapeutic use against P-gp-overexpressing MDR cells."

To better understand the mechanism of action of RSA, Drosophila melanogaster Schneider S2 cells were treated with different concentrations of the lectin and FITC-labeled RSA binding was examined using confocal fluorescence microscopy. RSA has antiproliferative activity with a median effect concentration (EC(50)) of 0.35 µM. In addition, the lectin was typically bound to the cell surface but not internalized. In contrast, the N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectin WGA and the galactose-binding lectin PNA, which were both also inhibitory for S2 cell proliferation, were internalized whereas the mannose-binding lectin GNA did not show any activity on these cells, although it was internalized. Extracted DNA and nuclei from S2 cells treated with RSA were not different from untreated cells, confirming inhibition of proliferation without apoptosis. Pre-incubation of RSA with N-acetylgalactosamine clearly inhibited the antiproliferative activity by RSA in S2 cells, demonstrating the importance of carbohydrate binding. Similarly, the use of MEK and JAK inhibitors reduced the activity of RSA. Finally, RSA affinity chromatography of membrane proteins from S2 cells allowed the identification of several cell surface receptors involved in both signaling transduction pathways."

Elucidation of the reasons why this cell-to-cell contact is essential will probably yield critical insights into β cell maturation and function. In the central nervous system, transcellular protein interactions (i.e. interactions between proteins on the surfaces of different cells) involving neuroligins are key mediators of synaptic functional development. We previously demonstrated that β cells express neuroligin-2 and that insulin secretion is affected by changes in neuroligin-2 expression. Here we show that the effect of neuroligin-2 on insulin secretion is mediated by transcellular interactions. Neuroligin-2 binds with nanomolar affinity to a partner on the β cell surface and contributes to the increased insulin secretion brought about by β cell-to-β cell contact. It does so in a manner seemingly independent of interactions with neurexin, a known binding partner. As in the synapse, transcellular neuroligin-2 interactions enhance the functioning of the submembrane exocytic machinery. Also, as in the synapse, neuroligin-2 clustering is important. Neuroligin-2 in soluble form, rather than presented on a cell surface, decreases insulin secretion by rat islets and MIN-6 cells, most likely by interfering with endogenous neuroligin interactions.

In neurons, extracellular interactions between synaptogenic (synapse-inducing) synaptic adhesion molecules on opposite sides of the synaptic cleft trigger assembly of the protein complexes necessary for neurotransmitter signaling (11Craig A.M. Kang Y. Neurexin-neuroligin signaling in synapse development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). By binding and clustering their presynaptic partners, postsynaptic synaptogenic adhesion molecules, including members of the neuroligin family, induce the formation of the presynaptic machinery for regulated secretion (11Craig A.M. Kang Y. Neurexin-neuroligin signaling in synapse development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In co-culture experiments, transfected, non-neuronal cell lines expressing neuroligins induce presynaptic differentiation at points of contact with co-cultured hippocampal neurons (11Craig A.M.

Clustering on the cell surface (either in the postsynaptic membrane or, in co-culture models, in the plasma membrane of transfected cells) is necessary for neuroligins to promote synapse formation and normal neurotransmission (12Graf E.R.

The neuroligin extracellular domains alone lack synapse-inducing activity, but, when neuroligin is presented to neurons on the surface of cells or clustered on beads, assembly of presynaptic active zones of neurotransmitter release is induced at sites where the extracellular domains come into contact with neuronal processes (12Graf E.R.

Increased NL-2 expression caused increased insulin secretion, and decreased expression lowered insulin secretion (14Suckow A.T. Comoletti D. Waldrop M.A. Mosedale M. Egodage S. Taylor P. Chessler S.D.

Our prior study determined that NL-2 affects insulin secretion but did not test the mechanism of this effect, most importantly whether the increased secretion is driven by extracellular interactions (14Suckow A.T. Comoletti D. Waldrop M.A. Mosedale M. Egodage S. Taylor P. Chessler S.D.

The central role of transcellular neuroligin interactions in synapse maturation along with the known importance of β cell-to-β cell contacts in insulin secretion led us to hypothesize that the effect of NL-2 on insulin secretion is mediated by transcellular interactions. Here we demonstrate that NL-2 in clustered but not soluble form increases insulin secretory capacity in a transcellular manner. Neuroligin-1 (NL-1) can similarly increase insulin secretion. Although neurexin-1α, a major neuroligin binding partner, is present on the β cell surface, neurexin binding is not necessary in order for neuroligin to influence insulin secretion (16Mosedale M. Egodage S. Calma R.C. Chi N.W. Chessler S.D. Neurexin-1α contributes to insulin-containing secretory granule docking.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 6350-6361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In longer term experiments, transcellular NL-2 interactions increased INS-1 β cell proliferation and insulin content. The effect of transcellular NL-2 interactions on insulin secretion occurs distal to glucose sensing. In parallel with its effects on presynaptic active zone formation and neurotransmitter exocytosis in synapses, NL-2 probably enhances insulin secretion by promoting formation and/or function of the submembrane, β cell insulin secretory microdomains. These data identifying transcellular NL-2 interactions as necessary for normal insulin secretion increase our understanding of why contact between β cells is essential to normal β cell function and of the role of synaptogenic adhesion molecules in the establishment of β cell function. INS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (INS-1 cell medium). MIN-6 cells were cultured in DMEM with 20% FBS with 50 pm β-mercaptoethanol (MIN6 medium). HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (HEK medium). Rat islets were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats (240–260 g; Charles River Laboratories) as described previously and cultured for 18 h to allow for recovery (14Suckow A.T. Comoletti D.

Animal procedures were approved by the University of California, San Diego, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rat islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (islet medium). l-Glutamine (2 mm), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin were also added to the medium. HEK293 cells grown to 100% confluence in antibiotic-free medium were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 24-well plates with full-length NL-2, with the same construct containing only the epitope tag, with neuroligin-1 (NL-1), with NL-1-G500A, or with CASPR2. All of these constructs carried N-terminal FLAG epitope tags. CASPR2 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1, and the other proteins were encoded by previously described plasmids (17Comoletti D. Flynn R.E.

After 24 h, dispersed MIN-6, INS-1 or primary rat islet cells were seeded onto the transfected cells. In some experiments, transfected HEK293 cells were, after 48 h, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed repeatedly with PBS. The short incubation time, although lethal to cells, allows retention of protein enzymatic and binding activity (paraformaldehyde is used in a similar manner to fix Staphylococcus aureus with nearly complete retention of protein A binding activity) (19Jungers J.

Dispersed INS-1 cells were cultured in contact with the fixed HEK293 cells for 24 h. MIN6 and INS-1 co-cultures were incubated for 24 h in MIN-6 medium or in a 50/50 mix of INS-1 and HEK medium, respectively. Dispersed islet cells were prepared by gently dissociating rat islets with 0.01% trypsin, 0.1 mm EDTA in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution.

Recombinant soluble NL-2 with a stop codon replacing Phe-616 and recombinant soluble NL-1 with a stop codon replacing residue 639 and with or without a Gly to Ala mutation at residue 500 (G500A) (all with N-terminal FLAG epitope tags) were produced as described previously (17Comoletti D.

Small clusters of MIN-6 cells or rat islets were washed with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer containing 2.75 mm glucose, aliquoted to wells on a 96-well plate, and allowed to equilibrate for 45 min. Cells were then incubated in KRB buffer with 30 mm glucose (20 mm for islets) containing either a control peptide (three FLAG epitope tags in series), soluble acetylcholinesterase, or soluble NL-1 or NL-2. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma). Secreted insulin and cellular insulin content were analyzed by radioimmunoassay (Millipore). For analyses of insulin secretion, cells were washed twice with KRB buffer containing 2.75 mm glucose and then equilibrated in this solution for 45 min. The cells were then treated for 1 h with KRB buffer containing either 2.75 mm glucose or 16.75 mm glucose (30 mm for MIN6). Where indicated, buffer was supplemented with 100 μm IBMX to enhance stimulated insulin secretion. For analyses of K+-stimulated insulin secretion, cells co-cultured for 24 h were washed twice with KRB buffer containing 2.75 mm glucose, next equilibrated in this solution for 45 min, and then treated with KRB buffer containing either 2.75 mm glucose, 20 mm glucose, or 30 mm KCl for 1 h. Protein was extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. Insulin was analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Soluble NL-2 was labeled with 125I by Dr. Robert Speth (University of Mississippi radioiodination core) by the Iodogen method (Thermo Scientific). The specific activity of 125I-labeled soluble NL-2 was 113.7 μCi/μg. Polypropylene test tubes containing INS-1 cells (2.5 × 105) in 170 μl of medium were placed in a shaking water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. Varying concentrations of unlabeled soluble NL-2 were added to the test tubes, followed by 125I-labeled soluble NL-2 (50 pm) and then a 30-min incubation. To measure binding of the 125I-labeled soluble NL-2 to the cells, cell-associated radioactivity was determined after separating away the unbound protein as described previously (22Sweet I.R.

A Pharmacology Primer: Theory, Applications, and Methods. 2nd Ed. Academic Press/Elsevier, Amsterdam2006: 59-78Crossref Google Scholar). To analyze Ki67 expression, cells were aspirated from the wells after treatment with 0.05% trypsin in EDTA, spun down at 500 × g for 5 min, and then washed with PBS with 1% BSA. They were then incubated at room temperature for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed twice with 1% BSA in PBS and stored in 1% saponin with 1% BSA in PBS. Cells were stained with 1:100 guinea pig anti-insulin primary antibody (Dako) or 1:100 mouse anti-Ki67 antibody (BD Biosciences) and then 1:1000 Alexa 488 anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibody or 1:500 Alexa 594 anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen) in 1% saponin, 1% BSA PBS. FACS analysis was performed using a Guava flow cytometry system (Millipore). To test for cell surface expression of NL-2 and of an NL-2 binding partner, MIN-6 and INS-1 cells were grown to 100% confluence in 75-cm2 flasks and then suspended in KRB buffer after detachment from the flask using Cellstripper (Mediatech) and washing in complete medium. Cells were then either incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with 700 nm 3× FLAG peptide or 700 nm FLAG-NL-2, both preincubated with monoclonal FLAG antibody, or at 4 °C with preimmune serum or a rabbit anti-NL-2 antibody against recombinant NL-2 extracellular domain (Lampire Biological Laboratories). Next, cells were washed three times with ice-cold KRB buffer and then incubated with AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three more times with KRB buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Analysis of insulin secretion stimulated by direct Ca2+ influx after cell permeabilization with streptolysin-O was performed as described previously (24Deeney J.T. Gromada J. Høy M. Olsen H.L.

Cells were then washed and equilibrated with an EGTA-buffered 0.1 μm free Ca2+, 140 mm K+-glutamate solution for 10 min at 37 °C and next incubated with the same EGTA-buffered solution with either 0.1 μm or 10 μm free Ca2+ for 15 min at 37 °C. Total protein was extracted from co-cultured cells with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (Sigma). Secreted and total insulin content were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. For quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of syntaxin clustering, cells co-cultured for 24 h were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS-Tween (PBST) prior to staining. Cells were stained with 1:500 rabbit anti-FLAG primary antibody (Sigma) to label transfected HEK293 cells and with 1:100 mouse anti-syntaxin-1A antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After 1 h of primary antibody incubation, cells were washed three times with 1% BSA in PBST, followed by incubation with 1:2000 Alexa 488 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, and 1:500 Alexa 594 anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (both from Invitrogen). Cells were finally washed in 1% BSA in PBST followed by three washes with PBS. Analysis of syntaxin clustering was by analysis of the punctateness of syntaxin immunofluorescence (i.e. the syntaxin protein content at sites of clustering, as reflected by the brightness of individual puncta of syntaxin staining, evaluated by measuring the signal intensity of syntaxin-positive pixels) as has been described previously for synapsin and other secretory proteins (27Shi P.

Compared with the muscle-specific isoforms SERCA2a and SERCA1a, SERCA2b houses an 11th transmembrane segment (TM11) and a short luminal extension (LE) at its C terminus (2b-tail). The 2b-tail imposes a 2-fold higher apparent Ca2+ affinity and lower Vmax. Previously, we assumed that LE is the sole functional region of the 2b-tail and that TM11 is a passive element providing an additional membrane passage. However, here we show that peptides corresponding to the TM11 region specifically modulate the activity of the homologous SERCA1a in co-reconstituted proteoliposomes and mimic the 2b-tail effect (i.e. lower Vmax and higher Ca2+ affinity). Using truncated 2b-tail variants we document that TM11 regulates SERCA1a independently from LE, confirming that TM11 is a second, previously unrecognized functional region of the 2b-tail. A phylogenetic analysis further indicates that TM11 is the oldest and most conserved feature of the 2b-tail, found in the SERCA pump of all Bilateria, whereas LE is only present in Nematoda and vertebrates. Considering remarkable similarities with the Na+,K+-ATPase α-β interaction, we now propose a model for interaction of TM11 with TM7 and TM10 in the anchoring subdomain of the Ca2+ pump.

SERCA consists of three cytosolic domains for ATP hydrolysis and one transmembrane (TM) domain for Ca2+ binding and transport. ATP hydrolysis in the cytosolic domain drives the conformational changes in the TM region that lead to the opening or closing of the gates to the Ca2+-binding sites. The TM region is divided into a highly mobile part (TM1–6) that controls the access to the Ca2+-binding sites, and a relatively immobile part (TM7–10) that is thought to serve as the anchoring region of the pump in the lipid bilayer (2Toyoshima C.

Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. Functional comparisons between isoforms of the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum family of calcium pumps.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the heart, SERCA2a is regulated by a small TM protein called phospholamban (PLB), which reduces its apparent affinity for Ca2+ (8MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Phospholamban: a crucial regulator of cardiac contractility.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). PLB occupies a hydrophobic groove in between the mobile and anchoring part of the TM domain of SERCA2a (TM2, 4, 6, and 9), leading to a stabilization of the low Ca2+ affinity E2 conformation (9Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Modeling of the inhibitory interaction of phospholamban with the Ca2+ ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This interaction is relieved by phosphorylation of PLB during β-adrenergic stimulation (8MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Phospholamban: a crucial regulator of cardiac contractility.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). SERCA2b, on the other hand, uniquely differs from the other SERCA1–3 splice variants by housing a 49-amino acid long C terminus (2b-tail) that imposes the unusual enzymatic properties on this pump, i.e. a 2-fold higher apparent affinity for Ca2+ (KCa) and lower catalytic turnover rate (Vmax) compared with the muscle isoforms SERCA1a or SERCA2a (7Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. Functional comparisons between isoforms of the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum family of calcium pumps.J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47877-47889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 2b-tail increases the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the pump, whereas PLB decreases it through a different mechanism (11Verboomen H. Wuytack F. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The 2b-tail consists of a cytosolic part (19 amino acids, Gly994–Asp1012), a transmembrane segment (TM11, 18 amino acids, Gly1013–Tyr1030), and a luminal extension (12 amino acids, Ser1031–Ser1042) (see Fig. 1A). Earlier work pointed to the luminal extension as the sole functional region of the 2b-tail (13Verboomen H. Wuytack F. Van den Bosch L. Mertens L. Casteels R. The functional importance of the extreme C-terminal tail in the gene 2 organellar Ca2+-transport ATPase (SERCA2a/b).Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). TM11 would interact with the anchoring part of the pump at the periphery of TM7 and TM10 (12Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H. Lescrinier E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vangheluwe P. Structural basis for the high Ca2+ affinity of the ubiquitous SERCA2b Ca2+ pump.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The short luminal extension would then follow a path from this remote site, running between luminal loops L5–6 and L7–8, toward a luminal binding site for the last four residues (1039MFWS1042) (see Fig. 1B). This functional C-terminal tetrapeptide stretch would here interact with a pocket formed in the E1 state by the upstream luminal loops. The interaction therefore stabilizes the E1 conformation, which at least partially accounts for the increased apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2b (12Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H. Lescrinier E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vangheluwe P. Structural basis for the high Ca2+ affinity of the ubiquitous SERCA2b Ca2+ pump.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, two observations indicate that the interaction of LE with its luminal interaction site does not fully explain the 2b-tail effect and that TM11 plays a more active role than simply providing a passive membrane passage. First, there remains a clear functional effect of the 2b-tail upon truncation of its last 11 residues (Thr1032*). But removal of one additional residue (Ser1031*) completely abolishes the effect of the 2b-tail (12Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H. Lescrinier E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vangheluwe P. Structural basis for the high Ca2+ affinity of the ubiquitous SERCA2b Ca2+ pump.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Verboomen H. Wuytack F. Van den Bosch L. Mertens L. Casteels R. The functional importance of the extreme C-terminal tail in the gene 2 organellar Ca2+-transport ATPase (SERCA2a/b).Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is thus clear that Ser1031 takes a key position in the function of the 2b-tail. Second, an affinity-increasing effect is also seen in the SERCA1a context, i.e. when the 2b-tail is coupled to SERCA1a (SERCA1a2b chimera) (12Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H. Lescrinier E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vangheluwe P. Structural basis for the high Ca2+ affinity of the ubiquitous SERCA2b Ca2+ pump.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because the SERCA1a luminal domain does not present the right interface for interaction with the last four residues of LE, the affinity modulation must by elimination be attributed to a more upstream region of the 2b-tail, presumably Ser1031 or TM11. Using peptides corresponding to TM11, we will here convincingly demonstrate that TM11 is the second functional region of the 2b-tail acting independently from Ser1031 and LE. Synthetic peptides corresponding to parts of the 2b-tail were purchased from Biomatik, Wilmington, DE (95% purity grade, HPLC and MS verified). Unless otherwise specified, all synthetic peptides are acetylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus to closely mimic the peptide backbone of the endogenous 2b-tail. Peptides were solubilized in 3:1 chloroform:trifluoroethanol at a concentration of 0.5–4 mg/ml. The peptide concentration was verified by quantitative amino acid analysis. Sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of rabbit hind limb skeletal muscle were prepared as described previously (14Moncoq K. Trieber C.A. Young H.S. The molecular basis for cyclopiazonic acid inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9748-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The membranes were then solubilized in octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8; Barnet Products), and SERCA1a was purified by affinity chromatography as in Ref. 14Moncoq K. Trieber C.A. Young H.S. The molecular basis for cyclopiazonic acid inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9748-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar. Functional co-reconstitution of SERCA1a with TM11 peptides has been performed essentially as described before for SERCA1a/PLB co-reconstitution (15Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S. Effects of phospholamban transmembrane mutants on the calcium affinity, maximal activity, and cooperativity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the required amount of pTM11 was mixed with lipids (360 μg of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine and 40 μg of egg yolk phosphatidic acid; Avanti Polar Lipids) and dried to a thin film. The peptide/lipid film was rehydrated in water, and detergent (800 μg of C12E8) was added. Buffer (20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% NaN3) and SERCA1a (300 μg) were added to achieve final molar stoichiometries of 1:0.5–15 SERCA1a:peptide and 1:120 SERCA1a:phospholipids. The detergent was extracted via gradual administration of SM-2 Biobeads (Bio-Rad). Finally, the SERCA1a-containing vesicles were purified via sucrose step-gradient centrifugation. To detect the peptides in the proteoliposomes, 7.5 μl of the vesicles were loaded on Tricine-SDS-PAGE as described in Ref. 16Schägger H. Tricine-SDS-PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar. Proteins and peptides were visualized in the gel by silver staining. The orientation of pTM11 in our co-reconstituted proteoliposomes was determined using a biotin surface labeling assay as in Ref. 15Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S. Effects of phospholamban transmembrane mutants on the calcium affinity, maximal activity, and cooperativity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. Co-reconstituted vesicles (5 μg of protein) were mixed in labeling buffer (20 mm borate-KOH, pH 9.0) with 5 mm EZLink Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-[biotin-amido]hexanoate; Thermo Scientific) in the absence or presence of 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Anatrace). The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by quenching with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The amount of biotin labeling was quantified on a Western blot using IRDye 800CW streptavidin conjugate and an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Bioscience). Ca2+-dependent ATPase activities of the co-reconstituted proteoliposomes were measured at 25 °C by an enzyme-coupled assay (as in Ref. 15Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S. Effects of phospholamban transmembrane mutants on the calcium affinity, maximal activity, and cooperativity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or at 37 °C by an end point colorimetric measurement (as in Ref. 12Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H. Lescrinier E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vangheluwe P. Structural basis for the high Ca2+ affinity of the ubiquitous SERCA2b Ca2+ pump.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SERCA1a activity was followed in the presence and absence of co-reconstituted synthetic peptides. A minimum of three independent reconstitutions and activity assays were performed, and the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was measured over a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations (from 0.1 to 10 μm). SERCA2b mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange). Ca2+-dependent ATPase activities of the overexpressed SERCA variants in COS cells were measured using an end point colorimetric assay (12Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H. Lescrinier E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vangheluwe P. Structural basis for the high Ca2+ affinity of the ubiquitous SERCA2b Ca2+ pump.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The contribution of the endogenous SERCA2b in COS cells to the measured Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of the overexpressed SERCA variants is negligible. The KCa (Ca2+ concentration at half-maximal activity), the Vmax (maximal activity), and the nH (Hill coefficient) were calculated via nonlinear least squares fitting of the activity data to the Hill equation using Sigma Plot (SPSS Inc.). Results are presented as average ± S.E. of n (number) independent experiments (n is provided in the legends). Multiple comparison statistical analysis was carried out by one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Fisher least squares difference test (Statistica 8). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We showed previously that when the 2b-tail is coupled to the SERCA1a isoform, it increases the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the pump (12Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H. Lescrinier E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vangheluwe P. Structural basis for the high Ca2+ affinity of the ubiquitous SERCA2b Ca2+ pump.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore used purified SERCA1a reconstituted in proteoliposomes as a model system (15Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S. Effects of phospholamban transmembrane mutants on the calcium affinity, maximal activity, and cooperativity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to address the role of TM11 and Ser1031. First, SERCA1a was reconstituted into proteoliposomes in the presence or absence of pTM11, i.e. a peptide that corresponds to the predicted TM11 region (Thr1011–Tyr1030) of the 2b-tail, but which also includes the first three residues of the LE (Ser1031–Asp1033) (Fig. 1C). Several reconstitutions were carried out with increasing molar ratios of pTM11 to SERCA1a (ratios 0.15–15; Fig. 1, D and E, and supplemental Fig. 1). We first verified whether pTM11 was incorporated in the SERCA1a vesicles via gel electrophoresis using a 16% Tricine-SDS polyacrylamide gel with 6 m urea to separate the small 2.6-kDa peptide. The dose-dependent increase of pTM11 incorporation is illustrated in supplemental Fig. 1A. We then determined the orientation of the peptide in the membrane. To that end, we incorporated a lysine at the N terminus of pTM11 as an acceptor for biotin. Lysines residing at the luminal side of the vesicles remain protected against biotinylation unless the vesicles are treated with detergent (n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside), which would lead to a complete labeling of pTM11. The ratio of biotinylated pTM11 in the absence and presence of detergent at molar ratios 1.5 and 4.5 is ∼50%, in line with an expected random orientation of pTM11 in the membrane (supplemental Fig. 1B). To test whether pTM11 alters the activity of SERCA1a in the proteoliposomes, we measured via an enzyme-coupled assay the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of SERCA1a in the presence and absence of pTM11. Our data clearly demonstrate that extrinsically added pTM11 mimics the effect of the 2b-tail (7Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47877-47889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), causing significant changes in Vmax and KCa in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, D and E). The differences between the Vmax effects at molar ratios 0.5 to 10 are not significant (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 1C). Therefore, the maximal effect of TM11 on Vmax is observed at molar ratio 0.5 and higher. With increasing molar ratios there is a continuous increase in the apparent Ca2+ affinity with a maximal effect on KCa at molar ratio 4.5 and higher (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. 1D). The Hill coefficient remained unaffected (data not shown). Importantly, we found a combined maximal effect of pTM11 on Vmax (65% reduction) and KCa (35% reduction) at a 4.5 molar ratio of pTM11 to SERCA1a (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). The lack of complete inhibition points to a specific 2b-tail-like effect and suggests that at molar ratio 4.5, the interaction site of pTM11 is saturated. To exclude possible side effects of the peptide, we tested two peptide variants of pTM11 with alanine substitution at sites Pro1017 or Trp1028 (Fig. 2A). We showed previously that mutation of these residues in SERCA2b reduced the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the pump (12Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H. Lescrinier E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vangheluwe P. Structural basis for the high Ca2+ affinity of the ubiquitous SERCA2b Ca2+ pump.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both peptide variants were successfully co-reconstituted with SERCA1a into proteoliposomes at levels comparable with pTM11 (Fig. 2B). At this point, we switched to a higher throughput method of measuring the ATPase activity based on an end point measurement of the produced inorganic phosphate at different free Ca2+ concentrations. Our results indicate that alanine substitutions at Pro1017 and Trp1028 reduce the impact of pTM11 on the KCa of SERCA1a (Fig. 2D). Note that the pP1017A substitution has no effect on Vmax, whereas the Vmax effect of pW1028A is only seen at molar ratio 10, indicating that the pump has a lower affinity for pW1028A than pTM11 (Fig. 2C). To rule out that the pTM11 effect on pump activity is not merely due to an aspecific hydrophobic interaction with the Ca2+ pump, we also tested the effect of a randomized pTM11 peptide (pTM11rand, supplemental Fig. 2). pTM11rand is predicted to be a TM-spanning peptide (predicted by the TMHMM software). Different molar ratios of pTM11rand to SERCA1a were tested (0.5–10, supplemental Fig. 2, B–D), i.e. in the same range as for the WT TM11 peptide. Although we confirmed that pTM11rand is incorporated into the proteoliposomes (supplemental Fig. 2B), we found in contrast to pTM11 no significant effect of pTM11rand on the maximal SERCA1a activity (supplemental Fig. 2C) and a modest, but not significant increase in KCa (supplemental Fig. 2D). The specificity of the reconstitution system is further corroborated by the opposite effect of adding pTM11 or PLB on the SERCA1a apparent Ca2+ affinity. pTM11 peptides increase the apparent Ca2+ affinity, whereas addition of PLB lowers it. This is in line with their respective expected physiological performance (15Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S. Effects of phospholamban transmembrane mutants on the calcium affinity, maximal activity, and cooperativity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Trieber C.A.

The effects of mutation on the regulatory properties of phospholamban in co-reconstituted membranes.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can conclude that in our reconstituted system, pTM11 is a specific regulator of SERCA1a that recapitulates the action of the 2b-tail on the Vmax and KCa of the Ca2+ pump. This method now allows the exploration of the functional role of TM11 by site-specific amino acid replacement in pTM11. Our next experiments addressed the specific role of Ser1031, i.e. a residue found at the border between the hydrophobic TM11 segment and the more hydrophilic LE. Clearly, Ser1031 occupies a key position in the 2b-tail. We knew that removing the last 12 amino acids (Ser1031*) results in a full loss of the 2b-tail effect rendering a pump with SERCA2a-like properties (12Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, we wanted to recapitulate the findings of the SERCA2b truncation mutant Ser1031* by comparing the maximal effect of shorter pTM11 peptides in our reconstituted system. First, we tested the amidated peptides pS1031-CN and pT1032-CN, which, respectively, correspond to fragments of the 2b-tail that are found in the SERCA2b Ser1031* and Thr1032* mutants (Fig. 3A). Unexpectedly, the pS1031-CN variant altered the KCa and Vmax to the same extent as the longer variants pTM11 and pT1032-CN (Fig. 3, C and D). This demonstrates that pTM11, and therefore also the corresponding TM11 stretch of the 2b-tail, represents a second, previously unrecognized functional region that acts independently from Ser1031 and the LE. However, this contrasts with our earlier conclusion that LE would be the only functionally important element in the 2b-tail (13Verboomen H. Wuytack F. Van den Bosch L. Mertens L. Casteels R. The functional importance of the extreme C-terminal tail in the gene 2 organellar Ca2+-transport ATPase (SERCA2a/b).Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Note that the SERCA2b truncation mutant Ser1031* contains a free C terminus, whereas with the peptide approach we used the peptide pS1031-CN that is amidated at the C terminus to better mimic the original peptide backbone. We therefore hypothesized that the presence of the free C terminus might lead to the complete loss of 2b-tail function in the SERCA2b truncation mutant Ser1031*. To test this, we also determined the effect of the nonamidated synthetic peptide pS1031-CO (Fig. 3A), which ends with a free C terminus. Indeed, we could show that in contrast to pS1031-CN, pS1031-CO does not alter the Vmax and KCa of SERCA1a, indicating that it is no longer active (Fig. 3, C and D). The possibility tha"

In contrast, maintenance of cell size and IL-7 induced growth were specifically dependent on amino acids. Furthermore, cellular amino acid uptake was implicated in the mechanism of IL-7 induced growth. Analysis of IL-7 regulated gene expression revealed that neutral and cationic amino acid transporters were specific transcriptional targets of IL-7 signalling.

TCR-induced activation of NF-κB signaling pathway is initiated from the interaction of TCR with specific antigen in the context of MHC and costimulation of CD28 by its ligands on antigen-presenting cells. Upon stimulation, a cascade of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling components is successively triggered, which results in the recruitment and activation of a number of signaling proteins, including phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (2van Oers N.S.

Concurrently PDK1 recruits CARMA1 to lipid rafts. Phosphorylated PKCθ phosphorylates the close-by CARMA1 at specific serine residues, and leads to the conformational changes of CARMA1 from an inactive form to an active one (4Matsumoto R. Wang D.

The CBM complex subsequently recruits downstream signal proteins, such as TRAF6, caspase 8, and TAK1, to collaboratively activate the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex. IκB is then phosphorylated and undergoes degradation, which leads to the activation of NF-κB. Among the CBM signalosome, the scaffold protein CARMA1 is crucial for the recruitment of downstream signal proteins, as well as their plasma membrane localization (9Thome M. CARMA1, BCL-10, and MALT1 in lymphocyte development and activation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 348-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 10Rawlings D.J. Sommer K. Moreno-García M.E.

Its activity requires fine tuning to elicit proper activation of NF-κB. Posttranscriptional modifications of CARMA1, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, determine the outcome of TCR stimulation. For examples, kinases such as PKCθ, IKKβ, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 can phosphorylate CARMA1 at different serine residues in the PKC-regulated domain (PRD), and subsequently lead to NF-κB activation (4Matsumoto R.

In addition, monoubiquitination of CARMA1 catalyzed by Cbl-b disrupts the formation of CBM complex (16Kojo S. Elly C. Harada Y. Langdon W.Y. Kronenberg M. Liu Y.C. Mechanisms of NKT cell anergy induction involve Cbl-b-promoted monoubiquitination of CARMA1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17847-17851Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although much has been reported, the subtle regulation of CARMA1 signalosome remains not so clear thus far. To identify potential regulators of CARMA1-mediated NF-κB activation, we performed biochemical affinity purification with CARMA1 as a bait protein, and identified PKCδ as a protein specifically associated with CARMA1. Knockdown of PKCδ accelerated TCR-induced NF-κB activation and IL-2 secretion, suggesting an inhibitory role of PKCδ in TCR-mediated NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the kinase activity of PKCδ was not required for its inhibitory role. Instead, PKCδ inhibited TCR-induced NF-κB activation by steric hindrance of recruiting TRAF6 to CARMA1 signalosome. The Abs against the following antigens were purchased from the indicated companies: human CD3, human CD28, and mouse IgG1 (BD Biosciences); human IκBα and phospho-IκBα (S32, S36) (Cell Signaling Technology); human PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); human β-actin, Flag, and hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes (Sigma-Aldrich). Mouse antisera were raised against recombinant human CARMA1 (aa 1–468), Bcl10 or MALT1 (aa 348–813) respectively. Human IL-2 ELISA kit (Dake Biotechnology), dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega), and Gamma Bind G Plus-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were purchased from the indicated companies. NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid was provided by Dr. Gary Johnson. Mammalian expression plasmids for human CARMA1 and its mutants, PKCδ and its mutants, PKCθ, Bcl10, or MALT1, fused with Flag-, HA-, or RFP-epitope, were constructed by standard molecular biology techniques. Double-stranded oligonucleotides for RNA interference corresponding to the target sequences were inserted into pSUPER. Retro vector (Oligoengine) according to protocols recommended by the manufacturer. The target sequence for human PKCδ-siRNA #1 is 5′-AAACACTGGTGCAGAAGAA-3′; for PKCδ-siRNA #3 is 5′-GCAGCAAGTGCAACATCAA-3′. HEK293 cells (5 × 108) stably transfected with pCTAP-CARMA1 (Stratagene) were collected and the cell lysates were subjected to tandem affinity purification procedures. The purified CARMA1-associated proteins were digested by trypsin in solution. The tryptic peptides were analyzed by HPLC-ESI/MS/MS with a Thermo Finnigan LTQ adapted for nanospray ionization. The tandem spectra were searched against Homo sapiens National Center for Biotechnology Information reference data base using SEQUEST. Results was filtered by Xcorr +1 > 1.9, +2 > 2.2, +3 > 3.5, sp >500, Deltcn >0.1, Rsp < = 5. HEK293 cells were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids by standard calcium phosphate precipitation. Jurkat T cells were transfected with siRNAs or expression plasmids by retroviral transduction. For luciferase reporter assays, HEK293 cells (1 × 105) were seeded on 24-well dishes and transfected the next day. In the same experiment, we added empty control plasmid to ensure that each transfection received the same amount of total DNA. To normalize the transfection efficiency, 0.01 μg pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase) reporter plasmid was added to each transfection. Luciferase assays were performed with a dual-specific luciferase assay kit. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of Renilla luciferase activities. All reporter assays were repeated for at least three times. Data shown were average values ± S.D. from one representative experiment. Constructs of MIGR-GFP-PKCδ-WT (wild type) or MIGR-GFP-PKCδ-KD (kinase-dead mutant, K378A) were transfected into PKCδ-knockdown Jurkat T cells (18D'Costa A.M. Denning M.F. A caspase-resistant mutant of PKC-δ protects keratinocytes from UV-induced apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours later, GFP-positive cells were isolated based on fluorescence intensity using the MoFlo XDP Sorter (Beckman Coulter). Approximately 1 × 105 cells of each sample with >95% purity were obtained and cultured for further experiments. For transient transfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, HEK293 cells (2 × 106) were transfected for 20 h. The transfected cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with proteases inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For each immunoprecipitation, 0.4 ml aliquot of lysates was incubated with 0.5 μg of antibody or control IgG and 25 μl of GammaBind G Plus-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. The precipitates were analyzed by standard immunoblotting procedures. For endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Jurkat T cells (5 × 107) were costimulated by mouse anti-human CD3 (10 μg/ml), mouse anti-human CD28 (10 μg/ml), and 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG for crosslinking at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells were then lysed and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis as described above. IL-2 production in the culture medium of Jurkat cells was measured after CD3/CD28 crosslinking for 48 h using a human IL-2 ELISA kit. CARMA1 plays a central role in signaling to NF-κB activation by TCR or BCR engagement. For a better understanding of signaling events in this pathway, we purified CARMA1-associated proteins by a tandem affinity purification system, and identified the eluted proteins by a shotgun mass spectrometry analysis method. By comparing with other unrelated purifications using the same method, we identified several candidates, including PKCδ, as specific CARMA1-associated proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation results confirmed the interaction between ectopic PKCδ and CARMA1 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). Besides, PKCδ also interacted with MALT1 and TRAF6, but not Bcl10 (Fig. 1B). To determine whether CARMA1 and PKCδ interact in untransfected cells, we stimulated Jurkat T cells by crosslinking CD3 and CD28 with antibodies, and performed endogenous coimmunoprecipitation. The results showed that endogenous PKCδ was recruited to CARMA1 after CD3/CD28 costimulation (Fig. 1, C and D). Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy also indicated that a population of PKCδ was translocated to the plasma membrane upon TCR stimulation (supplemental Fig. S1). To address whether PKCδ is involved in CARMA1-dependent NF-κB activation, we performed NF-κB reporter assays. Overexpression of PKCδ alone had no marked effect on the basal level of NF-κB activation. However, when cotransfected with CARMA1, PKCδ inhibited CARMA1-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the role of PKCδ in TCR-induced NF-κB signaling, we used RNAi to knockdown PKCδ in human Jurkat T cells. We made four PKCδ siRNA constructs, and determined their effects on knockdown of PKCδ. As shown in Fig. 2B, the #3 PKCδ-siRNA construct could inhibit the expression of transiently transfected PKCδ to 20% of the control sample (p < 0.01). The #1 siRNA constructs could reduce PKCδ level to 60% of the control sample, whereas #2 and #4 siRNA plasmid had minimal effects. We thus chose #3 and #1 siRNA constructs for further experiments. We generated stable Jurkat T cells expressing PKCδ-siRNAs by retroviral transduction. Comparing with the controls, PKCδ-knockdown Jurkat T cells exhibited enhanced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB upon the stimulation of CD3/CD28 crosslinking (Fig. 2C). Consistently, knockdown of PKCδ potentiated the production of IL-2, which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine induced by NF-κB activation (Fig. 2D). The extent of IL-2 enhancement was correlated with the efficiency of PKCδ knockdown (Fig. 2D). These evidences suggest that PKCδ itself plays a negative role in TCR-induced activation of NF-κB. It has been reported that upon TCR ligation, PKCδ is phosphorylated and regulates granule exocytosis in a kinase-dependent manner (17Ma J.S. Haydar T.F. Radoja S. Protein kinase Cδ localizes to secretory lysosomes in CD8+ CTL and directly mediates TCR signals leading to granule exocytosis-mediated cytotoxicity.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4716-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the kinase activity of PKCδ was required for TCR-induced NF-κB activation. We reconstituted PKCδ-knockdown Jurkat T cells with PKCδ-wild type (WT) or PKCδ-kinase dead (KD) mutant (18D'Costa A.M. Denning M.F. A caspase-resistant mutant of PKC-δ protects keratinocytes from UV-induced apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The reconstitutions were confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). The reconstituted cells, PKCδ-knockdown cells and controls were stimulated by CD3/CD28 crosslinking, and then the culture medium of each sample was collected to measure IL-2 production, while the cell lysates were subjected to immunoblots to detect NF-κB activation. The results showed that the ectopic expression of both WT and KD PKCδ reversed the promotion of IL-2 production and IκB phosphorylation and degradation in PKCδ-knockdown cells (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that the kinase activity was dispensable for the inhibitory role of PKCδ in TCR-induced NF-κB activation. The N terminus of CARMA1 contains a CARD domain and a coiled-coil domain. The C-terminal region contains a MAGUK-homology structure, which is composed of postsynaptic density 95/dislarge/zona occludens 1 (PDZ), Src homology 3 (SH3), and guanylate kinase (GUK) domains (10Rawlings D.J. Sommer K. Moreno-García M.E. The CARMA1 signalosome links the signaling machinery of adaptive and innate immunity in lymphocytes.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). PKCθ, a novel PKC isoform, associates with the PRD region of CARMA1, which links the coiled-coil domain and PDZ domain. PKCθ phosphorylates CARMA1 at Ser-552 and Ser-645 in PRD, which is essential for TCR-induced NF-κB activation (4Matsumoto R. Wang D. Blonska M. Li H. Kobayashi M. Pappu B. Chen Y. Wang D. Lin X.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). PKCδ, as another novel PKC isoform, shares 85% in catalytic domain and 62.5% in overall protein sequence homology with PKCθ, thus it may interfere with the interaction between CARMA1 and PKCθ through competitive binding. However, domain-mapping experiments suggested that PKCδ interacted with all the domains consisted in the MAGUK region of CARMA1 but not PRD region (Fig. 4A). CARMA1 associated with the catalytic domain (aa 353–668) of PKCδ, but not the regulatory domain (aa 1–352) (Fig. 4B). As an unexpected result, PKCδ had no marked effect on the CARMA1-PKCθ interaction, determined by competitive coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 4C). We next investigated whether PKCδ acted through inhibiting the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome. The competitive coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that PKCδ had no marked effect on the interactions between CARMA1-Bcl10, CARMA1-MALT1, or Bcl10-MALT1 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, PKCδ inhibited the association between MALT1 and TRAF6 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). We further performed endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments on PKCδ-knockdown Jurkat T cells or control cells to confirm the effect of PKCδ on MALT1-TRAF6 interaction. The results showed that TRAF6 in controls was associated with MALT1 moderately after CD3/CD28 crosslinking, peaked at 30 min, and became weaker after 60 min. While in PKCδ-knockdown cells, obviously more TRAF6 was associated with MALT1 after CD3/CD28 crosslinking. The association peaked at 10 min, and became weaker after 30 min (Fig. 5B). These results suggested that PKCδ inhibited the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome by interfering the association between MALT1 and TRAF6. In this study, we investigated the role of PKCδ in NF-κB activation in T cells and reported several observations. First, PKCδ participates in the negative control of TCR-induced NF-κB activation. Second, the kinase activity of PKCδ is dispensable for the negative regulation. Third, PKCδ is recruited to CARMA1 upon TCR stimulation, and inhibits the subsequent recruitment of TRAF6 by MALT1. T lymphocytes express multiple PKC isoforms, among which PKCθ is considered as the most important isoform participating in T cell activation (19Spitaler M. Cantrell D.A. Protein kinase C and beyond.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is essential for CARMA1 phosphorylation and further NF-κB activation. It also phosphorylates RapGEF2 and enhances T cell adhesion (20Letschka T. Kollmann V. Pfeifhofer-Obermair C. Lutz-Nicoladoni C. Obermair G.J. Fresser F. Leitges M. Hermann-Kleiter N. Kaminski S. Baier G. PKC-theta selectively controls the adhesion-stimulating molecule Rap1.Blood. 2008; 112: 4617-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although PKCθ was reported to be the only PKC isoform translocated to immunological synapse after TCR stimulation (21Monks C.R. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Selective modulation of protein kinase C-θ during T-cell activation.Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 22Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A.

Different protein kinase C isoenzymes regulate IL-2 receptor expression or IL-2 synthesis in human lymphocytes stimulated via the TCR.J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2207-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), more evidences suggest that other PKCs, such as PKCα, also translocate to the plasma membrane upon TCR stimulation and possibly participate in T cell activation (24Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Carmona E.M. Asin S. Savoy D.N. Billadeau D.D. Paya C.V. Protein kinase Cα (PKCα) acts upstream of PKCθ to activate IκB kinase and NF-κB in T lymphocytes.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7068-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Besides, PKCζ and PKCι are PKCθ-associated PKCs in T cells, and possibly assist in PKCθ-mediated signaling (25Gruber T. Fresser F. Jenny M. Uberall F. Leitges M. Baier G. PKCθ cooperates with atypical PKCζ and PKCι in NF-κB transactivation of T lymphocytes.Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to these PKCs, PKCδ is reported to serve a negative role in TCR-induced IL-2 cytokine production and T cell proliferation (26Gruber T. Barsig J. Pfeifhofer C. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Tinhofer I. Leitges M. Baier G. PKCδ is involved in signal attenuation in CD3+ T cells.Immunol. Lett. 2005; 96: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this negative regulation is not clear so far. By identifying the CARMA1-associated proteins, we found that PKCδ dynamically interacted with CARMA1 and was translocated to the plasma membrane in a TCR stimulation-dependent manner. It has been shown that following TCR ligation, PKCδ is rapidly phosphorylated at Thr-505 on the activation loop (17Ma J.S. Haydar T.F. Radoja S. Protein kinase Cδ localizes to secretory lysosomes in CD8+ CTL and directly mediates TCR signals leading to granule exocytosis-mediated cytotoxicity.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4716-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Gorelik G. Fang J.Y. Wu A. Sawalha A.H. Richardson B. Impaired T cell protein kinase C δ activation decreases ERK pathway signaling in idiopathic and hydralazine-induced lupus.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5553-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation leads to the activation of PKCδ, which regulates lytic granule exocytosis in CTLs in a kinase-dependent manner (17Ma J.S. Haydar T.F. Radoja S. Protein kinase Cδ localizes to secretory lysosomes in CD8+ CTL and directly mediates TCR signals leading to granule exocytosis-mediated cytotoxicity.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4716-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, however, we found that the kinase activity of PKCδ was not required for its regulation of TCR-induced NF-κB activation, because the promotion of either IκB phosphorylation or IL-2 production in PKCδ-knockdown Jurkat T cells could be reversed by reconstitution with kinase-dead mutant of PKCδ, similar to wild-type PKCδ. These surprising findings suggest that negative regulation of TCR-signaling by PKCδ may be mediated through steric hindrance of the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome. Although PKCδ and PKCθ share high protein sequence homology, they are associated with different region of CARMA1: PKCδ interacts with the MAGUK region, and PKCθ interacts with the PRD region. These findings indicated that PKCδ did not function through competitive binding to CARMA1 with PKCθ, which was confirmed by our competitive binding assays. Upon TCR stimulation, phosphorylated CARMA1 forms a CBM complex with Bcl10 and MALT1. Then MALT1 directly recruits TRAF6 and TAK1 into the CARMA1 signalosome (28Oeckinghaus A. Wegener E. Welteke V. Ferch U. Arslan S.C. Ruland J. Scheidereit C. Krappmann D.

Differential requirement for Malt1 in T and B cell antigen receptor signaling.Immunity. 2003; 19: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). TRAF6 functions as an E3 ligase to catalyze the K63-linked polyubiquitination of MALT1, Bcl10, and IKKγ, and thus promotes signaling to NF-κB activation (28Oeckinghaus A. Wegener E. Welteke V. Ferch U. Arslan S.C. Ruland J. Scheidereit C. Krappmann D.

Our results showed that PKCδ had no apparent effect on the association of CARMA1 with PKCθ, Bcl10, or MALT1. Instead, PKCδ inhibited the interaction between MALT1 and TRAF6 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of PKCδ enhanced the TCR-induced recruitment of endogenous TRAF6 to MALT1. These results provide an explanation for the inhibitory role of PKCδ in TCR-induced NF-κB activation: PKCδ is recruited to CARMA1 signalosome upon TCR stimulation and inhibits the recruitment of essential downstream signal components, such as TRAF6. PKCδ-deficient mice were reported to be susceptible to autoimmune disease, indicating that PKCδ plays a regulatory role in immune systems. Although the development of immune organs in PKCδ-deficient mice appears to be normal, cultured PKCδ-deficient lymphocytes, both B and T cells, display enhanced proliferation in response to various mitogenic stimuli (26Gruber T. Barsig J. Pfeifhofer C. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Tinhofer I. Leitges M. Baier G. PKCδ is involved in signal attenuation in CD3+ T cells.Immunol.

Increased proliferation of B cells and auto-immunity in mice lacking protein kinase Cδ.Nature. 2002; 416: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Since signal transduction from antigen receptors in both B and T cells to NF-κB shares the same downstream signaling events through CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex, our results might also explain the enhanced proliferation of PKCδ-deficient B cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that PKCδ negatively regulates TCR-induced NF-κB activation and IL-2 production by inhibiting the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome.

https://openalex.org/W2101470710,"The eight pre- or/and post-synaptic metabotropic glutamatergic receptors (mGluRs) modulate rapid excitatory transmission sustained by ionotropic receptors. They are classified in three families according to their percentage of sequence identity and their pharmacological properties. mGluR4 belongs to group III and is mainly localized presynaptically. Activation of group III mGluRs leads to depression of excitatory transmission, a process that is exclusively provided by mGluR4 at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse in rodent cerebellum. This function relies at least partly on an inhibition of presynaptic calcium influx, which controls glutamate release. To improve the understanding of molecular mechanisms of the mGluR4 depressant effect, we decided to identify the proteins interacting with this receptor. Immunoprecipitations using anti-mGluR4 antibodies were performed with cerebellar extracts. 183 putative partners that co-immunoprecipitated with anti-mGluR4 antibodies were identified and classified according to their cellular functions. It appears that native mGluR4 interacts with several exocytosis proteins such as Munc18-1, synapsins, and syntaxin. In addition, native mGluR4 was retained on a Sepharose column covalently grafted with recombinant Munc18-1, and immunohistochemistry experiments showed that Munc18-1 and mGluR4 colocalized at plasma membrane in HEK293 cells, observations in favor of an interaction between the two proteins. Finally, affinity chromatography experiments using peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domains of mGluR4 confirmed the interaction observed between mGluR4 and a selection of exocytosis proteins, including Munc18-1. These results could give indications to explain how mGluR4 can modulate glutamate release at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum in addition to the inhibition of presynaptic calcium influx."
https://openalex.org/W2090156415,"In the hypothalamus, fasting induces a member of the AF4 family of transcription factors, AFF4, which was originally identified as a fusion partner of the mixed-lineage leukemia gene in infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the roles of AFF4 in the hypothalamus remain unclear. We show herein that expression of AFF4 increased upon addition of ghrelin and fasting in the growth hormone secretagogue receptor-expressing neurons of the hypothalamus. In the growth hormone secretagogue receptor-expressing hypothalamic neuronal cell line GT1-7, ghrelin markedly induced expression of AFF4 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of AFF4 in GT1-7 cells specifically induced expression of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α2 subunit but failed to induce other AMPK subunits and AMPK upstream kinases. The promoter activity of the AMPKα2 gene increased upon addition of AFF4, suggesting that AFF4 regulates transcription of the AMPKα2 gene. Additionally, AFF4 also increased the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACCα), a downstream target of AMPK. In GT1-7 cells, ghrelin phosphorylated ACCα through AMPKα phosphorylation in the early phase (15 min) of the activation. However, ghrelin-induced expression of AMPKα2 and phosphorylation of ACCα in the late phase (2 h) of the activation were independent of AMPKα phosphorylation. Attenuation of expression of AFF4 by its siRNA in GT1-7 cells decreased ghrelin-induced AMPKα2 expression and ACCα phosphorylation in the late phase of the activation. AFF4 may therefore help to maintain activation of AMPK downstream signaling under conditions of prolonged stimulation with ghrelin, such as during fasting.

https://openalex.org/W2091052724,"HemAT-Bs is a heme-based signal transducer protein responsible for aerotaxis. Time-resolved ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) studies of wild-type and Y70F mutant of the full-length HemAT-Bs and the truncated sensor domain were performed to determine the site-specific protein dynamics following carbon monoxide (CO) photodissociation. The UVRR spectra indicated two phases of intensity changes for Trp, Tyr, and Phe bands of both full-length and sensor domain proteins. The W16 and W3 Raman bands of Trp, the F8a band of Phe, and the Y8a band of Tyr increased in intensity at hundreds of nanoseconds after CO photodissociation, and this was followed by recovery in ∼50 μs. These changes were assigned to Trp-132 (G-helix), Tyr-70 (B-helix), and Phe-69 (B-helix) and/or Phe-137 (G-helix), suggesting that the change in the heme structure drives the displacement of B- and G-helices. The UVRR difference spectra of the sensor domain displayed a positive peak for amide I in hundreds of nanoseconds after photolysis, which was followed by recovery in ∼50 μs. This difference band was absent in the spectra of the full-length protein, suggesting that the isolated sensor domain undergoes conformational changes of the protein backbone upon CO photolysis and that the changes are restrained by the signaling domain. The time-resolved difference spectrum at 200 μs exhibited a pattern similar to that of the static (reduced - CO) difference spectrum, although the peak intensities were much weaker. Thus, the rearrangements of the protein moiety toward the equilibrium ligand-free structure occur in a time range of hundreds of microseconds."
https://openalex.org/W2057943246,"With the aim to develop an efficient and cost-effective approach to control malaria, we have generated porcine parvovirus-like particles (PPV-VLPs) carrying the CD8+ T cell epitope (SYVPSAEQI) of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein from Plasmodium yoelii fused to the PPV VP2 capsid protein (PPV-PYCS), and tested in prime/boost protocols with poxvirus vectors for efficacy in a rodent malaria model. As a proof-of concept, we have characterized the anti-CS CD8+ T cell response elicited by these hybrid PPV-VLPs in BALB/c mice after immunizations with the protein PPV-PYCS administered alone or in combination with recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV) vectors from the Western Reserve (WR) and modified virus Ankara (MVA) strains expressing the entire P. yoelii CS protein. The results of different immunization protocols showed that the combination of PPV-PYCS prime/poxvirus boost was highly immunogenic, inducing specific CD8+ T cell responses to CS resulting in 95% reduction in liver stage parasites two days following sporozoite challenge. In contrast, neither the administration of PPV-PYCS alone nor the immunization with the vectors given in the order poxvirus/VLPs was as effective. The immune profile induced by VLPs/MVA boost was associated with polyfunctional and effector memory CD8+ T cell responses. These findings highlight the use of recombinant parvovirus PPV-PYCS particles as priming agents and poxvirus vectors, like MVA, as booster to enhance specific CD8+ T cell responses to Plasmodium antigens and to control infection. These observations are relevant in the design of T cell-inducing vaccines against malaria."
https://openalex.org/W1963893690,"Interferon alpha (IFNα) therapy, despite good efficacy in curing HCV infection, leads to major side effects, in particular inducement of a strong peripheral T-cell lymphocytopenia. We here analyze the early consequences of IFNα therapy on both thymic function and peripheral T-cell homeostasis in patients in the acute or chronic phase of HCV-infection as well as in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The evolution of T-cell subsets and T-cell homeostasis were estimated by flow cytometry while thymic function was measured through quantification of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and estimation of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation during the first four months following the initiation of IFNα therapy. Beginning with the first month of therapy, a profound lymphocytopenia was observed for all T-cell subsets, including naïve T-cells and recent thymic emigrants (RTE), associated with inhibition of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation. Interleukin (IL)-7 plasma concentration rapidly dropped while lymphocytopenia progressed. This was neither a consequence of higher consumption of the cytokine nor due to its neutralization by soluble CD127. Decrease in IL-7 plasma concentration under IFNα therapy correlated with the decline in HCV viral load, thymic activity and RTE concentration in blood. These data demonstrate that IFNα-based therapy rapidly impacts on thymopoiesis and, consequently, perturbs T-cell homeostasis. Such a side effect might be detrimental for the continuation of IFNα therapy and may lead to an increased level of infectious risk, in particular in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Altogether, this study suggests the therapeutic potential of IL-7 in the maintenance of peripheral T-cell homeostasis in IFNα-treated patients."
https://openalex.org/W2078672012,"In the human neoplastic cell lines 5637 and HeLa, recombinant CXCL12 elicited, as expected, downstream signals via both G-protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent pathways responsible for inducing a rapid and a late wave, respectively, of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, the structural variant [N33A]CXCL12 triggered no β-arrestin-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and signaled via G protein-dependent pathways alone. Both CXCL12 and [N33A]CXCL12, however, generated signals that transinhibited HER1 phosphorylation via intracellular pathways. 1) Prestimulation of CXCR4/HER1-positive 5637 or HeLa cells with CXCL12 modified the HB-EGF-dependent activation of HER1 by delaying the peak phosphorylation of tyrosine 1068 or 1173. 2) Prestimulation with the synthetic variant [N33A]CXCL12, while preserving CXCR4-related chemotaxis and CXCR4 internalization, abolished HER1 phosphorylation. 3) In cells knockdown of β-arrestin 2, CXCL12 induced a full inhibition of HER1 like [N33A]CXCL12 in non-silenced cells. 4) HER1 phosphorylation was restored as usual by inhibiting PCK, calmodulin or calcineurin, whereas the inhibition of CaMKII had no discernable effect. We conclude that both recombinant CXCL12 and its structural variant [N33A]CXCL12 may transinhibit HER1 via G-proteins/calmodulin/calcineurin, but [N33A]CXCL12 does not activate β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and retains a stronger inhibitory effect. Therefore, we demonstrated that CXCL12 may influence the magnitude and the persistence of signaling downstream of HER1 in turn involved in the proliferative potential of numerous epithelial cancer. In addition, we recognized that [N33A]CXCL12 activates preferentially G-protein-dependent pathways and is an inhibitor of HER1."
https://openalex.org/W2001209454,"Food is evaluated for various attributes. One of the key food evaluation domains is hedonicity. As food is consumed, its hedonic valence decreases (due to prolonged sensory stimulation) and hedonic habituation results. The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in food pleasantness ratings during consumption of a simple food by individuals without olfactory experience with food as compared to normosmics. 15 congenital anosmics and 15 normosmic controls were each presented with ten 10 g banana slices. Each was visually inspected, then smelled and chewed for ten seconds and subsequently rated for hedonicity on a 21-point scale. There was a significant difference in pleasantness ratings between congenital anosmics and controls (F(1, 26) = 6.71, p = .02) with the anosmics exhibiting higher ratings than the controls, a significant main repeated-measures effect on the ratings (F(1.85, 48) = 12.15, p<.001), which showed a decreasing trend over the course of consumption, as well as a significant portion*group interaction (F(1.85, 48) = 3.54, p = .04), with the anosmic participants experiencing a less pronounced decline. The results of the present explorative study suggest that over the course of consumption of a simple food, congenitally anosmic individuals experience differential patterns of appreciation of food as compared to normosmics. In this particular case, the decrease of hedonic valence was less pronounced in congenital anosmics."
https://openalex.org/W2060083954,"Legionella pneumophila has been shown to secrete a protease termed major secretory protein (Msp). This protease belongs to the M4 family of metalloproteases and shares 62.9% sequence similarity with pseudolysin (EC 3.4.24.26). With the aim of developing a specific enzymatic assay for the detection and quantification of Msp, the Fluofast substrate library was screened using both enzymes in parallel. Moreover, based on the crystal structure of pseudolysin, a model of the Msp structure was built. Screening of the peptide library identified a lead substrate specifically cleaved by Msp that was subsequently optimized by rational design. The proposed model for Msp is consistent with the enzymatic characteristics of the studied peptide substrates and provides new structural information useful for the characterization of the protease. This study leads to the identification of the first selective and high affinity substrate for Msp that is able to detect picomolar concentrations of the purified enzyme. The identified substrate could be useful for the development of a novel method for the rapid detection of Legionella."
