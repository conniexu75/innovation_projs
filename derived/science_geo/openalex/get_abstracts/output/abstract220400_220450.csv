We selected 1008 index cases, regardless of family history of cancer, and carried out molecular analysis across entire families. The lifetime risk of breast cancer among female mutation carriers was 82%, similar to risks in families with many cases. Risks appear to be increasing with time: Breast cancer risk by age 50 among mutation carriers born before 1940 was 24%, but among those born after 1940 it was 67%. Lifetime risks of ovarian cancer were 54% for BRCA1 and 23% for BRCA2 mutation carriers. Physical exercise and lack of obesity in adolescence were associated with significantly delayed breast cancer onset."

Here, we report that memory CD4 + Tcells are essential for this protection. Antibody-mediated depletion of CD4 + Tcells before reinfection of two immune chimpanzees resulted in persistent, low-level viremia despite functional intra-hepatic memory CD8 + Tcell responses. Incomplete control of HCV replication by memory CD8 + Tcells in the absence of adequate CD4 + Tcell help was associated with emergence of viral escape mutations in class I major histocompatibility complex–restricted epitopes and failure to resolve HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2024131694,"The carboxyl-terminal domain (BRCT) of the Breast Cancer Gene 1 (BRCA1) protein is an evolutionarily conserved module that exists in a large number of proteins from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Although most BRCT domain–containing proteins participate in DNA-damage checkpoint or DNA-repair pathways, or both, the function of the BRCT domain is not fully understood. We show that the BRCA1 BRCT domain directly interacts with phosphorylated BRCA1-Associated Carboxyl-terminal Helicase (BACH1). This specific interaction between BRCA1 and phosphorylated BACH1 is cell cycle regulated and is required for DNA damage–induced checkpoint control during the transition from G 2 to M phase of the cell cycle. Further, we show that two other BRCT domains interact with their respective physiological partners in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thirteen additional BRCT domains also preferentially bind phospho-peptides rather than nonphosphorylated control peptides. These data imply that the BRCT domain is a phospho-protein binding domain involved in cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2051636768,"The clay montmorillonite is known to catalyze the polymerization of RNA from activated ribonucleotides. Here we report that montmorillonite accelerates the spontaneous conversion of fatty acid micelles into vesicles. Clay particles often become encapsulated in these vesicles, thus providing a pathway for the prebiotic encapsulation of catalytically active surfaces within membrane vesicles. In addition, RNA adsorbed to clay can be encapsulated within vesicles. Once formed, such vesicles can grow by incorporating fatty acid supplied as micelles and can divide without dilution of their contents by extrusion through small pores. These processes mediate vesicle replication through cycles of growth and division. The formation, growth, and division of the earliest cells may have occurred in response to similar interactions with mineral particles and inputs of material and energy."
https://openalex.org/W1989883893,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) provides an essential component of immunity to tuberculosis by activating infected host macrophages to directly inhibit the replication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). IFN-gamma-inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) is considered a principal effector mechanism, although other pathways may also exist. Here, we identify one member of a newly emerging 47-kilodalton (p47) guanosine triphosphatase family, LRG-47, that acts independently of NOS2 to protect against disease. Mice lacking LRG-47 failed to control Mtb replication, unlike those missing the related p47 guanosine triphosphatases IRG-47 or IGTP. Defective bacterial killing in IFN-gamma-activated LRG-47-/- macrophages was associated with impaired maturation of Mtb-containing phagosomes, vesicles that otherwise recruited LRG-47 in wild-type cells. Thus, LRG-47 may serve as a critical vacuolar trafficking component used to dispose of intracellular pathogens like Mtb."
https://openalex.org/W2038260399,"We used a proteomic approach to identify phosphopeptide-binding modules mediating signal transduction events in the DNA damage response pathway. Using a library of partially degenerate phosphopeptides, we identified tandem BRCT (BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal) domains in PTIP (Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein) and in BRCA1 as phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-specific binding modules that recognize substrates phosphorylated by the kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia- and RAD3-related) in response to gamma-irradiation. PTIP tandem BRCT domains are responsible for phosphorylation-dependent protein localization into 53BP1- and phospho-H2AX (gamma-H2AX)-containing nuclear foci, a marker of DNA damage. These findings provide a molecular basis for BRCT domain function in the DNA damage response and may help to explain why the BRCA1 BRCT domain mutation Met1775 --> Arg, which fails to bind phosphopeptides, predisposes women to breast and ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2079975199,"The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) has been attributed to a rapid rise in greenhouse gas levels. If so, warming should have occurred at all latitudes, although amplified toward the poles. Existing records reveal an increase in high-latitude sea surface temperatures (SSTs) (8° to 10°C) and in bottom water temperatures (4° to 5°C). To date, however, the character of the tropical SST response during this event remains unconstrained. Here we address this deficiency by using paired oxygen isotope and minor element (magnesium/calcium) ratios of planktonic foraminifera from a tropical Pacific core to estimate changes in SST. Using mixed-layer foraminifera, we found that the combined proxies imply a 4° to 5°C rise in Pacific SST during the PETM. These results would necessitate a rise in atmospheric pCO 2 to levels three to four times as high as those estimated for the late Paleocene."
https://openalex.org/W2085685430,"Paracaspase (MALT1), a member of an evolutionarily conserved superfamily of caspase-like proteins, has been shown to bind and colocalize with the protein Bcl10 in vitro and, because of this association, has been suggested to be involved in the CARMA1-Bcl10 pathway of antigen-induced nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. We demonstrate that primary T and B lymphocytes from paracaspase-deficient mice are defective in antigen-receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation, cytokine production, and proliferation. Paracaspase acts downstream of Bcl10 to induce NF-kappaB activation and is required for the normal development of B cells, indicating that paracaspase provides the missing link between Bcl10 and activation of the IkappaB kinase complex."
https://openalex.org/W2061355448,"Lack of efficient access to collections of synthetic compounds that have skeletal diversity is a key bottleneck in the small-molecule discovery process. We report a synthesis strategy that involves transforming substrates with different appendages that pre-encode skeletal information, named sigma elements, into products that have different skeletons with the use of common reaction conditions. With this approach, split-pool synthesis can be used to pre-encode skeletal diversity combinatorially and thereby generate such small molecules very efficiently. A split-pool synthesis of more than 1000 compounds produced overlapping, combinatorial matrices of molecular skeletons and appended building blocks in both enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms."
https://openalex.org/W1966397403,"If today's surface traffic fleet were powered entirely by hydrogen fuel cell technology, anthropogenic emissions of the ozone precursors nitrogen oxide (NO x ) and carbon monoxide could be reduced by up to 50%, leading to significant improvements in air quality throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Model simulations of such a scenario predict a decrease in global OH and an increased lifetime of methane, caused primarily by the reduction of the NO x emissions. The sign of the change in climate forcing caused by carbon dioxide and methane depends on the technology used to generate the molecular hydrogen. A possible rise in atmospheric hydrogen concentrations is unlikely to cause significant perturbations of the climate system."
https://openalex.org/W1980451446,"Prior work demonstrates that AKT activity regulates sensitivity of cells to G1 arrest induced by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as rapamycin and CCI-779. To investigate this, a novel high-throughput microarray polysome analysis was performed to identify genes whose mRNA translational efficiency was differentially affected following mTOR inhibition. The analysis also allowed the assessment of steady-state transcript levels. We identified two transcripts, cyclin D1 and c-myc, which exhibited differential expression in an AKT-dependent manner: High levels of activated AKT resulted in rapamycin-induced down-regulation of expression, whereas low levels resulted in up-regulation of expression. To ectopically express these proteins we exploited the finding that the p27kip1 mRNA was efficiently translated in the face of mTOR inhibition irrespective of AKT activity. Thus, the p27kip1 5′-untranslated region was fused to the cyclin D1 and c-myc coding regions and these constructs were expressed in cells. In transfected cells, expression of cyclin D1 or c-myc was not decreased by rapamycin. Most importantly, this completely converted sensitive cells to a phenotype resistant to G1 arrest. Furthermore, the AKT-dependent differential expression patterns of these two genes was also observed in a mouse xenograft model following in vivo treatment with CCI-779. These results identify two critical downstream molecular targets whose expression is regulated by AKT activity and whose down-regulation is required for rapamycin/CCI-779 sensitivity.

Drugs that specifically inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 1The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; p70S6K, p70/p85 ribosomal S6 kinase; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol-3′ kinase; PDK-1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; AKT, anti-phospho-Akt/protein kinase B; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; UTR, untranslated region; ANOVA, analysis of variance. are currently being developed as potential anti-tumor agents. mTOR is a critical protein that integrates signals that link the ability of cells to undergo cell cycle transit to the availability of nutrients in their immediate environment (1.Abraham R.T.

By inhibiting mTOR, these drugs essentially trick the cell into believing that conditions are not appropriate for cell cycle progression to ensue and induce G1 arrest. Rapamycin is the prototype mTOR inhibitor and CCI-779, a recently developed analog of rapamycin, is currently in clinical trials for cancer patients. mTOR activation is mediated by upstream signals from the phosphatidylinositol-3′kinase(PI3-K)/3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1)/AKT cascade. mTOR activity, in turn, results in phosphorylation of the p70S6 kinase (p70) and 4E-BP1 translational repressor (5.Sonenberg N.

Phosphorylation of p70 is critical for ribosome biogenesis, and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 disrupts its interaction with the eIF-4E translation initiation factor, allowing eIF-4E to participate in assembly of a translation initiation complex (eIF-4F). In this complex, eIF-4E binds to the cap structure at the 5′-end of mRNAs, which promotes ribosome recruitment to mRNAs and the initiation of translation. By up-regulating the components of the protein synthetic machinery and cap-dependent translation, both of these mTOR-dependent phosphorylation events lead to translation of proteins required for cell cycle transit. Because malignant clones frequently demonstrate up-regulation of the PI3-K/PDK-1/AKT/mTOR pathway (9.Cheng J.Q. Ruggeri B. Klein W.M. Sonoda G. Altomare D.A. Watson D.K. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3532-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective as they target this pathway. In keeping with this notion, high levels of AKT activity, whether due to PTEN mutation or introduction of activated AKT alleles, result in hypersensitivity to CCI-779-induced G1 arrest (13.Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J. Wu H. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10314-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). At first glance, this correlation is intuitive because AKT activity is an indicator of activation through the PI3-K/PDK-1/AKT pathway, and this pathway is an upstream stimulator of mTOR function. However, mTOR inhibition should result in inhibition of ribosome biogenesis and cap-dependent translation in all cells, irrespective of AKT activity, and, in fact, cells with lower levels of basal activity (i.e. those with less stimulation through AKT to mTOR) might be more susceptible to rapamycin-induced decreases in mTOR activity below a specific threshold. The critical cytostatic effect of mTOR inhibitors is theoretically a reduction in cap-dependent translation of cell cycle proteins. Thus, a second possible explanation for the regulatory role of AKT might be that it can regulate the ability of cells to maintain levels of these proteins by controlling their translation through cap-independent mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we screened the translational state of >5,000 mRNAs, using the methodology of Zong et al. (14.Zong Q. Schummer M. Hood L. Morris D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10632-10636Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our results identified two potentially critical mRNAs for cell cycle transit, that of cyclin D1 and c-myc, whose translational response to mTOR inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo were remarkably regulated by the degree of AKT activation. Further studies confirmed that the differential effects on the expression of these proteins determined sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors. Cell Culture and Plasmids—U87 and LAPC-4 parental cell lines were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained as described previously (13.Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J. Wu H. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10314-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). They were subsequently stably transfected using retroviral constructs with a wild-type PTEN gene to generate U87PTEN and a constitutively active AKT allele to generate LAPC-4AKT as described previously (13.Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J. Wu H. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10314-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing p27-IRES-EGFP, p27-IRES-cyclin D1 and p27-IRES-myc mRNAs were constructed using pcDNA3 as the backbone vector. The 5′-UTR of p27kip1 containing the 365 nucleotide IRES was PCR amplified from IMAGE clone 4298338 and inserted immediately upstream of the cyclin D1 open reading frame in pcDNA3. The c-myc open reading frame was amplified from pBABEpuro (a gift from D. Felsher, Stanford University) and subcloned into pcDNA3. Subsequently the p27kip1 5′-UTR was inserted immediately upstream of c-myc. Lastly, the EGFP open reading frame was subcloned into pcDNA3 and the p27kip1 5′-UTR ligated immediately upstream. Plasmids were sequenced at all junction points to ensure that they were properly generated. Polysome and Microarray Analysis—Extraction and display of polysomes was performed as previously described (15.Ruan H.J. Brown C.Y. Morris D.R. Richter J.D. Analysis of mRNA Formation and Function. Academic Press, New York1997: 305-321Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide at 4 °C. Following removal of nuclei and mitochondria, supernatants were layered onto 15–50% sucrose gradients and spun at 38,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a SW 40 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Centrifuged gradients were fractionated into eleven 1-ml fractions using an ISCO Density Gradient Fractionator at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The polysome profile of the gradient was monitored via UV absorbance at 260 nm. RNA from individual fractions was extracted using phenol/chloroform following incubation with proteinase K and precipitated. RNA was then either processed for Northern blots or used to generate labeled cDNA. Prior to hybridization to cDNA arrays, polysomal and monosomal RNA was reverse transcribed (SuperScript RTII, Invitrogen) in the presence of Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP, respectively. Custom spotted arrays containing >6000 array elements were hybridized with the labeled cDNA for 16 h at 42 °C, washed, and then scanned using an Axon DNA array scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Raw images were quantified using GenePix 3.2 (Axon Instruments) and the data analyzed using the GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) software package. Data were normalized using the Lowess method contained in GeneSpring. The change in translation state for a given mRNA was defined as the ratio of polysomal RNA to monosomal RNA signal intensities after rapamycin treatment divided by the ratio of polysomal RNA to monosomal RNA signal intensities under normal conditions (culture without rapamycin). A value of greater than 1 indicates that the mRNA moved from the monosomal to the polysomal fractions upon rapamycin treatment. If the ratio was less than 1, the value was inverted and a negative number was used to indicate a change in the reverse direction, indicating a shift for a given mRNA from polysomal to monosomal fractions. K-means cluster analysis of the data was done using algorithms included in GeneSpring (16.Knudsen S. A Biologists Guide to Analysis of DNA Microarray Data. Wiley, New York2002: 43-44Google Scholar). Effects of Ectopic Cyclin D1/c-myc Expression—Transient transfections were performed using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) using 5 μg of plasmid containing p27-IRES-EGFP, 5.5 μg of plasmid containing p27-IRES-cyclin D1, or 5.5 μg of plasmid containing p27-IRES-myc. In groups where both IRES-containing cyclin D1 and c-myc plasmids were transfected only 2.75 μg of each plasmid were used. To measure GFP expression and DNA content, cells were first fixed in 2% buffered formaldehyde (Polysciences) and then permeabilized with 70% ethanol at –20 °C followed by propidium iodine staining. Texas Red-conjugated cyclin D1 antibody and Alexa 350-conjugated c-myc antibody were used for staining (Molecular Probes). Data were acquired and analyzed on FACScalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). RNA and Protein Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) or Trizol (Invitrogen) reagent. Denatured RNA was separated using 1.4% agarose gels containing 440 mm formaldehyde, transferred to positively charged membranes (Roche Applied Science), cross-linked by UV irradiation (Stratalinker, Stratagene), and hybridized at 65 °C in 1 m NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 0.01% salmon sperm DNA. Radioactive probes were generated by PCR amplification. Blots were analyzed by autoradiography followed by densitometry or using a PhosphorImager. Western blots were performed using standard procedures. Briefly, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were resolved by 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF (0.2 μm) membranes and probed with antibodies to the following proteins: cyclin D1 (BD Pharmingen), c-myc (clone 9E11, Upstate Biotechnology), 4E-BP1 (gift from N. Sonenberg, McGill University), actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-p70 (Ser-235/236), p70, phospho-AKT (Ser-473), AKT, phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and ERK were all from Cell Signaling Technologies. Blots were then incubated in appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and then detected using ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences). Cytotoxicity and Cell Cycle Analysis—For testing cell survival, viable recovery was determined by MTT assays as previously described (17.Xu F.H. Sharma S. Gardner A. Tu Y. Raitano A. Sawyers C. Lichtenstein A. Blood. 1998; 92: 241-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cycle phase distributions were determined by flow cytometry on propidium iodine stained cells. Mouse Xenograft Studies—Male SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with single cell suspensions of the four cell lines as described previously (13.Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J. Wu H. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10314-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Tumor growth was measured daily, and mice were randomized to CCI-779 versus vehicle when tumors reached 200 mm3. Treatment was given by intraperitoneal injection for 5 consecutive days, and tumors were harvested for Western analysis 6 h following the last injection. Tumor growth was assessed on day 8 or 12 after initiation of CCI-79 treatment. IC50 was determined by extrapolation of plots of percent growth inhibition by CCI-779 versus log concentration. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t test and ANOVA models using Sigma Stat 2.0 (Jandel Scientific). AKT Activity Regulates Sensitivity to mTOR Inhibitors both in Vitro and in Vivo—To investigate the mechanism by which AKT activity regulates sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, we studied two separate cell lines whose AKT activity was altered by transfection. The LAPC-4 line containing quiescent AKT was stably transfected with a constitutively active AKT allele and the U87MG glioblastoma cell line (termed U87 in this work), containing a mutated PTEN gene and resulting in heightened AKT activity, was transfected with a wild-type PTEN gene. LAPC-4 cells transfected with myristoylated AKT (termed LAPC-4AKT) had greatly increased expression of phosphorylated (activated) AKT compared with empty vector-transfected cells (LAPC-4puro), and U87 cells transfected with wild-type PTEN (U87PTEN) had significantly decreased expression compared with control U87 cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, levels of phosphorylated ERK were unaffected by transfection in both cell lines, attesting to the specificity of the altered AKT activity. The transfectants were then tested for sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 by cell cycle analysis (Fig. 1B). As shown, a clear differential sensitivity was demonstrated between the “high AKT” cell lines (U87 and LAPC-4AKT) versus their “low AKT” counterparts (U87PTEN and LAPC-4puro). The ID50 for decrease in S-phase distribution was 7.5–10 nm of CCI-779 for the sensitive U87 and LAPC-4AKT cell lines, whereas the U87PTEN and LAPC-4puro cell lines were completely resistant with no effect on S-phase distribution at any dose. There was no induction of apoptosis as detected by sub-G1 peak or annexin V staining (data not shown). To determine whether AKT activity could regulate sensitivity to CCI-779 in vivo, we examined the growth of the four cell lines in SCID mice. Tumor cells were injected subcutaneously, and mice were randomly assigned to treatment with CCI-779 at different doses when tumors reached 200 mm3 in size. Mice were treated with CCI-779 each day for five consecutive days, and at 8 and 12 days after initiation of treatment tumor growth was assessed. As shown in Fig. 1C, CCI-779 inhibited growth of all the cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion. However, the low AKT cell lines were relatively more resistant (IC50 values for U87PTEN and LAPC-4puro were 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively, when assessed at day 12) then their high AKT counterparts (IC50 values for U87 and LAPC-4AKT were 0.07 and 0.9 mg/kg, respectively). These results are consistent with previous work (13.Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J. Wu H. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10314-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) demonstrating the increased sensitivity of tumors containing high AKT activity to CCI-779 both in vitro and in vivo. Prior work with PTEN–/– and PTEN+/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts demonstrated that AKT-dependent differential sensitivity to CCI-779 was not due to differences in the ability of the drug to inhibit the mTOR pathway (13.Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J. Wu H. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10314-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). This was also true in our paired prostate and glioblastoma cell lines. p70 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were completely abrogated at 10 nm of CCI-779 in all four cell lines and the ED50 values did not differ between the high AKT and low AKT lines. AKT Activity Regulates the Translational State and Transcriptional Response of Specific mRNAs to mTOR Inhibition—By inhibiting p70 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, mTOR inhibitors prevent translation. Thus, another possible downstream determinant of sensitivity is differential effects on the translation of specific critical mRNAs. To investigate this hypothesis we utilized a high-throughput methodology whereby microarray analysis of mRNA translational state can be assessed. This technique is based on the observation that well translated transcripts are typically associated with polysomes, whereas poorly translated mRNAs are monosomal. Thus, the two pairs of LAPC-4 and U87 cell lines were treated with or without the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, for 6, 24, or 72 h and extracts prepared for polysomal analysis. Polysomes were then separated from monosomal material on sucrose gradients and the associated RNAs were extracted from gradient fractions. Gradient fractions corresponding to monosomal (fractions 1–4) and polysomal material (fractions 5–11) were pooled, and the RNA from these two groups was reverse transcribed separately to generate fluorescently labeled probes and hybridized to microarrays. The mRNA translation state for a given transcript was defined as the ratio of polysomal to monosomal signal intensity. The differences between these ratios in rapamycin-treated versus untreated cells gave an estimate of change in translational state (see “Experimental Procedures”). Transcripts for ∼3000 genes (48%) from the >6100 genes assessed were reproducibly detected in the four cell lines. We were able to identify 181 transcripts whose translational state changed dramatically and consistently over the course of the experiment. We identified a subset of 107 mRNAs whose translation was markedly inhibited (>2.5-fold inhibition) in both pairs of cell lines, irrespective of AKT activity, at all time points tested. When we analyzed the rapamycin-induced decreases in mRNA translation in more detail, we found that they were time-dependent with modest inhibition after 6 h of exposure and greater inhibition at 24 and 48 h (not shown). Transcripts whose translation is known to be inhibited by rapamycin were also inhibited in our analysis (18.Peng T. Golub T.R. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This subset included several ribosomal components and translation elongation factors. Furthermore, the recently reported inhibition of proteasomal subunit translation by rapamycin was also seen (19.Grolleau A. Bowman J. Pradet-Balade B. Puravs E. Hanash S. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Beretta L.

In contrast, there were 74 genes whose translational states significantly increased (>2.5-fold increase in mRNA translational state) upon exposure to rapamycin in all the cell lines tested. Grolleau et al. (19.Grolleau A. Bowman J. Pradet-Balade B. Puravs E. Hanash S. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Beretta L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22175-22184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) also reported that rapamycin increased the translation of a subset of mRNAs. This previously reported subset includes genes also identified in this analysis, such as cyclin F, Ets2 repressor factor, and Syk (see supplemental data). Fig. 2A demonstrates that the global changes in mRNA translational state induced by rapamycin was very similar in high AKT versus low AKT cell counterparts. The false-color images show the relative changes in translational state of the 181 genes (107 whose translation was inhibited and 74 whose translation was increased) clustered according to their expression profiles over time (6–48 h) following rapamycin treatment. It is clear that the general pattern of mRNA translational state changes due to rapamycin is quite similar among the four cell lines irrespective of AKT activity. However, in contrast to these comparable global alterations, we identified two mRNAs, cyclin D1, and c-myc, whose translation was markedly differentially regulated. These mRNAs were of particular interest because the degree to which they were differentially translated was more marked than any other interrogated mRNA, and they are also known to have prominent roles in cell cycle transit. When all detectable mRNAs were ranked by greatest degree of rapamycin-induced decrease in translation state in the high AKT lines, cyclin D1 and c-myc were first and second, respectively. Similarly, when all mRNAs were ranked in order of the greatest degree of rapamycin-induced increase in translational state in the low AKT lines, again cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNAs were first and second (see supplemental data). Fig. 2B shows the prominence of the differential alterations in translational state of these two mRNAs very clearly. The data represent changes obtained following a 48 h exposure to rapamycin, although a similar pattern was present following 24 and 72 h of exposure as well. As shown, in the high AKT cell lines (LAPC-4AKT, upper left panel, and U87, lower left panel) rapamycin repressed translation of cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNAs whereas, in the low AKT cell lines (LAPC-4puro, upper right panel, and U87PTEN, lower right panel), rapamycin enhanced their translation. In addition to translational state, a measure of total steady-state level of any mRNA could be obtained from these microarrays by summing the signal intensities of the polysomal and monosomal fractions. By this analysis, rapamycin had significant effects on mRNA expression in a small subset (63 genes) of the detectable genes (greater that 2.5-fold change), inhibiting transcription in 34 genes (54%) and enhancing transcription in 29 genes (31%). Again, our analysis confirmed the published finding (20.Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 21.Powers T. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 10 (987–1000)Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar) that the transcripts of many ribosomal components are inhibited by rapamycin. In general, these effects on transcription were comparable between high AKT and low AKT paired cell lines. However, in similar fashion to translation, rapamycin differentially regulated cyclin D1 and c-myc transcription, inhibiting it in high AKT lines and enhancing it in low AKT lines. These major alterations in translation and transcription of cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNAs are summarized in Fig. 2C. To confirm the results of the translational state microarray analysis, we performed Northern blot analysis on mRNAs associated with polysomes (well translated) versus monosomes (poorly translated) as separated by sucrose gradients. At the top of each series of Northern blots in Fig. 3 is shown the individual polysome profile obtained from each cell line during sucrose gradient fractionation. Northern blot analysis for cyclin D1, c-myc, and actin mRNA is shown below the profiles on total RNA isolated from the corresponding fractions of the sucrose gradient. Densitometric analysis of the signals obtained from the monosomal fractions (fractions 1–4) versus the polysomal fractions (fractions 5–11) allowed a calculation of percent mRNA found in polysome fractions (well translated) as shown to the right of the Northern blots. The differential regulation is very clear; in rapamycin-sensitive, high AKT cell lines (LAPCAKT or U87), rapamycin produces a marked shift in cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNA from polysome fractions (fractions 5–11) to monosome fractions (fractions 1–4), indicating a significant decrease in translational efficiency. In rapamycin-resistant, low AKT cell lines (LAPC4puro or U87PTEN), rapamycin induces an opposite response, increasing the percentage of cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNA found in polysome fractions versus monosome fractions. For example, the percent of cyclin D1 message associated with polysomes in U87 cells decreases from 45 to 8% after treatment with rapamycin. Likewise, the percent of c-myc message in polysomal fractions decreases from 39 to 4%. In contrast, rapamycin increases the percent of cyclin D1 mRNA associated with polysomes in U87PTEN cells from 27 to 67% and the percent of c-myc mRNA from 34 to 78%. As expected, in all cell lines regardless of AKT activity, rapamycin inhibits translation of actin (i.e. shift of actin mRNA from well translated polysomes to poorly translated monosomes). These data confirm the results of microarray analysis, namely that the level of AKT activity regulates the translational state response to rapamycin of cyclin D1 and c-myc. The Northern blots further confirm the assessment of total steady-state mRNA transcription from the microarrays. The relative amounts were determined by densitometry on equally exposed autoradiographs and summing the signals from monosome and polysome fractions (data not shown). Although the total amount of c-myc and cyclin D1 mRNA in all fractions (monosome + polysome fractions) is significantly decreased by rapamycin in LAPC4AKT and U87 cell lines (decreased by 35.3% for c-myc and 27.2% for cyclin D1 in LAPC-4AKT; decreased by 25.7% for c-myc and 31.3% for cyclin D1 in U87) the total c-myc and cyclin D1 mRNA is increased by rapamycin in resistant LAPC-4puro and U87PTEN cell lines (increased by 27.4% for c-myc and 32.8% for cyclin D1 in LAPC-4puro; increased by 31.7% for c-myc and 27.6% for cyclin D1 in U87PTEN). Western analysis of protein extracts obtained from the high AKT and low AKT cell lines prior to and following rapamycin exposure also demonstrated differential expression (Fig. 4A). Both cyclin D1 and c-myc protein levels decreased or became undetectable in the rapamycin-sensitive cell lines following exposure, whereas, in the resistant cell lines, the relative levels of both proteins increased upon rapamycin treatment. By densitometric analysis, cyclin D1 levels increased 3.5-fold in LAPC-4puro cells (3.5 ± 0.7, mean ± S.D. of three experiments) and 5.1-fold in U87PTEN cells. C-myc levels inc"

Here, we report activity-dependent remodeling of synapses by serum-inducible kinase (SNK). SNK was induced in hippocampal neurons by synaptic activity and was targeted to dendritic spines. SNK bound to and phosphorylated spine-associated Rap guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (SPAR), a postsynaptic actin regulatory protein, leading to degradation of SPAR. Induction of SNK in hippocampal neurons eliminated SPAR protein, depleted postsynaptic density-95 and Bassoon clusters, and caused loss of mature dendritic spines. These results implicate SNK as a mediator of activity-dependent change in the molecular composition and morphology of synapses."

The persistence of mesenchymal cells and the up-regulated expression/activation of TGF-β1 at sites of tissue injury and repair are associated with progressive fibrosis with subsequent organ dysfunction in diverse systems including the kidney, liver, and lung (14.Blobe G.C.

There is better understanding of the growth-inhibitory/pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β1 on immune cells (16.Brown T.L. Patil S. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Howe P.H. J. Biol.

In contrast to these “suppressive” functions, TGF-β1 generally promotes growth and survival of mesenchymal cells. Growth-promoting effects of TGF-β1 appear to be primarily mediated by indirect effects on the induction of mitogenic growth factor synthesis (18.Leof E.B. Proper J.A. Goustin A.S. Shipley G.D.

Anti-apoptotic effects of TGF-β1 on fibroblasts and myofibroblasts have been reported previously (21.Jelaska A. Korn J.H.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway regulates a number of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, cell motility, and apoptosis (24.Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Multiple targets of PKB/Akt mediate pro-survival/anti-apoptotic effects (reviewed in Ref. 25.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in response to TGF-β1 has been demonstrated in epithelial cells where it mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (26.Bakin A.V. Tomlinson A.K.

Moreover, activation of the PKB/Akt pathway has been demonstrated to “rescue” Hep3B cells from TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (28.Chen R.H. Su Y.H. Chuang R.L. Chang T.Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). There is limited information, however, on the role and regulation of this pathway by TGF-β1 in mesenchymal cells. TGF-β family members signal via heteromeric transmembrane complexes of type II and type I serine-threonine receptor kinases (1.Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 2.Roberts, A. B., and Derynck, R. (2001) Science's STKE http:/www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/PE43Google Scholar). The best known direct effectors of TGF-β receptor(s) signaling are the Smad proteins that, when activated, function as transcriptional regulators (1.Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). More recently, early post-receptor signaling via Smad-independent pathways have been increasingly recognized (2.Roberts, A. B., and Derynck, R. (2001) Science's STKE http:/www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/PE43Google Scholar). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) appears to be an important transducer of such responses (29.Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M. Fujisawa J. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K.

A direct link between activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and TGF-β receptor(s) activation appears to be through binding of X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (32.Yamaguchi K. Nagai S.

We hypothesized that activation of PI3K/Akt by TGF-β1 may induce an anti-apoptotic phenotype in mesenchymal cells/fibroblasts and that upstream activation of p38 MAPK may regulate this activity. This study was undertaken to determine effects of TGF-β1 on apoptotic susceptibility of primary cultures of untransformed human lung fibroblasts and the potential role of p38 MAPK-dependent PI3K-Akt activation in the expression of this phenotype. Research protocols involving human subjects received prior approval by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan. Lung mesenchymal cells were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage from adult patients with respiratory failure due to acute lung injury (ALI) (35.Ware L.B. Matthay M.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1334-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and fungizone (Invitrogen); medium was changed every 2 days. Studies were performed on passage 3-5 of a morphologically homogeneous population of spindle-shaped cells that uniformly stained positive for the fibroblast marker, prolyl 4-hydroxylase (36.Janin A. Konttinen Y.T. Gronblad M. Karhunen P. Gosset D. Malmstrom M. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1990; 8: 237-242PubMed Google Scholar). Normal human fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR-90; Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) were cultured under similar conditions, and studies were performed at passage 5-9. Cells were plated on 60-mm cell culture dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/dish or on 96-well ELISA cell culture plates at a density of 15,000 cells per well and incubated in 5% CO2, 95% air. When cells reached 80% confluence, they were growth-arrested for 48 h in DMEM with 0.01% FBS prior to treatment. Porcine-derived TGF-β1 was obtained from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. SB203580, SP600125, wortmannin, and Y-27632 were from Calbiochem. PD98059 and LY294002 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-ATF-2 (Thr-71), total Akt, and total p38 MAP kinase were from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse monoclonal antibody to phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) was from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to phospho-Smad2 (Ser-465/467) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Goat polyclonal antibody to total Smad2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to α-smooth muscle actin and β-actin were obtained from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibody to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against activated caspase 3 were from Chemicon International, Temecula, CA. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Pierce. All other reagents including suramin were from Sigma. The mammalian expression plasmids, pcDNA3-HA-p38 (wild type), pcDNA3-p38-KM (kinase mutant), and pcDNA3-MKK3, were provided by Dr. Kun Liang Guan, Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Plasmid transfections of IMR-90 cells using the cationic lipid reagent LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) were performed according the manufacturer's instructions. The optimal ratio of DNA (μg) to LipofectAMINE (μl) was determined to be ∼1:5 for IMR-90 cells. Cells were incubated with DNA-lipid complexes in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) for 4-5 h prior to introducing 10% FBS for 16-20 h. The next day, transfection medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and geneticin (Invitrogen). Geneticin concentrations were 400 μg/ml for selection of stable transfectants and 200 μg/ml as a maintenance dose in cell cultures prior to performing experiments. Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analyses performed as described previously (37.Thannickal V.J. Aldweib K.D. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23611-23615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In vitro p38 MAP kinase activity was measured using a nonradioactive assay obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA. Immobilized antibody to phospho-p38 MAPK was added to 200 μg of whole cell lysates in RIPA buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. This was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed and the pellet washed three times with lysis buffer and kinase buffer as per the manufacturer's protocol. The pellet was then suspended in kinase buffer supplemented with ATP and an ATF-2 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with 6× SDS sample buffer, and the samples were boiled, vortexed, and centrifuged. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an antibody to phospho-ATF-2. ELISA for ssDNA—Apoptosis was quantitated with the use of an ELISA-based assay for ssDNA (Apoptosis ELISA Kit, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with minor modifications (38.Frankfurt O.S. Krishan A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 253: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded directly into 96-well cell culture plates, grown to 80% confluence, growth-arrested for 48 h, and then treated with or without TGF-β1 in the presence of 10% FBS or under serum-deprived conditions for another 120 h. Prior to the assay, the 96-well plate was centrifuged for 5 min. The medium was removed, and cells were fixed to the plate with 80% methanol. The methanol was then removed, and the plate was dried in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min, after which 50 μl of formamide was added to each well for 10 min at room temperature followed by 10 min in a 75 °C water bath. After cooling, the formamide was removed, and 200 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin was added to each well for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. The blocking solution was then removed, and 50 μl of mouse monoclonal anti-ssDNA antibody (1:100) was added to each well for 30 min. After washing, 200 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was added for 30 min. After repeat washing, 100 μl of 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid solution was added to each well for 30 min followed by “stop solution” supplied by the manufacturer. Absorbance was read with an ELISA plate reader at 405 nm. The “background” absorbance of cells receiving no primary antibody was subtracted, and a relative apoptosis index calculated by dividing the corrected absorbance by cell counts (measured by Coulter counter) was obtained prior to fixing the cells. Activated Caspase 3/Immunofluorescence Staining—Activated caspase 3 was detected by immunofluorescence staining of fixed cells. Briefly, IMR-90 cells plated on 35 mm of tissue culture were grown to 50% confluence and growth-arrested in medium containing 0.01% serum for 48 h prior to treatments for defined times. Cells were then fixed in 5% formaldehyde and washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to permeabilization and after each subsequent step. Permeabilization was performed in buffer consisting of 0.1% Triton in 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 90 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 75 mm KCl. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min prior to the addition of antibody to activated caspase 3 (1:25 dilution) for 1 h followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:40 dilution) for 1 h. Counterstaining was with DAPI for nuclear staining, and cells were visualized and photographed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance with Bonferonni post test using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego (www.graphpad.com). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed using the public domain NIH Image program available on the internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image. TGF-β1 Protects Human Lung Mesenchymal Cells/Fibroblasts from Serum Deprivation-induced Apoptosis—Adult mesenchymal cells, particularly when isolated from injured tissues, often represent a variably heterogeneous population of cells; moreover, there may be differences in cellular phenotypes and responsiveness between adult and fetal fibroblasts/mesenchymal cells. Therefore, we examined the effects of TGF-β1 on mesenchymal cells isolated both from adult patients with acute lung injury (ALI-MC) and on normal human fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR-90). Spontaneous rates of apoptosis in the presence of serum were slightly higher in ALI-MC than in IMR-90 cells (Fig. 1). Serum deprivation for 5 days increased apoptotic rates in both groups. Treatment of serum-deprived cells with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) reduced apoptotic rates in ALI-MC and IMR-90 cells by 50 and 48%, respectively (Fig. 1). Interestingly, TGF-β1 also protected against spontaneous apoptosis (in the presence of serum) in ALI-MC cells (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that TGF-β1 is able to induce cellular resistance against both spontaneous and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in different fibroblasts/mesenchymal cells, including heterogeneous adult mesenchymal cells (ALI-MC) and more homogeneous cultures of untransformed, human fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR-90). TGF-β1 Induces Early Activation of the Smad and p38 MAPK Followed by Delayed Activation of the PI3K-Akt Pathway in Lung Fibroblasts—The PI3K-Akt pathway is known to transduce signals critical for cell survival (24.Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 25.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). To determine whether the pro-survival/anti-apoptotic effects of TGF-β1 on fibroblasts may, at least in part, be attributed to this pathway, we examined the effects of TGF-β1 on PKB/Akt activation. In both ALI-MC and IMR-90 cells, phosphorylation of PKB/Akt was observed as early as 3-6 h following TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) treatment with peak effects at 12 h (Fig. 2). Peak effects at 12 h were completely inhibited by treatment with LY294002 (10 μm) or wortmannin (1 μm) for 2 h prior to cell lysis (data not shown). TGF-β1-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation was sustained for 24 h and decreased significantly by 48 h following treatment (Fig. 2). The delayed responses in PKB/Akt phosphorylation suggested that other more proximal TGF-β1 signals mediate this effect. Rapid signaling from TGF-β receptor(s) activation is best recognized to occur by the Smad proteins (1.Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest the involvement of Smad-independent pathways involving p38 MAPK (2.Roberts, A. B., and Derynck, R. (2001) Science's STKE http:/www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/PE43Google Scholar, 30.Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Moreover, p38 MAPK appears to mediate PKB/Akt activation in mouse epithelial cells exposed to UV light (39.Nomura M. Kaji A. He Z. Ma W.Y. Miyamoto K. Yang C.S. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46624-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether p38 MAPK is rapidly activated in response to TGF-β1 in lung fibroblasts, we assessed the phosphorylated (activated) state of p38 MAPK and compared it with that of Smad2 phosphorylation. Fig. 3 demonstrates that both p38 MAPK and Smad2 are activated within 10 min of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) stimulation. Peak activation of these responses to TGF-β1 is observed at 1 h. These results demonstrate that the p38 MAPK pathway is activated rapidly in response to TGF-β1, with similar kinetics to that of Smad2 phosphorylation, and suggested that PKB/Akt phosphorylation might be mediated via p38 MAPK. Pharmacological Inhibition of p38 MAPK Blocks TGF-β1-induced PKB/Akt Phosphorylation—To determine whether early p38 MAPK activation is necessary for the more delayed activation of PKB/Akt, we examined the effect of various protein kinase inhibitors on TGF-β1-mediated PKB/Akt phosphorylation. In both ALI-MC and IMR-90 cells, blockade of the ERK-1/2 MAPK pathway with the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059 (20 μm), had little effect on PKB/Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4). In contrast, the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (6 μm), completely inhibited TGF-β1-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation to below base-line levels in both ALI-MC and IMR-90 cells (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained when the effects of TGF-β1 were examined separately at 12 and 24 h after treatment (data not shown). An inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SP600125, 100 nm) more modestly attenuated the induction of PKB/Akt phosphorylation by 48% in ALI-MC and 27% in IMR-90 cells (Fig. 4). In the presence of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (10 μm), PKB/Akt phosphorylation was virtually undetectable in IMR-90 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Similarly, wortmannin (1 μm) reduced PKB/Akt phosphorylation to about 50% of control levels in ALI-MC (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 (15 nm), inhibited PKB/Akt phosphorylation to a greater degree in ALI-MC than in IMR-90 cells. Overall, these results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway reliably and consistently blocks TGF-β1-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation; more variable and apparently cell-specific responses are observed with an inhibitor of Rho kinase. Protein kinase inhibitors may exert non-specific effects, particularly at higher concentrations (40.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). SB203580 may directly inhibit PKB/Akt, although the IC50 values are 100-500-fold higher than for p38 MAPK (40.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). In vitro assays indicate that at a concentration of 10 μm, SB203580 almost completely inhibits p38 MAPK activity (98%), whereas PKB/Akt is inhibited by about 38% (40.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). To define better effective concentrations at which SB203580 inhibits TGF-β1-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation, we performed a dose-response study by co-treating cells with increasing doses (0.6, 3, 6, and 18 μm) of SB203580 and TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml for 12 h). Fig. 5 demonstrates dose-dependent inhibition of TGF-β1-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation. An ∼50% inhibition was noted at 3 μm, and complete inhibition was achieved at 6 μm; at 18 μm, there was additional inhibition of the base-line levels of PKB/Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Moreover, 6 μm SB203580 alone (in the absence of TGF-β1) had no effect on base-line PKB/Akt phosphorylation in these cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that the observed blockade of TGF-β1 stimulated PKB/Akt phosphorylation is more likely related to inhibitory effects of SB203580 on upstream p38 MAPK activation than to more direct effects of this compound on PKB/Akt. PKB/Akt Phosphorylation by TGF-β1 Is Dependent on Functional p38 MAPK Activation—To address further the role of p38 MAPK activation in TGF-β1-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation, we generated stable cell lines of IMR-90 cells expressing a kinase-deficient/mutant p38 MAPK (p38-KM), a constitutively active MKK3 (MKK3), and control (pcDNA, empty vector) plasmid constructs. TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml for 1 h) induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in all cell lines (Fig. 6A, top panel). However, p38 MAPK activity measured by in vitro phosphorylation of ATF-2 was not induced in p38-KM cells at the same time point (Fig. 6A, upper middle panel), consistent with functionally inactive p38 MAPK in these cells. Overexpression of MKK3 did not appear to augment further the ATF-2 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1, and basal levels appeared to be lower than control pcDNA cells. The pattern of ATF-2 phosphorylation/p38 activity closely correlated with PKB/Akt phosphorylation induced by TGF-β1 in all cell lines. Importantly, TGF-β1-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation was completely inhibited in p38-KM cells (Fig. 6A, lower middle panel, and B). Moreover, the activation of this pathway appears to be less important for TGF-β1-induced α-smooth muscle cell actin, a marker of myofibroblast differentiation, because this response is preserved in p38-KM cells (Fig. 6A, lower panel). These results indicate that activation of p38 MAPK by TGF-β1 is required for the induction of PKB/Akt and suggest that activation of this pathway may be relatively more specific for pro-survival signaling than for myofibroblast differentiation-inducing effects of TGF-β1.

Using a combination of chemical synthesis and protein engineering, we generated and crystallized the monoprenylated Ypt1:RabGDI complex. The structure of the complex was solved to 1.5 angstrom resolution and provides a structural basis for the ability of RabGDI to inhibit the release of nucleotide by Rab proteins. Isoprenoid binding requires a conformational change that opens a cavity in the hydrophobic core of its domain II.

https://openalex.org/W2021383412,"Two novel estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) mRNA isoforms that diverge in their 5'-untranslated regions, ERbeta mRNA (0K-1) and ERbeta mRNA (0N-1), have recently been identified. This indicates that transcription of the human ERbeta gene occurs from at least two different promoters, named promoter 0K and promoter 0N. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of ERbeta isoforms in primary cultures of normal breast epithelial cells, a panel of breast cancer cell lines and in normal breast and breast cancer tissues; and to examine whether methylation of the two ERbeta promoters is involved in regulation of ERbeta gene expression. Using quantitative real-time PCR techniques, we found that ERbeta mRNA levels were significantly lower in breast cancer cell lines than in primary cultures of normal breast epithelial cells. Bisulfite genomic sequencing analysis revealed that two promoters of the ERbeta gene exhibit distinct methylation patterns. Promoter 0N was unmethylated in normal breast epithelial cells, but extensively methylated in breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, promoter 0K was unmethylated in both normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. We demonstrated a significant correlation between promoter 0N hypermethylation and loss of ERbeta mRNA expression in breast cancer cell lines. Treatment of breast cancer cells with demethylating agent effectively reactivated the expression of ERbeta mRNA. The observations from the cell lines were also reflected in primary breast cancer tumors. Thus, expression of ERbeta mRNA in breast tumors was found to be inversely associated with the degree of methylation of promoter 0N. Our results suggest that a decreased level of ERbeta mRNA may be associated with breast tumorigenesis, and that DNA methylation is an important mechanism for ERbeta gene silencing in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2015422162,"Islet transplantation is a promising therapy for Type 1 diabetes, but many attempts have failed due to early graft hypoxia or immune rejection, which generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the current study, we determined that transgenic overexpression of the antioxidant metallothionein (MT) in pancreatic beta cells provided broad resistance to oxidative stress by scavenging most kinds of ROS including H2O2, peroxynitrite radical released from streptozotocin, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), and superoxide radical produced by xanthine/xanthine oxidase. MT also reduced nitric oxide-induced beta cell death. A direct test of hypoxia/reperfusion sensitivity was made by exposing FVB and MT islets to hypoxia (1% O2). MT markedly reduced ROS production and improved islet cell survival. Because MT protected beta cells from a broad spectrum of ROS and from hypoxia, we considered it to be an ideal candidate for improving islet transplantation. We first tested syngeneic transplantation by implanting islets under the kidney capsule of the same strain, FVB mice, thereby eliminating the immune rejection component. Under these conditions, MT islets maintained much greater insulin content than control islets. Allotransplantation was then tested. MT transgenic and normal FVB islets were implanted under the kidney capsule of BALB/c mice that were previously treated with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. We found that MT islets extended the duration of euglycemia 2-fold longer than nontransgenic islets. The benefit of MT was due to protection from ROS since nitrotyrosine staining, an indicator of free radical damage, was much lower in MT grafts than in FVB grafts. The time course of protection suggested that the major mode of MT action may have been protection from hypoxia or hypoxia/reperfusion. These data demonstrate that treatment with a broad spectrum antioxidant protects islets from ROS damage such as that produced during the early phase of islet transplantation.

Transplantation of pancreatic islets is considered to be one of the most effective treatments for Type 1 diabetes (1.White S.A. James R.F. Swift S.M. Kimber R.M. Nicholson M.L. Diabet. Med. 2001; 18: 78-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, islet transplantation using the Edmonton protocol (2.Ryan E.A. Lakey J.R. Paty B.W. Imes S. Korbutt G.S. Kneteman N.M. Bigam D. Rajotte R.V. Shapiro A.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) achieved insulin independence in 12 out of 15 diabetic patients for 1 year. However, widespread application of transplantation therapy is still limited by the need for more than one donor pancreas per recipient and difficulties in maintaining long term euglycemia (1.White S.A. James R.F. Swift S.M. Kimber R.M. Nicholson M.L. Diabet. Med. 2001; 18: 78-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One obstacle has been that many islets are lost during the initial stages of transplantation (3.Davalli A.M. Scaglia L. Zangen D.H. Hollister J. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 4.Biarnes M. Montolio M. Nacher V. Raurell M. Soler J. Montanya E. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Shortly after implantation, islet grafts function poorly, and many transplanted beta cells undergo apoptosis prior to stable engraftment. This increases the mass of islets needed to achieve euglycemia (5.Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there is an extreme shortage of human pancreatic islet donors. Therefore, instead of increasing the number of islets implanted, a more desirable strategy is to improve islet graft survival during the early stages of transplantation. However, to date, no impressive regimen has been devised to prevent early graft damage.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; MT, metallothionein; STZ, streptozotocin; SIN-1, streptozotocin, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; SNAP, S-nitro-N-acetyl-penicillamine; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; MT, metallothionein; STZ, streptozotocin; SIN-1, streptozotocin, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; SNAP, S-nitro-N-acetyl-penicillamine; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; ANOVA, analysis of variance. are involved in both early islet graft loss and longer term immune rejection. Shortly after implantation, islet grafts are exposed to nonspecific inflammatory events (3.Davalli A.M. Scaglia L. Zangen D.H. Hollister J. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) that generate proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and ROS. These local, nonspecific inflammatory mediators attack implanted islets. In the rat islet transplant model, grafts are destroyed by high levels of nitric oxide released from allogenic (6.Marquet R.L. Bonthuis F. van IJken M. Bouwman E. Wolvekamp M.C. van Rooijen N. Scheringa M. Ijzermans J.N. Transpl. Int. 1994; 7: S660-S662Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or syngenic (7.Kroncke K.D. Rodriguez M.L. Kolb H. Kolb-Bachofen V. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) macrophages. In addition, the graft suffers from an initial period of hypoxic ischemia after transplantation. Oxygen tension measured within the islet graft is initially very low (8.Carlsson P.O. Palm F. Andersson A. Liss P. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In fact, newly transplanted islets are essentially avascular, leaving them with insufficient oxygen and nutrients until the process of revascularization is completed. This ischemic microenvironment, followed by reperfusion as a consequence of revascularization, produces conditions known to induce detrimental ROS in transplanted organs (9.Petrowsky H. Dippe B. Geck P. Lincke M. Koenig J. Bhatti S. Wenisch H.J. Encke A. Transplant. Proc. 1995; 27: 729-731PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Land W. Schneeberger H. Schleibner S. Illner W.D. Abendroth D. Rutili G.

Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to ROS markedly inhibits beta cell function and results in beta cell death. When compared with other cell types, pancreatic beta cells are particularly susceptible to destruction caused by ROS (21.Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G. Ling Z. Welsh N. Hellerstrom C. Andersson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9253-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This is probably because islet cells contain very low levels and activities of several ROS detoxifying systems (22.Lenzen S. Drinkgern J. Tiedge M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Recent studies reported that early islet graft loss could be ameliorated by various antioxidant combinations such as α-tocopherol (23.Gembal M. Druzynska J. Andrzejewska S. Arendarczyk W. Wojcikowski C. Endokrynol. Pol. 1993; 44: 147-150PubMed Google Scholar) and other vitamins (24.Winter D. Eich T. Jahr H. Brendel M. Bretzel R. Transplant. Proc. 2002; 34: 2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Other reports have investigated transgenic overexpression of a single, specific antioxidant protein. Protection from the mitochondrial superoxide radical by adenoviral-mediated expression of Mn-superoxide dismutase (25.Bertera S. Crawford M.L. Alexander A.M. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Robbins P.D. Trucco M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was sufficient to extend islet graft function by 50%. However, in our laboratory, we found that overexpression of the specific, hydrogen peroxide detoxifying protein catalase failed to prevent insulin loss in syngeneic islet grafts (18.Xu B. Moritz J.T. Epstein P.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To test whether beta cell protection could be improved by protecting against multiple species of ROS, several laboratories have expressed more than one antioxidant enzyme. In insulin-secreting RINm5F cells, combined expression of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase plus catalase or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase plus glutathione peroxidase provided more protection against hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radical, and nitric oxide than expression of either transgene alone (26.Tiedge M. Lortz S. Munday R. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1578-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 27.Tiedge M. Lortz S. Munday R. Lenzen S. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Co-administration of superoxide dismutase and catalase in cultured rat islets more effectively prevented alloxan-induced destruction than either antioxidant alone (28.Uchigata Y. Yamamoto H. Kawamura A. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6084-6088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicated that enhanced protection was possible by scavenging more than one species of ROS. Therefore, we hypothesized that a significant improvement of islet graft survival could be achieved if the donor islets were protected by a potent antioxidant protein with a broad spectrum of ROS scavenging activity, such as metallothionein (MT).MT is a low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, and highly inducible protein that binds heavy metal with high affinity. MT appears to play an important role in metal metabolism and detoxification. Due to its many cysteine residues, MT also functions as a potent antioxidant. Elevated expression of MT in pancreatic beta cells, produced either by zinc induction (29.Ohly P. Dohle C. Abel J. Seissler J. Gleichmann H.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2040-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), has been shown to protect from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced beta cell damage and diabetes. Studies in cell-free systems have demonstrated that MT is able to scavenge a wide range of ROS including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and nitric oxide at higher efficiencies than other antioxidants such as GSH (32.Thornalley P.J. Vasak M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 33.Kumari M.V. Hiramatsu M. Ebadi M. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 29: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 34.Miura T. Muraoka S. Ogiso T. Life Sci. 1997; 60: PL301-PL309Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, it is not certain that MT will provide such a broad spectrum of antioxidant function in vivo.The present study was designed to test whether overexpression of a single protein with broad spectrum antioxidant activity improved beta cell protection. MT is first shown to be a broad spectrum antioxidant in islets, capable of scavenging many different types of ROS. We then show that MT islets exposed to hypoxia produce fewer ROS and suffer reduced cell death. In syngeneic transplants, MT markedly improved the preservation of graft insulin content, and in allogenic transplants, MT extended the period of euglycemia 2-fold.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—MT transgenic mice were established in our laboratory on the FVB strain with pancreatic beta cell overexpression of the human MT II gene, as described previously (31.Chen H. Carlson E.C. Pellet L. Moritz J.T. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2040-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The HMT-l transgenic line was used in this study since this line has the highest expression of MT. Recipient BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were housed in ventilated cages at the University of Louisville Research Resources Center with free access to water and standard mouse diet. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which is certified by the American Association of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.Chemicals—Streptozotocin, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), S-nitro-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP), hypoxanthine, xanthine oxidase, collagenase (type V), Ficoll, and trypsin were obtained from Sigma. Hanks' balanced salt solution, RPMI 1640 medium, and fetal bovine serum were supplied by Invitrogen. Rat insulin standard was bought from Linco (St. Charles, MO). Rabbit antiserum to guinea pig insulin was purchased from BioGenex (San Ramon, CA). Monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody was supplied by Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). 5-(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Alamar Blue was purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA).Islet Preparation—The isolation procedure was based on a modification of the method of Gotoh et al. (35.Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Satomi S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and has been described previously (31.Chen H. Carlson E.C. Pellet L. Moritz J.T. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2040-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Isolated islets were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% bovine serum albumin, 2% penicillin-streptomycin before the transplantation and in vitro studies, which were performed on the second day.Measurements of ROS Production—To measure ROS production in single islet cells, the overnight cultured islets were first dispersed into individual cells by treatment with trypsin (0.0075%) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' solution at 37 °C for 10 min followed with mechanical dispersal by 50 times of repeat pipetting, as described previously (36.Appels B. Burkart V. Kantwerk-Funke G. Funda J. Kolb-Bachofen V. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3803-3808PubMed Google Scholar). A cell membrane-permeable and oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dye CM-H2DCFDA was used to measure ROS. The dispersed islet cells were loaded with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 30 min followed by three washes of fresh culture medium without phenol red. The cells were resuspended in culture medium without phenol red. After the cells were counted, the dispersed islet cells containing CM-H2DCFDA were distributed into a 96-well plate at a concentration of 40,000 cells/well in 200 μl of islet culture medium without phenol red. The exogenous sources of ROS (H2O2, SIN-1 or hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase) were added quickly to the wells. With the addition of ROS, the increase of fluorescence intensity in each well was measured on a fluorescent microplate reader (Tecan, Durham, NC) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The data were expressed as fluorescent intensity per 40,000 cells.ROS production in whole islets following hypoxia treatment was measured with a method modified from the procedure of Ye et al. (37.Ye G. Metreveli N.S. Ren J. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) in our laboratory. Briefly, the hypoxia-treated or untreated FVB control or MT transgenic islets were loaded with 5 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 30 min followed by three washes of fresh culture medium. The fluorescence of each islet was activated at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and recorded at an emission wavelength of 530 nm. ROS was monitored from randomly sampled individual islets using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a digital cooled CCD camera. Images were analyzed with ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). More than 100 islets from at least three separate islet isolations were studied for each group. The results were expressed as the mean fluorescence intensity.Nitric Oxide in Vitro Studies—Isolated FVB and HMT-1 islets were exposed to different concentrations of a nitric oxide donor, SNAP, for 24 h. Apoptotic and necrotic DNA was detected with an anti-histone biotin/anti-DNA POD ELISAplus kit (Roche Applied Science) based on the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 40-50 islets were cultured for 24 h in 500 μl of fresh culture medium in a 1.5-ml microtube with or without SNAP treatment. After treatment, the microtube was centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed as the necrosis DNA sample. The pellet was lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The microtube was centrifuged again at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed as the apoptotic DNA sample. To quantify the necrotic and apoptotic DNA, both DNA samples were added to the streptavidin-coated microplate contained in the kit. All values were normalized to islet total DNA measured by picogreen DNA quantification (Molecular Probes).In Vitro Hypoxia Treatment—Isolated FVB and HMT-1 islets were cultured in a 96-well plate placed in a sealed incubator chamber saturated with 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 at 37 °C. After incubation for 24, 48, or 72 h, the islet cell viability was assessed by measuring islet metabolism as indicated by Alamar Blue absorbance. The data for cell viability were calculated as the percentages of viability of control cells that were cultured normally in 95% air, 5% CO2. ROS production in islets after hypoxia for 7 h was measured with CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence dye, as described above.Alamar Blue Assay—The Alamar Blue assay, which incorporates a redox indicator that changes color and fluorescence in response to cell metabolic activity, is a commonly used method to assess cell viability and/or proliferation of mammalian cells (38.Gonzalez R.J. Tarloff J.B. Toxicol. In Vitro. 2001; 15: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and microorganisms (39.Byth H.A. Mchunu B.I. Dubery I.A. Bornman L. Phytochem. Anal. 2001; 12: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In our studies, 15 overnight-cultured FVB control islets or HMT-1 transgenic islets were handpicked into 200 μl of fresh culture medium (no phenol red) containing 1:20 diluted Alamar Blue in a 96-well plate. Islets were cultured for 4 h, and the Alamar Blue fluorescence was measured on a fluorescent microplate reader (Tecan, Durham, NC) at the excitation wavelength of 535 nm and the emission wavelength of 595 nm. This measurement provided an absorbance value indicating the pretreatment metabolic activity and was used to normalize the post-treatment metabolic activity. After three washes with fresh culture medium, islets were cultured in 200 μl of culture medium under normoxia or hypoxia (1% O2) conditions for varying time periods. At the end of treatment, 50 μl of culture medium was replaced with 50 μl of fresh culture medium containing 1:5 diluted Alamar Blue for a final dilution of 1:20. The color was developed for another 4 h, and the fluorescence was measured again. Islet cell viability was calculated as the ratio of fluorescence after treatment to the fluorescence before treatment.Syngeneic Transplantation—50 FVB and HMT-1 islets were transplanted separately under each kidney capsule in a normal FVB mouse according to a modification of the procedure of Montana et al. (40.Montana E. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recipient mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection with 10 μl/g of a solution containing 10 mg/ml ketamine and 3.2 mg/ml xylazine. The left side kidney was first externalized through a small incision and kept moist with saline. 50 islets were picked into a gel-loading pipette tip (0.5-mm diameter) mounted on a 1-cc Hamilton syringe (Reno, NV) and allowed to settle. The tip was inserted through an incision beneath the kidney capsule, and the islets were gently forced out of the tip. The body wall and the skin were closed with sutures. Then the transplantation to the right kidney was performed by the same procedure. 6 days later, grafts were recovered by removing a portion of the kidney many fold larger than the visualized graft site. This portion of the kidney was homogenized in acid ethanol (23 ethanol, 2 HCl,75 H2O, v/v/v) for insulin extraction. To determine the insulin content, we used an anti-insulin antibody-coated tube radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA) and rat insulin standards according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 400 μl of diluted sample or rat insulin standard solution was mixed thoroughly with 1 ml of 125iodine-labeled insulin in the anti-insulin-coated tubes. After overnight incubation at room temperature, tubes were washed three times, and the radioactivity for each tube was counted in a γ counter. The sample insulin values were within 20-80% of the binding capacity of the radioimmunoassay. Insulin content was calculated from a standard curve made with rat insulin standards.Allotransplantation—200 FVB or HMT-1 islets were transplanted under each kidney capsule (400 total) with the same protocol described above. Before transplantation, the recipient BALB/c mice, aged 8-12 weeks, were injected with a single dose of STZ (intraperitoneal 220 mg/kg) to induce diabetes. Only mice with blood glucose ranging from 350 to 500 mg/dl were used as recipients for transplantation surgery. After transplantation, the mice were allowed to recover freely without treatment. Tail blood glucose levels of the transplanted mice were monitored every other day with a glucose meter (OneTouch Ultra, Life Scan, Milpitas, CA). Graft failure was defined as a return of hyperglycemia (nonfasting blood glucose > 250 mg/dl) on two consecutive measurements. Islet graft survival time was calculated as the number of days from transplantation to the first day of hyperglycemia of two consecutive measurements. Grafts from some recipients were recovered 6 days after transplantation and sectioned for hematoxylin/eosin and nitrotyrosine staining. In separate experiments in which only one kidney was transplanted, we verified that removal of the graft containing kidney caused a return to glucose levels over 600 mg/dl.Immunohistochemistry for Nitrotyrosine—Islet grafts were fixed in 10% formaldehyde in 0.1 mol/liter phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), dehydrated in an ascending graded series of ethanol, and subsequently infiltrated with paraffin. Serial sections were cut at 5 μm, mounted on polylysine-coated slides, and then deparaffinized in xylenes and a descending graded series of ethanol. For nitrotyrosine staining, slides were treated with target retrieval solution (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) followed by M.O.M. mouse Ig blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Cayman) was added to the slides at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, slides were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG reagent, followed by ABC reagent, and developed with DAB as chromagen. Slides without primary antibody treatment were used as negative control. For quantification of nitrotyrosine production, 5 MT graft slides and 5 FVB control graft slides from three independent recipients were scored on a scale from 1 to 5 grades based on the severity of nitrotyrosine staining by two researchers blind to the identity of the section.Data Analysis—Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was performed by one-way or two-way ANOVA and Dunnet's post hoc (2-tailed) test. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Mantel-Cox log rank test were used to analyze islet graft survival time. Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to analyze nitrotyrosine staining in islet grafts. Computations were done using statistical programs from SPSS (version 10.0) and Sigmastat (version 2.03).RESULTSBroad Spectrum ROS Scavenging by MT—Our previous study (31.Chen H. Carlson E.C. Pellet L. Moritz J.T. Epstein P.N. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2040-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the MT transgene protected against ROS released by STZ. To determine whether MT could protect against many species of ROS, beta cells were exposed to H2O2, the superoxide radical produced by hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, and the peroxynitrite radical released from SIN-1. Beta cell ROS production measured with CM-H2DCFDA (Fig. 1) was dramatically reduced by the MT transgene following exposure to all three sources. Islets were also exposed to nitric oxide by incubation with SNAP, a nitric oxide donor. SNAP did not increase CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence in our assay; consequently, we assessed MT-induced resistance to nitric oxide by observing changes in islet morphology and quantitating islet cell death. As shown in Fig. 2, MT islets were resistant to SNAP-induced morphological damage and cell death as measured by DNA cleavage. These data demonstrate that MT is able to efficiently scavenge all or most forms of free radicals.Fig. 2Nitric oxide-induced damage in FVB and MT transgenic islets exposed to SNAP for 24 h.A, representative photomicrographs of FVB and MT islets after SNAP treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2020368904,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is well established as a growth-inhibitory, apoptosis-inducing secreted molecule that acts via insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-independent as well as IGF-dependent pathways. Nuclear localization of IGFBP-3 has been observed and nuclear binding partners for IGFBP-3 demonstrated. However, little is known about the mechanism of IGFBP-3 internalization. We hypothesized that IGFBP-3 is first secreted then taken up again into cells and that its internalization could occur via binding to transferrin or caveolin. Incubation of cells with an IGFBP-3-neutralizing antibody demonstrated that nuclear translocation of endogenous IGFBP-3 requires IGFBP-3 secretion and re-uptake. Nuclear localization of exogenously added IGFBP-3 was rapid, occurring within 15 min, inhibited by co-incubation and extracellular sequestration with IGF-I, and dependent on the transferrin-binding C-terminal peptide region of IGFBP-3. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that IGFBP-3 binds transferrin but not directly to the transferrin receptor (TfR1); however, transferrin binds TfR1 and a ternary complex is formed. Specific binding to caveolin scaffolding docking sequence was confirmed utilizing radiolabeled IGFBP-3. Blocking TfR1-mediated endocytosis prevents both endogenous and exogenous IGFBP-3 re-uptake and inhibitors of caveolae formation also retard IGFBP-3 nuclear entry. Co-treatment with anti-transferrin receptor antibody and cholesterol depletion agents completely abolished endogenous and exogenous IGFBP-3 uptake. Suppression of IGFBP-3 internalization by TfR1 blockade inhibited IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis.

Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) as a biological mediator of cancer cell apoptosis (2.Lee K.W. Cohen P. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 175: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Previously, we have described IGFBP-3 as the mediator of both TGF-β- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis using antisense oligonucleotides or neutralizing antibodies to IGFBP-3 in PC-3 prostate cancer cells (3.Rajah R.

Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 163-171PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of IGFBP-3 is a well described phenomenon and has been demonstrated in a variety of cellular models (5.Li W.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and nuclear transport is facilitated by importin-β factor (10.Schedlich L.J. Le Page S.L. Firth S.M. Briggs L.J. Jans D.A. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23462-23470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although advances have been made in our understanding of these IGF-independent effects, including novel nuclear effects on retinoid X receptor-mediated signaling (8.Liu B. Lee H.Y. Weinzimer S.A. Powell D.R. Clifford J.L. Kurie J.M. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33607-33613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the mechanisms and pathways by which IGFBP-3 is internalized into the cell are poorly understood. The long-standing search for IGFBP-cell surface receptors has not yet provided definitive results. It is unclear at this time whether IGFBP-3 can act as an intracrine molecule or whether it needs to be secreted and re-uptaken (in an autocrine/paracrine fashion) back into cells. Furthermore, it is unknown how IGFBP-3 enters the cells. Current understanding of macromolecular entry into cells includes two major endocytic pathways, caveolin- and clathrin-mediated uptake. IGFBP-3 binding to transferrin has been shown by us (11.Weinzimer S.A. Gibson T.B. Collett-Solberg P.F. Khare A. Liu B. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to be dependent on a region in the C-terminal domain shown in Fig. 1. Analysis of the IGFBP-3 amino acid sequence also demonstrated that a caveolin-scaffolding domain consensus sequence (CSD, ØXØXXXXØ, where Ø is a hydrophobic residue and X is any amino acid residue) (12.Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), FCWCVDKY, also resides near the C-terminal end of IGFBP-3 (Fig. 1). This offered caveolin-1 as an attractive membrane protein partner for IGFBP-3 as well as a mediator of IGFBP-3 internalization. To resolve some of the issues related to the process of IGFBP-3 internalization, we examined the effect of membrane cholesterol depletion (as a method of blocking caveolin-dependent uptake) and blockade of the transferrin receptor (to arrest clathrin-mediated uptake) on the nuclear localization of IGFBP-3 in prostate cancer cells. Our data demonstrate the requirement for IGFBP-3 secretion and re-uptake for efficient apoptosis. IGFBP-3 binds transferrin, which then binds the transferrin receptor for subsequent internalization. The specific disruption of caveolae organization also inhibited IGFBP-3 endocytosis, whereas blockade of both transferrin receptor and caveolin-mediated pathways completely impedes IGFBP-3 internalization. These data are consistent with a model wherein caveolae and clathrin-mediated (specifically transferrin/TfR1) endocytosis function together to mediate the efficient endocytosis of IGFBP-3.

A caspase-3/-7 specific fluorometric assay (ApoONE™, Promega, Madison, WI) was used as a measure of apoptosis induction. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Immunoblots—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which normally do not express the TfR1, have been stably transfected to overexpress the TfR1 (13.Kawabata H.

Whole cell lysates were pre-precipitated (if indicated) with anti-transferrin antibodies. Briefly, 250 μl of protein A-agarose was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μl of anti-human transferrin antibodies. 125 μl of each antibody-treated protein A-agarose was added to 10 μg of CHO-TfR1 cell lysates and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with shaking. Immunoprecipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation. This immunodepleted (if indicated) supernatant was subjected to protein A-agarose bound to described antibody as above, precipitated, and washed 3 times with 100 μl of SACI buffer. 200 μl of sample buffer was added to each sample and vortexed vigorously. Samples were boiled and vortexed again to release protein-antibody complexes from the protein A-agarose. The protein A-agarose was then separated from the immunoprecipitated complexes by centrifugation. The supernatants were saved, and the cycle was repeated if indicated with another antibody, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (8%) at constant voltage overnight and then transferred to nitrocellulose for 4 h at 170 mA. The nitrocellulose was immersed in blocking solution (5% non-fat milk/TBS) for 45 min, washed with TBS, 0.1% Tween, and incubated with primary anti-human TfR1 or anti-human IGFBP-3 antibody (1:4000) for 2 h. After washing off any unbound antibodies, the nitrocellulose was incubated with a secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h. The membrane was washed 4 times with TBS, 0.1% Tween, and TBS. Bands were visualized using the peroxidase-linked enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Experiments were repeated 3 times. Ligand Dot Blot—Western ligand blots were used to assess IGFBP-3 binding. Peptides (2 μl at a time) were carefully dot-blotted directly onto PVDF membrane (membrane presoaked in methanol and subsequently balanced in PBS) and allowed to dry completely. PVDF membrane was then wet again with methanol, soaked in distilled H2O, and then buffered in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) -3% Igepal CA-630 with gentle shaking for 30 min at 4 °C, after which the membrane was blocked with TBS, 1% bovine serum albumin for 3 h at 4 °C. 125I-rhIGFBP-3 (106 cpm, 0.5 μCi) was incubated in TBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The membrane was washed with TBS, 0.1% Tween 4 times and rinsed once with TBS. 125I signals were detected using the Storm PhosphorImager and Image-Quant software (Amersham Biosciences). For competition experiments, tracer was mixed with a 100× excess (1 μm) of cold IGFBP-3 before incubation with the membrane. Tissue Culture—LAPC-4 cells were a kind gift from C. Sawyers (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). LAPC-4 cells (14.Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% R1181 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 22 RV1 and PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown according to recommended protocols. TfR1-transfected CHO Cells (13.Kawabata H. Germain R.S. Vuong P.T. Nakamaki T. Said J.W. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16618-16625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) were maintained in F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/ml G418. For each indicated experiment, cells were dissociated, centrifuged, and resuspended in serum-containing medium with antibiotics and inoculated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 in 24- or 6-well tissue culture dishes and grown to 60-70% confluence in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C before treatment. After a quick wash with serum-free media, the cells were treated with various concentrations of the specified reagents for the specific times indicated. Serum-free media with antibiotics were used as the control treatment. Subcellular Fractionation/Nuclear Localization Assessment—Cells were pulsed or treated with the indicated reagents for the indicated times under serum-free conditions, and the CelLytic™ NuCLEAR™ Extraction kit (Sigma) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to separate nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from whole cell lysates. The procedure for the nuclear protein extraction method is to allow cells to swell with hypotonic buffer. The cells are then disrupted; the cytoplasmic fraction is removed, and the nuclear proteins are released from the nuclei by a high salt buffer. Equal amounts of protein were quantitated (Lowry reagent, Bio-Rad) and separated by SDS-PAGE. If indicated, conditioned media were also quantitated via densitometric analysis of Western immunoblot on subcellular fractions. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—1 × 104 LAPC-4/PC-3/CHO-TfR1 cells were plated on coverglass with or without reagent for the indicated times before staining for immunofluorescence. After three washes in PBS, fixation and permeabilization of the cells were performed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min on ice, and cells were washed twice with PBS. IGFBP-3 protein localization was detected using the DSL hIGFBP-3 goat polyclonal antibody (which was previously purified an IGFBP-3 column), diluted 1:200, followed by fluorescein/Texas Red anti-goat antibody from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Preincubation of antibody with recombinant BP3 resulted in loss of signal indicating specificity (data not shown). Specimens were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, with secondary antibodies in PBS for 40 min at room temperature, and then incubated with Hoechst (DAPI) to stain nuclei for 2 min. Samples were analyzed using the Inverted Confocal Microscope (Leica, Inc., Germany), equipped by digital camera Himamatsu (Japan), and operated by QED-image software. Caspase Assays—For caspase assays cells were plated at equal density (104 cells/ml) on 96-well plates (Costar) in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were cultured overnight and changed to serum-free media for the experiments. rhIGFBP-3 was used at the indicated concentrations. A caspase-3/-7-specific fluorometric assay (Apo-ONE, Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to measure the degree of apoptosis induction by IGFBP-3. Statistical Analyses—Experiments are means of triplicates, and each experiment was performed 3 times. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired t test or by analysis of variance utilizing InStat (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Nuclear Translocation of IGFBP-3 Involves IGFBP-3 Secretion and Re-uptake—Because TGF-β1 is a potent growth inhibitor of epithelial cells and has been shown to induce apoptosis via an IGFBP-3-dependent pathway in PC-3 cells (3.Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), we investigated the presence of nuclear IGFBP-3 in TGF-β1-treated cells. Consistent with our previously published findings of a 10-fold increase in the presence of IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein in conditioned media of TGF-β-treated cells, treatment of PC-3 cells with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 48 h also resulted in a 10-fold increase in IGFBP-3 secreted into conditioned media, as well as of IGFBP-3 found in the nuclear fractions and a 5-fold increase of cytoplasmic IGFBP-3 as compared with control serum-free conditions (Fig. 2A). When visualized by confocal indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B), the presence of IGFBP-3 (shown in red) is clearly increased by TGF-β in the 2nd panel both in the nucleus (identified by the DAPI staining in blue) and in the cytoplasm. Addition of a non-internalizable neutralizing IGFBP-3 polyclonal antibody together with TGF-β dramatically reduced the amount of intracellular IGFBP-3, abolished the presence of nuclear IGFBP-3 shown by confocal microscopy, and markedly reduced the presence of nuclear IGFBP-3 as shown by Western immunoblot (Fig. 2C). Residual cytoplasmic staining of IGFBP-3 may represent newly translated IGFBP-3 in the cytoplasm before secretion. We demonstrated previously that this antibody tightly binds IGFBP-3 secreted from cells as a large molecular weight non-internalized complex (data not shown). These results demonstrate that IGFBP-3 must be secreted before re-uptake and targeting to the nucleus. Nuclear Localization of IGFBP-3 Is Rapid, IGF-inhibitable, and C-terminal Sequence-dependent—22RV1 prostate cancer cells were pulsed with 500 ng of IGFBP-3 alone or in combination with IGF-I or IGF analogue for 15 min; nuclear fractions were isolated and resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for IGFBP-3. Fig. 3 shows a definite, intense IGFBP-3 nuclear band at 15 min with a lesser amount in the cytoplasm. The C-terminal mutant (shown in Fig. 1) has greatly reduced ability (∼10% of wild type) to localize to the nucleus, and no cytoplasmic presence is detected. The polyclonal IGFBP-3 antibody used recognizes both mutant and wild-type IGFBP-3 with similar affinities (data not shown). Co-incubation with IGF-I resulted in a dramatic retardation of nuclear entry, consistent with an expected extracellular sequestration. Co-treatment with the IGF analogue (long R3-IGF-I) that does not bind to IGFBPs did not impair cellular entry, whereas treatment with the IGF analogue (Leu-60) that has greatly reduced affinity for the type I IGF receptor with normal binding affinity for the IGFBPs did impair cellular entry. These observed effects of IGF and IGF analogues on IGFBP-3 nuclear entry recapitulate previous effects of IGF-I and its analogues on IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis (3.Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Therefore, the predominant destination of the re-uptaken free IGFBP-3 is the nucleus and is dependent on the C-terminal region that binds transferrin. Of note, the residues mutated are also involved in cell surface (15.Firth S.M. Ganeshprad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16.Baxter R.C. Firth S.M. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and importin-β binding (10.Schedlich L.J. Le Page S.L. Firth S.M. Briggs L.J. Jans D.A. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23462-23470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 Binds Transferrin but Not Directly to Transferrin Receptor-1 (TfR1); However, a Ternary Complex May be Formed—We and others (11.Weinzimer S.A. Gibson T.B. Collett-Solberg P.F. Khare A. Liu B.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have described transferrin as an IGFBP-3 binding partner. A series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments was employed to investigate whether IGFBP-3 interacts with the TfR1 either directly or as a complex bound to transferrin. CHO cells, which normally do not express the TfR1, have been stably transfected to overexpress the TfR1 (13.Kawabata H. Germain R.S. Vuong P.T. Nakamaki T. Said J.W. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16618-16625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4A, these cells were immunoprecipitated with various antibodies bound to protein A-agarose, and subsequent nonreducing SDS-PAGE was immunoblotted with anti-IGFBP-3 and anti-TfR1 antibodies. In lane 2 of both Fig. 4, A and B, lysates were depleted of transferrin with pre-precipitation by a transferrin antibody. Fig. 4A shows that TfR1 associates with transferrin but not IGFBP-3. In Fig. 4B, note that IGFBP-3 is co-immunoprecipitated by transferrin as well as by the transferrin receptor. However, pre-depleting the lysates with a transferrin immunoprecipitation results in a loss of most of the IGFBP-3 brought down by the TfR indicating that this interaction most likely involves a ternary complex of IGFBP-3, transferrin, and TfR1. IGFBP-3 Binds CSD—We identified a caveolin scaffolding docking domain consensus sequence near the transferrin-binding C-terminal region of IGFBP-3 (Fig. 1A). IGFBP-3 is the only binding protein that contains three consensus aromatic amino acids (Fig. 1B). To verify the interaction between CSD and IGFBP-3, we used ligand dot blot experiments (Fig. 5, A and B). CSD peptide, caveolin-1 residues 82-101 (12.Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), along with a peptide synthesized from an adjacent region of caveolin-1 (residues 53-81) used as a negative control, were immobilized to PVDF membrane. CSD peptide showed saturable binding to 125I-labeled rhIGFBP-3 (0.5 μCi/100 μl) (Fig. 5, A and B), as a 100-fold excess of cold IGFBP-3 (1 μm) co-incubated with radiolabeled IGFBP-3 displaced binding effectively. IGF-I was used as a positive control for IGFBP-3 binding. Specificity of binding with respect to the other IGFBPs was not tested. TfR1 Blockade Prevents Exogenous and Endogenous IGFBP-3 Uptake—We hypothesized that IGFBP-3 might internalize via a pathway that involves a classical clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway, of which the transferrin/transferrin receptor is the best studied (18.Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). To test whether blocking the TfR1 prevents IGFBP-3 uptake, we treated LAPC-4 cells with IGFBP-3 for 24 h after pretreatment with and without anti-TfR1 antibody for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment with exogenous recombinant IGFBP-3 results in marked nuclear accumulation of IGFBP-3. Co-treatment with anti-TfR1 antibody shows exclusion of IGFBP-3 from the nucleus and also from cell extracts (data not shown). To further validate this observation on endogenous IGFBP-3 production and re-uptake, CHO-TfR1 cells were treated with TNF-α alone or in combination with TfR1 antibody for 12 h. We have shown previously (4.Rajah R. Lee K.W. Cohen P. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 163-171PubMed Google Scholar) that TNF-α treatment induces IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein production 5-10-fold. The anti-human IGFBP-3 Ab, purchased from DSL, also detects CHO IGFBP-3 (immunoblot and ELISA data not shown). An antibody to a related receptor (TfR2), serving as a control, did not block IGFBP-3 internalization (data not shown). Fig. 6B shows that after treatment with TNF-α, these cells demonstrated a large amount of nuclear IGFBP-3 in serumfree conditions presumably secondary to increased re-uptake via increased amounts of TfR1. Blockade of the TfR1 with a specific antibody resulted in a marked decrease in both nuclear and total intracellular IGFBP-3 as shown by confocal microscopy. Thus, the transferrin internalization pathway participates in the internalization of IGFBP-3. Inhibition of Caveolae Formation Also Inhibits IGFBP-3 Nuclear Entry—Although caveolae have been described recently (19.Shin J.S. Abraham S.N. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as an internalization pathway for several pathogens, including non-enveloped viruses with a classical NLS (e.g. SV40), their role as an internalization pathway for IGFBPs has not been addressed. To examine the role of this pathway, cells were treated with caveolae-inhibiting drugs. Nystatin and methyl-β-cyclodextrin are sterol-binding drugs that sequester cholesterol and are not believed to affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis (20.Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 21.Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, 22RV1 prostate cancer cells were treated with 25 ng/ml nystatin or 10 nm MβCD for 2 h in serum-free conditions and then pulsed with 500 ng of IGFBP-3 for 5, 10, and 15 min. Nuclear fractions were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-IGFBP-3 antibody. Pretreatment with these classical cholesterol depletion agents significantly impaired IGFBP-3 nuclear entry. Nystatin inhibited nuclear entry of IGFBP-3 by over 50% at 5 and 10 min, and cyclodextrin impaired IGFBP-3 nuclear entry by >50% at 5, 10, and 15 min. Quantitation of three separate experiments done in triplicate show a >40% reduction by nystatin in nuclear IGFBP-3 transport associated with a >50% reduction in cytoplasmic IGFBP-3 (Fig. 7B). As a positive control, treatment with nystatin and cyclodextrin also impaired nuclear and cytoplasmic transport of cholera toxin, known to internalize via caveolar pathways (22.Torgerson M.L. Skretting G. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3737-3747PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, caveolae disruption by cholesterol depletion agents significantly impairs IGFBP-3 cellular internalization, suggesting that caveolae-mediated endocytosis also participates in IGFBP-3 internalization. Interestingly, this inhibition was lessened at 15 min, suggesting that caveolin blockade is compensated for by entry via an alternate pathway. Disruption of Caveolin- and Transferrin-mediated Endocytosis in Combination Blocks Endogenous and Exogenous IGFBP-3 Nuclear Entry—Our present data suggest that IGFBP-3 internalization is mediated by both classical TfR/clathrin- and caveolin-mediated pathways. Fig. 8 illustrates blockade of both pathways on both endogenous and exogenous IGFBP-3 internalization. 22RV1 cells were treated in serum-free conditions with MβCD or TfR1 Ab alone or in combination for 1 h and then pulsed with 500 ng IGFBP-3. Nuclear fractions were isolated and resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-IGFBP-3. There is a clear dose-dependent decrease in both endogenous and exogenous IGFBP-3 internalization with MβCD. There is also a decrease in internalization as effected by the TfR1-blocking antibody. However, treatment with a combination of both agents completely abolishes endogenous IGFBP-3 re-uptake, as well as significantly diminishing exogen"
https://openalex.org/W2149278865,"Both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) have been implicated in the tumorigenesis of a variety of human cancers. Effective tumor inhibition has been achieved both experimentally and clinically with a number of strategies that antagonize either receptor activity. Here we constructed and produced two fully human recombinant bispecific antibodies (BsAb) that target both EGFR and IGFR, using two neutralizing human antibodies originally isolated from a phage display library. The BsAb not only retained the antigen binding capacity of each of the parent antibodies, but also were capable of binding to both targets simultaneously as demonstrated by a cross-linking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, the BsAb effectively blocked both ligands, EGF and IGF, from binding to their respective receptors, and inhibited tumor cell proliferation as potently as a combination of both the parent antibodies. More importantly, the BsAb were able to completely block activation of several major signal transduction molecules, including Akt and p44/p42 MAP kinases, by both EGF and IGF, whereas each individual parent antibody was only effective in inhibiting those signal molecules activated by the relevant single growth factor. The BsAb molecules retained good antigen binding activity after incubation with mouse serum at 37 °C for up to 6 days. Taken together, our results underscore the benefits of simultaneous targeting multiple growth factor receptor pathways for more efficacious cancer treatment. This report describes the first time use of a recombinant BsAb for targeting two tumor-associated molecules on either a single or adjacent tumor cells for enhanced antitumor activity.

This report describes the first time use of a recombinant BsAb for targeting two tumor-associated molecules on either a single or adjacent tumor cells for enhanced antitumor activity. One of the hallmarks in effective cancer treatment is the use of combinational therapeutic regimens comprising several cytotoxic agents, e.g. various chemotherapeutics and radiations, that target cancer cells via different mechanisms. Unfortunately, the difference between malignant and normal cells in regards to their sensitivity to these cytotoxic therapies is not sufficient to allow potentially curative doses of chemotherapeutic agents or radiations to be administered without unacceptable toxicity to normal cells, the administration of therapeutic doses of these cytotoxic agents during the treatment also kills or damages normal rapidly proliferating cells such as hematopoietic cells, hair follicles, and lining epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract. In this regard, monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; BsAb, bispecific antibodies; CH1 and CL, the first constant domain of the antibody heavy chain and the constant domain of the antibody light chain, respectively; ECD, extracellular domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFR, insulin-like growth factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; scFv, single chain Fv; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; VH and VL, the variable domains of antibody heavy and light chains, respectively; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.-based therapeutics represent a promising new class of anticancer agents because of their exclusive specificity toward defined antigens (1.Glennie M.J.

Pathol. 2003; 119: 472-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the other hand, because of their limited intrinsic cytotoxic activity, antitumor antibodies are most therapeutically efficacious when used either in combination with conventional chemotherapy regimens, e.g. Rituxan® plus CHOP in non-Hodgkins lymphoma (3.Czuczman M.S. Grillo-Lopez A.J. White C.A. Saleh M. Gordon L. LoBuglio A.F. Jonas C. Klippenstein D. Dallaire B. Varns C. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 268-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Herceptin® plus Taxol in metastatic breast cancer (4.Baselga J. Oncology. 2001; 61: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), or as conjugates to other cytotoxic moieties, such as Zevalin® (a yttrium 90-labeled anti-CD20 mAb) (5.Grillo-Lopez A.J. Exp. Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2002; 2: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Bexxar® (an iodine 131-labeled anti-CD20 mAb) (6.Cheson B. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 3: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar) in non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and Mylotarg® (an anti-CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin) in acute myeloid leukemia (7.Sievers E.L. Linenberger M. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2001; 13: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The dose limiting toxicity of these combined, or conjugate therapies are usually associated with the cytotoxic components in the regimens. Based on these observations, it is plausible that the combination of antitumor antibodies directed against different tumor-associated targets may yield enhanced therapeutic activity without adding severe unwanted toxicities. Clinical application of combinational antibody therapy is, however, greatly hindered by a number of factors, including limited availability of antibody products, high cost of each product, and the FDA-associated regulatory issues (e.g. every antibody in the combination as well as the combination regimen itself may require a separate review and approval by the agency). To this end, the development of bispecific or multispecific antibodies that target two or more tumor-associated antigens simultaneously may offer a novel and promising solution. Both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) have been implicated in the tumorigenesis of a variety of human cancers (8.Baserga R. Exp.

Similarly, significant tumor inhibition has also been achieved in animal models with several IGFR targeting strategies including antisense oligonucleotides (25.Lee C.T. Wu S. Gabrilovich D. Chen H.

A recent study demonstrated that tumor cells may gain resistance to anti-EGFR therapies without altering EGFR expression, but rather through up-regulation and activation of other proliferative and/or anti-apoptotic activities, e.g. IGFR and downstream signal transduction through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (30.Chakravarti A. Loeffler J.S. Dyson N.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 200-207PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that a combinational regimen targeting both EGFR and other growth factor receptors, such as IGFR, simultaneously may yield greater anticancer activity than those approaches that address only a single receptor. In past years, both laboratory and early clinical studies have demonstrated that BsAb may have significant potential application in cancer therapy by targeting tumor cells with cytotoxic agents including effector cells, radionuclides, drugs, and toxins (31.van Spriel A.B. van Ojik H.H. van de Winkel J.G.

Here we explored a new concept of utilizing BsAb by constructing a novel antibody molecule that targets two relevant tumor targets, i.e. growth factor receptors, thus blocking simultaneously multiple receptor activation and downstream signal transduction pathways. Using two neutralizing antibodies, one directed against EGFR and the other against IGFR, as the “building blocks” we constructed and produced two different versions of an IgG-like tetravalent BsAb. The BsAb molecules bound to both EGFR and IGFR, and blocked the receptors from interacting with their respective ligands, as efficient as their parent monospecific IgG antibodies. Furthermore, whereas individual monospecific mAb was only able to inhibit single growth factor-stimulated receptor activation, the BsAb blocked both EGF and IGF stimulated activation of the receptors as well as the receptor-associated downstream signal transduction molecules. Cell Lines and Proteins—Human tumor cell lines, DiFi and HT29 (colorectal carcinoma), MCF7 (breast carcinoma), A431 (epidermoid carcinoma), and BxPC3 (pancreatic carcinoma) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Recombinant extracellular domain (ECD) of IGFR1 and its ligand, IGF-I, were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant EGFR ECD, and IMC-1121, a fully human antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) that does not cross-react with EGFR and IGFR, were produced at ImClone Systems Inc. Both 125I-IGF-I and 125I-EGF were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Generation of Fully Human Antibodies to IGFR and EGFR—Recombinant human IGFR1 ECD and A431 tumor cells were used to screen a human naïve phage display Fab library containing 3.7 × 1010 unique clones (34.De Haard H.J. van Neer N. Reurs A. Hufton S.E. Roovers R.C. Henderikx P. de Bruine A.P. Arends J-W. Hoogenboom H.R. J. Biol.

J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 11F8, an anti-EGFR clone identified after 3 rounds of selection on A431 cells, binds to both recombinant and cell surface-expressed EGFR with high affinity and neutralizes EGF-stimulated receptor activation and cell proliferation. 2M. Liu, D. Hicklin, and Z. Zhu, manuscript in preparation. Initial selection on IGFR1 ECD yielded a clone, 2F8, with modest binding affinity and neutralizing activity. Affinity maturation of 2F8 via a chain-shuffling approach (36.Lu D. Shen J. Vil M.D. Jimenez X. Zhang H. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43496-43507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) led to the identification of A12, a clone with significantly improved binding affinity and neutralizing activity (37.Burtrum, D., Zhu, Z., Lu, D., Anderson, D. M., Prewett, M., Pereira, D. S., Bassi, R., Abdullah, R., Hooper, A., Finnerty, B., Koo, H., Jimenez, X., Johnson, D., Apblett, R., Kussie, P., Bohlen, P., Witte, L., Hicklin, D. J., and Ludwig, D. L. (2003) Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). To produce full-length IgG antibodies, IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12, the DNA sequences encoding the heavy and light chain variable genes of 11F8 and A12 were amplified by PCR and cloned into an expression vector containing the human IgG1 constant domains (the glutamine synthetase expression system from Lonza Biologics Inc.). The expression vector was stably transfected into myeloma NS0 cells (38.Bebbington C.R. Renner G. Thomson S. King D. Abrams D. Yarranton G.T. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), followed by antibody production in serum-free media and purification via Protein A affinity chromatography. Construction and Production of the Bispecific Anti-EGFR x Anti-IGFR Antibodies—Single chain Fv (scFv) molecules of both 11F8 and A12 were first constructed following a previously described protocol (39.Lu D. Jimenez X. Zhang H. Wu Y. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7002-7008PubMed Google Scholar). These two scFv were then used as the building blocks to construct the bispecific anti-EGFR x anti-IGFR antibodies in the Bs(scFv)4-IgG format we previously described (40.Zuo Z. Jimenez X. Witte L. Zhu Z. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two different versions of the BsAb were constructed: in one version (BsALFH), the scFv encoding A12 was fused to the N terminus of the constant domain of the light chain (CL) and the scFv encoding 11F8 was linked to the N terminus of the first constant domain of the heavy chain (CH1), whereas in the other version (BsFLAH), the alternate orientation was used (for illustration see Fig. 1). Both genes encoding the scFv-CL and scFv-CH1CH2CH3 fusions were subcloned into the expression vector and expressed in NS0 cells, followed by antibody purification with Protein A chromatography. The purity of the BsAb was assayed via SDS-PAGE analysis under both reducing (Nupage 4-12% bis-Tris gel, Invitrogen) and non-reducing (4-20% Tris glycine gel, Invitrogen) conditions. The solution behavior of the BsAb preparations was examined via size exclusion chromatography as previously described (41.Lu D. Jimenez J. Zhang H. Atkins A. Brennan L. Balderes P. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 279: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified BsAb was applied to a Bio-Sep 3000 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) linked to a high performance liquid chromatography system with UV and refractive index detectors (Agilent 1100, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA), and followed by a Mini-Dawn LS (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). The column was equilibrated in PBS (pH 7.0) and run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Receptor Binding Assays—Two different assays were carried out to examine the binding specificity and efficiency of the BsAb. In the first assay, the cross-linking assay, the BsAb was tested for their capability in simultaneously binding two target antigens: the BsAb or the monospecific antibodies (5 nm) were first incubated with a biotin-labeled IGFR (100 ng) in solution and then transferred to a microtiter plate coated with EGFR (100 ng/well), followed by incubation with streptavidin-HRP to measure the plate-bound biotin activity. In the second assay, the direct binding assay, various amounts of antibodies were added to triplicate wells of 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) pre-coated with human IGFR1 or EGFR ECD (100 ng/well) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, after which the plates were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 100 μl of a rabbit anti-human IgG Fc-HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc., West Grove, PA). The plates were washed and developed following a procedure previously described (35.Lu D. Jimenez X. Zhang H. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 39.Lu D. Jimenez X. Zhang H. Wu Y. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7002-7008PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-based Competitive Blocking Assay—A431 or MCF-7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The subconfluent cell monolayers were washed 3 times with binding buffer (Iscove's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) followed by incubation with various amounts of antibodies on ice for 15 min. 125I-EGF or 125I-IGF (40 pm) were added to each well and incubated for an additional 3 h with gentle agitation. After washed three times with ice-cold PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were lysed with 200 μl of 0.5 n NaOH and radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. FACS Analysis—DiFi, MCF-7, BxPC3, A431, and HT29 cells were incubated with various antibodies (10 μg/ml) at 4°C for 1 h, followed by incubation with an anti-human Fc antibody-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (BIOSOURCE Int., Camarillo, CA) for an additional 1 h at 4°C. After several washes with cold PBS the cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (model EPICS® ELITE, Coulter Corp., Edison, NJ). Cell Proliferation Assays—1 × 104 DiFi or BxPC3 cells in 100 μl of complete medium were seeded in each well of 96-well plates and cultured overnight. Various amounts of the antibodies were added in triplicate wells and allowed to culture for 4 days, after which 10 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (5 mg/ml, Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 4 h. The plates were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 100 μl of HCl/isopropyl alcohol (40 mm) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by optical density reading at 570 nm. Western Blotting Analysis—Tumor cells were plated onto 75-mm dishes and grown to 70-80% confluence, after which the cells were washed twice in PBS and cultured overnight in serum-free medium. The cells were first incubated with various antibodies at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by stimulation with EGF, IGF, or both at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin), followed by centrifugation of the lysate at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Both EGFR and IGFR1 were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate supernatant by using a mixture of anti-EGFR and anti-IGFR antibodies, followed by addition of 20 μl of Protein A/GSepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The precipitated receptor proteins were resolved on a 4-12% Nupage bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phospho-EGFR and phosphor-IGFR were detected on the blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total receptor proteins loaded on the gel were assayed with a mixture of an anti-EGFR and anti-IGFR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42 MAPK, whole cell lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 10% acrylamide gel, and the phospho-Akt and phospho-p44/p42 were detected with an antibody mixture containing anti-phospho-Akt and anti-phospho-p44/p42 antibodies (Cell Signaling), followed by an anti-mouse antibody-HRP conjugate. Total Akt and p44/p42 proteins were assayed with a mixture of an anti-Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an anti-p44/p42 antibody (Cell Signaling). All signals were visualized with the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Stability of the Antibodies in Mouse Serum—Various antibody preparations were added to 10% freshly isolated mouse serum (in PBS) and incubated at room temperature or 37 °C. Aliquots of samples were removed at predefined intervals of incubation and assayed for efficiency for binding to both EGFR and IGFR using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described above. Construction and Production of the Anti-EGFR x Anti-IGFR BsAb—Two scFv molecules, the anti-EGFR, 11F8 scFv, and the anti-IGFR, A12 scFv, were used as the building blocks to construct an IgG-like tetravalent BsAb. Two different versions of the BsAb were produced (Fig. 1A): in one construct (BsALFH), the A12 scFv was linked to the N terminus of CL (A12 scFv-CL) and the 11F8 scFv was linked to the N terminus of CH1 of an IgG1 molecule (11F8 scFv-CH1CH2CH3); whereas in the other construct (BsFLAH), the 11F8 scFv-CL and the A12 scFv-CH1CH2CH3 orientation was used (see Fig. 1 for details). Co-expression in mammalian cells of A12 scFv-CL along with 11F8 scFv-CH1CH2CH3, or A12 scFv-CH1CH2CH3 with 11F8 scFv-CL, resulted in an IgG-like tetravalent molecule with two binding specificities (Fig. 1). Both BsAb were produced by stably transfected NS0 cells in serum-free conditions and purified from the cell culture supernatant via a Protein A affinity column. Electrophoresis analysis of BsALFH under non-reducing conditions yielded a single protein band with molecular weight of ∼200,000 (Fig. 1B, lane 3), the expected molecular mass of the tetravalent BsAb. Under the same conditions, BsFLAH gave rise to two bands: one major band at ∼200 kDa (representing the properly assembled BsAb), and one minor band at ∼100 kDa, suggesting the existence of A12 scFv-CH1CH2CH3 homodimer (without association with the 11F8 scFv-CL chain) (Fig. 1B, lane 4). As controls, both monospecific IgG, IMC-A12 and IMC-11F8, gave one major band with the expected mobility of ∼150 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 2 and 5, respectively). Under reducing conditions, both BsAb yielded two major bands, one represents the scFv-CH1CH2CH3 fusion (∼62.5 kDa) and the other the scFv-CL fusion (∼37.5 kDa) (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). As expected, both IMC-A12 and IMC-11F8 showed two major bands: the IgG heavy chain (∼50 kDa) and IgG light chain (∼25 kDa) (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 5, respectively). Under size exclusion chromatography, both BsAb preparations yielded a single major peak (>90%) with estimated molecular weight of ∼200,000 (not shown), indicating that the majority of the proteins exist in solution as the expected tetravalent BsAb monomer. The BsAb Binds to Both EGFR and IGFR—A number of assays were used to confirm that the BsAb molecules were capable of binding to both EGFR and IGFR. In the first assay, the cross-linking assay, we examined whether the BsAb could bind to both its targets simultaneously. The antibodies were first incubated with a biotin-labeled IGFR in solution and then transferred to a 96-well plate coated with EGFR, followed by incubation with streptavidin-HRP to measure the plate-bound biotin activity, i.e. the amount of IGFR that was cross-linked to the immobilized EGFR by the BsAb. As shown in Fig. 2A, both BsAb molecules, but not the monospecific IMC-A12 or IMC-11F8, were able to cross-link IGFR in solution with the immobilized EGFR, as demonstrated by the plate-associated biotin activity. In the second assay, the BsAb were compared with their monospecific counterparts in antigen binding efficiency. Various amounts of antibodies were added to 96-well plates coated with EGFR or IGFR ECD and assayed for their efficiency in binding to the receptors. IMC-A12 and IMC-11F8 bound only to their respective targets, whereas the BsAb reacted to both immobilized EGFR and IGFR with similar efficiencies to their monospecific counterparts (Fig. 2, B and C). The ED50 values, i.e. the antibody concentrations that yield 50% of maximum binding, to EGFR were 0.05 nm for IMC-11F8 and 0.1 nm for both BsALFH and BsFLAH, and to IGFR were 0.1 nm for IMC-A12 and 0.25 nm for both BsALFH and BsFLAH. Finally, the BsAb were examined by FACS analysis for binding to tumor cell surface-expressed receptors. A431, HT-29, and BxPC3 express almost equal levels of EGFR and IGFR as demonstrated by fluorescence intensity when stained by IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12 (Fig. 3). On the other hand, DiFi cells express significantly higher levels of EGFR, whereas MCF-7 cells have significantly higher IGFR expression (Fig. 3). Both BsAb bound to all tumor cells with higher efficiency (as demonstrated by the mean fluorescence intensity) than did each individual antibody (except for IMC-A12 to MCF-7 cells), indicating additive binding to both EGFR and IGFR on the cell surface by the BsAb molecules (Fig. 3). The BsAb Blocks Both IGF and EGF from Binding to Its Receptor—The BsAb was compared with their monospecific counterparts for efficacy in blocking ligand/receptor interaction. As shown in Fig. 4, whereas IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12 effectively blocked individual ligand, EGF and IGF, respectively, from binding to its receptor on tumor cell surface, the BsAb were able to compete with both EGF and IGF for binding to the receptors. The IC50 values, i.e. the antibody concentrations required to inhibit 50% of ligand binding, were ∼1.5 nm for IMC-11F8, 12 nm for BsALFH, and 20 nm for BsFLAH in EGFR binding (Fig. 4A), and 2 nm for IMC-A12, 40 nm for BsALFH, and 25 nm for BsFLAH in IGFR binding (Fig. 4B). As positive controls, the unlabeled ligands, EGF and IGF, competed efficiently with its radiolabeled counterpart, with IC50 of ∼10 nm for both EGF and IGF (Fig. 4). Inhibition of Tumor Cell Proliferation in Vitro by the BsAb—We next examined the efficacy of the BsAb in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in vitro in comparison to their monospecific counterparts. Two tumor cell lines were used in this study: DiFi cells that express significantly higher levels of EGFR, and BxPC3 cells that express high levels of both EGFR and IGFR. The anti-EGFR IMC-11F8 significantly inhibited the proliferation of DiFi cells, whereas the anti-IGFR IMC-A12, as well as the control antibody (the anti-VEGFR2 IMC-1211), had no effect on tumor cell growth (Fig. 5). Simple combinations of both IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12 yielded similar activity to that of IMC-11F8 alone. Both BsAb molecules demonstrated good anti-proliferative activity: BsALFH was equally potent to the combination of IMC-11F8 and IMC-A12 (both treatments were slightly more active than IMC-11F8), whereas BsFLAH was ∼5-fold less potent than IMC-11F8. The IC50 values, i.e. the antibody concentrations required for 50% tumor growth inhibition, were 1.8 nm for IMC-11F8, 1.2 nm for IMC-11F8 plus IMC-A12, 1.2 nm for BsALFH, and 10 nm for BsFLAH. BxPC3 cells, which express high levels of both EGFR and IGFR, were much less sensitive to anti-EGFR therapy: incubatio"
https://openalex.org/W2043220386,"Many vertebrate organs adopt asymmetric positions with respect to the midline, but little is known about the cellular changes and tissue movements that occur downstream of left-right gene expression to produce this asymmetry. Here, we provide evidence that the looping of the zebrafish gut results from the asymmetric migration of the neighboring lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Mutations that disrupt the epithelial structure of the LPM perturb this asymmetric migration and inhibit gut looping. Asymmetric LPM migration still occurs when the endoderm is ablated from the gut-looping region, suggesting that the LPM can autonomously provide a motive force for gut displacement. Finally, reducing left-sided Nodal activity randomizes the pattern of LPM migration and gut looping. These results reveal a cellular framework for the regulation of organ laterality by asymmetrically expressed genes."
https://openalex.org/W2154541005,"The androgen receptor (AR), when complexed with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), supports the survival and proliferation of prostate cells, a process critical for normal development, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and tumorigenesis. However, the androgen-responsive genetic pathways that control prostate cell division and differentiation are largely unknown. To identify such pathways, we examined gene expression in the ventral prostate 6 and 24 h after DHT administration to androgen-depleted rats. 234 transcripts were expressed significantly differently from controls (p < 0.05) at both time points and were subjected to extensive data mining. Functional clustering of the data reveals that the majority of these genes can be classified as participating in induction of secretory activity, metabolic activation, and intracellular signaling/signal transduction, indicating that AR rapidly modulates the expression of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation in the prostate. Notably AR represses the expression of several key cell cycle inhibitors, while modulating members of the wnt and notch signaling pathways, multiple growth factors, and peptide hormone signaling systems, and genes involved in MAP kinase and calcium signaling. Analysis of these data also suggested that p53 activity is negatively regulated by AR activation even though p53 RNA was unchanged. Experiments in LNCaP prostate cancer cells reveal that AR inhibits p53 protein accumulation in the nucleus, providing a post-transcriptional mechanism by which androgens control prostate cell growth and survival. In summary these data provide a comprehensive view of the earliest events in AR-mediated prostate cell proliferation in vivo, and suggest that nuclear exclusion of p53 is a critical step in prostate growth.

AR is a steroid hormone receptor that when activated by its high-affinity ligand 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) directs the expression of target genes by acting as a DNA-binding transcription factor. AR interacts with specific DNA sequences or with other proteins in the regulatory regions of target genes, and recruits cofactors that either enhance or inhibit the rate of transcription, depending on the nature of the regulatory element (2.Gelmann E.P. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 3001-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling pathways, cell cycle proteins, and other factors can modulate AR by modifying the receptor or interacting with it physically, providing a means for cross-talk between hormonal and growth factor signals (3.Kang H.Y.

Thus AR activity in the prostate is a complex sum of ligand concentration, input from signal transducing systems, and relative activity of transcriptional cofactors (5.Fujimoto N. Mizokami A. Harada S. Matsumoto T. Urology. 2001; 58: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The importance of AR activity for prostate function and in prostatic disease progression such as in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer (PCa) has been established (reviewed in Ref. 6.Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). AR is expressed in the secretory epithelial cells, the surrounding periacinar stromal cells, and in perivascular smooth muscle (1.Marker P.C. Donjacour A.A. Dahiya R. Cunha G.R. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). If AR activity is inhibited by any number of mechanisms, then the prostate undergoes involution because of apoptosis and atrophy in both the stromal and epithelial layers and to regression of the vasculature (1.Marker P.C. Donjacour A.A. Dahiya R. Cunha G.R. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This atrophy of prostate cells is due at least in part to a reduction in pro-growth and -survival factors secreted by the stromal cells (7.Cunha G.R. Foster B. Thomson A. Sugimura Y. Tanji N. Tsuji M. Terada N. Finch P.W. Donjacour A.A. World J. Urol. 1995; 13: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many genes encoding seminal proteins are under direct regulation by AR in the secretory epithelial cells (8.Frick J. Aulitzky W. Infection. 1991; 19: S115-S118Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Restoration of AR signaling rapidly promotes the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of prostate cells, leading ultimately to complete reformation of the functional organ and production of seminal proteins (9.Evans G.S. Chandler J.A. Prostate. 1987; 11: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). At that time, unknown growth-limiting mechanisms make the organ refractory to further stimulation (10.Bruchovsky N. Lesser B. Van Doorn E. Craven S. Vitam. Horm. 1975; 33: 61-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In benign prostatic hyperplasia and PCa, these growth control mechanisms are often corrupted (6.Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Both diseases can be treated with anti-androgen therapy, demonstrating the critical role for AR in disease progression. Unfortunately, androgen blockade is not curative for PCa, and hormone-independent disease typically develops (6.Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Given the necessity for AR activity in prostate development, function, and pathogenesis, it will be important to determine the molecular events downstream of AR that promote growth and survival. However, few direct targets of AR are known, and the genes immediately downstream of AR in the prostate that regulate proliferation and differentiation remain largely uncharacterized. Because AR acts primarily as a transcription factor, differential gene expression studies are an ideal means to study the effects of AR in prostate cells. Several large-scale gene expression studies in prostate cells have been reported (e.g. Ref. 11.Pang S.T. Dillner K. Wu X. Pousette A. Norstedt G. Flores-Morales A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4897-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and these have increased the number of androgen-responsive genes known in the prostate. However, none have focused exclusively on identifying genes immediately downstream of AR that coordinate the multitude of physiological changes under androgenic control. In this study we sought to identify genes that rapidly respond to DHT activation of the AR in the rat ventral prostate gland. We focused on gene regulation occurring before growth and organogenesis, reasoning that genes responding to DHT within that time would be enriched for direct targets of the AR that promote the survival and function of the prostate. Using large-scale gene expression analysis of ventral prostate samples collected 6 and 24 h after DHT treatment to castrated animals, 234 genes are shown to be androgen-regulated prior to the onset of cell proliferation. Approximately 200 of these genes were not previously known to be androgen-responsive. These genes were extensively reviewed for their potential roles in prostate physiology, allowing for a description of the molecular events involved in the initiation of prostate cell growth. We use this data to demonstrate that p53 inhibition by AR is an early event in androgen-stimulated proliferation. These findings confirm and extend previous observations and offer novel insights into the mechanisms by which androgens regulate prostate physiology. Animals—All animals were treated according to Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. 3-4-Month-old 250-300 g Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from the vendor after orchiectomy or sham operation. Nine days following surgery, animals were injected daily with 3 mg/kg 5α-DHT (Steraloids) in propylene glycol or with propylene glycol alone. Six or 24 h later, animals were euthanized by CO2 and ventral prostates (VP) was collected and weighed before being frozen in liquid nitrogen (RNA or protein analysis) or fixed in paraformaldehyde for sectioning and staining. Microarrays—Nine animals were used per treatment. RNA was collected from ventral prostates using Trizol™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After treatment with DNase I (as directed by the manufacturer, Genhunter), 3 distinct pools of RNA, each from 3 animals, were generated per group by mixing equal amounts of RNA from individual samples. These n = 3 RNA pools were each used to probe a single microarray chip, providing 3 non-redundant replicates per treatment. Hybridizations were performed as directed by Affymetrix (97.Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by Superscript II primed with oligo(dT) coupled to the T7 promoter. Doublestranded cDNA was captured using QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and used as the template for in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (MEGAscript T7 kit, Ambion) in the presence of biotin-UTP and -CTP. These biotin-cRNA transcripts were collected on RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and then hydrolyzed to 50-100-nucleotide fragments by 10 mm MgCl2 at 95 °C for 35 min. Ten-μg aliquots of these probes were hybridized at 45 °C for 16 h to the Affymetrix RGU34A arrays. After washing, signals were visualized with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin using a fluorescence scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Microarray Analysis—In pilot experiments we confirmed the sequence of several microarray probes by mass spectrometry, verified their specificity toward their intended transcript by BLAST search, and optimized the normalization and analysis methodologies such that a high correlation (r2 = 0.91) between microarray and quantitative realtime RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) data were achieved (data not shown). Data were normalized using the hybridization intensities of multiple housekeeping genes. Then the normalized mean fluorescent intensity for each probeset (probesets consist of 16-25 oligonucleotides) was compared between experiments using the SAFER algorithm (100.Holder D. Pikounis V. Raubertas R. Svetnik V. Soper K. Proceedings of the American Statistical Association. Statistical Analysis of High Density Oligonucleotide Arrays: A SAFER Approach, August 2001. American Statistical Association, Atlanta, Georgia2001Google Scholar). In this approach the inherent variability of each probeset is determined (in this case, based on 18 hybridizations of different VP RNA samples) and used to assign a probability that the normalized mean signal from probesets significantly varied from controls by ANOVA. For a transcript to be considered differentially expressed: 1) the hybridization signals must have exceeded the experimentally determined background, and 2) must have tested different from vehicle control (p < 0.05) at both 6 and 24 h with an absolute difference of >1.5-fold normalized fluorescent intensity units at one of those time points. Gene names were determined by BLAST search of GenBank™ sequences. Probesets directed toward sequences that were not ≥90% homologous to a known full-length gene were excluded. Functional Clustering—Genes were then grouped by function. First, genes encoding enzymes involved in specific biochemical pathways (e.g. hexokinase II) were placed into a functional category annotating the metabolic process (e.g. glycolysis). Each remaining gene was analyzed extensively using the primary literature at NCBI PubMed to determine the commonly accepted function of each gene product. In cases where gene products perform multiple functions, the best documented or most prostate-relevant function was subjectively determined. Each functional category was then assigned to a general category (e.g. glycolysis is included in general metabolism), and in some cases these general categories were further grouped (e.g. lipid metabolism and general metabolism were grouped into metabolism). Signal transduction and transcription factor genes were not assigned to subcategories, because their protein products often function in multiple cellular processes. Quantitative RT-PCR—Gene-specific primers and probes (Applied Biosystems) were (F, forward; R, reverse; P, probe; all probes labeled 5′ with 6-Fam and 3′ with TAMRA): IGF-1 (F, CACAGCTCCCGGAAGCAACA; R, CCATGGCTCCAGCATTCG; P, CAATGCCCGTCTGTGGTGCCC); Egr-1 (F, CCATGAACGCCCGTATGC; R, CATGCAGATTCGACACTGGAA; P, TCGCCGCTTTTCTCGCTCGGAT); adrenomedullin (F, GAGCACAGCCCACATTCGA; R, CCCAAAGCGGCATCCA; P, CGCTACCGCCAGAGCATGAACCA); Golgi SNAP (F, ACTCTGGCCAACCGCTTTC; R, CGCCGCTTCCTAAGGTTGA; P, CGCCGTCAACAGCCTGATACAAAGG); SREBP-1C (F, CTGGCCAATGGACTACTAGTGTTG; R, GGAGTGTGGCCTGGTCACA; P, CCTGCTTGGCTCTTCTCTTTGTCTACGGG); cyclin D1 (F, TGCTTCTGGTGAACAAGCTCAA; R, CGCCTCTGGCATTTTGGA; P, AACCTGGCCGCCATGACTCCC); calnexin (F, GAGCGTCCATGGCTTTGG; R, GCAGAAGAGGATCACAAGGAACA; P, TGGTCTACATTCTGACTGTAGCGTTGCCA); squalene epoxidase (F, CCCACTTCGTTGGCTTCATT; R, ATGAGAACTGGACTGGGATCGA; P, ACCACAGTTTAAAGCCAATTTCGCGGA); and human p53 (Applied Biosystems). 75 ng of total RNA from pooled vehicle or DHT-treated prostates (9 per sample) were analyzed using a Sequence Detector 7700 using the manufacturer's protocols (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Average Ct values from duplicate PCR were normalized to average Ct values for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the same cDNA preparations. The ratio of each RNA in DHT-treated versus vehicle-treated samples was calculated as: 2-(meanΔΔCt) of that treatment as recommended by PerkinElmer. Significant differences were determined as previously described (98.Sun H. Xu J. Della Penna K.B. Benz R.J. Kinose F. Holder D.J. Koblan K.S. Gerhold D.L. Wang H. BMC Neurosci. 2002; 3: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Histomorphometry—Ventral prostates were collected from 3 vehicletreated and 3 DHT-treated orchidectomized (ORX) rats, then fixed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histomorphometric analyses used the Bioquant Nova V4 semiautomated image analysis system (R&M Biometrics, Nashville, TN). To determine distance from nuclei to luminal surface 10 epithelial cells from 10 glandular structures were measured from each specimen. For cell proportion 6 glandular structures from each specimen were analyzed by counting all nuclei within the basal lamina (considered “epithelial”) and those outside the basal lamina (“stromal”). These numbers were expressed as a ratio then averaged for each section and tested for significance by ANOVA. Cell Culture and Protein Analysis—For prostate samples, tissue was collected frozen in liquid nitrogen, and proteins were extracted in 2% SDS. LNCaP cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI medium 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were treated for 24 h with 5α-DHT or OH-flutamide (Sigma), with or without 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), then fractionated into cytosolic or nuclear fractions by homogenization in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g, then the supernatant was removed, and nuclear proteins were extracted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and protease inhibitors on ice for 1 h. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce), then equal amounts of protein were mixed 1:1 with 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved on 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Coomassie staining of replicate gels verified equal loading. p53 was detected by anti-p53 monoclonal (Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and chemiluminescent detection (Pierce). Results were quantified with a densitometer (Bio-Rad) and tested for significance using ANOVA. Immunofluorescence was performed in LNCaP using standard procedures with anti-p53 (Sigma), propidium iodide, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Bioinformatics Search for Potential Androgen Response Elements— The strategy for finding putative androgen response elements (AREs) is similar to the weight matrix searching method employed by the TESS software (99.Schug, J., and Overton, C. (1997) Technical Report CBIL-TR-1997-1001 Version 0.0, Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of PennsylvaniaGoogle Scholar). A list of 28 experimentally defined AREs was compiled (see Supplemental Materials Table II). The aligned AREs were used to generate a weight matrix of log base 2 nucleotide frequencies at each position. A pseudocount of 0.1 was added to each nucleotide occurrence. Query sequences were scored by summing the individual nucleotide positions and normalizing to the range of possible scores, such that the quality of the match was reported as a number between 0 and 100. Putative AREs were searched in 5′ upstream regions of genes of interest. For each rat gene, mouse and human orthologs were identified based on LocusLink 2www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink. assignments. The 5′ transcript ends were approximated from available RefSeq mRNAs available in the public data bases. 5 kb of upstream sequences were generated from the University of Southern California genome assemblies, 3genome.ucsc.edu. January 2003 release (rat), February 2003 (mouse), and April 2003 (human). Each 5-kb upstream sequence was scanned with the ARE weight matrix and the top 10 scoring sequence elements were compared among orthologous genes with respect to score, position relative to the transcript start, and nucleotide sequence. Experimental Strategy—To identify genes that are immediately downstream of AR and thus control cell growth and differentiation, DHT or vehicle alone were given to ORX rats and RNA samples were collected after 6 and 24 h. DHT was chosen as the ligand because, unlike testosterone, it cannot be aromatized and activate estrogen receptors. This time period precedes revascularization and mitosis (12.Franck-Lissbrant I. Haggstrom S. Damber J.E. Bergh A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13.Waltregny D. Leav I. Signoretti S. Soung P. Lin D. Merk F. Adams J.Y. Bhattacharya N. Cirenei N. Loda M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 765-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which occur 2-3 days after androgen repletion. To confirm that the VP were collected prior to rapid growth, we measured the effects of DHT on VP weighting ORX rats after 6 h, 24 h, and 17 days. Prostate weight was completely restored after 17 days, confirming that this dose of DHT is fully effective. However, no significant change in prostate weight was observed after 6 or 24 h of DHT treatment (Fig. 1A). Histological examination revealed no gross changes in cell proportion or vascularization (Fig. 1B), and histomorphometric analysis confirmed that the proportion of nuclei in the epithelial layer to nuclei in the stromal layer was not different (Fig. 1C). DHT did, however, produce a significant increase in the distance from the luminal surface to the epithelial nuclei (Fig. 1C). These data confirm that the VP samples were derived from similar proportions of the most abundant cell types, but also show that the DHT-treated VP were in the early stages of epithelial reorganization and differentiation. Identification of Androgen-responsive Genes—VP were collected from 3 groups of 3 animals from each of the 4 treatment groups (vehicle 6 h, vehicle 24 h, DHT 6 h, and DHT 24 h) so that the gene expression experiments could be performed on triplicate independent RNA samples. Using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays, the relative abundance of ∼7000 transcripts was then measured. The mean signal intensity of each transcript was tested for significant difference from time-matched controls using error models specific for each gene. Transcripts were considered to be regulated if the mean hybridization signals were different (p < 0.05) at both 6 and 24 h from their corresponding vehicle controls, and were at least 1.5-fold regulated at one time point. To allow functional interpretation of the data, only genes that encode for a known protein were included. 234 genes met these criteria and are presented in Supplemental Materials Table I. Reproducibility of Gene Expression Data—To assess the reproducibility of the hybridization data, we analyzed the primary literature and tested a subset of genes in a replication experiment. First, the regulation of at least 29 of the 234 genes is supported by published data (Supplemental Materials Table I, bold type). Then 8 genes with various levels of regulation were evaluated by QRT-PCR in an independent group of animals. All 8 genes showed similar changes in expression in both experiments, and there is quantitative correlation between QRT-PCR and microarray results (Fig. 2). Thus the criteria used for data mining produced reproducibly regulated genes, with the caveat that a small fraction might falsely appear regulated because of Type I statistical error (predicted to be less than 1 transcript) or infidelity of the oligonucleotide probes. Functional Categorization of Regulated Genes—We then mined published literature to organize the androgen-responsive genes into functional clusters so that the effects of androgens on whole genetic pathways could be studied. Each gene was extensively reviewed for its potential role in prostate physiology by analyzing human and rodent genetic data, biochemical studies, and experiments conducted in cultured prostate and other cells. After this manual data mining exercise, genes were grouped according to function (Fig. 3). To describe the behavior of genes within functional groups, genes were assigned to one of three temporal categories (maximal at 6 h, approximately equal at both 6 and 24 h, and maximal at 24 h), and scored as either induced or repressed. This analysis allows for a characterization of the first 24 h following AR activation in the VP. Consistent with the effects of androgens on prostatic secretory activity (14.Schoonees R. Reynoso G. Murphy G.P. J. Surg. Oncol. 1972; 4: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), over one-third of the rapidly regulated genes function in the various steps of polypeptide synthesis, maturation, trafficking, and degradation (26.5%), are involved in vesicle trafficking, or encode secreted proteins (10.3%). The majority of these genes were upregulated. A second major effect of DHT is the metabolic activation of the prostate. 59 (25.2%) of the genes encode proteins involved in metabolic processes; 17 of which are involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Finally, 84 (34.9%) of the regulated genes were classified as intercellular ligands, receptors, signal transducers, transcription factors, and cell cycle/apoptosis effectors. In contrast to protein synthesis and secretory genes, these clusters tended to have roughly equal proportions of induced and repressed genes, perhaps reflecting that both inductive and inhibitory mechanisms are important in prostate growth (see below). Finally, only a small proportion (2.1%) of the regulated genes were classified as involved in cell adhesion/extracellular matrix, in agreement with the absence of major morphological changes (Fig. 1). Thus prior to proliferation, DHT has profound effects on the expression of genes involved in secretory activity, metabolism, and intracellular signaling/signal transduction. Each of these major findings is explored below. Induction of Secretory Activity—AR activation in the androgen-depleted prostate induces epithelial reorganization (Fig. 1), consistent with the known androgenic control of seminal protein secretion by the prostate (15.Thompson S.A. Heidger Jr, P.M. Anat. Rec. 1978; 191: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16.Fischer T.V. Burkel W.E. Kahn R.H. Herwig K.R. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 382-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The microarray data reveals that the multiple steps in protein secretion are regulated at the level of gene expression by DHT (Supplemental Materials Table I). Nascent polypeptides targeted for secretion are accepted into the endoplasmic reticulum by the signal sequence receptor, glycosylated by the oligosaccharide transferase complex, folded by the activity of chaperones, and transported to the Golgi for additional processing and eventually exocytosis. All of these initial steps in polypeptide secretion appear to be up-regulated by AR: DHT induced the expression of genes that code for components of the signal sequence receptor (such as SSRΔ), the oligosaccharide transferase complex (ribophorins-1 and -2, defender against cell death-1, and glucosidase-1), and endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperones (e.g. calreticulin, protein-disulfide isomerase, and BiP). Many prostate secretory products undergo complex glycosylation, a process regulated by androgen levels (17.Reddy P.R. Tadolini B. Wilson J. Williams-Ashman H.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1976; 5: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine β1,4-galactosyl-transferase, and α1,3-fucosyltransferase were induced greater than 15-fold at 24 h and thus are likely to be involved in complex modification of seminal proteins. Furthermore, 17 genes involved in vesicle trafficking were induced, most of which function in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. Notably these genes include the ADP-ribosylation factors Arf3, Arf4, and Arl1, as well as the Golgi protein gene p115. Because these proteins induce Golgi biogenesis (18.Lu L. Horstmann H. Ng C. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4543-4555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Puthenveedu M.A. Linstedt A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), an effect of androgens in prostate epithelial cells (15.Thompson S.A. Heidger Jr, P.M. Anat. Rec. 1978; 191: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), they might function in the expansion of the secretory apparatus. These data together indicate that AR rapidly promotes the formation of an active secretory pathway at the level of gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W1500780819,"The oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent infection membrane protein 1 (LMP1) constitutively activates the 'canonical' NF-kappaB pathway that involves the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha downstream of the IkappaB kinases (IKKs). In this study, we show that LMP1 also promotes the proteasome-mediated proteolysis of p100 NF-kappaB2 resulting in the generation of active p52, which translocates to the nucleus in complex with the p65 and RelB NF-kappaB subunits. LMP1-induced NF-kappaB transactivation is reduced in nf-kb2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts, suggesting that p100 processing contributes to LMP1-mediated NF-kappaB transcriptional effects. This pathway is likely to operate in vivo, as the expression of LMP1 in primary EBV-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma biopsies correlates with the nuclear accumulation of p52. Interestingly, while the ability of LMP1 to activate the canonical NF-kappaB pathway is impaired in cells lacking IKKgamma/NEMO, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, p100 processing remains unaffected. As a result, nuclear translocation of p52, but not p65, occurs in the absence of IKKgamma. These data point to the existence of a novel signalling pathway that regulates NF-kappaB in LMP1-expressing cells, and may thereby play a role in both oncogenic transformation and the establishment of persistent EBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2140949058,"The nuclear atpC1 gene encoding the γ subunit of the plastid ATP synthase has been inactivated by T-DNA insertion mutagenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the seedling-lethal dpa1 (deficiency of plastid ATP synthase 1) mutant, the absence of detectable amounts of the γ subunit destabilizes the entire ATP synthase complex. The expression of a second gene copy, atpC2, is unaltered in dpa1 and is not sufficient to compensate for the lack of atpC1 expression. However, in vivo protein labeling analysis suggests that assembly of the ATP synthase α and β subunits into the thylakoid membrane still occurs in dpa1. As a consequence of the destabilized ATP synthase complex, photophosphorylation is abolished even under reducing conditions. Further effects of the mutation include an increased light sensitivity of the plant and an altered photosystem II activity. At low light intensity, chlorophyll fluorescence induction kinetics is close to those found in wild type, but non-photochemical quenching strongly increases with increasing actinic light intensity resulting in steady state fluorescence levels of about 60% of the minimal dark fluorescence. Most fluorescence quenching relaxed within 3 min after dark incubation. Spectroscopic and biochemical studies have shown that a high proton gradient is responsible for most quenching. Thylakoids of illuminated dpa1 plants were swollen due to an increased proton accumulation in the lumen. Expression profiling of 3292 nuclear genes encoding mainly chloroplast proteins demonstrates that most organelle functions are down-regulated. On the contrary, the mRNA expression of some photosynthesis genes is significantly up-regulated, probably to compensate for the defect in dpa1.

On the contrary, the mRNA expression of some photosynthesis genes is significantly up-regulated, probably to compensate for the defect in dpa1. In oxygenic photosynthesis light-dependent electron transport from water to NADP+ is coupled to synthesis of ATP (photophosphorylation) and energetically mediated by a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. Photophosphorylation, which essentially resembles oxidative phosphorylation, is carried out at the thylakoid membrane of photosynthetic eubacteria and chloroplasts and is catalyzed by a proton-translocating reversible ATPase (“ATP synthase”). The basic organization, structure, and composition of this protein complex have been extensively investigated on the eubacterial level as well as in mitochondria and plastids and were found to be vastly conserved (1.Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplast and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1998: 477-500Google Scholar, 2.Groth G. Pohl E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The plastid ATP synthase complex consists of nine different subunits, four of them are localized in the membrane integral CF0 subcomplex (a, b, b′, and c14) which is responsible for proton translocation, and five subunits constitute the extrinsic CF1 subcomplex (α3, β3, γ, δ, and ϵ) which forms the catalytic entity (3.Groth G.

Three independent studies proved the rotation of the γ subunit relative to (αβ)3 during ATP hydrolysis in the isolated F1 (5.Ducan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13448-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The γ subunit is responsible for the so-called “thiol modulation” or “redox modulation” due to two Cys residues able to form an intrapeptide disulfide bond (9.Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon reduction, the activation profile of ATP synthase is shifted toward lower proton gradients (10.Ketcham S.R. Davenport J.W. Warncke K. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7286-7293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Junesch U. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The seven amino acids Cys199–Cys205 (numbering in Arabidopsis) are present only in land plants and green algae as in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (10.Ketcham S.R. Davenport J.W. Warncke K. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7286-7293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Ross S.A. Zhang M.X. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9813-9818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, differences in the redox regulation mechanism have been pointed out between algae and higher plants (13.Ort D.R. Oxborough K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 269-291Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whereas in higher plants the re-oxidation of CF1, following a light-dark transition, takes over 1 h, in the alga Dunaliella salina CF1 is several times faster re-oxidized by a specific endogenous oxidant (14.Selman-Reimer S. Duke R.J. Stockman B.J. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 182-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only recently redox modulation of the γ rotation has also been reported (15.Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In bacteria the genes for the two subcomplexes are organized in separate operons suggesting that the enzyme evolutionarily derived from a proton channel (F0) and an ATPase (F1) (16.Falk G. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The organization of the genes reflects also a possible mechanism of assembly. The bacterial F0 and F1 accumulate independently and associate then to the membrane to assemble a functional complex (17.Klionsky D.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11207-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, only little is known about the assembly of the chloroplast enzyme (1.Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplast and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1998: 477-500Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas neither CF0 nor CF1 is assembled, although the unimpaired polypeptides are synthesized, if one of the nine subunits is missing. Several mutants in Chlamydomonas affected in different chloroplast-encoded subunits of the ATP synthase have been used to characterize the assembly process (18.Wollman F.A. Minai L. Nechushtai R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 21-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis two genes, atpC1 and atpC2 (accession numbers M61741 and J05761, respectively), located on chromosomes 4 and 1, respectively, encode for the plastid γ subunit (19.Inohara N. Iwamoto A. Moriyama Y. Shimomura S. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7333-7338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Legen J. Misera S. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In plants grown under continuous illumination, atpC1 is much higher expressed than atpC2 (19.Inohara N. Iwamoto A. Moriyama Y. Shimomura S. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7333-7338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two AtpC proteins in Arabidopsis share 73% sequence homology, whereas the homology of the AtpC subunits between other plants and AtpC1 in Arabidopsis is about 88 ± 4%. This raises the intriguing question about the role(s) of the two atpC gene copies in Arabidopsis, and whether the two genes possess distinct functions and under which physiological conditions they become operative. Proton efflux through the plastid ATP synthase, associated with ATP synthesis, results in an accelerated relaxation of the electric field-associated absorption change at 518 nm (21.Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 505: 355-427Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This property has been used to identify coupling factor reduction mutants in Arabidopsis which grow poorly in dim light and showed slowed ΔA518 decay after light-dark transition (22.Gabrys H. Kramer D.M. Crofts A.R. Ort D.R Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One coupling factor quick recovery mutant, cfq, contains an E244D point mutation in the γ subunit leading to a decreased acidification of the lumen compared with wild type in the initial few minutes of the induction period under subsaturating light conditions. This mutant has been used to correlate non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching (NPQ) 1The abbreviations used are: NPQ, non-photochemical quenching; chl, chlorophyll; PAM, pulse amplitude modulation; PSI and PSII, photosystem I and II, respectively; QA, primary electron acceptor quinones of PSII; qE, high energy quenching; WT, wild type; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; T-DNA, transfer DNA; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. with ΔpH (23.Govindjee Spilotro P. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study we have identified the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant dpa1 in which the atpC1 gene has been inactivated by T-DNA insertion. The mutant has been characterized on the level of accumulation, activity, and assembly of ATP synthase. Deficiency of the γ subunit leads to loss of ATP synthesis and unusual NPQ which is much below the dark Fo level due to proton accumulation in the lumen. The pattern of mRNA expression of nuclear genes coding for chloroplast proteins in dpa1 is interpreted as a compensatory effect. Plant Material, Growth Conditions, and Mutant Selection—Seed sterilization and growth conditions of dpa1 and wild type were as described (24.Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with the exception that only 1.4% (w/v) sucrose has been supplemented to the medium. Seedlings were grown under continuous light at a photon flux density of 20 μmol photons m–2 s–1 and at a constant temperature of 21 °C if not otherwise indicated. Prior to illumination, plates were placed for 2 days at 4 °C to synchronize germination. Propagation of the dpa1 mutant occurred via heterozygous offsprings. All comparisons between mutant and wild type were carried out with leaf material of the same developmental stage. Individual mutant plants of segregants grown in Petri dishes have been identified by chlorophyll (chl) fluorescence video imaging (FluorCam 690M; Photon Systems Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic). The FluorCam software package (protocol for quenching analysis) has been used to follow the chl fluorescence induction and to determine fluorescence parameters and PSII yield. The dpa1 mutant could easily be distinguished from wild type plants due to a strong NPQ (see below). Molecular Mapping and Complementation Studies—F1 populations were produced by pollinating emasculated flowers of the accession Landsberg erecta with Wassilewskija plants heterozygous for the dpa1 mutation. F2 families selected for the mutant offsprings were grown on medium, and individual mutant plants were chosen for genetic mapping of the mutation with molecular markers. The oligonucleotides 5′-CAGTCGAATCTTGATGACCGTCGATGATG-3′ and 5′-GTTCGTCGAGAATCAGAGTGGCTC-3′ were used as a simple sequence length polymorphism marker Cer452226 (25.Jander G. Norris S.R. Rounsley S.D. Bush D.F. Levin I.M. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) located 850 kb upstream of the atpC1 gene on the bacterial artificial chromosome F4C21. This marker is polymorphic between Landsberg and Wassilewskija producing 203- and 285-bp PCR products, respectively. The full-length coding sequence of the intron-less atpC1 gene was amplified by Pfu polymerase from wild type genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-AACAAAAAAATGGCTTGCTCTAATCTAACA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAGAGGGTTCTAGACAAATCAAACCTGTGC-3′, which inserts an XbaI restriction site at the 3′-end of the gene. The XbaI-digested and -purified PCR product was ligated into the SmaI/XbaI sites of the binary vector pS001-VS under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S rRNA promoter (26.Reiss B. Klemm M. Kosak H. Schell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3094-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Successful cloning was verified by sequencing. The construct was introduced into progenies of plants that segregate the mutation via Agrobacterium using the floral dip method (27.Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformant plants were efficiently selected on rock wool (Grodan, Hobro, Denmark) immersed in 10 mg/liter sulfadiazine prior to spreading the seeds (28.Hadi M.Z. Kemper E. Wendeler E. Reiss B. Plant Cell Rep. 2002; 21: 130-135Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For PCR analysis of transformed lines (see Fig. 1) the following primers have been used: Atactr (5′-GCTCATTCTGTCGGCGATTCCAGG-3′) and Atactf (5′-TCCTAGTATTGTGGGTCGTCCTCG-3′) of the actin3 gene as a control; primer 1 (5′-CGAACCATCCACTAATACCCAGCC-3′) of the atpC1 promoter; primer 2 (5′-CGTCTCTTCGTGAGCTCAGAGACCGTATCG-3′) of the 5′ atpC1 coding region; primer 3 (5′-GCATAGATGCACTCGAAATCAGCC-3′) of the left border of the T-DNA; primer 4 (5′-GGTGATAAAGGCAGTAGCGTGTGGATCACG-3′) of the 3′ atpC1 coding region; and primer Pv (5′-GCCATCGTTGAAGATGCCTCTGCCG-3′) of the 35S promoter. Northern and Southern Analyses—Total RNA and DNA were isolated and subjected to Northern and Southern analysis, respectively, as described (24.Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29.Steiner J.J. Poklema C.J. Fjellstrom R.G. Elliott L.F.

Hybridizations with 32P-labeled probes were carried out for 1 h at 68 °C in Rapid Hybridization Buffer (Amersham Biosciences). The signals were analyzed on autoradiographs using Fuji Bio Imaging plates type BASIII, a Fuji Bio Imaging analyzer, and the Aida software package (Raytest, Sprockhövel/Germany). Probes for atpH/I, atpF, atpA, and atpC1 used for Northern analysis were as described (32.Meurer J. Lezhneva L. Amann K. Gödel M. Bezhani S. Sherameti I. Oelmuller R. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3255-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To confirm the array expression data, probes for petC, psbS, lhcB6, and psaD1 genes were used in Northern analysis. The full-length cDNAs obtained from the ABRC (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State) were amplified using the vectorial (pZL1, Invitrogen) forward primer 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′. Real Time PCR Technique—The LightCycler Thermal Cycler System (Roche Applied Science) was used to perform quantitative two-step reverse transcriptase-PCR for atpC1, atpC2 mRNA, and 18S rRNA applying the SYBR Green protocol (33.Wittwer C.T. Ririe K.M. Andrew R.V. David D.A. Gundry R.A. Balis U.J. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesis was carried out with total RNA using SuperScript II RNase H– Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and hexanucleotides according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Primer combinations specific for the 5′-ends of atpC1 (primer 2 and 5′-GGTTAAGGGAACATCGACATCATCGG-3′), atpC2 (5′-GCTTCGAGCTCAGAGTCCTACTCTT-3′ and 5′-CCAGTAACAACAACCAAAGCAACTCTC-3′), and the 18S rRNA (5′-GCTCAAAGCAAGCCTACGCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-GGACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTCGAGCC-3′) were chosen. After addition of MgCl2 (4 mm) and template cDNA to the master mix, an initial denaturation step followed by 45 cycles of denaturation (95 °C for 15 s), annealing (58 °C, atpC1 and atpC2, or 63 °C, 18S rRNA for 5 s) and extension (72 °C for 1 s/20 bp) were performed. All ramp rates were set to 20 °C per s. Serially diluted samples of Arabidopsis genomic DNA, corresponding to 15 ng to 1.5 pg, were used for calibration. Specific amplification has been confirmed by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Photophosphorylation—Chloroplast thylakoids from Arabidopsis leaves were prepared as described for spinach (34.Strotmann H. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 460: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The reactions were conducted in a ΔpH clamp instrument as described (35.Strotmann H. Thelen R. Müller W. Baum W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction cell of 2.5-ml volume contained a medium consisting of 25 mm Tricine buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm32P-labeled Na2HPO4, 50 mm KCl, 50 μm phenazine methosulfate, and thylakoids corresponding to a chl concentration of 25 μg/ml. The experiments were conducted at pre-chosen ΔpH values (35.Strotmann H. Thelen R. Müller W. Baum W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36.Kothen G. Schwarz O. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 208-214Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) which were kept constant throughout the experiment by the employed clamp device. ΔpH was continuously controlled by the fluorescence quenching of 9-aminoacridine. The fluorescence signal was calibrated as described (37.Schwarz O. Strotmann H. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 287-295Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The thylakoids were pre-illuminated for 2 min to obtain the prechosen proton gradient. Then 0.5 mm ADP was added in the light. After 10, 20, and 30 s, 0.2-ml samples were taken and deproteinized by HClO4 (final concentration 0.6 m). The formed 32P-labeled organic phosphate was determined as described (38.Avron M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 40: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Immmunological and Translation Analyses—Thylakoid membrane proteins of 3-week-old plants were isolated as described (39.Meurer J. Berger A. Westhoff P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1193-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified (40.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and samples were heated for 5 min at 80 °C in 2% SDS mixed with 1/10 volume of glycerol/dye solution and immediately applied onto SDS-PAGE at 30 mA for 12–15 h at room temperature. The protein pattern was visualized in silver-stained gels (41.Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). For immuno-detection, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Pall Biodyne, Dreieich, Germany) by semi-dry electroblotting (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). The membranes were incubated with antisera raised against thylakoid membrane proteins, and signals were identified by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences). Most of the antibodies used in this study were raised in rabbits against Chlamydomonas or spinach polypeptides (24.Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For in vivo labeling analysis intact leaves of 3-week-old plants were immersed in a ½× MS solution containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 20 min (42.Meurer J. Plücken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Subsequently, thylakoid membrane proteins were isolated, subjected to SDS gel electrophoreses, and transferred to PVDF membranes. Incorporation was detected by fluorography (43.Laskey R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Sample preparations for ultrastructural analysis and electron microscopy were performed as described (44.Swiatek M. Regel R.E. Meurer J. Wanner G. Pakrasi H.B. Ohad I. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 268: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fluorometric and Absorption Studies—chl a fluorescence measurements were performed with 3-week-old plants using a commercial pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer PAM 101 interphased with the PAM data acquisition system PDA-100 (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). The fiber optic was held 2 mm distant from the upper side of plants grown under sterile conditions in Petri dishes. Leaves were dark-adapted for 5 min prior to the induction fluorescence measurements. The minimal (Fo), steady state (Fs), and maximal (Fm) fluorescence yield, and the variable fluorescence (Fv), calculated as (Fm – Fo), as well as the ratio Fv/Fm, which reflects the potential yield of the photochemical reaction of PSII (45.Krause G.H. Weis E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 313-349Crossref Scopus (3695) Google Scholar), were recorded at 20 °C, unless noted otherwise. Photochemical quenching and NPQ was determined as described (46.van Kooten O. Snel J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). The intensity of the saturating light flash (800 ms) used for detection of Fm and the maximal fluorescence during induction, Fm′, was 4000 μmol photons m–2 s–1. For nigericin studies, leaves of 3-week-old plants were harvested and cut into small pieces with a sharp razor blade at 4 °C in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 330 mm sorbitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2% (w/v) defatted bovine serum albumin. The resuspension buffer was supplied with 0.1 mm methylviologen as an electron acceptor in all samples and, when indicated, with 2 μm nigericin as a ionophore (47.Nishio J.N. Whitmarsh J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Expression Profiling Using Nuclear Arrays—The 3292 gene sequence tags array representing genes known or predicted to code for proteins having a chloroplast transit peptide has been described previously (48.Kurth J. Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Biehl A. Richly E. Salamini F. Leister D. Planta. 2002; 215: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 49.Richly E. Dietzmann A. Biehl A. Kurth J. Laloi C. Apel K. Salamini F. Leister D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). At least three experiments with different filters and independent cDNA probes derived from plant material corresponding to pools of at least 50 individuals were performed for each condition or genotype tested, thus minimizing variations between individual plants, filters, or probes. cDNA probes were synthesized by using a mixture of oligonucleotides matching the 3292 genes in antisense orientation as primer, and hybridized to the gene sequence tags array as described previously (48.Kurth J. Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Biehl A. Richly E. Salamini F. Leister D. Planta. 2002; 215: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 49.Richly E. Dietzmann A. Biehl A. Kurth J. Laloi C. Apel K. Salamini F. Leister D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Images were read using the Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization images were imported into the ArrayVision program (version 6; Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada) and statistically evaluated (Bonferroni-adjusted significance test corresponding to a confidence interval of 0.9999), using the Array-Stat program (version 1.0 Rev. 2.0; Imaging Research). Normalization of data was performed with reference to all spots on the array as described previously (48.Kurth J. Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Biehl A. Richly E. Salamini F. Leister D. Planta. 2002; 215: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 49.Richly E. Dietzmann A. Biehl A. Kurth J. Laloi C. Apel K. Salamini F. Leister D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous—Basic molecular biology methods were performed as described (31.Sambrook J. Ftitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.1-9.62Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (50.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar). Energy transfer fluorochrome dideoxynucleotide labeling (51.Rosenblum B.B. Lee L.G. Spurgeon S.L. Khan S.H. Menchen S.M. Heiner C.R. Chen S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4500-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) was used for detection of sequencing products using the ABI 377 system (Applied Biosystems). Identification and Phenotype of the Dpa1 Mutant—The F2 progeny of 1100 EMS-treated seeds and 75 preselected pale mutants from T-DNA collections (53.Felmann K.A. Plant J. 1991; 1: 71-82Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar) obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) have been used for screening. 87 mutant plants were selected by their non-photoautotrophic growth on soil. They developed pale green cotyledons but no primary leaves. Cultivation on sucrose-supplemented MS medium (52.Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar) often rescued the mutant seedlings, leading to a nearly normal pigmentation and development. Under these conditions the mutants could often hardly be distinguished from wild type plants, although growth rates were slightly retarded. Seven plants showing a high dark level of fluorescence (Fo) but a lower level during induction were selected from the collection by imaging analysis (Fig. 1A). In six plants the lowest fluorescence level became apparent after about 1–2 min, and the fluorescence again slowly increased close to the Fo level during induction. This unusual fluorescence behavior we have already observed previously in several high chlorophyll fluorescence (hcf) mutant plants (24.Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In one mutant, dpa1, light-dependent quenching of Fo was stable during induction. Therefore, we have chosen dpa1 for the present study. This increased NPQ was indicative of photosynthetic electron transport activity in dpa1 in contrast to a high chlorophyll fluorescence phenotype of photosystem I mutants such as hcf101 (Fig. 1A) (24.Meurer J. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Planta. 1996; 198: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The screened seedling lethal dpa1 mutant of A. thaliana, accession Wassilewskija, originated from the T-DNA insertion collection. Inactivation of the atpC1 Gene—Initially, we have tried to isolate flanking genomic regions of the right border of the T-DNA by inverse PCR. Each attempt to get a specific product failed. We backcrossed the mutation in order to confirm the Mendelian segregation of dpa1, to remove possible background mutations and to generate a mapping population. The dpa1 mutation was mapped to the upper part of chromosome 4 by the use of the molecular Cer452226 marker closely located to atpC1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Forty-eight meiotic chromosomes of individual F2 mutant plants derived from backcrosses to the accession Landsberg have been used in this study. No recombinations have been identified, indicating that the dpa1 mutation is closely linked to the atpC1 gene. Southern analyses with genomic DNA from dpa1, wild type, and heterozygous plants using probes of the T-DNA left border and the atpC1 gene resulted in restriction fragment length polymorphisms showing that there is a T-DNA insertion in the region of atpC1 (data not shown). Due to the close location of the mutation to atp"
https://openalex.org/W1980640885,"RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the central enzyme of gene expression. Despite availability of crystal structures, details of its nucleotide addition cycle remain obscure. We describe bacterial RNAP inhibitors (the CBR703 series) whose properties illuminate this mechanism. These compounds inhibit known catalytic activities of RNAP (nucleotide addition, pyrophosphorolysis, and Gre-stimulated transcript cleavage) but not translocation of RNA or DNA when translocation is uncoupled from catalysis. CBR703-resistance substitutions occur on an outside surface of RNAP opposite its internal active site. We propose that CBR703 compounds inhibit nucleotide addition allosterically by hindering movements of active site structures that are linked to the CBR703 binding site through a bridge helix."

Such ""translational research"" activities, traditionally the province of the private sector, have long been compromised by high rates of attrition (failure during the course of preclinical or clinical development of therapeutics). Attrition has led to growing financial costs, as well as opportunity costs.

https://openalex.org/W2081427260,"Activation of Akt signalling pathway is frequently found in glioma cells and may contribute to their resistance to undergo apoptosis in response to conventional therapies. We found that cyclosporin A (CsA) induces apoptosis of C6 glioma cells, which is associated with transcriptional activation of fasL. In the present paper, we investigated an involvement of Akt signalling in the regulation of FasL expression in CsA-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated that the level of active Akt decreases significantly after CsA treatment, which results in the decrease of Forkhead phosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus. It correlated with an increase of binding to the Forkhead-responsive element FHRE from the FasL promoter, as demonstrated by gel-shift assays. Although treatment with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3 K, decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and increased Fkhr translocation to the nucleus, these events were not sufficient to induce FasL expression and apoptosis of C6 glioma cells. Interference with Akt/Forkhead signalling by membrane-targeted Akt or removal of the FKHR-binding sites from the FasL promoter significantly abolished its activation. These results indicate that downregulation of Akt signalling and activation of Forkhead is a prerequisite for the induction of FasL promoter. It may be clinically important for pharmacological intervention in gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W1581569435,"Mammary epithelial regeneration implies the existence of cellular progenitors with retained replicative capacity, prolonged lifespan and developmental potency. Evidence exists that ΔN-p63 isoforms preserve these features by modulating p53 activity in basal epithelia. ΔN-p63 mRNA levels decline at the onset of differentiation suggesting that its transcriptional regulation may contribute to the initiation of differentiation. To study transcriptional regulation of ΔN-p63, a 10.3 kbp fragment containing the ΔN-p63 promoter was isolated. We report here that ΔN-p63 is a positive and negative transcriptional target of p53 and ΔN-p63-α, respectively. Disruption of p53 activity or expression abolishes the expression of ΔN-p63-α. This regulation is mediated by a p53-binding element sufficient to confer these activities to a heterologous promoter. Chromatin immune-precipitation indicates that, in asynchronously growing cells, p53 occupies this element. In response to DNA damage, ΔN-p63-α is recruited to this element as transcription of ΔN-p63 declines. Disruption of ΔN-p63-α expression had differential effects on the transcriptional regulation of several p53-target genes. These findings indicate that p53 contributes to the preservation of basal epithelia by driving the expression of ΔN-p63 isoforms. These studies also suggest that in response to genotoxic stress, ΔN-p63-α mediates the silencing of its own promoter thereby altering the pattern of p53-target gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2085915219,"The activity of E2F transcription factors plays a crucial role in mammalian cell-cycle progression and is controlled by physical association with the pocket proteins (pRb and its related p107 and p130). The E2F1 promoter, which contains two overlapping E2F-binding sites, is activated at the G1/S transition in an E2F-dependent manner. Mutational experiments have shown that the distal E2F-binding site on the E2F1 promoter is required for transcriptional repression in the G0 phase, whereas the proximal E2F-binding site contributes to transcriptional activation at the G1/S boundary. Consistent with these results, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have revealed that the E2F4/p130 repressor complex specifically binds to the distal E2F-binding site, whereas E2F1 and E2F3 activators preferentially bind to the proximal E2F-binding site. The assays also showed that the specific binding of E2F4/p130 complex to the distal site was dramatically impaired by a mutation introduced into the contiguous repression site (cell Cycle gene Homology Region; CHR). Taken together, these findings indicate that the two E2F-binding sites play distinct roles in the regulation of E2F1 transcription by interacting with different sets of E2F members and cooperating with the contiguous repressor element."
https://openalex.org/W2145911943,"Atovaquone is a substituted hydroxynaphthoquinone that is widely used to prevent and clear Plasmodium falciparum malaria and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Atovaquone inhibits respiration in target organisms by specifically binding to the ubiquinol oxidation site at center P of the cytochrome bc1 complex. The failure of atovaquone treatment and mortality of patients with malaria and P. jirovecii pneumonia has been linked to the appearance of mutations in the cytochrome b gene. To better understand the molecular basis of atovaquone resistance, we have introduced seven of the mutations from atovaquone-resistant P. jirovecii into the cytochrome b gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and thus obtained cytochrome bc1 complexes resistant to inhibition by atovaquone. In these enzymes, the IC50 for atovaquone increases from 25 nm for the enzyme from wild-type yeast to >500 nm for some of the mutated enzymes.

Atovaquone is now widely used as an important “second-line” therapy for prophylaxis and treatment of moderate cases of Pneumocystis infections (9.Chan C. Montaner J. Lefebvre E.A. Morey G. Dohn M.

Consequently, a multi-center study was conducted to determine the reasons for the failure of this therapeutic agent (11.Walker D. Wakefield A. Dohn M. Miller R. Baughman R. Hossler P. Bartlett M.

Atovaquone has been shown to be a potent and specific inhibitor of the cytochrome bc1 complex (13.Fry M. Pudney M. Biochem.

It appeared that mutations in the cytochrome b subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex of P. jirovecii were the cause of resistance to the drug. The relatively high frequency of spontaneously arising mutations that confer atovaquone resistance may be because the cytochrome b gene is located in the mitochondria where mutation rates are usually higher than in the nucleus due to the multi-copy nature of the mitochondrial genome.The similarities of P. jirovecii to ascomycete fungi and the lack of an in vitro culture system for P. jirovecii suggest that Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be a useful organism in which to model the molecular basis of atovaquone resistance in P. jirovecii (15.Bruns T.D.

There is a high degree of sequence identity in the regions of cytochrome b involved in atovaquone binding in the two fungal species, and the yeast is amenable to transformation of the mitochondrial genome (19.Fox T.D.

In addition, the cytochrome bc1 complex of S. cerevisiae can be purified and its crystal structure is available (22.Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Roβmanith T. Mitchel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Thus, we characterized the interaction of atovaquone with the yeast bc1 complex and developed a model of atovaquone binding to the ubiquinol oxidation pocket that accounts for the effects of this competitive inhibitor on the isolated enzyme (14.Kessl J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).We also recently developed a S. cerevisiae strain that is sensitive to atovaquone by deleting the genes for plasma membrane transporters that are otherwise responsible for efflux of the drug (23.Hill P.

Cytochrome b mutations associated with atovaquone resistance in P. jirovecii were then transferred into the atovaquone-sensitive S. cerevisiae by transformation of the mitochondrial genome. The resulting mutated yeast strains were atovaquone-resistant, and the cytochrome c reductase activities of the mitochondrial membranes exhibited significantly reduced sensitivity toward the drug (23.Hill P. Kessl J. Fisher N. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. Meunier B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we have isolated the cytochrome bc1 complexes from atovaquone-resistant yeast mutants and characterized the kinetic properties of the mutated enzymes and the interaction of the enzymes with atovaquone. We have also modeled the structural changes associated with the mutations in silico to describe the molecular basis of atovaquone resistance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Yeast extract and peptone were from Difco. Nitrogen base without amino acids but with ammonium sulfate was from U. S. Biological. Dodecylmaltoside was obtained from Roche Applied Science. DEAE-Biogel A was obtained from Bio-Rad. Diisopropylfluorophosphate, decyl ubiquinone, and dithionite were purchased from Sigma. Stigmatellin was purchased from Fluka Biochemica. Atovaquone was a gift from GlaxoSmithKline.Purification of and Assay of Cytochrome bc1 Complexes—The cytochrome b mutations were introduced into the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene by biolistic transformation as described elsewhere (23.Hill P. Kessl J. Fisher N. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. Meunier B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutated yeast strains were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium and harvested by centrifugation. Cytochrome bc1 complexes were then isolated from the yeast mitochondrial membranes as described previously (24.Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25.Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and concentrated by centrifugal filtration using Amicon® Centriprep YM-30 filtration tubes. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities of the purified cytochrome bc1 complexes were measured as described previously (14.Kessl J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis of Cytochrome bc1 Complexes—The Western blot analysis was performed using 2 pmol of purified cytochrome bc1 complexes from wild-type and mutated strains. The proteins were resolved in a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN® II apparatus. The membranes were probed for iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1 using monoclonal antibodies to the yeast proteins (26.Ljungdahl P.O. Beckmann J.D. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3723-3731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative amounts of iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1 were determined by scanning the Western blot and densitometry quantification using the NIH Image software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/).Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was carried out on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station using the commercially available Insight II® software package (Acclerys Inc., San Diego). The starting structure was the dimeric cytochrome bc1 complex from S. cerevisiae as determined by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.3 Å (Protein Data Bank code 1EZV) (22.Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Roβmanith T. Mitchel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Modeling was focused on two subunits, cytochrome b and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, along with buried water molecules. The six P. jirovecii cytochrome b mutations that conferred atovaquone resistance in yeast were built into the previously modeled atovaquone-bound center P site (14.Kessl J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using the Biopolymer® module. Prior to molecular dynamics and energy minimization, the manual rotamer function was used to select the most plausible starting conformation for each residue. All of the modeling was done using the CFF91 force-field and a central flexible subset of amino acid residues surrounded by a 9.5-Å shell of fixed residues including atovaquone. The most distant residues were excluded from calculation in the interest of speed.The mutations were divided into three modeling groups based on their proximity to atovaquone. The I147V, L150F, and L275F mutations were grouped together because of their direct interaction with atovaquone in the center P binding site. The flexible subsets for mutations L150F and L275F were defined by a 2.0-Å radius from the mutated residue to allow the pocket to accommodate the larger side chains. The flexible subset for mutation I147V consisted only of the mutated residue, because the mutation decreased the volume of the side chain. This minimal flexibility allowed evaluation of the energy cost that each mutation has on atovaquone binding. Using the same procedure as was used for the modeling of atovaquone into the wild-type structure (14.Kessl J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), four simulated annealing runs were carried out on each mutant structure.The T148I and S152A mutations were grouped together because of their locations in the cd1 helix facing away from the atovaquone binding pocket. The size of the flexible subsets was too great for effective simulated annealing modeling, so both mutations were modeled by molecular dynamics to equilibrium. The flexible subset consisted of the cd1 helix and its flanking loop regions. In the T148I model, a restraint was set up between Ser-152 and Lys-288 of cytochrome b to simulate the hydrogen bond connecting the ends of the cd1 and F1 helices. No restraint was used in the S152A model, because the mutation itself disrupted the hydrogen bond. The simulation temperature was kept constant at 800 K. Each simulation began with 5000 fentoseconds of equilibration using a 1.0-fentoseconds/iteration time step and the velocity scaling temperature control method. Molecular dynamics simulation was continued for an additional 50 picoseconds using a 0.5-fentoseconds/iteration time step and the more accurate Nosé temperature control method. Successful equilibration was judged by plotting both the running and batch averages for the total energy versus time. Equilibrium was reached when the batch-average energies oscillated smoothly around the constant running-average energy. Upon reaching equilibrium, the lowest energy structure from each run was selected for a full minimization using the same procedure as for the modeling of atovaquone in the wild-type structure.The P266L mutation was modeled individually because of its unique location in the ef loop outside the inner shell of residues that coordinate the bound atovaquone. In the first set of runs, the flexible subset consisted of ef loop residues 264–272, nearby Met-139, and adjacent water molecules. This subset was chosen to allow any changes in backbone and side-chain conformations in the P266L mutant to propagate into the atovaquone binding pocket. In contrast to the other five mutant models, atovaquone and the iron-sulfur protein were excluded from simulation. This was done to model the position of the ef loop of cytochrome b before the binding of atovaquone, at which point the iron-sulfur protein has moved away from the binding pocket into its c1 position. Several annealed dynamics runs were carried out on the unliganded P266L mutant structure and an unliganded wild-type control structure. The minimized results indicated that the P266L mutant endowed the ef loop with greater flexibility, allowing Ile-269 to move down into the binding pocket. Atovaquone and the iron-sulfur protein were reintroduced into the P266L and wild-type control models. In the final set of annealed dynamics runs, atovaquone and the iron-sulfur protein were fixed just as they were for the other five mutations. The flexible subset was focused to include only those residues from the first runs that came into direct contact with atovaquone.To estimate the energy cost of binding atovaquone, we calculated the energy of each mutant structure with atovaquone bound and compared that to the energy of the wild-type enzyme with atovaquone bound. The structure of the atovaquone binding pocket in each of the atovaquone-resistant mutant models was optimized using a unique subset of flexible residues based on the location and nature of the mutation. In contrast, to facilitate comparison of changes in binding energy, the energy calculation used a common subset that included atovaquone, the residue His-181 from the iron-sulfur protein, cytochrome b residues within 4.0 Å of the inhibitor, and cytochrome b residues within 4.0 Å of the residue Glu-272 of cytochrome b. This calculated energy contained non-bonding interactions (van der Waals and electrostatic) and internal conformational energies of atovaquone and adjacent pocket residues.RESULTSLocation of Cytochrome b Mutations in the Center P Ubiquinol Oxidation Pocket—The overall sequence identity of the cytochrome b subunits of the S. cerevisiae and P. jirovecii cytochrome bc1 complexes is ∼60%. In the regions of cytochrome b between amino acid residues 117–155 and 251–300 corresponding to the segments of the protein around the ubiquinol oxidation pocket where the resistance mutations occur in the P. jirovecii protein, the two cytochrome b sequences are 73% identical as shown in Fig. 1.The structure of the ubiquinol oxidation site at center P with atovaquone bound with the location of the amino acid resides that are affected in the atovaquone-resistant cytochrome b mutants is shown in Fig. 2. In this modeled structure, the hydroxyl group of the hydroxynaphthoquinone binds via a hydrogen bond to a imidazole nitrogen of His-181 of the Rieske protein (14.Kessl J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). On the opposite side of the ring system, the carbonyl group at position 4 on the quinone ring interacts via a water molecule with Glu-272 of cytochrome b. This structure accounts for the effects of atovaquone on the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and is also consistent with the crystal structure of the yeast bc1 complex with another hydroxyquinone bound in the center P pocket (27.Palsdottir H. Gomez Lojero C. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31303-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Stereoview of the atovaquone binding pocket of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex showing the location of mutations conferring resistance to atovaquone in P. jirovecii. A portion of cytochrome b including the cd1 and ef helices, the ef loop, and part of helix C is shown in cyan, and a portion of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein including the loops that coordinate the iron-sulfur cluster is shown in gold. The iron-sulfur cluster is at the top with iron and sulfur atoms colored purple and yellow, respectively. The hydroxynaphthoquinone ring of atovaquone points toward the front, and the chlorophenyl ring extends to the rear. The carbon atoms in atovaquone and His-181 of the Rieske protein are colored green, oxygen atoms are red, nitrogen atoms are blue, and hydrogen atoms are white. The cytochrome b residues that are changed in the atovaquone-resistant yeast mutants are colored purple.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As described below, the six P. jirovecii cytochrome b mutations showing atovaquone resistance were built into this previously modeled ubiquinol oxidation site at center P to analyze the structural changes resulting from the mutations. These six mutations are I147V, T148I, L150F, S152A, P266L, and L275F. Three of the amino acid residues (Ile-147, Leu-150, and Leu-275) that are mutated in the P. jirovecii cytochrome b interact directly with atovaquone in the modeled structure as shown in Fig. 2. Two of the affected residues, Ser-152 and Thr-148, are in the cd1 helix facing away from the atovaquone binding pocket. One residue, Pro-266, is in the ef loop outside the inner shell of residues that coordinates the bound atovaquone.Effect of Cytochrome b Mutations on Activities of the Cytochrome bc1 Complexes—We introduced seven mutations that have been linked to atovaquone resistance in P. jirovecii into the yeast cytochrome b gene (23.Hill P. Kessl J. Fisher N. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. Meunier B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities were measured in both mitochondrial membranes and the purified enzymes from each mutant and are summarized in Table I and Fig. 3. The activities of the bc1 complexes from most of the mutated strains increased by varying amounts relative to that in the membranes during purification of the enzymes. A similar increase during purification is seen with the enzyme from wild-type yeast and from bovine heart mitochondria (25.Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These increases in activity occur when the enzyme is dispersed from the membrane with detergent, which presumably results in better substrate accessibility to the enzyme. For this reason, we feel that measurements of activity and related kinetic parameters are more reliably represented with the purified enzymes.Table IKinetic parameters of cytochrome bc1 complexes from atovaquone-resistant yeast mutantsYeast strainskcatKmVms-1μms-1Wild type22013270T127I15NDNDI147V1208160T148I20013200L150F30NDNDS152A30NDNDP266L70985L275F20013280 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities of mitochondrial membranes and purified cytochrome bc1 complexes from atovaquone-resistant mutants.

Loss of iron-sulfur protein and/or damage to cytochrome b is the most common form of damage to the cytochrome bc1 complex during purification. Thus, we thus analyzed the purified enzymes by Western blots and optical absorption spectroscopy of the bc1 complexes from these strains. The Western blots (Fig. 4) and absorption spectra (data not shown) revealed that, with the exception of T127I, the mutations and the purification procedures neither affected the iron-sulfur protein subunit stoichiometry nor the heme composition of the bc1 complexes. The Western blots showed that the loss of activity during purification of the bc1 complex from the T127I mutant could be attributed to loss of iron-sulfur protein (Fig. 4). Because of the extensive loss of activity during purification of this bc1 complex and because the T127I mutant did not exhibit resistance to atovaquone (23.Hill P. Kessl J. Fisher N. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. Meunier B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the enzyme from this mutant was not further characterized.Fig. 4Immunoblot analysis of cytochrome bc1 complexes with cytochrome b mutations. Cytochrome bc1 complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the Western blot was probed with monoclonal antibodies against yeast iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1. The Western blot is shown at the top, and the relative amounts of iron-sulfur protein compared with cytochrome c1 determined by densitometry scanning of the Western blot are shown at the bottom. The relative amounts of cytochrome c1 were arbitrarily set to 100% to allow comparison of the samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Cytochrome b Mutations on Inhibition of the bc1 Complex by Atovaquone—Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities of the bc1 complexes from the wild-type and atovaquone-resistant yeast strains were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of atovaquone to test whether sensitivity of the enzymes to the bc1 inhibitor was altered by the cytochrome b mutations. Similar measurements were made with stigmatellin, another inhibitor that binds to the ubiquinol oxidation pocket at center P.We previously showed that atovaquone is a competitive inhibitor of the bc1 complex (14.Kessl J. Lange B.B. Merbitz-Zahradnick T. Zwicker K. Hill P. Meunier B. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31312-31318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and as shown in Fig. 5, it inhibits the activity of the bc1 complex from wild-type yeast with an IC50 of ∼25 nm. The cytochrome b mutations that confer atovaquone resistance to the yeast mutants alter the IC50 for inhibition of the bc1 complex by varying amounts. The T148I mutation has the smallest effect, and it increases the IC50 ∼2-fold to 60 nm. Interestingly, this mutation seems to impact on the yeast bc1 complex assembly because it caused a 30% decrease in cytochrome b content as estimated from optical spectra of whole cells (23.Hill P. Kessl J. Fisher N. Meshnick S. Trumpower B.L. Meunier B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The I147V, L150F, and P266L mutations increase the IC50 for inhibition of the bc1 complex to 150–300 nm. The L275F and S152A mutations increase the IC50 to 500–800 nm. This result corresponds to a 20-fold increase over that of the wild-type enzyme.Fig. 5Efficacy of inhibition of wild-type and mutated bc1 complexes by atovaquone and stigmatellin. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities of purified bc1 complexes were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of atovaquone or stigmatellin. Activities are expressed as a percentage of the activity of each bc1 complex in the absence of inhibitor, which are listed in Table I. The left panel shows inhibition of the enzymes by atovaquone, and the right panel shows inhibition by stigmatellin. Activities for the enzymes from the various yeast are indicated as follows: wild type (open circles); T148I (solid squares); I147V (crosses); L150F (solid triangles); P266L (open squares); L275F (open triangles); and S152A (solid circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The cytochrome b mutations had little or no effect on inhibition of the enzyme by stigmatellin. Interestingly, the T148I mutation, which had the smallest effect on inhibition of the enzyme by atovaquone, caused the largest change in IC50 for inhibition by stigmatellin. This lack of cross-resistance is discussed in more detail below.Because atovaquone is a competitive inhibitor of the bc1 complex, we also examined how the resistance mutations affected the interaction of the substrate with the enzyme. As can be seen in Table I, two of the mutations, T148I and L275F, had no significant effect on activity or Km for ubiquinol oxidation. There was a modest decrease in Km for ubiquinol oxidation in enzymes from two of the resistant mutants, I147V and P266L, and there was also a significant drop in activity of the enzymes from these two mutants. The L150F and S152A mutations caused the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities of the isolated bc1 complexes to drop to 5–10% of the activity of the enzyme from wild-type yeast. These activities were too low to permit accurate evaluation of the kinetic parameters for ubiquinol oxidation by the purified enzymes from these strains.Molecular Modeling of Structural Changes in Cytochrome b Caused by Mutations"
https://openalex.org/W1973116504,"Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play a central role in the integration of proliferative and survival responses of most mammalian cell types. IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) influences IGF action directly as a carrier of IGFs but also modulates these actions indirectly via independent mechanisms involving interactions with plasma, extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules, conditional proteolysis, cellular uptake, and nuclear transport. Here we demonstrate that a short C-terminal metal-binding domain (MBD) of IGFBP-3 mediates binding to metals. MBD epitopes, sequestered in the intact molecule, are unmasked by incubation in the presence of ferrous (but not ferric or zinc) ions. An isolated 14-mer MBD peptide triggered apoptotic effects in stressed HEK293 cells as effectively as IGFBP-3. The MBD, which encompasses a nuclear localization sequence and an adjacent putative caveolin-binding sequence, mobilizes rapid cellular uptake and nuclear localization of unrelated proteins such as green fluorescent protein and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Metal ions stimulate MBD-mediated cellular/nuclear uptake in vivo. Cross-linking studies showed a direct physical interaction of MBD with integrins αv and β1, caveolin-1, and transferrin receptor. MBD-mediated protein mobilization and pro-apoptotic effects are inhibited by nystatin but not chlorpromazine, suggesting an involvement of caveolar-mediated endocytosis. However, MBD effects are inhibited by antibodies to transferrin receptor or integrins. These results are discussed with particular reference to the cell target specificity of IGFBP-3 in disease processes such as cancer and atherosclerosis.

IGFBP-3 1The abbreviations used are: IGFBP-3, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3; MBD, metal-binding domain; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; rh, recombinant human; IGFBPs, IGF-binding proteins; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SA-HRP, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; g, glycosylated; ng, nonglycosylated; HEK, human embryonic kidney. modulates the biological effects of IGFs directly by sequestering them and indirectly by independent mechanisms that may involve specific binding to a number of plasma, extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules, conditional proteolysis, rapid internalization of IGFBP-3 (or its fragments) into target cells, and translocation into the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 1.Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, IGFBP-3 interacts with transcription factors such as retinoid X receptor-α (2.Liu B. Lee H.Y.

IGFs trigger cellular effects via their cognate plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases. By binding IGFs, the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) can modulate these effects directly. Other biochemical actions of IGFBPs at the target cell surface are not well understood. IGFBP-3 is known to bind a number of extracellular matrix components including collagen, fibronectin, and heparin (3.Liu B. Weinzimer S.A. Gibson T.B. Mascarenhas D. Cohen P. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2003; 13: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4.Gui Y. Murphy L.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 2104-2110PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Fowlkes J.L. Serra D.M. J. Biol.

Cross-talk between IGF receptor tyrosine kinases and integrins has also been reported (6.Clemmons D.R. Maile L.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The role of iron in the biological actions of IGFs and IGFBPs is not well understood. In plasma, IGFBP-3 is known to participate in high affinity interactions with the iron-binding proteins lactoferrin (7.Baumrucker C.R. Gibson C.A. Schanbacher F.L. Domest. Anim. Endocrinol. 2003; 24: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and transferrin (8.Weinzimer S.A. Gibson T.B. Collett-Solberg P.F. Khare A. Liu B. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of these interactions is not known. Unlike the documented binding interactions of IGFBP-3 with pre-kallikrein, plasminogen, fibrinogen, collagen, and fibronectin (3.Liu B. Weinzimer S.A. Gibson T.B. Mascarenhas D. Cohen P. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2003; 13: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4.Gui Y. Murphy L.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 2104-2110PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D.

Gibson C.A. Schanbacher F.L. Domest. Anim. Endocrinol. 2003; 24: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Iron-saturated transferrin binds IGFBP-3 with twice the affinity of apotransferrin (8.Weinzimer S.A. Gibson T.B. Collett-Solberg P.F. Khare A. Liu B. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Selective release of molecular iron from transferrin (15.Lamb D.J. Leake D.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is believed to be enhanced at low pH environments typically found in iron-rich tumors (16.Stubbs M. McSheehy P.M. Griffiths J.R. Bashford C.L. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and atherosclerotic lesions (17.Leake D.S. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 129: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Acidic environments promote a dramatic acceleration of lipid oxidation rates in the presence of iron (18.Balagopalakrishna C. Paka L. Pillarisetti S. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid. Res. 1999; 40: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caveolae, specialized flask-shaped invaginations on the cell surface, are composed of cholesterol, sphingolipids, and structural proteins termed caveolins; functionally, these plasma membrane microdomains have been implicated in signal transduction (19.Couet J. Belanger M.M. Roussel E. Drolet M.C. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 49: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, in most cells, caveolin-1 plays additional roles in membrane dynamics, including organization of noncaveolar detergent-insoluble lipid rafts and trafficking of cholesterol (20.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Caveolin has profound effects on cellular oxidative metabolism (21.Razani B. Engelman J.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11278-11283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A role for caveolin in IGF signal transduction is suggested by the observation that IGF-I receptor colocalizes with caveolin 1 in the lipid raft-enriched fractions of plasma membranes. IGF-I induces caveolin 1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 14, which results in the translocation of caveolin 1 and in the formation of membrane patches on the cell surface. These actions are IGFI-specific (as opposed to insulin-specific) (25.Maggi D. Biedi C. Segat D. Barbero D. Panetta D. Cordera R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 1085-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Insulin-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation cascade and signaling molecules are also localized in a caveolin-enriched cell membrane domain (26.Smith R.M. Harada S. Smith J.A. Zhang S. Jarett L. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) where caveolin binds to the insulin receptor and stimulates signaling (27.Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C.

Lipid rafts may represent a spatial integration point for insulin/IGF signaling and membrane traffic (28.Chamberlain L.H. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49750-49754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Both IGF-I and insulin (but not IGF-II) enhance lipid oxidation (29.Rifici V.A. Schneider S.H. Khachadurian A.K. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 107: 99-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and caveolae are implicated in human disease states characterized by altered membrane lipid structure. Chronic disease states such as rheumatoid arthritis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer (30.Jikimoto T.

IGFBP-3 treatment has been observed to sensitize some types of tumor cell lines to secondary apoptotic stimuli such as exposure to radiation or selected chemical and biological agents (38.Fowler C.A. Perks C.M. Newcomb P.V. Savage P.B. Farndon J.R. Holly J.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and these effects are postulated to be IGF-independent (39.Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic nature of the IGFBP-3 molecule makes it difficult to establish unequivocal “IGF independence” of observed biological effects in experiments using the intact IGFBP-3 molecule. In this work we use short synthetic peptides to identify domains within the IGFBP-3 molecule that are necessary and sufficient for cellular uptake, nuclear localization, and pro-apoptotic effects. Reagents—Laboratory chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Monoclonal antibodies purchased from BD Biosciences are as follows: anti-GFP JL-8, anti-fibronectin, anti-integrin-β1, and anti-transferrin receptor-1. Monoclonal antibodies obtained from Sigma are as follows: anti-integrin-αv P2W7, anti-α6 VLA60c, and anti-transferrin. Polyclonal antibody to human caveolin 1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Preparation of recombinant human (rh) IGFBP-3 in glycosylated (g-IGFBP-3) and non-glycosylated (ng-IGFBP-3) forms, rhIGF-I·rhIGFBP-3 complex, and a polyclonal antibody to intact IGFBP-3 have been described (40.Sommer A. Spratt S.K. Tatsuno G.P. Tressel T. Lee R. Maack C.A. Growth Regul. 1993; 3: 46-99PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Zhang Y. Olsen D.R. Nguyen K.B. Olson P.S. Rhodes E.T. Mascarenhas D. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For this work, unless otherwise specified, rhIGFBP-3 refers to non-glycosylated IGFBP-3. Custom synthesis of all peptides and preparation of anti-MBD5 polyclonal antibody were performed under contract at Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Each peptide was purified by HPLC to >80% purity and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC) were used for all mammalian cell culture experiments in this work. 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (VWR Scientific) and penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to 85–90% confluent. For nutrient stress apoptosis assays, cells were cultured either in 2 (nutrient-stressed) or 8% (control) calf serum. For chemical stress apoptosis assays, 0.3 ng/ml paclitaxel (Sigma) was added to the medium at the start of the experiment. In certain experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 60 min just prior to the experiment at the following concentrations: antibodies (200 ng/ml), nystatin (10 μg/ml), chlorpromazine (10 μg/ml), and LY294002 (25 μm). For iron independence studies, serum-free RPMI culture medium was used instead of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Metal Binding—Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose was purchased either uncharged or pre-charged with manganese or zinc (Sigma). The His-Bind kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) was also used according to the kit protocol. For charging NTA, nickel chloride (Novagen, Madison, WI), ferrous and ferric chlorides (VWR Scientific, West Chester, PA), cobalt chloride, and magnesium sulfate solutions were used. Each column was loaded with glycosylated (g-IGFBP-3) or non-glycosylated (ng-IGFBP-3) rhIGFBP-3, rhIGF-I·rhIGFBP-3 complex, or peptides according to the His-Bind kit protocol and batch-eluted with the provided buffers (10 mm imidazole wash, elution in 60 or 250 mm imidazole, column strip in EDTA buffer). The absorbance of each fraction was read at A280. Recovery of loaded protein was at least 90% in all chromatography experiments, which were repeated at least once. Results of typical experiments are reported. Cloning and Purification of Modified GFP Proteins—Oligonucleotides were ordered from Genset Oligos (La Jolla, CA), and the GFPuv vector was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). N-terminal inframe fusions to the GFP gene sequence were made by inserting PCR fragments into the multilinker cloning site of GFPuv. GFPuv DNA was digested with PstI and KpnI, purified on low melt agarose, and ligated to PCR products digested with the same enzymes. Ligated products were used to transform competent JM109 cells (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), plated on LB agar (VWR Scientific, West Chester, PA) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Colonies were grown in LB broth (BD Biosciences) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin overnight. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a plasmid mini prep kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Purified plasmids were sent to Biotechcore (Mountain View, CA) for sequencing. The sequences of the GFP N-terminal extensions created by this method are shown in Fig. 4B. In addition, each construct contains a hexahistidine tag to facilitate protein purification. Bacterial cultures of constructs exhibiting the expected sequences (GFP-31, -32, -34, -35, and -36) were grown in LB/ampicillin broth overnight, diluted 1:100 in the same medium, grown to A600 = 0.4, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted using a Branson sonicator. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and GFP proteins were purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography using the His-Bind Kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) followed by a desalting step on an Amersham Biosciences HI-TRAP desalting column using an Amersham Biosciences LKB LCC-500 Plus fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus. Proteins were stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at -80 °C. ELISAs—Each extract was assayed in triplicate. 100 μl of cell extract per well was incubated in a 96-well plates for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.5% Tween (VWR Scientific) 3 times and blocked for 3 h with 3% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibody(s) at a 1:3500 dilution (200 μl) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed with 1× PBS plus Tween 3 times. Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:5000 dilution (200 μl) was added to wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h the plates were washed 3 times with 1× PBS and Tween. 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. An absorbance reading was taken at 655 nm using a Bio-Rad plate reader. Apoptosis Assays—Cell extracts were prepared 6 h after addition of peptides to cultured cells. Extracts were assayed in triplicate for caspase-3 using a commercial kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Cell extracts were assayed for Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA levels using Quantikine mRNA kits from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Alternatively, cell supernatants were assayed in triplicate for nuclear matrix protein at 2-h intervals using the Cell Death Detection Kit (Calbiochem). Nuclear Uptake—Peptides and proteins were added directly to 85–90% confluent 293 cells in culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. For GFP experiments, GFP protein was directly added to the medium of 293 cells in culture (200 ng/ml). For MBD-mediated SA-HRP experiments, a complex was first formed in vitro by coincubating a molar excess of biotinylated MBD peptide with 3 μg of streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. This complex was purified by filtration (Centricon-30 filter) to remove free peptide, and the specific activity of the peroxidase complex was checked by enzymatic assay before experimental use. Complexes were directly added to the medium of 293 cells in culture (350 ng/ml complex final concentration, unless otherwise stated). After 20 min of incubation with cells, media were removed from the plates, and the cells were washed with 1× PBS plus 1% calf serum twice. Extracts were made using commercial kits: Cellytic™ Nuclear™ extraction kit and Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Sigma) and Nuclear Extract Kit (Pierce). Cell extracts were assayed for peroxidase activity (in SA-HRP experiments) or for GFP by ELISA (in GFP experiments). Assay results were read using a Bio-Rad plate reader at 655 nm. Cross-linking Assays—Approximately 100,000 (per aliquot) HEK293 cells grown to 85–90% confluency and subsequently harvested from cell culture plates were cooled down for 1 h at 4 °C. 1 μg of biotinylated MBD peptide was added to each cell aliquot, and incubation was continued at 4 °C. At various times (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min) 25 mm bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate cross-linking reagent (Pierce) was added to an aliquot of cells. After 20 min, the reaction was stopped with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Cells were washed twice with Tris Buffer and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min to remove excess material. Cell extracts were prepared using Cellytic MT (mammalian tissue lysis/extraction reagent), and 100 μl of extract was captured using streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (Promega, Madison, WI). The presence of various proteins covalently linked to MBD peptide in each well was detected using the ELISA protocol. Statistical Analysis of Data—Except for column chromatography, results presented are the means of triplicate measurements in a representative experiment, with each experiment having been performed at least 3 times. Key apoptosis experiments were repeated several dozen times, with essentially identical results. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Metal-binding Domain—A homology BLAST search of the amino acid sequence of IGFBP-3 revealed the presence of a conserved C-terminal domain (residues 215–241) homologous to a zinc finger-like motif conserved in human CD74 and other vertebrate proteins of unrelated function. We asked if intact IGFBP-3 might also be able to bind metals. Purified samples of IGFBP-3 were passed through nickel-NTA columns charged with each of several metals known to bind NTA. The results (Fig. 1, A and B) showed that IGFBP-3 bound nickel, cobalt, zinc, iron, magnesium, and manganese but not calcium. Nickel-NTA binding (and ferrous-NTA binding, not shown) was inhibited by IGF-I but was unaffected by the glycosylation status of IGFBP-3. We next asked if peptides made to the above motif (putative metal-binding domain, MBD) within the IGFBP-3 sequence might also bind metal. As shown in Fig. 1C, a 12-residue cyclic peptide (residues 224–235) is sufficient to specify Ni-NTA binding. Effect of Metals on IGFBP-3 in Vitro—We observed that a polyclonal antibody raised to the peptide MBD5 efficiently recognized MBD2, MBD5, and MBD9 but did not recognize intact rhIGFBP-3 (Fig. 2A, right panel). A second independent anti-MBD5 polyclonal antibody generated identical results (not shown). Conversely, anti-IGFBP-3 polyclonal antibody recognized IGFBP-3 but did not recognize any of the MBD peptides (Fig. 2A, left panel). One explanation of these results is that MBD epitopes are “buried” in the intact molecule. We then considered the possibility that MBD epitopes might be “unmasked” by pre-treating IGFBP-3 with metal ions in vitro. Aliquots of IGFBP-3 or IGF-I·IGFBP-3 complex were pre-incubated for various times with each of several metal ions. As shown in Fig. 2B, MBD epitopes are rapidly unmasked by pre-incubation in 100 μm ferrous (but not ferric or zinc) chloride solution. Simultaneously, IGFBP-3 epitopes appear to be lost. We have not been able to distinguish whether this effect of ferrous metal on IGFBP-3 occurs via partial proteolysis or by the induction of a conformational change in IGFBP-3. Iron-mediated epitope unmasking is dramatically inhibited in the presence of IGF-I. As shown in Fig. 7C, ∼10–15% of the starting IGFBP-3 is converted to MBD molar equivalents (i.e. “epitope-unmasked” form) within 60 min in ferrous chloride buffer. The loss of IGFBP-3 immunoreactivity during that time (Fig. 2B, left panel) appears to be about 50%. This discrepancy can be explained by rapid proteolysis of unmasked IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3, even in highly purified form, is known to be highly sensitive to rapid proteolytic degradation unless “stabilized” by high salt or by binding to heparin or IGF-I. From its chromatographic behavior in a number of systems, some investigators have tentatively concluded that IGFBP-3 can exist in at least two dramatically different conformations, with respect to proteolytic sensitivity. We suspected that iron, by exposing MBD epitopes, might trigger degradation of IGFBP-3 (or vice versa). A series of complementary experiments using plasminogen/plasmin, kallikrein, and other reported IGFBP-3 proteases to try and establish the reverse ontology (proteolysis, therefore exposure of epitopes) failed, in our hands, to provide supportive evidence for that option. MBD peptides trigger apoptosis in stressed cells. HEK293 cells stressed chemically (sublethal doses of paclitaxel) or nutritionally (2% serum) can be induced to undergo apoptosis when 50 ng/ml rhIGFBP-3 is added to the growth medium. As shown in Fig. 3a (a typical experiment is shown of several dozen performed, all yielding essentially identical results), MBD2 peptide triggers apoptosis as effectively as intact IGFBP-3 in these assays when used at the same concentrations. Even conservative amino acid substitutions in the MBD core sequence (such as in the homologous region of the closely related protein, IGFBP-5) completely abolish this pro-apoptotic effect (Fig. 3b). There is a sharp peptide length optimum for this effect (Fig. 3c) with the 14-mer, MBD2, consistently exhibiting the highest activity in this assay. Caspase-3 levels induced in cells treated with pro-apoptotic MBD peptides correlate exactly with the levels of Bax mRNA measured in the same cells (Fig. 3d). The pro-apoptotic effects of intact IGFBP-3 in this assay are inhibited by [Y60L]-IGF-I, an IGF-I mutant incapable of binding to cell membrane IGF receptors, but able to bind IGFBP-3 as avidly as wild type IGF-I (42.Wu H.B. Kumar A. Tsai W.C. Mascarenhas D. Healey J. Rechler M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, MBD-mediated apoptosis is not inhibited by [Y60L]-IGF-I (Fig. 3e). This suggests that the MBD of IGFBP-3 can mediate unequivocally IGF-independent effects on cultured cells. MBD-mediated Cell Uptake and Nuclear Localization—Purified GFP proteins that had been engineered to contain short MBD sequences at their N termini were added directly to HEK293 cells in culture. GFP32 contains most of the MBD domain, including the sequences shown to be sufficient for metal binding and for mediating pro-apoptotic effects. As shown in Fig. 4A, the added GFP32 protein rapidly disappears from the culture medium and simultaneously appears in the nuclear compartment of HEK293 cells. Uptake is essentially complete within 20 min. When various MBD-GFP fusions were tested, the core 14-mer sequence present in MBD35 was found to be sufficient for cellular uptake, but the so-called “basic domain” peptide used by numerous investigators in past studies (53.Schedlich I.J. Le Page S.L. Firth S.M. Briggs I.J. Jans D.A. Baxter R.C J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23462-23470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) was not able to mobilize GFP at all (compare GFP35 and GFP36). Thus, the integrity of the 12-mer cysteine loop appears to be important for this activity. MBD-mediated cell uptake was further investigated using biotinylated peptides MBD9 and MBD21. Each peptide was pre-incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (SAHRP) conjugate and then added to cultured cells. MBD21 contains a putative caveolin-binding sequence (FCWAVDKY), partially overlapping the conserved MBD motif. The presence of this sequence appears to enhance nuclear uptake of SA-HRP (compare MBD9 and MBD21 in Fig. 4C). Unlike the case of GFP uptake, there is substantial localization of SA-HRP in the cytoplasmic as well as the nuclear compartments. Perhaps molecular mass (SA-HRP complexes are nearly 5 times as large as GFP) affects the rate of intracellular compartmentalization. However, the overall rates of nuclear uptake are very similar for GFP32 and SA-HRP·MBD9 (about 0.2–0.4% of the initially added reagent can be found in the nuclei of HEK293 cells within 10 min of being added to the culture medium; data not shown). Inhibition of MBD-mediated Effects—Pre-incubation of HEK293 cells with nystatin (an inhibitor of caveolae), LY294002 (in"
https://openalex.org/W1965525879,"The physiological function of PrPc, the cellular isoform of prion protein, still remains unclear, although it has been established, in vitro or by using nerve cells, that it can homodimerize, bind copper, or interact with other proteins. Expression of PrPc was demonstrated as necessary for prion infection propagation. Considering the importance of the intestinal barrier in the process of oral prion infectivity, we have analyzed the expression of PrPc in enterocytes, which represent the major cell population of the intestinal epithelium. Our study, conducted both on normal human intestinal tissues and on the enterocytic cell line Caco-2/TC7, shows for the first time that PrPc is present in enterocytes. Interestingly, we found that this glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein was localized in cholesterol-dependent raft domains of the upper lateral membranes of enterocytes, beneath tight junctions, in cell-cell junctional domains. We observed that PrPc, E-cadherin, and Src co-localized in adherens junctions and that PrPc was co-immunoprecipitated with Src kinase but not with E-cadherin. Alteration of cell polarity after cholesterol depletion or loosening of the cell-cell junctions after EGTA treatment rapidly impaired membrane targeting of PrPc. Overall, our results point out the signaling of cell-cell contacts as a putative role for PrPc in epithelial cells. The physiological function of PrPc, the cellular isoform of prion protein, still remains unclear, although it has been established, in vitro or by using nerve cells, that it can homodimerize, bind copper, or interact with other proteins. Expression of PrPc was demonstrated as necessary for prion infection propagation. Considering the importance of the intestinal barrier in the process of oral prion infectivity, we have analyzed the expression of PrPc in enterocytes, which represent the major cell population of the intestinal epithelium. Our study, conducted both on normal human intestinal tissues and on the enterocytic cell line Caco-2/TC7, shows for the first time that PrPc is present in enterocytes.

The cellular prion protein (PrPc) 1The abbreviations used are: PrPc, cellular prion protein; PrPSc, prion protein scrapie; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PFA, paraformaldehyde. 1The abbreviations used are: PrPc, cellular prion protein; PrPSc, prion protein scrapie; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PFA, paraformaldehyde. was identified essentially because of its involvement in infectious degenerative encephalopathies (1.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5101) Google Scholar). Indeed, the expression of PrPc has been demonstrated as required for prion infection propagation (2.Weissmann C. Bueler H. Fischer M. Sailer A. Aguzzi A. Aguet M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 724: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3.Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5101) Google Scholar). Efforts were mainly directed at understanding infection and have essentially focused on nerve cells. The biological roles of PrPc still remain unclear. It has been established, however, that PrPc can homodimerize (4.Meyer R.K. Lustig A. Oesch B. Fatzer R. Zurbriggen A. Vandevelde M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38081-38087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), interacts with other proteins, such as synapsin Ib, Grb2, Pint1, LRP/LR, and N-CAMs (5.Gauczynski S.

Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) that PrPc triggers cell signaling through interaction with phosphorylated Fyn. In addition, it has been shown that multiple biochemical changes occurred in prion protein knockout mice. They included increased levels of NF-κB and COX-IV and decreased levels of p53 and Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase activity, along with an increased neuronal sensitivity to oxidative stress in cultured cells isolated from these knockout mice (15.Brown D.R. Nicholas R.S. Canevari L. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although oral transmission for prions diseases has been demonstrated, the site at which the infectious agent crosses the intestinal epithelium is still debated. After oral infection, the rapid accumulation of PrPSc in Peyer's patches (16.Beekes M. McBride P.A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 278: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17.Maignien T. Lasmezas C.I. Beringue V. Dormont D. Deslys J.P. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3035-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) led to the concept that M cells, which are present in the covering epithelium of lymphoid follicles, were responsible for the intestinal transfer of prion infectious particles toward the immune system (18.Heppner F.L. Christ A.D. Klein M.A. Prinz M. Fried M. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Aguzzi A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 976-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19.Shmakov A.N. Ghosh S. Gut. 2001; 48: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, M cells have a high activity of endocytosis and transport a wide variety of macromolecules and microorganisms to the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (20.Nicoletti C. Gut. 2000; 47: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, enterocytes represent the major cell population of the intestinal epithelium (21.Booth C. Potten C.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), even over Peyer's patches (22.Onori P. Franchitto A. Sferra R. Vetuschi A. Gaudio E. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2001; 46: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and PrPSc has also been detected in the enterocytes of the villous epithelium of the small intestine of primates after oral infection (23.Bons N. Mestre-Frances N. Belli P. Cathala F. Gajdusek D.C. Brown P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). While being a prerequisite for prion replication in nerve cells, rare studies have dealt with the expression of the normal cellular counterpart PrPc in the gastrointestinal tract, where replication might also occur. In these reports, the presence of high levels of PrPc was observed in crypts (24.Pammer J. Cross H.S. Frobert Y. Tschachler E. Oberhuber G. Virchows Arch. 2000; 436: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in the mucus of some rare goblet cells (25.Fournier J.G. Escaig-Haye F. Billette de Villemeur T. Robain O. Lasmezas C.I. Deslys J.P. Dormont D. Brown P. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), in the intestinal vascular endothelium (26.Lemaire-Vieille C. Schulze T. Podevin-Dimster V. Follet J. Bailly Y. Blanquet-Grossard F. Decavel J.P. Heinen E. Cesbron J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5422-5427Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), in afferent nerves of the lamina propria, and in the dispersed neuroendocrine system (27.Ford M.J. Burton L.J. Morris R.J. Hall S.M. Neuroscience. 2002; 113: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the presence of PrPc in enterocytes has not been specifically investigated. To determine whether enterocytes express PrPc, we used normal human intestinal tissues and the Caco-2/TC7 cell model that we have developed and that is morphologically and functionally similar to normal human enterocytes (28.Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot-Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that PrPc is present in enterocytes and, interestingly, that this glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein is targeted to junctional complexes, in the lateral membranes of adjacent cells, where it interacts with Src kinase. These results open new directions for evaluating the biological function of PrPc in epithelial cells. Reagents—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except where indicated. Mouse 12F10 (against peptide 142-160) and SAF32 (against peptide 79-92) (29.Krasemann S. Groschup M.H. Harmeyer S. Hunsmann G. Bodemer W. Mol.

Rabbit anti-human E-cadherin (HB-108), anti-human Src (sc-18), and anti-human PrP (FL 253) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-Src monoclonal antibody (clone GD11) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit L459 anti-human sucrase isomaltase polyclonal antibodies were used as described previously (28.Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot-Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary CY2- CY3-, and CY5-labeled antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). F-actin was labeled with phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Cell Culture and Human Tissues—Caco-2/TC7 cells (28.Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot-Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured on 1-μm pore-size microporous PET filters (Falcon, BD Biosciences) in a 10% CO2 atmosphere in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Glutamax 1 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (AbCys, Paris, France), 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (10 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). In some experiments cells were cultured in plastic flasks (Falcon) or on glass lamellae (Polylabo, Strasbourg, France). SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown on 10-cm diameter plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. Normal ileum and jejunum mucosa samples were collected from irreversibly brain-damaged kidney donors (obtained from France Transplant). Cell Treatments—For cholesterol depletion, cells were cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium /Glutamax1 medium supplemented with a lipoprotein-deficient serum and mevastatin (10 μm). β-Cyclodextrin (2.5 mm) was added for the last 18 h of culture (31.Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 32.Le Lay S. Krief S. Farnier C. Lefrere I. Le Liepvre X. Bazin R. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The cellular junctional tightness was perturbed by treatment with EGTA (2 mm) for 5, 10, 15, and 30 min and monitored by apical biotin labeling. At each indicated time, cells were washed with cold PBS (Invitrogen) and immediately fixed for 30 min, at 4 °C, with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells cultured on filters or lamellae were fixed for 30 min with 4% PFA in PBS and permeabilized for 20 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Frozen human tissue samples were embedded in tissue-Tek (Dako) and cut with a cryo-microtome (Leica, Rueil Malmaison, France). Unlike cultured cells, human tissue sections were not permeabilized after treatment with 4% PFA. Cultured cells and human tissue sections were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Cell Lysates, Sucrose Gradients, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting Analysis—For preparation of total cell lysates, Caco-2/TC7 and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed at 4 °C for 15 min in a PBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors, and 125 nm phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Crude cell extracts were frozen at -80 °C before use. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein-assay (Bio-Rad). For sucrose density centrifugation, 108 Caco-2/TC7 cells were homogenized on ice in 2 ml of a 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl buffer (TBS) containing 1% Triton X-100 plus an anti-protease mixture and anti-phosphatases (orthovanadate and β-glycerophosphate). The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose in TBS. The resulting 4 ml were covered with 4 ml of 30% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose and centrifuged for 3 h (39,000 rpm, 4 °C) in an SW-41 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Gagny, France). Sequential 1-ml fractions were then collected from the top of the tube, and 160 μl were used for electrophoresis to characterize the proteins present in each fraction. The remaining 840 μl of the turbid fraction containing the floating detergent-insoluble membranes (fraction 4) were adjusted to 11 ml in TBS buffer and centrifuged in an SW-41 rotor (35,000 rpm, 1 h). The pellet was dissolved in TBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, anti-proteases, and anti-phosphatases and immunoprecipitated with anti-PrPc or anti-Src antibodies (3 μg) coupled to protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). For SDS-PAGE, samples were boiled for 10 min in Laemmli buffer (2.5% SDS final concentration) and fractionated under reducing conditions in a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), probed, and then developed with ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoelectron Microscopy—Cryostat sections of polarized/differentiated Caco-2/TC7 monolayers were fixed with 4% PFA or 3% PFA plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde or acetone. After incubation with the 12F10 monoclonal antibody, gold (1 nm particles)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgGs (Amersham Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies, and the resulting signal was enhanced by the Intense™ M silver enhancement kit (Amersham Biosciences). For double labeling, mouse 12F10 anti-PrPc monoclonal antibody and rabbit sc-18 anti-Src polyclonal antibodies were used. Gold (12-nm particles)-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgGs and gold (6 nm particles)-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. After alcohol-graded dehydration, sections were embedded in Epon, and ultrathin sections were analyzed (Jeol 100 CX II). PrPc Is Expressed in Human Enterocytes and Concentrated in Cell-Cell Junctional Complexes—We analyzed the presence and the distribution of PrPc in normal human intestinal tissues. Our results revealed that PrPc is present throughout the epithelium, in villi, where it is concentrated below the apical brush-border (Fig. 1, A and B), and in the crypt-villus junctions (Fig. 1C), in cells that express sucrase-isomaltase, a specific marker for the brush-border of enterocytes. PrPc was never observed in the apical membrane of the brush-border microvilli and, accordingly, did not co-localize with sucrase isomaltase (Fig. 1C). In fact, PrPc was found mostly concentrated beneath the tight junction-associated protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO1) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the optimal cut incidence regularly obtained in crypt sections revealed that PrPc was concentrated in the upper part of the lateral membrane at the site of contact between two adjacent cells (Fig. 1C). We also found high levels of PrPc in the mucus of a few goblet cells (not shown) and in the vascular endothelium in the lamina propria (Fig. 1A), as reported in previous studies (24.Pammer J. Cross H.S. Frobert Y. Tschachler E. Oberhuber G. Virchows Arch. 2000; 436: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25.Fournier J.G. Escaig-Haye F. Billette de Villemeur T. Robain O.

Neuroscience. 2002; 113: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that did not detect PrPc in enterocytes. We then analyzed the distribution of PrPc in enterocytic Caco-2/TC7 cells cultured on microporous filters. In confluent and polarized Caco-2/TC7 cells, PrPc was concentrated in the lateral membrane (Fig. 2A and inset). Conversely, a high proportion of the protein remained intracellularly distributed in exponentially growing cells (Fig. 2B). However, in this last condition, a small proportion of PrPc was already located at the plasma membrane within the expanding cell clusters. Interestingly, the localization of PrPc at the lateral membrane appeared to be dependent on cell-cell contacts (Fig. 2B, arrows) as no PrPc labeling was observed, before confluence, on membranes not committed to cell-cell adhesion, i.e. around cell clusters (Fig. 2B, arrowheads). The specificity of the PrPc signals was assessed by using 12F10 antibody previously saturated with the 142-160 antigenic peptide (Fig. 2C). Moreover, SAF32 antibody gave similar PrPc signals at the lateral membrane in confluent Caco-2/TC7 cells (Fig. 2D). Western blot analysis, using 12F10 or SAF32 antibody, showed that a similar amount of PrPc was present in exponentially growing and confluent polarized cells (Fig. 2E). Several bands were obtained around 35 kDa, the specificity of which was controlled after blotting with 12F10 antibody previously saturated with the 142-160 antigenic peptide (Fig. 2E, middle panel). The amount of PrPc was compared by Western blot in confluent polarized Caco-2/TC7 cells and in SH-SY5Y nerve cells. Results reported in Fig. 2F showed that equal amounts of PrPc were present in both cell types. Moreover, the pattern of the isoforms detected with SAF32 antibody differed between Caco-2/TC7 and SH-SY5Y cells, most probably due to changes in the respective proportions of the glycosylated isoforms. As observed in the normal human intestinal epithelium, PrPc was localized below ZO1 in the lateral membrane of Caco-2/TC7 cells (white arrows, Fig. 3A), in cell-cell contacts domains. PrPc and ZO1 never co-localized. By using immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 3B), we showed that PrPc was associated with specialized domains of the lateral membrane, identified as junctional complexes with a thickening of the adjacent plasma membranes and their association with cytoskeleton. These junctional complexes were further shown to be adherens junctions as PrPc, E-cadherin, the main component of these junctions, and F-actin gave a merged signal in confocal microscopy at the major expression plane of PrPc (Fig. 3C). Cholesterol-dependent Membrane Targeting of Mature PrPc in Caco-2/TC7 Cells—By cholesterol depletion (Fig. 4), using mevastatin and β-cyclodextrin (32.Le Lay S. Krief S. Farnier C. Lefrere I. Le Liepvre X. Bazin R. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we further confirmed that PrPc is localized in rafts microdomains of enterocytes, as in other cell types (33.Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Although cholesterol depletion did not affect cell viability, it did induce a loss of the polarization of Caco-2/TC7 cells as shown by cell rounding and the delocalization of sucrase isomaltase on the whole cell membrane (not shown). As expected, ZO1, which is associated with the tight junctions known to be raft domains (34.Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Verkade P. Foley C.S. Liang T.W. Innis-Whitehouse W. Eastburn K.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1771-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was redistributed in the cytoplasm. In these conditions, PrPc was detected intracellularly rather than at the lateral membrane, demonstrating that the membrane targeting of PrPc requires the integrity of cholesterol-dependent raft microdomains. Perturbation of Junctional Complexes Interferes with the Membrane Targeting of PrPc—We then analyzed whether perturbation of junctional complexes affects the membrane localization of PrPc. Loosening of cell-cell adhesion in confluent and polarized Caco-2/TC7 cells, following 2 mm EGTA-mediated Ca2+ depletion (35.Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), resulted in a progressive permeability of the monolayer to apically delivered biotin (data not shown) and, as expected (35.Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), in the internalization of E-cadherin (Fig. 5A) without affecting the cell shape and the association of ZO1 to the tight junctions (Fig. 5B). In these conditions, PrPc was no longer detected at the lateral membrane (Fig. 5, A and B), and it was found exclusively intracellularly. Membrane PrPc Interacts with Src Kinase—Src kinase is known to be targeted to cadherin-dependent junctions (36.Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and PrPc has been reported to interact with Fyn (14.Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), a member of the Src family kinases, in neuronal cells. Therefore, we compared the distribution of PrPc and Src kinase in confluent and polarized Caco-2/TC7 cells. Confocal microscopy showed a co-localization of both proteins at the cell-cell contacts (Fig. 6A). Immunoelectron microscopy analysis of the co-localization zones revealed that PrPc and Src were regularly in the immediate vicinity one of the other in these zones (Fig. 6B). The measured distance between PrPc and Src, 12.5 nm in majority, was compatible with the 10-nm thickness of the membrane, PrPc being anchored in the external leaflet while Src is anchored in the internal one. The observation of a potential interaction between PrPc and Src was further supported by biochemical data. Detergent-treated cell lysates were subjected to sucrose density gradient experiments, and the resulting fractions were analyzed for the presence of PrPc, Src, and E-cadherin. PrPc and E-cadherin were recovered both in the detergent-insoluble and detergent-soluble fractions, whereas Src was mainly found in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 6C). The detergent-insoluble fraction was then subjected to immunoprecipitation experiments with antibodies directed against PrPc or against Src kinase. We found that PrPc and Src interact, whereas PrPc and E-cadherin did not. Indeed, a pool of Src was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-PrPc antibodies and vice versa (Fig. 6D). In contrast, E-cadherin, which is known to interact with Src (36.Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Src antibodies but not with anti-PrPc antibodies. This report is the first demonstration that PrPc is expressed in enterocytes (Fig. 1), which account for 80% of the intestinal epithelial cells (21.Booth C. Potten C.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The amount of PrPc expressed in human Caco-2/TC7 enterocytes was similar to that of human SH-SY5Y nerve cells (Fig. 2). Interestingly, in the human intestine and in differentiated enterocytic Caco-2/TC7 cells, this GPI-anchored protein is targeted to junctional complexes of the lateral membranes of adjacent polarized cells. PrPc was found in cholesterol-dependent rafts in adherens junctions where it co-localized with E-cadherin, the major component of these junctional complexes (Fig. 3). However, the observation that PrPc and E-cadherin were not co-immunoprecipitated excludes the possibility that they interact or participate in the same protein complex. GPI-anchored proteins are considered targeted to the apical membrane domains of polarized cells. However, the localization of a GPI-anchored protein in junctional domains has already been observed for T-cadherin, a cell-cell binding signaling protein (37.Philippova M.P. Bochkov V.N. Stambolsky D.V. Tkachuk V.A. Resink T.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our finding in cells that endogenously express PrPc was further supported by Sarnataro et al. (38.Sarnataro D. Paladino S. Campana V. Grassi J. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) who reported that a transfected PrPc was targeted to the basolateral membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney and FRT epithelial cells. Moreover, we also observed that PrPc exhibited the same localization in normal human keratinocytes as in enterocytes, i.e. at the junctions between adjacent cells (data not shown). Our results open questions about the role that PrPc can play when localized in epithelial cell-cell junctions. One could hypothesize that two PrPc molecules that face each other when anchored in two adjacent cell membranes (see Fig. 3B) interact and dimerize through their α-helices in a “head-to-tail conformation,” as suggested by in vitro modeling of PrPc oligomerization (39.Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Contrary to most other junctional proteins involved in cell-cell contacts (40.Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar), PrPc is a GPI-anchored protein, meaning that it lacks a transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail and is unlikely to contribute to strong cell-cell interactions. Moreover, cell-cell junctional domains are enriched in signaling molecules such as the Gα subunit and Src family kinases (37.Philippova M.P. Bochkov V.N. Stambolsky D.V. Tkachuk V.A. Resink T.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that PrPc co-immunoprecipitates with a pool of Src kinase (Fig. 6) while E-cadherin co-immunoprecipitates with another one. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that PrPc plays a role in intercellular signaling and/or sensing of neighboring cells, through an interaction with Src kinases, rather than in adhesion per se. Because PrPc is anchored in the outer membrane and Src in the inner one, such a PrPc-dependent signaling does involve an intermediate factor(s) that has to be characterized. This intermediate partner of the PrPc-Src complex cannot be the transmembrane adhesion molecule E-cadherin since PrPc and E-cadherin were independently co-immunoprecipitated with two different pools of Src kinases (Fig. 6). The precise localization of PrPc in junctional complexes suggests that it could play a distinct role in epithelial cells and in nerve cells where this protein is present on the whole cell surface, binds to N-CAM (10.Schmitt-Ulms G. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Ball H.L. Bradon N. Bosque P.J. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1209-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and was suggested to trigger signaling through the Src kinase Fyn activation (14.Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Combined with our results, this could suggest that PrPc plays a role in cell-cell adhesion signaling in epithelial cells and in cell-matrix adhesion signaling in nerve cells. Src kinases are known to be involved in both signaling pathways, being targeted to integrin-dependent cell-matrix and to cadherin-dependent cell-cell junctions where they phosphorylate substrates that induce adhesion turnover and actin remodeling (36.Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Another important result is that alteration of the cell monolayer integrity (i.e. cholesterol depletion or loosening of cell junctions) leads to the intracellular sequestration of PrPc (Figs. 4 and 5), suggesting that the targeting of PrPc to junctional complexes can be modulated according to the physiological state of the epithelium. Whether similar modulation of the membrane targeting of PrPc also occurs in pathological conditions remains to be determined. Interestingly, Heppner et al. (18.Heppner F.L. Christ A.D. Klein M.A. Prinz M. Fried M. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Aguzzi A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 976-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), using Caco-2/TC7 cells, reported that infectious scrapie prion units are more easily transferred through the cell monolayer when cells have acquired an M cell phenotype resulting from a co-culture with B lymphocytes. In view of our results, it may be hypothesized that the drastic cell remodeling that accompanies the enterocyte to M cell transition in this model, i.e. a disassembly of the brush border and a redistribution of villin to the cytoplasm (41.Kerneis S. Bogdanova A. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Pringault E. Science. 1997; 277: 949-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), may have induced the intracellular sequestration of PrPc and favored intracellular interactions between PrPSc and the endogenous PrPc. However, the presence and/or distribution of endogenous PrPc in untreated Caco-2/TC7 cells or in the “M cells” resulting from co-culture were not analyzed. These results do not preclude that a transfer of infectious particles, although less abundant than in M cells since it must involve an active transcellular transport, could also occur in the initial Caco-2/TC7 enterocytes. In conclusion, the results reported here point out the signaling of cell-cell contacts as a putative role for the endogenous cellular prion protein PrPc in epithelial cells, through interaction with Src kinase. In addition, the human enterocytic Caco-2/TC7 cell line appears as an accurate model to investigate whether and how enterocytes participate in the passage of infectious particles through the intestinal epithelium, and whether these cells could represent a site of PrPc transconformation by the pathogenic prion agents.

In addition, PS1 plays a role in β-catenin signaling and in the regulation of apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of PS1 is regulated by two independent signaling pathways involving protein kinase (PK) A and PKC and that both kinases can directly phosphorylate the large hydrophilic domain of PS1 in vitro and in cultured cells. A phosphorylation site at serine residue 346 was identified that is selectively phosphorylated by PKC but not by PKA. This site is localized within a recognition motif for caspases, and phosphorylation strongly inhibits proteolytic processing of PS1 by caspase activity during apoptosis. Moreover, PS1 phosphorylation reduces the progression of apoptosis. Our data indicate that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at the caspase recognition site provides a mechanism to reversibly regulate properties of PS1 in apoptosis.

Several lines of evidence indicate that PS proteins are also involved in apoptosis (1.Mattson M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Initially, a gene trap analysis for anti-apoptotic factors revealed a C-terminal sequence of PS2 (26.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that inhibition of PS1 expression in cultured tumor cells or mice strains with spontaneous tumor development induces a higher rate of apoptosis (27.Roperch J.P. Alvaro V.

PS1 was found to be phosphorylated at serine residue 346 by PKC. The phosphorylation at this site regulates the caspase-mediated cleavage of PS1 and inhibits the progression of apoptosis.MATERIALS AND METHODScDNAs and Fusion Proteins—The phosphorylation site mutants of PS1 were generated by PCR techniques using appropriate oligonucleotides.

Protein kinase or phosphatase activities were modulated by the addition of the activators or inhibitors as indicated in the respective experiment. In vitro phosphorylation assays with purified PKA from bovine heart (kindly provided by Dr. V. Kinzel) or with rat brain PKC (Biomol) were carried out as described previously (38.Walter J. Grunberg J. Schindzielorz A. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5961-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein representing the loop region of PS1 (amino acids 263–407) was used as substrate. Phosphorylation reactions were started by the addition of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP and allowed to proceed for 20 min at 32 °C. To control the kinase activities, parallel phosphorylation reactions were carried out using histone (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma) as protein substrate. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer.Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping—32P-Labeled PS1 was analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping according to Boyle et al. (45.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) after digestion with trypsin (sequencing grade; Roche Applied Science). In some experiments synthetic peptides representing phosphorylated PS1 were added to the digest as indicated in the respective experiments. The peptides were dissolved in 300 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (7.8% (v/v) glacial acetic acid, 2.5% (v/v) formic acid (88%)) and spotted onto a cellulose-coated TLC plate (Merck). After thin layer electrophoresis for 20 min at 1 kV (first dimension), chromatography with phosphochromatography buffer (37.5% (v/v) n-butanol, 25% (v/v) pyridine, 6.1% (v/v) glacial acetic acid) was carried out (second dimension). The radiolabeled peptides were detected by autoradiography. To visualize synthetic peptides, TLC plates were stained with ninhydrin.In Vitro Cleavage by Caspases—One μg of the respective fusion proteins or 5 μg of synthetic peptides were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in 25 μl of cleavage assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose) in the presence or absence of 20 ng of recombinant active caspase-3 (PharMingen). The reactions were terminated by shock freezing in liquid nitrogen. Cleavage of fusion proteins was analyzed by Western immunoblotting, and cleavage of synthetic peptides was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry—Synthetic PS1 peptides, after incubation in the presence or absence of recombinant caspase-3, were desalted and purified by microbore reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on a 150 × 1.0 mm Vydac C18 column. 0.5 μl of selected peak fractions were applied onto the dried matrix spot. The matrix consisted of 13 mg of nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and 20 mg of α-cyano 4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Sigma) dissolved in 1 ml of acetone:isopropanol 2:3 (v/v). 0.5 μl of the matrix solution was applied onto the sample target.

Apoptosis of MCF-7 cells overexpressing Fas was induced by incubation with monoclonal anti-Fas antibody (2 μg/ml). Progression of apoptosis was monitored by the following parameters: (a) Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was analyzed by immunoblotting (46.Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grunberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). (b) Early changes in membrane permeability were detected by cell staining with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) (47.Elstein K.H. Zucker R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The accumulation of the dye in apoptotic cells was analyzed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DMIL, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a band pass excitation filter of 340–380 nm and a long pass emission filter of 425 nm. (c) Caspase-3 activity was measured as described previously (48.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A.

In brief, the cells were exposed to 1 μm STS for 2 or 6 h, respectively. After determination of cell numbers, the cells were homogenized in 750 μl of caspase-3 assay buffer (10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0,1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with the fluorogenic caspase-3 tetrapeptide-substrate Ac-DEVD-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) at a final concentration of 20 μm. The cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate was followed by determination of emission at 460 nm after excitation at 390 nm using a fluorescence plate reader.RESULTSPhosphorylation of PS1 by PKA and PKC—Previously, we and others have shown that phosphorylation of the PS1 CTF increases upon activation of PKC or PKA (41.Walter J. Grunberg J. Capell A. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A. Citron M. Mendla K. St George-Hyslop P. Multhaup G. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To investigate whether PKC and PKA independently regulate phosphorylation of PS1, we pharmacologically activated or inactivated these kinases in HEK293 cells during incubation with [32P]orthophosphate. Activation of PKC with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) results in strong increase of phosphate incorporation into the PS1 CTF (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Consistent with previous results (41.Walter J. Grunberg J. Capell A. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A. Citron M. Mendla K. St George-Hyslop P. Multhaup G. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 5090-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of the PS1 CTF induces a slower migration in SDS gels resulting in an apparent molecular mass shift from ∼ 20 to ∼ 23 kDa (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Cell treatment with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X selectively suppresses the PDBu-induced phosphorylation of PS1 CTF. In contrast, the PKA inhibitor H-89 had no significant effect on PDBu induced phosphorylation, indicating that PDBu selectively increases PKC-dependent phosphorylation of PS1. Activation of PKA by cell treatment with forskolin also increases phosphorylation of PS1. In contrast to the PDBu-induced phosphorylation, the forskolin-induced phosphorylation of PS1 is strongly suppressed by the PKA inhibitor H-89 but not by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (Fig. 1A). These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of the PS1 CTF can be regulated by two independent signaling pathways involving PKA or PKC, respectively.The hydrophilic loop region between TM6 and TM7 of PS1 contains several consensus recognition sites for these kinases (Fig. 2A). We therefore tested whether both kinases can phosphorylate this domain in vitro using a recombinant protein that represents amino acids 263–407 of PS1 as a substrate. Both PKA and PKC readily phosphorylate the recombinant PS1 sequence in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), indicating that the hydrophilic loop region of PS1 is a substrate for both kinases.Fig. 2PS1 is phosphorylated at Ser346 by PKC. A, alignment of PS1 loop amino acid sequences from several mammalian species. Potential phosphorylation sites within the minimal consensus sequence for PKC ((R/K)XS) are indicated by arrowheads. The amino acid sequence of human PS1 also contains a recognition motif for PKA (RRX(S/T)) at Ser310. Note that the recognition motif at Ser346 is conserved in all mammalian species (boxed). The cleavage site for caspase is indicated by an arrow. B, recombinant proteins representing amino acids 263–407 of PS1 WT, S310A and S346A were incubated with PKA or PKC in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min. The radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography (upper panels), and the total proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining (lower panels). Note that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PS1 containing the S310A mutation is completely abolished. C, HEK293 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of PDBu, and PS1 CTF was isolated by immunoprecipitation with antibody 3027 and SDS-PAGE. After blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, radiolabeled PS1 CTF was digested with trypsin in the presence of the synthetic phosphopeptide DS(p)HLGPLR, which represents a tryptic digestion product of PS1 (amino acids 345–352). After two-dimensional separation of the digestion products, radiolabeled peptides were detected by autoradiography (left panel). The synthetic peptide was visualized by staining the plate with ninhydrin (middle panel). Overlay of the autoradiogram with the stained TLC plate demonstrated co-migration of one in vivo phosphorylated peptide with the synthetic peptide (indicated by dashed circle (right panel)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been"

(2002) Nature 419, 587-593). The extramembrane headpiece of the AcrB trimer contains a central pore composed of three α-helices. Each pore helix belongs to a different monomer. In this study, we constructed cysteine-scanning mutants as to the residues comprising the pore helix. Of the 21 mutants (D99C to P119C), 5 (D101C, V105C, N109C, Q112C, and P116C) showed significantly reduced drug resistance and drug-exporting activity. These residues are localized on one side of the pore helix, i.e. on the wall of the pore. These observations strongly indicate the important role of this pore in the drug transport process. A N-ethylmaleimide binding experiment revealed that the pore is in the closed state, and the thickness of the permeability barrier in the middle of the pore corresponds to 2.5 α-helical turns. Two mutants (V105C and Q112C), which showed the greatest loss of activity of all of the pore mutants, were detected in the form of disulfide cross-linking dimers under normal conditions, suggesting that a conformational change of the pore is indispensable during the transport process. We previously reported the crystal structure of the major multidrug exporter AcrB in Escherichia coli (Murakami, S., Nakashima, R., Yamashita, E., and Yamaguchi, A. (2002) Nature 419, 587-593).

AcrB is an inner membrane transporter that cooperates with a membrane fusion protein, AcrA, and an outer membrane channel, TolC (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar, 2Fralick J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5803-5805Google Scholar), and exports a wide variety of drugs directly out of cells, bypassing the periplasm (3Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7190-7195Google Scholar). The AcrAB-TolC system exports drugs not only from the cytoplasm but also from the periplasm (4Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5853-5859Google Scholar). Homologues of the AcrAB-TolC system are widely distributed in Gram-negative organisms and confer intrinsic drug resistance (5Poole K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 255-264Google Scholar, 6Nikaido H. Zgurskaya H.I. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 215-218Google Scholar). AcrB belongs to a resistance-nodulation division family (7Saier Jr., M.H. Tam R. Reizer A. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Google Scholar), the members of which are composed of 12 transmembrane segments and 2 large periplasmic loops (8Fujihira E. Tamura N. Yamaguchi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 145-151Google Scholar). The substrate specificity is determined by the periplasmic large loops of AcrB (9Elkins C.A. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6490-6498Google Scholar, 10Tikhonova E.B. Wang Q. Zgurskaya H.I. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6499-6507Google Scholar) and its homologues (11Eda S. Maseda H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2085-2088Google Scholar, 12Mao W. Warren M.S. Black D.S. Satou T. Murata T. Nishino T. Gotoh N. Lomovskaya O. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 889-901Google Scholar). We determined the crystal structure of AcrB (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar), which is not only the first structure of a multidrug exporter but also the first structure of a proton-coupled solute transporter elucidated. AcrB comprises a homotrimer, each monomer being composed of a 40-Å-thick transmembrane region and a large headpiece protruding 70 Å into the periplasm. At the center of the headpiece, there is a central pore composed of three α-helices. The distal end of the pore connects with a funnel-like opening at the top of the headpiece, and the proximal end connects to the central cavity located between the headpiece and the transmembrane region. The central cavity opens into the periplasm via three vestibules between the monomers. Substrates in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane can enter the cavity via these vestibules and might be actively transported through the central pore into outer membrane channel TolC (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar). This is the mechanistic basis of the periplasmic active transport by the AcrAB-TolC system. It has been reported that multiple substrates bind to the central cavity (13Yu E.W. McDermott G. Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 2003; 300: 976-980Google Scholar), supporting this presumed mechanism. The central pore seems to be closed in the resting condition, because there is not enough space for substrate molecules to pass through (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar). Therefore, the pore is presumed to play an important role in the drug export function of AcrB not only as a substrate translocation pathway but also as a valve for active transport. To investigate such important roles of the central pore, we constructed and analyzed cysteine-scanning mutants as the pore-forming helices in this study. Strains and Plasmids—Escherichia coli strains TG1 (14Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Google Scholar), JM109 (15Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J.

Yamagishi S. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 808-813Google Scholar) were used for DNA manipulation, DNA sequencing, site-directed mutagenesis with the Kunkel method (18Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar), and investigation of the phenotypes of the mutants, respectively. Strains KAM3 (19Morita Y. Kodama K. Shiota S. Mine T. Kataoka A. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1778-1782Google Scholar) and W3104ΔacrAB (20Kobayashi N. Nishino K. Hirata T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 241-246Google Scholar) are acrB (KAM3) and acrAB (W3104ΔacrAB) gene-deletion derivatives of E. coli TG1 and W3104, respectively. KAM3 was kindly provided by Tomofusa Tsuchiya and Yuji Morita (Okayama University, Okayama, Japan). Plasmids pACBH, a derivative of pUC118 that carries the acrR, acrA, and His-tagged acrB genes, and pACBHCL, a derivative of pACBH that contains His-tagged Cys-less acrB in place of the wild-type His-tagged acrB gene, were prepared previously (8Fujihira E. Tamura N. Yamaguchi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 145-151Google Scholar). For use as templates for site-directed mutagenesis, the DNA fragments encoding the N- and C-terminal halves of Cys-less AcrB were separately subcloned into pUC118 previously, i.e. pACBN and pACBHCLC carry the N- and C-terminal halves, respectively (8Fujihira E. Tamura N. Yamaguchi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 145-151Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—To facilitate DNA recombination, five unique restriction enzyme sites were introduced into the acrB gene by silent site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting plasmid, pACBHLR, encoding the cassetted acrB gene is a derivative of pACBHCL containing five new restriction sites: XbaI at position 167; BamHI at position 257; NotI at position 303; Aor51HI at position 491; and SmaI at position 833. All of these restriction sites were introduced by silent mutagenesis; thus, the amino acid sequence of AcrB was not changed. The cassetted versions of the plasmids encoding the N- and C-terminal halves of AcrB were also subcloned from pACBHLR and named pACBRN and pACBHLRC, respectively. The mutagenesis for constructing 21 Cys mutants (i.e. D99C, A100C, D101C, I102C, A103C, Q104C, V105C, Q106C, V107C, Q108C, N109C, K110C, L111C, Q112C, L113C, A114C, M115C, P116C, L117C, L118C, and P119C) was performed with pACBRN as a template. The mutagenesis was performed with mutagenic oligopeptides containing mismatches for the desired amino acid replacements and silent mismatches producing new restriction enzyme sites by the method of Kunkel et al. (18Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar). Mutations were first detected by restriction enzyme analysis and then verified by DNA sequencing. After verification of the mutations, adequate restriction fragments of pACBRN were introduced into pACBHLR by means of corresponding fragment exchange. Detection of Mutant AcrB Expression—E. coli W3104ΔacrAB was transformed with the mutant plasmids, and then the expression of the mutant AcrB protein was detected by Western blotting with an anti-AcrB rabbit antibody, which was prepared by Medical Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd (Nagoya, Japan) using purified AcrB protein as an antigen. Drug Resistance Determination—The minimum inhibitory concentrations of drugs and toxic compounds were determined as the concentrations that greatly prevented bacterial growth on YT-agar (0.8% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) plates with sequential 2-fold dilutions as described previously (21Nishino K. Yamaguchi A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5803-5812Google Scholar). DASPEI (2-[4-dimethylamino]styryl-N-ethylpyridinium iodide) Transport Assay—E. coli KAM3 cells were transformed with the plasmids encoding the wild-type and mutant AcrB. Cells were harvested from 2-ml cell culture (A610 = 0.6) and suspended in 2 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 μm DASPEI (22Germ M. Yoshihara E. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 452-455Google Scholar) and 100 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). 1The abbreviations used are: CCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidNEMN-ethylmaleimide. To preload the cells with DASPEI, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min followed by the collection of the cells by brief centrifugation and resuspension in the same buffer without CCCP. While monitoring the fluorescence (excitation, 461 nm; emission, 560 nm) of the cell suspension with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer LS55), glucose (final concentration of 0.2%) was added to start DASPEI extrusion. At 4 min after glucose addition, CCCP was added to dissipate the energy. carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid N-ethylmaleimide. Assaying of the Reaction of [14C]N-ethylmaleimide with AcrB Proteins—The [14C]NEM binding experiment was performed as follows. A membrane suspension (200 μg of protein) prepared by brief sonication of E. coli W3104ΔacrAB cells carrying pACBHLR or one of its derivatives was incubated with 0.5 mm [14C]NEM in 50 mm MOPS-KOH buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 m KCl for 5 min at 30 °C. The membrane protein was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm unlabeled NEM, and then His-tagged AcrB proteins were precipitated with nickel-chelating-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the beads twice with 50 mm imidazole, the AcrB proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The AcrB proteins then were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The dried gel was exposed to an imaging plate for visualization with a FLA-3000G fluoroimaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Construction of Cysteine-scanning Mutants as to the Pore Helices and Expression of the Mutants—The central pore is composed of three α-helices (Fig. 1). Each helix belongs to a different monomer. The pore-forming helix is the second α-helix (Nα2) in the N-terminal large loop between transmembrane helices 1 (TM1) and 2 (TM2) (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar) that is composed of 21 amino acid residues Asp-99 to Pro-119 (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequence of this region is highly conserved among AcrB homologues (Fig. 2). In particular, in AcrB, AcrF, and MexB, 19 of the 21 residues are completely identical, whereas the sequences of AcrD and MexD contain three and five more charged residues, respectively, in this region than the former three homologues. This discrepancy might be related to the fact that the substrate specificity of the latter two homologues is rather different from that of the former three (21Nishino K. Yamaguchi A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5803-5812Google Scholar, 23Murata T. Kuwagaki M. Shin T. Gotoh N. Nishino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 247-251Google Scholar, 24Srikumar R. Kon T. Gotoh N.

All of the mutants were well expressed, and no significant differences in the expression level were observed. Drug Resistance Patterns of Cys-scanning Mutants—The drug resistance against 16 representative drugs and toxic compounds of E. coli W3104ΔacrAB cells was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Table I). In comparison with wild-type W3104 cells, the acrAB gene-deletion strain showed hypersensitivity to all of these 16 compounds by a factor of 4-128. Multicopy plasmid pACBHLR encoding wild-type AcrAB restored the intrinsic drug resistance of E. coli with the exception of that to crystal violet, whereas the resistance level of the cells carrying the multicopy acrAB gene was not higher than that of the wild-type E. coli strain, indicating that the resistance level is not proportional to the gene dosage.Table IDrug resistance of E. coli W3104 cells lacking acrAB genes harboring plasmids carrying a mutant acrB gene with the wild type acrA geneDrugW3104W3104 ΔacrABMICW3104 Δacr harboring plasmid carrying mutated acrBpACBHLRD101CV105CN109CQ112CP116COthersμg/mlChloramphenicol6.250.783.130.780.781.560.781.561.56-3.13Tetracycline6.251.563.131.561.561.561.561.561.56-3.13Minocycline256.2512.512.56.2512.56.2512.512.5Erythromycin1006.25100252525255050-100Nalidixic acid3.130.783.130.780.780.780.390.781.56-3.13Norfloxacin0.10.050.10.10.050.050.050.10.1Enoxacin0.20.050.20.10.050.10.050.10.1-0.2Novobiocin>40025>400400200400100>400>400Acriflavine2006.251002512.52512.52550-100Crystal violet250.783.131.560.781.560.783.133.13Ethidium Bromide>40012.5>40040010040050400>400Rhodamine 6G4003.13200100255012.5200100-200TPP>40012.54004005020025400400Benzalkonium503.132512.56.2512.53.1312.512.5-25SDS>40050>400400100400100>400>400Deoxycholate>400002500>40,000>40,00025004000020,00020,000>40,000 Open table in a new tab Most of the plasmids encoding Cys mutants restored the intrinsic resistance of E. coli W3104ΔacrAB to all of the compounds tested, similar to that encoding the wild-type AcrB, with the exception of five mutants (Table I). Of the 21 mutants, only 5 showed decreased resistance to several or all of the compounds tested in comparison with the wild type. In particular, the resistance levels of the cells expressing the V105C and Q112C mutants were decreased or lost for all of the compounds tested. In the case of the D101C, N109C, and P116C mutants, the drug resistance was partially lost, i.e. the resistance to some drugs was lost but that to the other drugs remained, indicating that the substrate specificity changed to become narrower than that of the wild type. Among the functionally important residues, Asp-101 and Asn-109 are completely conserved in the five AcrB homologues listed in Fig. 2; however, Val-105, Gln-112, and Pro-116 are not conserved in MexD and/or AcrD. These three non-conserved residues may be related to substrate specificity. Interestingly, all of the functionally important residues are located on the same side of the pore-forming helix (Fig. 4). DASPEI Export Activity—DASPEI is an amphiphilic compound that fluoresces in a hydrophobic environment (Fig. 5A) (22Germ M. Yoshihara E. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 452-455Google Scholar). When intact cells carrying the plasmid encoding the wild-type AcrB were incubated with DASPEI under starved conditions (in the presence of CCCP), DASPEI was accumulated in the plasma membrane and the cells fluoresced (22Germ M. Yoshihara E. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 452-455Google Scholar). After removal of CCCP, when glucose was added as an energy source to drive the AcrAB-TolC system, the fluorescence drastically decreased, whereas the addition of CCCP again rapidly restored the fluorescence (Fig. 5B). The rapid decrease in fluorescence of energized cells indicates the active extrusion of DASPEI from the plasma membrane due to the “membrane vacuum cleaner” function of the AcrAB-TolC system. The host KAM3 cells lacking AcrB did not show such a rapid fluorescence decrease. The small decrease in fluorescence of KAM3 cells might be the result of trace amounts of exporters other than AcrAB. Fig. 5C shows the fluorescence trace of DASPEI-preloaded cells carrying mutant plasmids. The D99C mutant is an active control, which shows wild-type drug resistance and DASPEI extrusion activity. On the other hand, the V105C and Q112C mutants showed a very low decrease in fluorescence, which was almost the same as the background level in KAM3 cells without a plasmid, indicating that these mutants had lost the DASPEI export activity. The N109C, D101C, and P116C mutants showed an intermediate fluorescence decrease, the degree of the fluorescence decrease increasing in this order. The order of the DASPEI export activities of the N109C, D101C, and P116C mutants was consistent with the widths of the drug resistance spectra of these mutants (Table I). Accessibility of NEM to Cysteine Residues of the Cys-scanning Mutants—The binding of [14C]NEM to the Cys-scanning mutants was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 6, NEM bound well to the four N-terminal (cavity-side) mutants (D99C, A100C, D101C, and I102C) and the five C-terminal (funnel-side) mutants (Q112C, L113C, M115C, P116C, and L117C), whereas it hardly or only weakly bound to the middle nine mutants (A103C, Q104C, V105C, Q106C, V107C, Q108C, N109C, K110C, and L111C). Although position 114 is located on the funnel side, the A114C mutant did not bind to NEM at all. In addition, the two C-terminal-end mutants (L118C and P119C) did not bind to NEM (data not shown). These observations suggest that: 1) the N-terminal end of the pore helix projects into and is exposed to the central cavity; 2) the pore is closed and that the residues in the middle of the pore are occluded in the protein interior; and 3) the C-terminal side of the pore is open to the funnel. The crystal structure of AcrB (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar) supports these conclusions. In addition, the side chain of Ala-114 protrudes opposite to the pore (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar). The pore helix bends at the C-terminal end and is connected to short helix Nα2′ (Fig. 7B), which is inserted into the core of the protein. Leu-118 and Pro-119 are located between the pore helix and Nα2′. The side chains of these two residues also protrude into the protein core.Fig. 7Three-dimensional structure of AcrB around the extramembrane central pore.A, top view of a ribbon representation. The three protomers are individually colored. B, a cutaway side view of the ribbon representation. The front protomer (green) is removed. The side chains of the functionally important residues, Asp-101, Val-105, Asn-109, Gln-112, and Pro-116, are depicted as a ball-and-stick representation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Competitive inhibition of [14C]NEM binding with a membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, AMS (4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid), was also measured. As a result, NEM binding to all of the NEM-reactive mutants was found to be more or less inhibited by AMS pretreatment of intact cells (data not shown). Therefore, it is clear that AMS can gain access to the central cavity from the periplasm via vestibules as well as to the funnel. Because the SDS electrophoresis shown in Fig. 6 was performed in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol, a significant amount of the disulfide cross-linking dimer was detected for the V105C and Q112C mutants. These residues face the pore interior, and in the trimer, they are close to the corresponding residues in the next monomer (Fig. 7). The greatest loss of transport activity of these two mutants among all of the pore mutants might be because of the conformational fixation by these S-S cross-links, suggesting the importance of a conformational change of the pore during the transport process. Besides, cross-linking was also observed in the D99C, D101C, I102C, and N109C mutants but the degree of linking was too low to affect the activity. One of the striking facts revealed by determination of the crystal structure of the multidrug efflux transporter AcrB was the fact that active drug export seems to occur at the extramembrane pore (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar). In the presumed substrate translocation pathway through the AcrB trimer, only the central pore is closed, whereas the pathways to the central cavity from the periplasm via vestibules and from the cytoplasm via transmembrane grooves are open for substrates (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar). Because the proton motive force might be captured in the transmembrane region, probably at the Asp-Lys ion pair (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar), the energy might be transmitted via a remote conformational change to open the extramembrane pore. This finding supports the important role of the extramembrane pore in the AcrB function. Fig. 7 shows the side chains of the functionally important residues determined in this study on the three-dimensional structure of AcrB around the extramembrane central pore. The side chains of the functionally important residues, Asp-101, Val-105, Asn-109, Gln-112, and Pro-116, are depicted on a ribbon representation of the AcrB structure. It is clear that all of the functionally important residues face the inside of the pore (Fig. 7A) and that all of the residues facing the inside of the pore are functionally important (Fig. 7B), indicating that the pore is a strong candidate for the substrate translocation pathway. The results of the NEM binding experiment supported that the pore is closed. The thickness of the permeability barrier corresponds to 2.5 turns of α-helices (9 residues). The cysteine-scanning mutants also revealed the importance of a conformational change of the pore during the transport process, that is, the mutants in which the pores are fixed in the closed state by disulfide cross linking showed an almost complete loss of the transport activity. The crystal structure of TolC, which is an outer membrane channel coupled with AcrB, is also closed (27Koronakis V. Shaff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Google Scholar), and is postulated to open during the transport process (28Andersen C. Koronakis E. Bokma E. Eswaran J. Humphreys D. Hughs C. Koronakis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11103-11108Google Scholar). The pore of the AcrB must undergo a similar conformational change for the transport function. However, because AcrB catalyzes active transport, the conformational change might not be a simple open-close one but rather a change from the inside-open form to the outside-open form. Recently, Elkins and Nikaido (9Elkins C.A. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6490-6498Google Scholar) exchanged the two large periplasmic loops of AcrB and AcrD in E. coli with each other and found that the substrate specificity is determined by these periplasmic loops (9Elkins C.A. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6490-6498Google Scholar). A similar observation was also observed on the replacement of the two large loops of MexB and MexY in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11Eda S. Maseda H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2085-2088Google Scholar) and of AcrB and MexB (10Tikhonova E.B. Wang Q. Zgurskaya H.I. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6499-6507Google Scholar). Our observation of the importance of the central pore supported their results. Mao et al. (12Mao W. Warren M.S. Black D.S. Satou T. Murata T. Nishino T. Gotoh N. Lomovskaya O. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 889-901Google Scholar) reported the point mutations that affect the substrate specificity of MexD (12Mao W. Warren M.S. Black D.S. Satou T. Murata T. Nishino T. Gotoh N. Lomovskaya O. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 889-901Google Scholar), all of which are located in the pore domain (lower part of the headpiece) (1Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Google Scholar). Therefore, substrate specificity is probably determined by the pore domain including the central pore. This study revealed that site-directed mutagenesis on the basis of a crystal structure is a useful tool for identifying the specific role of each structural module."

The work presented here definitively established Ter DNA-Fob1p interaction as an important step in fork arrest. DNA replication in many prokaryotes is often terminated at sequence-specific replication termini (Ter sites). Replication terminator proteins specifically bind to the Ter sites and arrest forks in an orientation-specific mode with respect to the replication origins (1.Bastia D. Mohanty B.K. DePamphilis M. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 177-215Google Scholar). In many eukaryotes, although every replicon in the multiorigin chromosomes does not have specific Ter sites, such sites are present in the nontranscribed spacer sequences in the rDNA from yeast to man (1.Bastia D. Mohanty B.K. DePamphilis M. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 177-215Google Scholar, 2.Rothstein R. Michel B. Gangloff S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, the Ter sites bind to replication termination proteins, called Tus and RTP, respectively, that are contrahelicases (3.Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6600-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have similar replication fork arrest systems located in their nontranscribed spacer elements. In S. pombe, replication fork arrest has been shown to occur at and near the mating type switch locus (13.Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14.Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J.

The rDNA locus of S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1) consists of 100–200 tandem copies of 9.1-kb rDNA units present in chromosome number XII. Each unit of the rDNA consists of a 35 S rRNA and a 5 S rRNA gene that transcribe in opposite directions. A nontranscribed spacer called NTS2 containing an origin of replication called ARS 1The abbreviations used are: ARS, ARS (autonomously replicating sequence; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; wt, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IR, inverted repeat; IRAS, inverted repeat associated sequence; TAP, tandem affinity purification. (autonomously replicating sequence) is located between the genes encoding the 35 S and the 5 S RNAs (6.Brewer B.J. Lockshon D. Fangman W. Cell. 1992; 71: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 16.Linskens M.H.K. Huberman J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4927-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The two replication forks initiated at the ARS face unequal fate. The rightward moving fork moves through the 35 S rDNA in the same direction as that of transcription until it meets the fork coming from the opposite direction. But the leftward moving fork, after passing through the 5 S rRNA gene, is arrested at two Ter sites located in the nontranscribed spacer called NTS1 and is thus prevented from entering the 35 S rRNA gene. The two Ter sites (known as replication fork barrier or RFB sites) located in NTS1 arrest replication forks in an orientation-dependent manner (6.Brewer B.J. Lockshon D. Fangman W. Cell. 1992; 71: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 7.Ward T.R. Hoang M.L. Prusty R. Lau C.K. Keil R.L. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 13: 4948-4957Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Ter1 and Ter2 sites are separated from each other by a few nucleotides and can be further separated by inserting foreign DNA between them without affecting their activities (7.Ward T.R.

The Ter sites in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are recombinogenic (2.Rothstein R. Michel B. Gangloff S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast rDNA also contains a recombination hot spot HOT1 that consists of two elements called enhancer and initiator that include the RNA polymerase I enhancer and promoters, respectively (see Fig. 1). The enhancer region includes the tandem Ter sites. The initiator and enhancer elements together stimulate high levels of recombination between tandemly repeated sequences even when placed at ectopic sites in a chromosome (17.Keil R.L. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1984; 39: 377-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18.Voelkel-Meiman K. Keil R.L. Roeder G.S.

Deletions of Ter sites (present in the enhancer element) and/or that of the promoter (present in the initiator element), as expected, reduce not only the HOT1 activity (18.Voelkel-Meiman K. Keil R.L. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1987; 48: 1071-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 21.Lin Y.H. Keil R.L.

A colony sectoring assay has been developed to identify mutations in genes that reduce HOT1 activity, and this technique has resulted in the identification of several genes that are involved in the recombination process (19.Zehfus B.R. McWilliams A.D. Lin Y.H. Hoekstra M.F. Keil R.L. Genetics. 1990; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Lin Y.H. Keil R.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 31-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FOB1 gene was discovered using such a colony sectoring assay and was shown by two-dimensional gel analysis to be involved in fork arrest at the Ter sites of rDNA (22.Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). FOB1 also plays a role in rDNA circle formation and aging (23.Defossez P.A. Prusty R. Kaeberlein M. Lin S.J. Ferrigno P. Silver P.A. Keil R.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and in expansion and contraction of rDNA repeats (24.Kobayashi T. Heck D.J. Nomura M. Horiuchi T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 25.Johzuka K. Horiuchi T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26.Takeuchi Y. Horiuchi T. Kobayashi T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although several functions of FOB1 have been described by in vivo experiments, very little is known about its biochemical properties and its precise mechanistic role in promoting replication termination. In the present work, we describe the isolation of several interesting mutants of FOB1 and purification of the wt and the mutant forms of the protein expressed in yeast to near-homogeneity. We show further that Fob1p protein specifically binds to the Ter1 and Ter2 sites. We present two lines of evidence in support of the proposition that interaction of Fob1p with the Ter1 and Ter2 sites causes replication termination. First, we show that mutation in the FOB1 locus that significantly reduces the DNA binding activity of the encoded protein also abolishes the ability of the protein to arrest replication forks in vivo. Second, mutations at Ter1 and Ter2 sites that separately inactivate replication termination at these sites also abolish binding of Fob1p to the two sequences. From the results, we conclude that interaction of Fob1p with Ter sites creates a protein-DNA complex that arrests replication forks in an orientation-specific fashion with respect to the nearest ARS site. Strains—The yeast strains used for sectoring assay are K2307 and its HRM1-1 derivative (gift from Dr. Ralph Keil) (21.Lin Y.H. Keil R.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 31-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant form of fob1 in HRM1-1 was deleted as described below. This strain (called Δfob1H) was used in sectoring assay and two-dimensional gel analysis. FOB1 gene was deleted from a protease-deficient strain SUB62 (Mata lys2-801 leu2-3, 2-112 ura3-52 his3-D200 trp1-1 (am)) (kindly provided by Dr. David Leggett) for expression of TAP-FOB and GST-TAP-FOB1 proteins. E. coli DH5a was used for cloning. Plasmids—For two-hybrid analysis, FOB1 and its mutants were cloned as BamHI-SalI fragments into pGAD424 and pGBT9 (27.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar). For sectoring/papillae formation assay, the LEU2 marker in pGAD424 and pGAD424 containing the FOB1 gene (GAD-FOB) or mutants was replaced by a hygromycin marker by gap repair cloning generating pGADh and its derivatives. For tandem affinity purification (TAP) tagging, the fragment containing ProtA-TEV-CBP site was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pBS1761 (28.Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar) and cloned as a BamHI fragment at the 5′ end of the FOB1 gene in GADhFOB plasmid (TAP-FOB). Fragment containing the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene under the Gal1 promoter and the HIS3 marker was amplified by PCR (29.Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4169) Google Scholar) and was used to construct the triple-tagged FOB1 expression plasmid GST-TAP-FOB. Sectoring Assay—Colony color sectoring assay was performed as described (21.Lin Y.H. Keil R.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 31-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vector pGAD424 or pGADh plasmid and their derivatives containing the wt FOB1 gene or its mutants were transformed into Δfob1H strain and plated either on SD/Ura–Leu– low Ade containing plates or on YPD + hygromycin plates. On YPD + hygromycin plates, growth was much faster, and sectoring/papillae formation was distinct and more frequent than on the plates containing minimal medium. Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of FOB1 gene was carried out by PCR with Taq polymerase with GAD forward and reverse primers in the presence of MnCl2 and low dNTP (one dNTP) concentrations. The mutants were co-transformed with a SmaI- or BamHI-digested pGAD424 or pGADh plasmid into Δfob1H strain and plated either on SD/Leu–Ura– low Ade or on YPD + hygromycin plates, respectively. The colonies that failed to sector were further streaked on appropriate plates to confirm the non-sectoring phenotype. Plasmids were isolated from the nonsectoring clones and transformed into E. coli to amplify and recover the plasmid DNA. The plasmids isolated from E. coli were again transformed into Δfob1H to confirm the loss of sectoring and then sequenced to identify the mutations. FOB1 Deletions—FOB1 deletion was carried out as indicated below. FOB1 gene was obtained from genomic DNA by PCR using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and was cloned into pUC18 at the SmaI site. pUC18-FOB1 plasmid was digested with BstZ17I or SnaBI and BstZ17I and ligated to the G418 cassette amplified by PCR from the plasmid pFA6KnMX4 (30.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). The fragment containing the G418 cassette flanked by the ends of FOB1 was amplified by PCR with pUC forward and reverse primers and transformed into the strain HRM1-1 or SUB62 to delete the FOB1 gene. FOB1 deletion was confirmed by PCR and by two-dimensional gel analysis to confirm loss of replication fork blockage activity. Two-hybrid Assay—For two-hybrid assay, the pGBT9 and pGAD424 plasmids and their derivatives containing FOB1 gene, its mutants, or deletions were transformed sequentially into the yeast strain PJ69-4A (31.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and patched on SD/Leu–Trp–, SD/Leu–Trp–Ade–, or SD/Leu–Trp–His– (with 2 mm aminotriazole) plates, and the interactions were subsequently confirmed by liquid β-galactosidase assay (described in Clontech manual). DNA Preparation and Two-dimensional Gel Analysis—Replication intermediate DNA was prepared from yeast cells growing in appropriate medium to A600 0.8–0.9. Cell lysis, DNA preparation, and two-dimensional gel analysis were carried out as described previously (32.Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The DNA was transferred to Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schüll), and hybridization was carried out as described (33.Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Purification of GST-TAP-Fob1p Protein—An overnight culture of Δfob1SUB62 cells containing the GST-TAP-FOB1 plasmid was inoculated into 10 liters of YPD with 2% raffinose and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Galactose was added to 2% final concentration at midlog phase, and the cells were harvested after 5 h and stored at–70 °C. Cells were quickly thawed and suspended in 100 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a mixture of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). Acid-washed glass beads (half the total volume of buffer A) were added to the cells, and the cells were lysed in a Waring Blendor by setting the blender speed to 7 and running the blender 6 times for 30 s each with 4-min intervals between each run. KCl was added to 150 mm final concentration. The lysate was first centrifuged in a Sorvall RC5B HS4 rotor at 5000 rpm for 10 min and then centrifuged in a Beckman ultracentrifuge at 30,000 rpm for 20 min in a Ti70 rotor, and the supernatant (fraction I) was collected. Ammonium sulfate was added to the fraction I to 70% final concentration, and it was centrifuged in the ultracentrifuge Ti70 rotor at 20,000 rpm for 20 min. The ammonium sulfate pellet was suspended in (150 ml) buffer B (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a mixture of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin), and conductivity was adjusted to that of buffer C (buffer B + 150 mm NaCl). 5 ml of calmodulin beads (Stratagene) were washed with buffer C, and the lysate was bound to the calmodulin beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The slurry was poured into a column, and the beads were washed with 100 ml of buffer C followed by 50 ml of buffer D (buffer B + 0.65 m NaCl). The protein was eluted with 5 fractions of 5 ml each of buffer E (buffer C with 2 mm EGTA instead of 2 mm CaCl2). The last four fractions containing the Fob1p fusion protein were pooled and loaded on a 1-ml Mono Q column in a fast pressure liquid chromatograph. The column was washed with 3 ml of buffer C and eluted with buffer C containing a gradient of 150 mm to 1.5 m NaCl. The fractions containing Fob1p protein were pooled and bound to 2.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed with 50 ml of buffer C and 50 ml of buffer F (buffer B + 0.8 m NaCl). Fob1p protein was eluted with buffer C containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm reduced glutathione. The protein, which was in a volume of 12.5 ml, was further concentrated by binding to 1 ml of calmodulin beads, washing with 10 ml of buffer B, followed by washing with 10 ml of buffer F and eluting with 10 0.5-ml fractions of buffer E. Fractions 2 and 3 were used for all experiments. Purification of TAP-Fob1p Protein for DNA Binding Assay—The SUB62 cells expressing TAP-Fob1p fusion protein were grown in 500 ml of medium and harvested. The cells were lysed in a bead beater and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was bound to 200 μl (packed volume) of calmodulin beads as above in buffer C and washed with buffer C. After washing, 20–50 μl of beads were used for DNA binding as described below. For some experiments we have made large scale preparations of this TAP-Fob1p protein with some modifications that will be published elsewhere. DNA for Fob1p Binding Assay—pUC18 plasmid DNA was digested with HaeIII or DdeI, and the digestion products were dephosphorylated by shrimp alkaline phosphate enzyme (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). An ∼370-bp-long Ter fragment was generated by PCR with RFBMAP1 and RFBMAP2 primers, the sequences of which are available upon request. The pUC18 fragments and the Ter (RFB) fragment were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The fragments were used separately and mixed together also (see Fig. 8). Custom-made oligonucleotides of different lengths representing TerI, TerII, and IR (inverted repeat) and their mutant forms were labeled as above. Briefly, 2 pmol of each oligonucleotide was labeled and mixed with 4 pmol of the complementary oligonucleotide in the presence of 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 600 mm NaCl. The mixture was heated in boiling water for 3 min and cooled for several hours (typically overnight). All the labeled DNA fragments were passed through a Sephadex G-25 spin column before use. Oligonucleotides of various lengths have been used in these experiments. Although most of the sequences are described in the figures and text, detailed sequences are available upon request. DNA Binding Assay—To the TAP-Fob1p protein bound to calmodulin beads, 20–50 fmol of labeled DNA was added in the presence of 5 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a volume of 200 μl of buffer C (calmodulin binding buffer), and the binding was carried out at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction mixture was loaded on a Bio-Rad polyprep column (catalogue 731-1550), and the beads were washed with 4× 1 ml of buffer C after which the protein-DNA complex was eluted with 4× 100 ml of buffer E (EGTA buffer). 200 μl of the eluate was mixed with DNA loading dye without or with 0.25% SDS and fractionated on a polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown in raffinose and galactose were spotted on slides, treated with DAPI for several minutes, and directly visualized by a Nikon microscope with visible, UV, and fluorescence filters. A Spot RT color camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) was used to take the photomicrographs. Replication Fork Arrest at Ter Sites—The locations and the landmarks around the replication termini derived from published works is shown in Fig. 1. The EcoRI-HpaI fragment should contain both of the Ter sites, and we confirmed this and calibrated our two-dimensional gel technique by cloning the hygromycin resistance marker into the pBB3NTS plasmid (7.Ward T.R. Hoang M.L. Prusty R. Lau C.K. Keil R.L. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 13: 4948-4957Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (resulting in the plasmid pBB3-H; Fig. 2A). Both the fob1 and wild type yeast cells were transformed with the plasmid, and cultures were grown in rich medium containing hygromycin, and the plasmid DNA was extracted as described above. A typical two-dimensional gel of the SspI cut plasmid that was probed with 32P-labeled NTS1 DNA is shown in Fig. 2C. The interpretation of the pattern is shown in diagrammatic form in Fig. 2B. Consistent with published observations, two tandem termination spots, Ter1 and Ter2, were observed on the Y arc. Most of the forks seemed to be getting arrested at Ter1 and any that leaked through were apparently arrested at Ter2. In addition to the twin Ter spots on the Y arc, two corresponding spots were observed in the X arc. The latter spots are generated by progression of forks initiated from the ARS, moving counterclockwise which merged with the forks that were initiated from the ARS and moving clockwise and arrested at Ter1 and Ter2, thus generating X-shaped intermediates. Previous work had shown that although all of Ter1 was located entirely within the HindIII and HpaI fragment (Fig. 1 center, H to Hp), Ter2 consisted of sequences located not only in this fragment but also of an inverted repeat sequence located just upstream of the HindIII site (see Fig. 1, lower, marked IR) (7.Ward T.R. Hoang M.L. Prusty R. Lau C.K. Keil R.L. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 13: 4948-4957Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The poly(dT) region located immediately upstream of the IR sequence is needed for enhanced activity of Ter2 (7.Ward T.R. Hoang M.L. Prusty R. Lau C.K. Keil R.L. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 13: 4948-4957Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mutations C20 and C26 specifically knock out Ter1, and the N35 mutation located in the inverted repeat knocks out Ter2 but not Ter1. Experiments utilizing some of these mutations are described below. HOT1 Induced Recombination and Isolation of fob1 Mutants— We wished to investigate the possible role of Fob1p in replication termination by endeavoring to isolate a series of mutants using the HOT1 recombination assay described (18.Voelkel-Meiman K. Keil R.L. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1987; 48: 1071-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 21.Lin Y.H. Keil R.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 31-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The principle of the HOT1 assay is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 3A. A yeast strain constructed by Dr. R. Keil (20.Huang G.S. Keil R.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 845-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Lin Y.H. Keil R.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 31-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contained chromosomally integrated tandem alleles of leu2 and a HOT1 element inserted into the left leu2 sequence. In between the tandem leu2 sequences is a reporter sequence ADE5 whose presence in the ade2, ade5 background of the host generated a red pigment. Loss of the ADE5 marker generated white sectors. We deleted the FOB1 gene from this host by one-step gene disruption as described above and introduced a plasmid expressing FOB1 or a blank plasmid into the host. In the presence of functional FOB1, the HOT1 sequence promoted recombination between the tandem leu2 sequences resulting in a recombination product excised as a circle and containing the ADE5 marker but without a replication origin. The circle was therefore eliminated from the cell generating white sectors (in red colonies) due to the loss of the ADE5 marker (Fig. 3B, panel II). When the blank plasmid (without FOB1) was present in the cell, there was very infrequent loss of ADE5 resulting in mostly solid red, non-sectoring colonies (Fig. 3B, panel I). We mutagenized the FOB1 sequence in vitro by PCR and introduced the mutagenized pool of plasmid DNA into the indicator host strain, and we looked for solid red colonies that potentially contained nonfunctional fob1 mutants. By specific site-directed mutagenesis, we also isolated mutant forms that did or did not knock out its recombinogenic activity. In this way we identified one mutation identified as L104S that generated solid red nonsectoring colonies (Fig. 2B, panel III). In contrast, a second mutation that was generated by mutating the GKT sequence in FOB1 to a GAT sequence (K168A) yielded a mutant form that did not lose the sectoring activity (Fig. 3B, panel IV). Although the GKT sequences are located in the putative Walker box indicative of a potential ATP-binding site, the FOB1 sequence did not have a typical Walker box (34.Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The K168A and a third mutation C246R (also known as HRM1-1 (21.Lin Y.H. Keil R.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 31-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that generated nonsectoring red colonies) are presented here as controls. A critical point in this context was to consider whether the mutants described above affected an isolated property of Fob1p (e.g. failure to terminate replication) or were trivial mutations that caused global misfolding of the mutant form of the protein. We reasoned that global misfolding should affect almost all or many of the biochemical properties of the mutant form such as its ability to be translocated into the nucleolus (Fob1p is a nucleolar protein; Refs. 23.Defossez P.A.

Boschiero C. Thuriaux P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5498-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), ability to oligomerize, and the ability to interact with other proteins. We therefore proceeded systematically to analyze the various properties of the mutant forms of Fob1p and the wild type control as described below. Interaction of Fob1p with Itself and with Another Protein YDR026C—Fob1p is known to interact with itself (36.Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2946) Google Scholar) and with a protein encoded by a yeast gene called YDR026C that has no known function (37.Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2039099407,"The multiprotein Mediator complex is a coactivator required for transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase II transcribed genes by DNA binding transcription factors. We previously partially purified a Med8-containing Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei (Brower, C. S., Sato, S., Tomomori-Sato, C., Kamura, T., Pause, A., Stearman, R., Klausner, R. D., Malik, S., Lane, W. S., Sorokina, I., Roeder, R. G., Conaway, J. W., and Conaway, R. C. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 10353–10358). Analysis of proteins present in the most highly enriched Mediator fractions by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of several new mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as several potential Mediator subunits. Here we identify one of these proteins, encoded by the previously uncharacterized AK000411 open reading frame, as a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. The AK000411 protein, which we designate hIntersex (human Intersex), shares significant sequence similarity with the Drosophila melanogaster intersex protein, which has functional properties expected of a transcriptional coactivator specific for the Drosophila doublesex transactivator. In addition, we show that hIntersex assembles into a subcomplex with Mediator subunits p28b and TRFP. Taken together, our findings identify a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator and shed new light on the architecture of the mammalian Mediator complex. The multiprotein Mediator complex is a coactivator required for transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase II transcribed genes by DNA binding transcription factors. We previously partially purified a Med8-containing Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei (Brower, C. S., Sato, S., Tomomori-Sato, C., Kamura, T., Pause, A., Stearman, R., Klausner, R.

Taken together, our findings identify a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator and shed new light on the architecture of the mammalian Mediator complex. The Drosophila melanogaster doublesex (dsx) gene encodes a transcription factor that is necessary for somatic sexual development in male and female flies (1.Cline T.W. Meyer B.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 637-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 2.Baker B.S. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. Cell. 2001; 105: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Male- and female-specific forms of the doublesex proteins, DSXM and DSXF, are encoded by alternatively spliced forms of the dsx transcript. DSXM and DSXF bind to an enhancer in the promoter of the yolk protein 1 and protein 2 genes and repress or activate their transcription in male and female flies, respectively (3.Burtis K.C. Coschigano K.T. Baker B.S. Wensink P.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2577-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4.Coschigano K.T. Wensink P.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Activation of the yolk protein 1 and protein 2 genes by DSXF also requires the product of the intersex (ix) gene. Although the precise mechanism of action of the intersex protein has not been determined, it appears to function as a coactivator for DSXF, since it binds specifically to DSXFin vitro and is required for activation of a reporter gene driven by the yolk protein enhancer in flies (5.Garrett-Engele C.M. Siegal M.L. Manoli D.S. Williams B.C. Li H. Baker B.S. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 4661-4675PubMed Google Scholar). The Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription is a multiprotein coactivator that regulates eukaryotic messenger RNA synthesis through direct interactions between DNA bound transcriptional activators and RNA polymerase II and the general initiation factors. The Mediator was first identified and characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it was found to be composed of more than twenty proteins including Srb2, Srb4, Srb5, Srb6 Srb7, Srb8, Srb9, Srb10, Srb11, Med1, Med2, Med4, Med6, Med7, Med8, Med11, Pgd1, Rox3, Cse2, Nut1, Nut2, Gal11, Sin4, and Rgr1 (6.Myers L.C.

Analysis of proteins present in our most highly enriched Mediator fractions by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of a large number of the known mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as a collection of proteins not previously recognized as subunits of the mammalian Mediator complex. In this report, we identify one such protein encoded by the AK000411 ORF as a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. The protein encoded by the AK000411 ORF is an apparent homolog of Drosophila intersex (5.Garrett-Engele C.M. Siegal M.L. Manoli D.S. Williams B.C. Li H. Baker B.S.

Materials—Anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibodies, anti-Myc (C-3956) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose, and anti-FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma. Anti-c-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-Med6 (E-20) and anti-TRFP (E-18) polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Med8 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a peptide corresponding to Med8 residues 247–268 (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc.).

Light chain-specific anti-mouse antibodies were from Bethyl Laboratories and labeled with Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-FLAG-Agarose Chromatography—Anti-FLAG-agarose immunoaffinity chromatography was carried out essentially as described for purification of the TRAP/SMCC Mediator complex (15.Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (16.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Undialyzed nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose beads in buffer A (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 0.3 m KCl for at least 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with a 50-fold excess of buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl and once with a 50-fold excess of buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 10 mm Hepes, 0.1 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 2 mg/ml FLAG peptide. Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Insect Cells—Sf21 cells were cultured at 27 °C in Sf-900 II SFM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Sf21 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 or 20 with the appropriate recombinant baculoviruses. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were collected and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.28 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.33 mg/ml benzamidine. Lysates were centrifuged 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—FLAG-hIntersex was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells and purified by anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography as described above. The eluate from anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography was adjusted to a conductivity equivalent to that of 0.05 m NaCl and applied to a 0.6 ml of TSK DEAE-NPR HPLC column (Tosoh-BioSep) pre-equilibrated in buffer C (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.1 m NaCl. FLAG-hIntersex was recovered in the flow-through fraction. His-Myc-TRFP was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells and purified batchwise by nickel chromatography using HIS-Select™ HC nickel affinity gel (Sigma). Following incubation of Sf21 lysates containing His-Myc-TRFP with nickel affinity gel, the gel was washed with buffer B (40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.28 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.33 mg/ml benzamidine) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer B containing 0.3 m NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins in gel slices were subjected to in-gel reduction, S-carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion. Peptide sequences were determined in a single run by microcapillary reversed-phase HPLC coupled to the nanospray ionization source of a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan LCQ DECA XPPLUS, San Jose, CA). Tandem mass spectrometry spectra were interpreted using the SEQUEST algorithm run in the BioWorks 3.0 software package from ThermoFinnigan. We previously reported partial purification from rat liver nuclear extracts of a multiprotein Mediator complex with an apparent native molecular mass by gel filtration of more than 1000 kDa (12.Brower C.S. Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Kamura T. Pause A. Stearman R. Klausner R.D. Malik S. Lane W.S. Sorokina I. Roeder R.G. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10353-10358Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analysis of proteins present in the most highly enriched Mediator fractions by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of many previously characterized mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as a collection of potential Mediator subunits including the LCMR1, p28b, Surf5, and HSPC296 proteins, which we subsequently demonstrated are bona fide Mediator subunits (13.Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Banks C.A. Sorokina I. Parmely T.J. Kong S.E. Jin J. Cai Y. Lane W.S. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15123-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Among the additional proteins present in the most highly enriched Mediator fractions and identified by mass spectrometry was a previously uncharacterized, 200-amino acid protein encoded by the AK000411 ORF (Fig. 1A). PSI-BLAST searches of the NCBI protein data base revealed that the AK000411 protein bears significant sequence similarity (E-value 2e–13) to the 188-amino acid D. melanogaster interesex protein (Fig. 1B). BLAST searches revealed no obvious hIntersex orthologs in lower eukaryotes including Caenorhabditis elegans and yeast. To begin to address the possibility that hIntersex is a bona fide subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex, we took advantage of three HeLa cell lines stably expressing either Mediator subunit Nut2, Mediator subunit LCMR1, or hIntersex, all with N-terminal FLAG tags. The FLAG-Nut2-expressing HeLa cell line has been used extensively as a source for anti-FLAG-agarose immunoaffinity purification of the transcriptionally active human TRAP/SMCC Mediator complex (15.Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts prepared from parental, FLAG-Nut2, FLAG-LCMR1, and FLAG-hIntersex HeLa cell lines were subjected to anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography as described previously for purification of the human FLAG-Nut2-containing TRAP/SMCC Mediator complex. As shown in the silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of Fig. 1A, anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from the FLAG-hIntersex (lane 1)-, FLAG-Nut2 (lane 2)-, and FLAG-LCMR1 (lane 3)-expressing HeLa cells appeared to include remarkably similar sets of proteins. Analysis of proteins present in the FLAG-Nut2-containing TRAP/SMCC Mediator complex and anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-LCMR1-expressing HeLa cells by tandem mass spectrometry confirmed that they contained similar sets of proteins and that each included most of the known mammalian Mediator subunits (see Table I in the Supplemental Material). Importantly, the hIntersex protein was detected in both the FLAG-Nut2- and FLAG-LCMR1-containing Mediator complexes by mass spectrometry (see Table I in Supplemental Material) and by Western blotting with anti-hIntersex rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against full-length human hIntersex, arguing that the hIntersex protein is a previously unrecognized subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. In addition, anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-hIntersex-expressing HeLa cells were found in Western blotting experiments to contain many of the known mammalian Mediator subunits (Fig. 2B), again arguing that hIntersex is associated with the mammalian Mediator complex. Finally, and consistent with previous findings indicating that the mammalian Mediator complex binds to and can be purified through interactions with the VP16 and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) transcriptional activation domains, we observe that hIntersex can be purified along with other Mediator subunits from HeLa cell lysates by GST-VP16 or GST-TR chromatography. As shown in Fig. 3, hIntersex, as well as the Mediator subunits TRAP80 and Med8, can be purified from HeLa cell lysates using immobilized GST-VP16, but not GST. Similarly hIntersex and other Mediator subunits bind immobilized GST-TR in a ligand-dependent fashion. Thus, we observe that the hIntersex protein copurifies with the mammalian Mediator complex by several independent methods, arguing that it is a bona fide subunit of the Mediator.Fig. 3hIntersex associates with the VP16 and TR transcriptional activation domains.A, GST-VP16 was prebound to glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for at least 4 h at 4 °C with undialyzed HeLa cell nuclear extracts prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (16.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Following incubation with HeLa cell nuclear extracts, the glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed seven times with a 50-fold excess of the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with GST elution buffer (50 mm glutathione, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 120 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). B, GST-TR was prebound to glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) in GST-TR buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm AEBSF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with and without 100 μm ligand for TR (T3, 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine). Following incubation with HeLa cell nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 4 h, the beads were washed five times with a 10-fold excess of GST-TR buffer containing a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 26 μm TRAP220 peptide. Aliquots of glutathione-Sepharose eluates were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with the antibodies indicated in the figure. Western blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and Super-Signal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain additional evidence supporting assignment of the hIntersex protein as a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex, we sought to identify pairwise binding partners of the hIntersex protein among the known Mediator subunits. To accomplish this, we carried out initial screens to assess the ability of hIntersex to interact with known mammalian Mediator subunits coexpressed with hIntersex in transiently transfected 293T cells or baculovirus-infected insect cells and to assess the ability of in vitro translated Mediator subunits to bind bacterially expressed GST-hIntersex. The results of these experiments identified the TRFP, TRAP25, and Surf5 Mediator subunits as potential hIntersex binding partners (data not shown), with TRFP exhibiting the best binding in all assays. The hIntersex-TRFP interaction could be reconstituted by mixing FLAG-hIntersex and His-Myc-TRFP, which had been expressed independently in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified. As shown in Fig. 4A, hIntersex alone flowed through a TSK DEAE-NPR column at 0.1 m NaCl, whereas the reconstituted hIntersex-TRFP complex bound to the column and eluted with ∼0.15 m NaCl. In light of our previous observation that TRFP interacts directly with the p28b Mediator subunit to form a stable heterodimer (13.Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Banks C.A. Sorokina I. Parmely T.J. Kong S.E. Jin J. Cai Y. Lane W.S. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15123-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that hIntersex can interact with the TRFP-p28b complex. To accomplish this, insect cells were coinfected with baculoviruses encoding various combinations of FLAG-hIntersex, Myc-TRFP, and Myc-p28b. As shown in Fig. 4B, Myc-TRFP and Myc-p28b could be coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-hIntersex. Binding of p28b to hIntersex depended on the presence of TRFP, indicating that TRFP bridges hIntersex and p28b in the complex and raising the possibility that the TRFP-p28b module may serve to recruit the hIntersex protein into the Mediator complex. In summary, in this report we identify the previously uncharacterized mammalian hIntersex protein as a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. Our data indicates that hIntersex is likely to be located in or adjacent to the Mediator head-domain (also known as the Srb4 subcomplex), since we have shown that it forms a heteromeric complex with TRFP and p28b, mammalian homologs of the S. cerevisiae head-domain subunits Srb2 and Srb5 (14.Boube M. Joulia L. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.-M. Cell. 2002; 110: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17.Kang J.S. Kim S.H. Hwang M.S. Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42003-42010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Whether the Drosophila intersex protein is also a subunit of the Drosophila Mediator complex remains to be determined; however, it seems most likely that it is given the strong similarity between other mammalian and Drosophila Mediator subunits. Because the Drosophila intersex protein functions as a coactivator for the sex-specific DNA binding transactivator DSXF (5.Garrett-Engele C.M. Siegal M.L. Manoli D.S. Williams B.C. Li H. Baker B.S. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 4661-4675PubMed Google Scholar), our results raise the possibilities (i) that direct contacts between the Drosophila DSXF and intersex proteins could recruit the Mediator complex to promoters activated by DSXF in flies and (ii) that hIntersex, analogous to its Drosophila homolog, functions as an adaptor molecule between the human Mediator complex and one or more DNA binding transactivators. At the present time, we have not identified transactivators that function through interactions with hIntersex, and we have been unable to detect a direct interactions between hIntersex and Drosophila DSXF. Although a number of mammalian transcription factors of the Doublesex family have been identified (18.Hodgkin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2322-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), they share little homology with Drosophila doublesex outside of their DNA binding domains. Consequently, more work will be required to determine which, if any, transactivators function through direct interactions with hIntersex and whether hIntersex, like Drosophila intersex, plays a critical role in specific developmental pathways.

https://openalex.org/W1984924559,"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is an important regulator of osteoblast differentiation. However, the regulation of osteoblast apoptosis by BMP signaling remains poorly understood. Here we examined the role of type I BMP receptor (BMP-RI) in osteoblast apoptosis promoted by BMP-2. Despite undetectable BMP-RIB expression in OHS4 cells, BMP-2 or BMP-2 overexpression increased osteoblast differentiation similarly as in SaOS2 cells which express BMP-RIB, as shown by alkaline phosphatase and CBFA1/RUNX2 expression. In contrast to SaOS2 cells, however, BMP-2 or BMP-2 overexpression did not increase caspase-9 and caspases-3, -6, and -7 activity and DNA fragmentation in OHS4 cells. Consistently, BMP-2 increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity, and PKC inhibition suppressed BMP-2-induced caspase activity in SaOS2 but not in OHS4 cells that lack BMP-RIB. A dominant negative BMP-RIB inhibited BMP-2-induced caspase activity, whereas wild-type BMP-RIB promoted caspase activity induced by BMP-2 in SaOS2 and MC3T3-E1 cells. Wild-type BMP-RIB rescued the apoptotic response to BMP-2, and a constitutively active BMP-RIB restored the apoptotic signal in OHS4 cells, supporting an essential role for BMP-RIB in osteoblast apoptosis. We also assessed whether BMP-2-induced apoptosis occurred independently of osteoblast differentiation. General inhibition of caspases did not abolish BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase and CBFA1/RUNX2 expression in SaOS2 cells. Furthermore, broad caspases inhibition increased matrix mineralization but did not reverse the BMP-2 effect on mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells. These results indicate that BMP-2-induced apoptosis was mediated by BMP-RIB in osteoblasts and occurred independently of BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation, which provides additional insights into the dual mechanism of BMP-2 action on osteoblast fate.

Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The terminal maturation of osteoblasts is followed by the occurrence of apoptosis, which begins to occur during the late differentiation stage (36.Lynch M.P. Capparelli C. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 37.Manolagas S.C. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). The importance of apoptosis for osteoblast function and bone formation has been demonstrated during bone development and remodeling (37.Manolagas S.C. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar, 38.Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In the developing limb, BMPs induce apoptosis of mesenchymal cells, which is critical for normal skeletal development (39.Zou H. Niswander L. Science. 1996; 272: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 40.Zou H. Wieser R. Massague J. Niswander L.

Biol. 2002; 249: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This effect is not limited to mesenchymal cells during development because we recently showed that BMP-2 activates apoptosis in postnatal human osteoblastic cells (26.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Fromigué O. Marie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29028-29036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of osteoblast apoptosis by BMP signaling remains poorly understood. Type IB BMP receptor was found to be involved in the regulation of embryonic cell death during development (40.Zou H. Wieser R. Massague J. Niswander L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2191-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Although this suggests that type I BMP-Rs may be involved in apoptosis, this has not been examined previously in osteoblasts. Furthermore, although BMP-2 may exert a dual control of osteoblast fate through regulation of differentiation and apoptosis, it is unknown whether BMP-2-induced apoptosis can occur independently of its effects on osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we examined the role of type I BMP receptors in the control of apoptosis by BMP-2 in osteoblastic cells by using human osteoblastic cells lacking BMP-RIB as a model. We also tested the hypothesis that the effect of BMP-2 on osteoblast apoptosis may occur independently of its effect on osteoblast gene expression. Our results suggest that BMP-RIB is essential for BMP-2-induced activation of apoptosis in osteoblastic cells and mediates apoptosis independently of BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation. Cell Culture and Treatments —We studied two human osteosarcoma cell lines (OHS4 and SaOS2) that express osteoblast phenotypic characteristics including alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, and osteocalcin (44.Rodan G.A. Majeska R.J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1982; 110: 249-259PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Fournier B. Price P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 46.Drissi H. Hott M. Marie P.J. Lasmoles F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We took advantage of these cell lines because they express BMP-RIB differently (see under “Results”). We also used clonal normal mouse calvaria-derived MC3T3-E1 cells that display all characteristics of differentiating osteoblasts, including mineralization in vitro (47.Quarles L.D. Yohay D.A. Lever L.W. Caton R. Wenstrup R.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine (292 mg/liter), 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). For analysis of differentiation, the cells were cultured at confluence in the presence of 10% FCS and then treated with recombinant human BMP-2 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) for the time indicated before analysis of osteoblast marker genes by RT-PCR and Western blot. For analysis of cell survival, the cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free conditions and then treated with BMP-2 for 24 h before analysis of apoptosis and caspase activity. To analyze whether inhibition of apoptosis results in change in osteoblast differentiation gene expression, serum-deprived SaOS2 cells that express BMP-RIB receptors (see under “Results”) were cultured in the presence of 1% FCS and treated with a broad pharmacological inhibitor of caspases (Z-VAD-fmk, 20 μm) (48.Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Wiliams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) or its solvent (Me2SO), in the presence or absence of BMP-2 (50 ng/ml) for the time indicated. Inhibition of osteoblast apoptosis by Z-VAD-fmk was checked by quantification of cell number after 72 h of treatment. The expression of osteoblast phenotypic genes ALP and Cbfa1/Runx2 was determined by RT-PCR after 24 h of treatment with Z-VAD-fmk and BMP-2. ALP activity was determined at 48 h of treatment as described (12.Haÿ E. Hott M. Graulet A.M. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Analysis of Mineralization —For analysis of mineralization, MC3T3-E1 cells that express BMP-RIA and RIB receptors (49.Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3519-3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured at confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS and then cultured in the presence of ascorbic acid (25 ng/ml) and inorganic phosphate (3 mm) to induce collagenous matrix release and mineralization (47.Quarles L.D. Yohay D.A. Lever L.W. Caton R. Wenstrup R.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with Z-VAD-fmk (20 μm) or its solvent (Me2SO), in the presence or absence of BMP-2 (50 ng/ml). After 14 days, matrix mineralization was detected by alizarin red and von Kossa stainings which reveal calcium and phosphate, respectively (50.Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and microphotographed using an Olympus microscope (Japan). Quantification of matrix mineralization was determined by colorimetric measurement of calcium, as described (50.Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Transfection —Rat cDNA for BMP-2 was kindly provided by Drs. Di Chen and G. Mundy (51.Chen D. Harris M.A. Rossini G. Dunstan C.R. Dallas S.L. Feng J.Q. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 60: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Wild-type (wt)BMP-RIB, constitutively active (ca)BMP-RIB, and dominant negative (DN)-BMP-RIB vectors were kindly provided by Dr. S. Roman-Roman (Aventis, Romainville, France). The DN-BMP-RIB construct was created by a single amino acid change in the ATP-binding site (Lys-231 to Arg) as described (40.Zou H. Wieser R. Massague J. Niswander L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2191-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The caBMP-RIB was created by a point mutation (Gln-203 to Asp) (40.Zou H. Wieser R. Massague J. Niswander L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2191-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We performed transient transfections allowing effective expression of the transfected cDNA for at least 48 h. Stable transfection with these vectors could not be conducted because the cells die by apoptosis. Transient transfection was sufficient to determine the changes in apoptosis induced by BMP-2 occurring at 24–48 h of treatment (26.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Fromigué O. Marie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29028-29036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). OHS4 and SaOS2 cells were transfected with wtBMP-RIB, caBMP-RIB, and DN-BMP-RIB vectors. MC3T3-E1 cells were also transfected with wtBMP-RIB or DN-BMP-RIB vectors to ensure reproducibility of the results in normal osteoblastic cells. All cells were plated at 5,000 cells/cm2 the day before transfection. The cells were co-transfected with the plasmid (15 μg/100-mm dish) and pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega), at a 10:1 ratio, by calcium-phosphate precipitation according to standard procedures described by the manufacturer (Profection mammalian transfection systems, Promega). After 16 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium (1% BSA, serum-free) overnight. The efficiency of transfection was controlled by determination of β-galactosidase activity. The number of β-galactosidase-positive cells was counted 72 h post-transfection. Efficient transfection of BMP-2 cDNA was also tested by the expression of BMP-2 by Western blot analysis. Apoptosis and the activity of caspases were determined as described below. RT-PCR Analysis —The expression of BMP-RIA, BMP-RIB, BMP-RII, Smad1, -4, -5, and –8, ALP, CBFA1/RUNX2, and N-cadherin mRNA levels were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. Optimization of RT-PCR results was carried out by generating saturation curves of RT-PCR products of each gene and of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) against cycle number (0–35 cycles) as described (13.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We chose the same cycle number (30 cycles) for all genes, except for N-cadherin and GAPDH (25 cycles), in which the amplification was linear. After treatment with BMP-2 (50 ng/ml) or the solvent, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with Extract-All (Eurobio, France) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed, and the cDNA samples were then divided and amplified using specific primers (20 pmol/tube) (13.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Primers were as follows: sense 5′-TGTACTTCCTCCTGTGCTGG-3′, antisense 5′-TGGTTCCTCATAAGCAACCG-3′ for Smad1; sense 5′-GCTTCACTGCAGAGTAATGC-3′, antisense 5′-CGGATCCCCATCCTGATAAGG-3′ for Smad4; sense 5′-CCTGCTAGCAGCACATATCC-3′, antisense 5′-CATTCCGCATACACCTCTCC-3′ for Smad5; sense 5′-AGATGCTGCTGTGTCACTCACG-3′, antisense 5′-GGTGAAGACCTTGAGGCTGC-3′ for Smad8; sense 5′-TAGAGTTTCTTCCTTCCGATGG-3′, antisense 5′-GCATACTTAATGGACATTGCT-3′ for BMP-RIA; sense 5′-GCAGCACAGACGGATATTGT-3′, antisense 5′-TTTCATGCCTCATCAACACT-3′ for BMP-RIB; and sense 5′-ACGGGAGAGAAGACGAGCCT-3′, antisense 5′-CTAGATCAAGAGAGGGTTCG-3′ for BMP-RII. Other primers were as described previously (13.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 26.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Fromigué O. Marie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29028-29036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Southern blots were performed by running aliquots of amplified cDNA on 1.2% agarose gel followed by transfer onto nylon membrane according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization of blots was carried out overnight at 50 °C with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled internal primers. Membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, once in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 10 min and then the filters were exposed to x-ray films. Autoradiographic signals were quantified using a scanner densitometer (Transydine General Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). The signal for each gene was corrected for GAPDH. Western Blot Analysis —Cells (10,000/cm2) treated with BMP-2 (50 ng/ml) or the solvent were washed twice with cold PBS and scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) containing 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein samples were solubilized in 4× Laemmli SDS loading buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Fifty micrograms of proteins, determined using the DC Protein assay (Bio-Rad), were resolved on 12% acrylamide gel and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride-Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were saturated overnight with 1% blocking solution (Roche Applied Science) in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl) and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Cbfa1/Osf2 (52.Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), monoclonal anti-N-cadherin (Sigma) (13.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), polyclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-BMP-2/4 or monoclonal anti-BMP-RIB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 0.5% blocking buffer. After 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were washed twice with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.5% blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies, the membranes were washed, and the signals were visualized with ECL+ blotting substrate (Amersham Biosciences). The specific bands on the autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometry, and the level of expression was normalized to β-actin. Detection of Apoptosis —To detect apoptosis, DNA cleavage was assessed by the TUNEL assay as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). SaOS2 and OHS4 cells (5,000/cm2) cultured on Labtek chambers in serum-deprived conditions (1% BSA, serum-free) for 24 h were treated with BMP-2 (50 ng/ml) or the solvent for 24 h and then fixed with paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 5 min. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% H2O2, and the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, at 4 °C for 2 min and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the TUNEL reaction mixture containing the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Incorporated fluorescein was detected by sheep anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The TUNEL signal was detected with peroxidase-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody revealed with diaminobenzidine and mounted. TUNEL-positive cells were detected by brown nuclei and nuclear fragmentation. Positive controls consisted of cells treated for 24 h with 50 μm etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor that induces DNA damage and nuclear fragmentation associated with apoptosis. Additional positive controls consisted of cells treated with DNase I for 10 min. Negative controls were obtained by omitting the transferase from the reaction (26.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Fromigué O. Marie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29028-29036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In each experiment, the number of total and TUNEL-positive cells was counted. A total of 1,500 cells was counted for each cell type, and the results were expressed as percentage of total cells. Determination of Caspase Activity —To identify the caspases involved in BMP-2-induced apoptosis, cells (10,000/cm2) were cultured in 1% BSA/serum-free medium in the presence of BMP-2 (50 ng/ml) or the solvent. After 24 h, the cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min on ice and stored at –20 °C. The activity of initiator caspases (caspase-2, caspase-8, and caspase-9) and effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) was determined by the cleavage of synthetic fluorogenic substrates containing the amino acid sequence recognized by specific caspases (13.Haÿ E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The substrates were as follows: DEHD (Asp-Glu-His-Asp) for caspase-2; DEVD (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp) for caspase-3-like; IETD (Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp) for caspase-8; LEHD (Leu-Glu-His-Asp) for caspase-9, combined to a fluorophore (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, AMC). Upon cleavage of the substrate by caspases, free AMC fluorescence emission was detected using a spectrofluorimeter. For the assay, aliquots of 100 μl were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 200 μl of reaction buffer (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4) containing 5 μl of specific substrate (20 μm final concentration). The fluorescence released in samples was measured by excitation at 367 nm, and reading was made at 440 nm. The negative control was buffer mix, and the positive control was free AMC (10 μm in PBS). Results were expressed as arbitrary units and corrected for protein content. Protein Kinase C Assay —For direct analysis of PKC activation, SaOS2 and OHS4 cells (10,000/cm2) were cultured in 1% BSA serum-free medium for 24 h and then treated with BMP-2 (50 ng/ml) or the solvent for 10–60 min. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). PKC activity was determined by measuring the transfer of 32P-labeled phosphate to a biotinylated peptide substrate (AAKIQAS*FRGHMARKK) that is specific for PKC activi"

https://openalex.org/W2081926247,"Increasing evidence suggests that the SYT-SSX fusion gene plays an important role in synovial sarcoma development and progression. However, very little is known about the downstream targets of SYT-SSX. In this study, we used antisense oligonucleotides to block the expression of the SYT-SSX fusion gene in synovial sarcoma cells. By comparing SYT-SSX inhibited cells with noninhibited cells, the gene expression profile was analysed using cDNA microarray and established by real-time PCR. Herewith, using a filter containing 1176 cancer-relevant genes, we found that the DNA repair gene XRCC4 and the DNA mismatch repair gene MSH2 were downregulated, whereas the gene encoding for the serine/threonine protein kinase PRK (also known as CNK), and the macrophage inhibitory cytokine MICI (also known as PLAB) were upregulated after the inhibition of SYT-SSX. In comparison, expression of the XRCC4 gene was undergoing the strongest alteration. Consistently, the protein expression of XRCC4 was found to be decreased after SYT-SSX inhibition, whereas there were no detectable changes for the other gene products. Our study provides some clues to elucidate the signaling pathways of the SYT-SSX fusion gene, as well as it demonstrates a valuable model system for search for other SYT-SSX targets."
https://openalex.org/W1985211885,"Dysfunction of cell-cycle checkpoints in DNA mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient cells in response to DNA damage has implications for anticancer therapy and genetic instability. We have studied the cell-cycle effects of MMR deficiency (Msh2−/−) in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exposed to cisplatin (10 μ M × 1 h) using time-lapse microscopy. Kinetic responses of MEFs from different embryos and passage ages varied, but we report a consistent drug-induced inhibition of mitotic entry (approx. 50%). There was a loss of an early-acting (<5 h) delay in G2 to M transition in Msh2−/− cells, although a later-acting G2 arrest was apparently normal. This suggests that Msh2 primarily acts to delay mitotic entry of cells already in G2, that is, DNA damage incurred during G2 does not influence the cell once committed to mitotic traverse. Irrespective of Msh2 status, cisplatin treatment and the incurred DNA damage did not effect mitotic traverse or show any evidence for early (within 24 h) cell death. The results indicate that Msh2−/− status can result in the premature commitment to mitosis of a cell subpopulation, determined by the fraction residing in G2 at the time of damage induction. The findings suggest a new route to MMR-driven genetic instability that does not rely primarily on the integrity of the late-acting checkpoint."

A small number of 3(S)-hydroyxyproline residues are present in most collagens in the Xaa position. Neither the structural nor a biological role is known for 3(S)-hydroxyproline. To characterize the structural role of 3(S)-hydroxyproline, the peptide Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 was synthesized and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. At 4 °C in water the circular dichroism spectrum indicates that this peptide was in a polyproline-II-like secondary structure with a positive peak at 225 nm similar to Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. The positive peak at 225 nm almost linearly decreases with increasing temperature to 95 °C without an obvious transition.

Therefore 3(S)-hydroxyproline destabilizes the collagen triple helix in either position. In contrast, when 3(S)-hydroxyproline is inserted as a guest in the highly stable -Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyprepeated host sequence, Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH2 forms as stable a trimer (Tm = 49.6 °C) as Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)8-Gly-Gly-NH2 (Tm = 48.9 °C). Given that Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH2 forms a triple helix nearly as stable as the above two peptides (Tm = 45.0 °C) and the knowledge that Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2 does not form a triple helix, we conclude that the host environment dominates the structure of host-guest peptides and that these peptides are not necessarily accurate predictors of triple helical stability.

The collagen triple helix is used as a structural motif in other proteins such as C1q, macrophage scavenger receptor, collectins, and surfactant proteins (1.Tenner A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2.Crouch E. Wright J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The collagen triple helix domain might have a significant role in the molecular recognition of these proteins. Although it is one of the most extensively studied proteins, the structure of the collagen triple helix is still not fully understood. The collagen molecule consists of three polyproline-II-like left-handed helices that form a right-handed superhelix. The polypeptides that form the collagen triple helix have repeated -Gly-Xaa-Yaa- sequences. The Xaa and Yaa positions are frequently occupied by proline residues. These proline residues are posttranslationally modified during biosynthesis (3.Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These modifications give the collagens the heterogeneity needed for their various biological roles in tissues and organs. Almost all proline residues in the Yaa position in vertebrate collagens are posttranslationally hydroxylated by prolyl-4-hydroxylase (4.Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This modification to 4(R)-hydroxyproline (4(R)Hyp) stabilizes the triple helix and is used to modulate the stability for the requirements of the organism (5.Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In addition to 4(R)-hydroxyproline, 3(S)-hydroxyproline (3(S)Hyp) is found in almost all collagens (6.Wolff 3rd, J.S. Logan M.A. Ogle J.D. Fed. Proc. 1966; 25: 862-863PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Wolff 3rd, J.S. Ogle J.D. Logan M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1300-1307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3(S)-Hydroxyproline is the product of the enzyme prolyl-3-hydroxylase, which has not been well characterized (8.Risteli J. Tryggvason K. Kivirikko K.I. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9.Risteli J. Tryggvason K. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 73: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The occurrence of 3(S)Hyp is much less frequent than that of 4(R)Hyp in the total amino acid content of collagens. In basement membrane collagens, fractions range from 1 to 15 residues (10.Kresina T.F. Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3089-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11.Kefalides N.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1973; 6: 63-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) per 1000. 3(S)-Hydroxyproline is also found in other types of collagens, such as type I (11.Kefalides N.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1973; 6: 63-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), type V (12.Burgeson R.E. El Adli F.A. Kaitila I.I. Hollister D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 13.Rhodes R.K. Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3442-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), type X (14.Bos K.J. Rucklidge G.J. Dunbar B. Robins S.P. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), interstitial and cuticle collagens of annelids (15.Gaill F. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the cysteine proteinases synthesized by the adult stage of the trematode Fasciola hepatica (16.Wijffels G.L. Panaccio M. Salvatore L. Wilson L. Walker I.D. Spithill T.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The only reported sequences containing 3(S)Hyp are in Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp tripeptide units (15.Gaill F. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17.Gryder R.M. Lamon M. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2470-2474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Rexrodt F.W. Hopper K.E. Fietzek P.P. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), although 3(S)Hyp might occur in other sequences. In addition, it was reported that 3(S)Hyp is degraded much faster than 4(R)Hyp during the hydrolysis in 6 m HCl as used in amino acid analysis (19.Bellon G. Berg R. Chastang F. Malgras A. Borel J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Some reports might therefore have underestimated the 3(S)Hyp content. Previous studies have shown that the peptide (Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)10 forms a triple helix that has a significantly higher transition temperature than the trimer of the peptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 (20.Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the experimental data indicate the contribution of 4(R)Hyp in the Yaa position to the stability, the exact mechanism is still controversial (21.Jenkins C.L. Raines R.T. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22.Vitagliano L. Berisio R. Mastrangelo A. Mazzarella L. Zagari A.

Biopolymers. 2001; 58: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because neither (Pro-4(S)Hyp-Gly)10 (24.Inouye K. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 420: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), (4(S)Hyp-Pro-Gly)10 (24.Inouye K. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. 1982; 219: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) forms a stable triple helix in water, it was believed that (Gly-4(R)Hyp-Yaa)10 peptides do not form a triple helix in water until our recent reports (26.Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24466-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27.Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32373-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). There is a consensus about two factors stabilizing the collagen triple helix: the interchain GlyNH... CO(Xaa) hydrogen bonds and the ϕ dihedral angle limitation by the pyrrolidine ring structure. Additional factors that have been proposed are solvent water molecule-mediated hydrogen bonds, the propensity of the pyrrolidine ring puckering down in the Xaa and up in the Yaa position (23.Vitagliano L. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Biopolymers. 2001; 58: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28.Improta R. Mele F. Crescenzi O. Benzi C. Barone V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7857-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the inductive effect of Hyp to stabilize transXaa-Hyp peptide bond conformation and the strengthening of the NH... CO bond (21.Jenkins C.L. Raines R.T. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 29.Holmgren S.K. Taylor K.M. Bretscher L.E. Raines R.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 666-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and the gauche effect of 4(R)Hyp in the Yaa to pucker up (Cγ-exo pucker) (21.Jenkins C.L. Raines R.T. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, it is still difficult to consistently explain all the experimental results. The basement membrane collagens (type IV) have more than 20 interruptions of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeated sequence in each α-chain. The biological function of basement membranes is related to cell growth and differentiation, tissue repair, filtration at the glomeruli, etc. (30.Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 31.Adachi E. Hopkinson I. Hayashi T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 173: 73-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The supramolecular structure of type IV collagen consists of a fine meshwork with frequent branches. 3(S)Hyp might be related to the supramolecular structure and the thermal stability of type IV collagen molecules. The supramolecular structure of type IV collagen suggests its triple helical domain might have a more flexible property than fibrillar collagen molecules. In this study we address the structural role of 3(S)-hydroxyproline and its contribution to the thermal stability. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized with an ABI 433A synthesizer. Couplings were carried out on a PAL-PEG-PS resin (0.16 mmol/g, PerSeptive Biosystems) using Fmoc 1The abbreviations used are: Fmoc, N-(9-fluoroenyl)methoxycarbonyl; CD, circular dichroism; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. -amino acids (Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-4(R)Hyp(tBu)-OH, acetylglycine (Bachem, Torrence, CA), and Fmoc-3(S)Hyp). Fmoc-3(S)Hyp was synthesized from H-3(S) Hyp-OH (Fluka) and (N-(9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyloxy)-succinimide) (Bachem). HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1.1.3.3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (4.0 eq) (PerSeptive Biosystems))/diisopropylethylamine mediated peptide couplings. The peptides were cleaved from the resin and purified by semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac C18, 5 μm, 300 Å, 250 × 10 mm, W.R. Grace Co., Columbia, MD). All synthesized peptides were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ) using a Peltier cell holder (equipped with a thermostat) and a 1-mm path length rectangular cell (Starna Cells Inc., Atascadero, CA). Peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The wavelength spectra represent at least an average of 10 scans with 0.1-nm resolution. Thermal transition curves were recorded at a rate of 10 °C/h, except for the host-guest peptides, which were recorded at a rate of 6 °C/h. For the refolding kinetics, the peptides were denatured at 70 °C for 20 min and then rapidly cooled to 15 °C by quenching in an ice water bath before transfer into the cell kept at 15 °C. Quenching time was approximately 5 s, and the time needed for sample transfer was approximately 15 s. The ellipticity at 225 nm was monitored as a function of time over at least 60 min. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed in a model E analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) equipped with a scanner. Twelve-millimeter Epon double sector cells in an An-F Ti rotor were used. The peptides were analyzed in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl. The peptide concentrations were adjusted to 0.2–1.2 mg/ml. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were carried out at temperatures between 4 and 7 °C with rotor speeds from 40,000 to 52,000 rpm. Molecular masses were evaluated from ln A versus r2 plots, where A represents the absorbance and r is the distance from the center of rotation. A partial specific volume of 0.72 ml/g was used for all calculations. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-400 spectrometer operating at 400.14 MHz. The 90° pulse width was 9 μs, and a low power 2-s presaturation pulse was applied to suppress the H2O (HOD) resonance. The spectra were recorded as 16,384 points for the one-dimensional spectra and as 1024 × 512 data point sets for the two-dimensional spectra. The NOESY data were collected with time proportional phase incrementation (32.Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar) in the indirect dimension at mixing times between 30 and 120 ms and a total recording time of approximately 10 h. Total correlation spectroscopy data (33.Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) were collected with various mixing times ranging from 30 to 90 ms. The data were processed with Swan-MR (34.Balacco G. Mol. Biol. Today. 2000; 1: 23-38Google Scholar, 35.Balacco G. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1994; 34: 1235-1241Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or nmrPipe (36.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) to 1024 × 1024 real data sets after application of a 60° phase-shifted sin2 function and Fourier transformation for the two-dimensional spectra; base lines were straightened with polynomials as needed. Spectra were referenced to 0 ppm via internal 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonate or via the water resonance (4.71 ppm at 30 °C). Final visualization and analyses of the two-dimensional data sets were performed using NMRView (37.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar) or Swan-MR (34.Balacco G. Mol. Biol. Today. 2000; 1: 23-38Google Scholar). The circular dichroism spectra of Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 in water shown in Fig. 1 is similar to that of other collagen-like peptides. It has a positive peak at approximately 220–225 nm and a negative peak at approximately 195–200 nm. The change in ellipticity monitored at 225 nm as a function of temperature does not show an obvious transition (Fig. 2). The ellipticity was positive even at 95 °C. Both the positive and negative peaks shifted to a longer wavelength with increasing temperature. The slope of the linear decrease of the ellipticity with increasing temperature was similar to that found in the unfolded region of other collagen-like peptides. The molar ellipticity of the positive and negative peaks of Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 peptide was a little larger than that of Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2, a peptide known not to form a triple helix. These data suggest that the Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 peptide is either extremely stable or not triple helical at all. In order to analyze whether Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 forms a trimer or a monomer, sedimentation equilibrium runs in an analytical ultracentrifuge were performed at 7 °C. Most of the Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 was present as a monomer. A weight average molecular mass of 3340 ± 200 daltons was determined (theoretical mass = 2892 daltons). The lack of a cooperative transition of the peptide therefore indicates that Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 does not form a triple helix in water.Fig. 2Thermal transition curves of collagen-like peptides. The peptides were measured in water, and the CD signal was monitored at 225 nm as a function of temperature. The peptide concentration was 100 μm, and the heating rate was 10 °C/h. ▪, Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R) Hyp)10-NH2; ▴, Ac-(Gly-Pro-Pro)10-NH2; •, Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)-Hyp)10-NH2; ▾, Ac-(Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro)10-NH2; and ♦, Ac-(Gly-Pro-3(S)-Hyp)10-NH2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The peptide Ac-(Gly-Pro-3(S)Hyp)10-NH2 was synthesized and analyzed by CD spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation. As shown in Fig. 1 the spectroscopic properties of this peptide are very similar to Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, and there is no cooperative transition present in the temperature scan (Fig. 2). The weight average molecular mass determined by sedimentation equilibrium was 2930 ± 200 daltons (theoretical mass = 2732 daltons); therefore this peptide is also a monomer in water. These results suggest that 3(S)Hyp has a strong destabilizing effect on the triple helix. Further evidence for this conclusion comes from the NMR spectra shown in Fig. 3. The bottom spectrum (C) illustrates for comparison the behavior of the peptide Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2, which forms a triple helix at 30 °C in D2O. The lines are generally quite broad and are most obvious for the Gly Hα resonances between approximately 3.9 and 4.3 ppm, which are so broadened as to be nearly at the base-line level. The two-dimensional NOESY spectra likewise show extensive and broad cross-peaks even though the mixing time is only 60 ms. The extensive NOEs arise from the short distances between all parts of the molecules because of the short interchain distances of the three packed helices of collagen-like peptides. The middle (B) and top spectra (A) are for the peptides Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Pro-3(S)Hyp)10-NH2, respectively. These one-dimensional reference traces show much higher resolution (again, it may be helpful to refer to the Gly Hα resonances at approximately 3.9–4.3 ppm), reflecting faster molecular motion resulting from being one-third the size of a triple helix trimer and probably from more internal flexibility. In fact, most of the observed cross-peaks are antiphase, indicating that they arise from zeroquantum, J-coupling effects (38.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G.I. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar); the predominance of these cross-peaks is consistent with a high degree of molecular mobility. The trace of Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 (Fig. 3B) shows more NOESY cross-peaks in the two-dimensional spectrum than does the top spectrum; this may mean that there is less conformational mobility or there may be a minor amount of triple helix, or both. The possibility of a minor fraction of triple helix in this sample of Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 is enhanced by the high concentration used for the NMR studies. In neither of these two-dimensional NOESY spectra is there the extensive network of broad NOESY cross-peaks as seen for Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 (Fig. 3C). In any event, the conclusion for Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 is that it does not form a stable triple helix as is readily seen for Ac-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2. The peptide Ac-(Gly-Pro-3(S)Hyp)10-NH2 shows evidence for being monomeric (Fig. 3A). In order to investigate the possibility that the peptide Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 does not form a triple helix because of an extremely slow nucleation step, we synthesized the peptide Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-foldon. A foldon was previously shown to be an effective oligomerization domain for collagen-like peptides (39.Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 40.Frank S. Boudko S. Mizuno K. Schulthess T. Engel J. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol.

Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that also in the context of the foldon the peptide Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 does not form a stable triple helix. Based on previous reports, the content of 3(S)Hyp is at most 16/1000 residues, and the only sequenced 3(S)Hyp is found in Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp tripeptide units. We therefore synthesized the Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp as the guest peptide in the host-guest peptide system of Brodsky and colleagues (42.Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14960-14967Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The guest tripeptide unit was inserted in the host sequence to produce the acetyl-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)3-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)-(Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH2 peptide. Fig. 5 shows that the guest tripeptide unit Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp formed a collagen triple helix in this system, and the Tm of the guest tripeptide unit Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp (49.6 °C) is comparable with the Tm of the Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp guest (48.9 °C). However, the guest tripeptide unit Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro also forms a stable triple helix with a high Tm (45.0 °C), although this peptide does not form a triple helix as a homopolymer. The guest tripeptide unit, Gly-Pro-3(S)Hyp, was much less stable with a Tm of 37.5 °C. The refolding kinetics of the host-guest peptides containing 3(S)Hyp (Table I) show half-times comparable with other hostguest peptides measured previously (43.Ackerman M.S. Bhate M. Shenoy N. Beck K. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7668-7673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). More significantly, there is only a weak correlation between the refolding rates and the observed stabilities in the host-guest peptides, and no predictions can be made from these results for the stability of the corresponding homopolymers.Table IThermal stability and refolding kinetics of host-guest peptidesGuest peptidet 1/2Tm aThe error in the values for the Tm is ±0.4 °C.min°CGly-Pro-Pro846.5Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp848.9Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp849.6Gly-Pro-3(S)Hyp1037.5Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro945.0a The error in the values for the Tm is ±0.4 °C.

Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The inability of the Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 peptide to form a triple helix is an unexpected observation. The CD spectrum shows the presence of a polyproline-II-like structure, but the analytical ultracentrifugation indicates that mostly monomers are present. At present we do not fully understand why Ac-(Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp)10-NH2 does not form a triple helix. The main stabilizing force between the three polypeptides in the triple helix can be accounted for by the GlyNH... OC(Xaa) interchain hydrogen bonds. The presence of 3(S)Hyp in the Xaa position does not result in steric hindrance in the triple helix. It was reported recently that the 3(S)Hyp is a weaker hydrogen bond acceptor than proline or 4(R)Hyp (45.Jenkins C.L. Bretscher L.E. Guzei I.A. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The dihedral angles of Ac-3(S)Hyp-OMe were reported to be compatible with the preferred angles of prolines in the Xaa position of the triple helix (45.Jenkins C.L. Bretscher L.E. Guzei I.A. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, the measured differences between the cis/trans ratios of 3(S)Hyp and proline make only a negligible contribution to the stability (45.Jenkins C.L. Bretscher L.E. Guzei I.A. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that 3(S)Hyp somehow stabilizes the monomeric polyproline-II helix, but there is no obvious reason for this. Molecular modeling of single chain peptides with the sequence Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp shows that no direct hydrogen bonds can be formed and that water-mediated hydrogen bonds are unlikely. In contrast, the dihedral angles of Ac-3(S)Hyp-OMe differ significantly from the optimal angles for proline in the Yaa position of the triple helix (45.Jenkins C.L. Bretscher L.E. Guzei I.A. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and this is probably the main reason for the inability of the peptide Ac-(Gly-Pro-3(S)Hyp)10-NH2 to form a triple helix. There is also the potential of steric hindrance of the hydroxyl group of 3(S)Hyp with the proline ring in the Xaa position of an adjacent chain. In the context of a very stable triple helix as in the host-guest peptides 3(S)Hyp is able to form a triple helix in the Xaa position as well as in the Yaa position. The destabilizing effect becomes apparent when a slightly less stable host peptide is chosen. Raines and co-workers compared the stabilities of 3(S)Hyp in either position of the host-guest system (Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)3-Xaa-Yaa-Gly-(Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly)3 (45.Jenkins C.L. Bretscher L.E. Guzei I.A. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This system contains one less tripeptide unit and is further destabilized by charges at the end of the peptide. The Tm of the 3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp-Gly guest is 3 °C lower than the Pro-4(R)Hyp-Gly guest. A significant decrease in stability of 15 °C of the guest peptide with Gly-Pro-3(S)Hyp is observed in this system. This value agrees well with the value determined here in the slightly more stable host-guest system (–11.4 °C). A comparison between the stabilities of guest peptides determined in the host-guest system and their corresponding homopolymers is impossible. Both peptides studied here as well as Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro do not form triple helices as homopolymers despite showing similar stabilities in the host-guest system. The refolding rates of the host-guest peptides containing Gly-Pro-Pro, Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp, Gly-4(R)Hyp-Pro, Gly-3(S)Hyp-4(R)Hyp, and Gly-Pro-3(S)Hyp as guests are all very similar. This indicates that the host portion of the host-guest peptide dominates the nucleation of the refolding reaction. When the refolding kinetics are analyzed in homopolymers there is a 1000-fold difference between Gly-Pro-Pro and Gly-Pro-4(R)Hyp (39.Boudko S. Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Stetefeld J. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Presumably the relatively small differences in the rates of refolding reported in the host-guest peptides (43.Ackerman M.S. Bhate M. Shenoy N. Beck K. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7668-7673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) are probably because of interactions between the hydrophobic or charged guest residues of the guest tripeptide units. We can only speculate about the biological role of 3(S)Hyp in collagens. Table II lists the occurrence of 3(S)Hyp in different collagens and tissues. The prevalence of 3(S)Hyp in basement membrane collagens could be related to the supramolecular structure of this collagen. Type IV collagen forms a meshwork in basement membranes (30.Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 31.Adachi E. Hopkinson I. Hayashi T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 173: 73-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This collagen contains interruptions in the tripeptide repeat, presumably to allow for kinks to accommodate the meshwork structure. The incorporation of 3(S)Hyp could modulate the stability to allow for additional regions of lower stability in this meshwork structure. The triple helical domain of the human α1-chain (type IV) (7 S region to major triple helical domain; 1421 residues) contains 44 Gly-Pro-Pro tripeptide units. From the published contents of 3(S)Hyp in type IV collagen, approximately one-third of these tripeptide units could be modified to 3(S)Hyp in the Xaa position. Further studies are required for the understanding of the structural and biological role of 3(S)Hyp in collagens.Table IIAmount of 3(S)Hyp reported in different tissues and different collagensResidues/1000 residuesRef.Type I collagen3-week-old chick bone146.Miller E.J.

https://openalex.org/W1985548462,"We report that cyclin D3 is rate limiting for G1 progression in thyroid follicular cells and that its constitutive upregulation by chronic stimulation of the TSH/cAMP pathway plays a role in human and experimental hyperproliferative diseases of the thyroid gland. These conclusions are supported by in vitro and in vivo studies. In rat thyrocytes (PC Cl 3 cells), cyclin D3 expression is enhanced in response to activation of the TSH/cAMP pathway. Interference with the expression of G1 cyclins (in particular cyclin D3) by the antisense methodology strongly reduced TSH-dependent proliferation of PC Cl 3 cells, indicating that proper progression through G1 requires cyclin D3. Accordingly, PC Cl 3 cells engineered to overexpress cyclin D3 (PC-D3 cells) show enhanced growth rate and elude hormone-dependence and contact inhibition. Using an animal experimental model of thyroid stimulation, we demonstrate that cyclin D3 is a key mediator of TSH-dependent proliferation of thyroid follicular cells also in vivo. Cyclin D3 protein levels were higher in the thyrocytes from glands of propylthiouracil-treated rats compared with control animals. The increase in cyclin D3 expression occurred after the propylthiouracil-induced increase in TSH levels and preceded the burst of cell proliferation. Finally, we found that cyclin D3 protein is expressed in a fraction of human goiters but it is strongly overexpressed in most follicular adenomas."
https://openalex.org/W2025131044,"We have shown previously that cytoskeletal reorganization (CSR) induced by pharmacological reagents such as colchicine or cytochalasins can up-regulate the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene via the Ras/Erk signaling pathway. In this present study using the small interfering RNA technique, we have found that ShcA adapter proteins play a rather active role in CSR-induced Erk activation, contrary to their mostly redundant role in other signaling pathways, e.g. growth factor-induced Erk activation, where Grb2 can bind directly to the receptor tyrosine kinase and activate Erk in the absence of ShcA. ShcA knockdown abolished CSR-induced activation of both Erk and the uPA promoter. Expression of small interfering RNA-escaping silent mutants of p52 or p46 but not p66 ShcA isoform efficiently rescued CSR-induced Erk activation. Moreover, we have shown that phosphorylation of either Tyr-239/Tyr-240 or Tyr-313 in p52ShcA can mediate CSR-induced Erk activation equally well. In a quest for molecules upstream of ShcA in this signaling, we found that CSR-induced ShcA tyrosine phosphorylation, its association with Grb2, Erk activation, and uPA gene expression were all dependent on Rho kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Src.

In summary, we have found a novel, non-redundant role for ShcA in contrast to its redundant role in many other signaling pathways. The Shc family of adaptor/docking proteins is an important component of signaling pathways induced by various extracellular signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and integrins, linked mainly to Ras activation (1Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Mele S. Grazia Borrello M. Segatto O. Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 899-907Google Scholar, 2Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L.

Upon ligand binding, activated receptor tyrosine kinases recruit and phosphorylate Shc proteins, which in turn recruit downstream signaling molecules. The most conspicuous of these is Grb2, which is constitutively complexed with Ras GTP exchange factor Sos. Thus, by activating Erk, one of the effector downstream molecules of Ras, Shc is involved in processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation (4Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. et al.Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Google Scholar, 5Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Google Scholar, 6Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Google Scholar).There are three members of the Shc family, ShcA, ShcB, and ShcC, encoded by three different genes (7Pelicci G. Dente L. De Giuseppe A. Verducci-Galletti B. Giuli S. Mele S. Vetriani C. Giorgio M. Pandolfi P.P. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 633-641Google Scholar). ShcA is ubiquitously expressed, whereas ShcB and ShcC are expressed predominantly in the neuronal system (7Pelicci G. Dente L. De Giuseppe A. Verducci-Galletti B. Giuli S. Mele S. Vetriani C. Giorgio M. Pandolfi P.P. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 633-641Google Scholar, 8Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N.

ShcA is expressed in three isoforms, p46Shc, p52Shc, and p66Shc, derived from a single gene through differential usage of transcription/translation initiation sites and alternative splicing, which differ in their amino-terminal sequence. The three proteins share an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine binding, a carboxyl-terminal Src homology 2, and a central CH1 domain (7Pelicci G. Dente L. De Giuseppe A. Verducci-Galletti B. Giuli S. Mele S. Vetriani C. Giorgio M. Pandolfi P.P. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 633-641Google Scholar, 10Luzi L. Confalonieri S. Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 668-674Google Scholar). p66Shc has an additional amino-terminal collagen homology-like domain denoted as CH2. Although all three isoforms of ShcA contain three conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr-239/Tyr-240 and Tyr-317) within the CH1 domain that are phosphorylated by activated tyrosine kinases and serve as docking sites for the Grb2-Sos complex (3Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Google Scholar, 11van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1435-1444Google Scholar), we have reported recently that they differ from each other with respect to their serine/threonine phosphorylation patterns (12Faisal A. el-Shemerly M. Hess D. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30144-30152Google Scholar). Ubiquitous expression of p52Shc/p46Shc and the presence of p66Shc in most cells other than those of hematopoietic lineage suggest a distinct biological role for each isoform (13Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Google Scholar).ShcA gene knockout in mice results in death at day 11.5 of embryogenesis, demonstrating an important role for ShcA in development (14Lai K.M. Pawson T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1132-1145Google Scholar). Using two different genetic approaches, inducible expression of a phosphorylation-defective mutant of Shc in transgenic mice and conditional knockout of Shc in thymocytes, Zhang et al. (15Zhang L. Camerini V. Bender T.P. Ravichandran K.S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 749-755Google Scholar) have shown that Shc plays an essential and non-redundant role in T cell development. Some studies have suggested isoform-specific functions. Overexpression of p52Shc/p46Shc exerted a positive effect on growth factor-induced c-fos promoter activity, but p66Shc expression showed a negative effect (13Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Google Scholar). Isoform-specific gene knockout of p66Shc increased mouse longevity, most likely through suppressing oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (16Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Google Scholar). Although expression of the largest isoform is not essential for development (16Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Google Scholar), the benefit to the organism of this particular isoform remains to be elucidated. Likewise, it is not clear how important ShcA is in the regulation of growth factor-induced Ras/Erk signaling. In several systems, Grb2 has been shown to be recruited directly to the activated receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to Ras activation (17Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Google Scholar, 18Arvidsson A.K. Rupp E. Nanberg E. Downward J. Ronnstrand L. Wennstrom S. Schlessinger J. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. Mol. Cell.

In line with this, growth factor-induced Erk activation seems to proceed normally in ShcA–/– fibroblasts (14Lai K.M. Pawson T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1132-1145Google Scholar). In this system, however, ShcA seemed to be required for sensitizing cells and giving full induction of Erk activity at low concentrations of growth factor (14Lai K.M. Pawson T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1132-1145Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been suggested that p52Shc/p46Shc act as amplifiers of receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling in pathways leading to Ras activation and involving a Grb2-Sos complex (10Luzi L. Confalonieri S. Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 668-674Google Scholar).The cytoskeleton, consisting of actin, microtubule, and intermediate filaments, is a highly organized architectural entity that regulates cell shape and size and is associated with diverse functions depending on cell type (22Fuchs E. Karakesisoglou I. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1-14Google Scholar). Cells respond to changes in cytoskeletal networks by inducing expression of specific genes through specific signaling cascades (23Aggeler J. Frisch S.M. Werb Z. J.

Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Google Scholar). The mechanisms of activation of these molecules, however, are poorly understood. We have shown previously in LLC-PK1 non-transformed epithelial cells that reorganization of actin and microtubule filaments by cytochalasins and colchicine, respectively, induces urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) through the Ras/Erk signaling pathway (25Irigoyen J.P. Besser D. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1904-1909Google Scholar). Induction was observed also in suspension cells, making it less likely that focal adhesions are involved, where various signaling molecules co-localize, including ShcA (25Irigoyen J.P. Besser D. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1904-1909Google Scholar). ShcA tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src after CSR were also observed, suggesting a role for these proteins in CSR-induced Erk activation and subsequent uPA induction (28Irigoyen J.P. Nagamine Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 666-670Google Scholar). However, it has not been demonstrated that ShcA is essential to this process as Grb2 can be recruited directly to FAK (34Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar). Also undetermined is the possible relative contribution of each ShcA isoform toward Erk activation.It has been rather difficult to study the role of individual isoforms in a clean background (i.e. without the influence of other isoforms) when, as is usually the case, a gene of interest is expressed in multiple isoforms in a given cell. Recently, we developed a system, termed knockdown-in (35Kisielow M. Kleiner S. Nagasawa M. Faisal A. Nagamine Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 1-5Google Scholar), in which isoform-specific down-regulation and expression are achieved utilizing siRNA-mediated RNA interference. In this method, a specific isoform is expressed from an expression vector with silent mutations within the region where siRNA targets the endogenous gene. Using this approach, we have determined the indispensability of ShcA for CSR-induced Erk activation. We show that either p52Shc or p46Shc alone is enough to mediate Erk activation after CSR but that p66Shc does not play a role in this regulation, and we show that phosphorylation of either Tyr-313 (equivalent to Tyr-317 in human ShcA) or Tyr-239/Tyr-240 in the CH1 domain of p52Shc is required for this pathway. We also show signaling molecules upstream of ShcA in CSR-induced Erk signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials—Cytochalasin D (CytD) was purchased from Sigma. Luciferin was from Chemie Brunschwig AG.

Blum (Novartis AG).Cells and Transfections—LLC-PK1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (AMIMED, Allschwil, Switzerland), 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. For serum starvation, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with siRNA as described previously (35Kisielow M. Kleiner S. Nagasawa M. Faisal A. Nagamine Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 1-5Google Scholar). Briefly, a day before transfection, cells (105/well) were plated in 6-well plates in medium without antibiotics, and the next morning siRNAs were transfected into cells using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 10 μl of 20 μm siRNA and 5 μl of transfection reagent/well.Analysis of Reporter Gene Expression—One day after siRNA transfection, cells were replated in 6-well plates. On the next day, cells were co-transfected with a reporter plasmid and the Renilla control plasmid using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Amersham Biosciences). After 6 h of transfection, cells were starved for 16 h followed by treatment with CytD for 6 h, and luciferase expression was measured as described previously (36Besser D. Urich M. Sakaue M. Messerschmitt A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Nagamine Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2383-2391Google Scholar) and normalized against Renilla expression.Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Stable cell lines were generated as described previously (12Faisal A. el-Shemerly M. Hess D. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30144-30152Google Scholar). Briefly, a plasmid encoding mouse wild-type p46Shc, p52Shc, or p66Shc or mutant p66Shc S36A, p66Shc T29A, p66Shc S36A/T29A, p52Shc Y313F, or p52Shc Y239F/Y240F was co-transfected with the plasmid pX343 (37Hofstetter P. Kikinis Z. Altus M.S. Pearson D. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4535-4541Google Scholar) expressing a hygromycin resistance gene in LLC-PK1 cells at a ratio of 9:1 by the calcium phosphate method. All ShcA-encoding plasmids contained two silent mutations at the site of targeting siRNA (see below). Stable cell lines were selected by culturing cells with 3 mg/ml hygromycin B. Clones were isolated and screened for ShcA expression by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. The parent cell line transfected with pcDNA3 plus pX343 was used as a control.Plasmids—Construction of expression vectors for HA-tagged mouse p46Shc, p52Shc, and p66Shc and the introduction of silent mutations by site-directed mutagenesis, which allow escape from siRNA targeting, have been described previously (35Kisielow M. Kleiner S. Nagasawa M. Faisal A. Nagamine Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 1-5Google Scholar). Tyr-239/Tyr-240 and Tyr-313 in p52Shc (equivalent to Tyr-317 in human p52Shc) were mutated to Phe with the Quick Site mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using overlapping oligonucleotides 5′-CCT GAC CAT CAG TTC TTC AAT GAC TTT CCA GGG AAG GAA C-3′ and 5′-TGG AAA GTC ATT GAA GAA CTG ATG GTC AGG GGG CTC TTC-3′ as well as 5′-GAT GAC CCC TCC TTT GTC AAC ATC CAG AAT CTA GAC-3′ and 5′-CTG GAT GTT GAC AAA GGA GGG GTC ATC GAA GAG TTC-3′, respectively. Similarly, Ser-36 and Thr-29 in p66Shc were mutated to Ala using 5′-GGG GCT TCG GGG TCT GCC CCT CCG GAG GAG-3′ and 5′-GCT CCT CCG GCG GGG CAG ACC CCG AAG CCC C-3′ as well as 5′-CCG GAG GAG CTA CCT GCC CCA TCA GCT TCA TCC-3′ and 5′-GGA TGA AGC TGA TGG GGC AGG TAG CTC CTC CCG G-3′, respectively. The pig uPA-reporter plasmid pGL2-puPA-4.6 was described previously (25Irigoyen J.P. Besser D. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1904-1909Google Scholar).siRNAs—The following 21-mer oligoribonucleotide pairs were used: all Shc siRNA nucleotides 677–697 (in the protein tyrosine binding domain), 5′-CUA CUU GGU UCG GUA CAU GGG-3′, and 5′-CAU GUA CCG AAC CAA GUA GGA-3′. Nucleotide numbering is based on the sequence of human p66Shc mRNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number HSU7377), and each pair has a 3′ overhang of two nucleotides on each side. The siRNA recognition sequence was conserved between human and mouse, and its uniqueness was confirmed by blasting against the GenBank™/EBI data base. Annealing was as described previously (38Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar). An siRNA corresponding to nucleotides 753–773 of the firefly luciferase mRNA or a scrambled siRNA with the sequence 5′-GUA CCU GAC UAG UCG CAG AAG-3′ was used as a negative control. They were obtained from Qiagen.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—LLC-PK1 cells (2 × 106) were plated in 10-cm plates. The next day, cells were starved for 16 h, treated with different stimuli for the indicated times, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-ShcA, anti-FLAG, anti-HA, or anti-Src antibodies; pulled down by protein A- or G-Sepharose beads; and washed twice with TNET (TNE + 1% Triton X-100) and once with TNE (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7, 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA). The beads were boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer, and eluates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ShcA, antiphosphotyrosine, anti-Grb2, anti-FAK, and anti-Src antibodies. An enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) was employed, and the membrane was exposed to Kodak X-Omat LS or Biomax MR film.Erk Kinase Assay—LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with siRNA as described above. On the second day after transfection, cells were retransfected with HA-Erk2 plasmid using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions in a serum-free medium; 5 h later serum was added to 10%. After 10 h of transfection, cells were starved overnight in 0.1% fetal calf serum. Cells were then stimulated with CytD and lysed, and HA-Erk2 was immunoprecipitated as described above. The immunoprecipitated HA-Erk2 was used for a kinase assay as described previously (39Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—Cells were transfected with siRNA as described above, and 2 days later they were starved in 0.1% FBS for 16 h and stimulated with CytD for 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed in 1 ml of prewarmed 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 20 min, and incubated with a polyclonal antiphospho-Erk (1:100) antibody in PBS containing 1% goat serum for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS (10 min/wash), incubated with secondary Alexa568-anti-rabbit goat antibody (1:100, Molecular Probes) and phalloidin (1:100) for 40 min, and washed three times with PBS (10 min/wash). To visualize nuclei, DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 1:5000) was added during the last wash. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount (Serva). Fluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope, and all images were captured at ×600 magnification.RESULTSCSR-induced ShcA Tyrosine Phosphorylation, Grb2 Association, and Erk Activation—LLC-PK1 cells treated with varying concentrations of CytD were analyzed for ShcA tyrosine phosphorylation, its association with Grb2, and Erk phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1A, CytD induced all these events at concentrations as low as 0.25 μm and exhibited optimal effects at 1 μm. In a kinetic analysis, Erk phosphorylation was observed after 15 min of CytD treatment, with a maximum at 30 min. This level was maintained for 1 h of treatment but declined slowly thereafter. Enhanced Erk phosphorylation was detected even after 4 h of treatment (Fig. 1B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of ShcA and its association with Grb2 occurred as early as 5 min, reached a maximum at 15 min, and stayed at high levels until 4 h after treatment (Fig. 1B).ShcA Is Essential for CSR-induced Erk Activation—ShcA has been considered an important component of receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling leading to Erk activation. However, based on results with ShcA–/– fibroblasts, it has been suggested recently that ShcA proteins are dispensable but act as amplifiers in growth factor-induced signaling (10Luzi L. Confalonieri S. Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 668-674Google Scholar). Although we showed previously that CSR induces ShcA tyrosine phosphorylation just like growth factor treatment (28Irigoyen J.P. Nagamine Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 666-670Google Scholar), the role of ShcA in CSR-induced Erk activation was not determined. Here we used siRNA to address this question and found that knock-down of ShcA completely abolished CSR-induced Erk activation (Fig. 2A). The suppression of Erk activation was not due to a nonspecific effect of RNA interference on the Ras/Erk signaling pathway as TPA- and growth factor-induced Erk activation was not affected (Fig. 2A and data not shown). The result suggests an essential role for ShcA in CSR-induced Erk activation. To be sure that inhibition of CSR-induced Erk activation by ShcA siRNA is a genuine effect of RNA interference, we performed rescue experiments using a modified knockdown-in protocol (35Kisielow M. Kleiner S. Nagasawa M. Faisal A. Nagamine Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 1-5Google Scholar). In this experiment, we first prepared stable LLC-PK1 cell lines expressing ShcA isoforms from vectors with silent mutations at the targeting site of siRNA and then down-regulated endogenous ShcA by transfecting with ShcA siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2B, knockdown of ShcA in control cells completely abolished CSR-induced Erk phosphorylation/activation. This could be rescued effectively by expressing silent mutants of either p52Shc (Fig. 2, B and C) or p46Shc (Fig. 2C) but not of p66Shc (Fig. 2B) as shown by Western blot analysis and in vitro Erk kinase assays. Further analysis showed, in accordance with these results, that CSR-induced Erk localization to the nucleus was suppressed by transfection with Shc siRNA and that this suppression could be overcome in cells expressing silent mutants of p46Shc and p52Shc but not of p66Shc (Fig. 2D). Thus, CSR-induced phosphorylation, activation, and nuclear localization of Erk are strictly dependent on the presence of either of the two shorter isoforms of ShcA.Fig. 2Shc indispensability in CytD-mediated Erk activation.A, ShcA knockdown blocked CytD-induced Erk activation. Cells were transfected with buffer, Shc or control siRNA as described under “Materials and Methods,” starved for 14 h, and left untreated or treated with 3 μm CytD or 100 ng/ml TPA for 30 or 10 min, respectively. Equal amounts of total cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed using specific antibodies against Erk, phospho-Erk, and Shc. unstim., unstimulated. B, rescue of CytD-induced Erk activation by p52Shc; Western blot analysis. Stable cell lines expressing empty vector or silent mutants of HA-p52Shc or HA-p66Shc were prepared. Cells were transfected with Shc siRNA, control siRNA, or buffer alone. After starvation for 14 h, cells were treated with 3 μm CytD and collected. Erk activation and Shc knockdown were analyzed by Western blot using specific antibodies. sm, silent mutant. C, rescue of CytD-mediated Erk activation by p46Shc and p52Shc; in vitro kinase assay. Cells were transfected with siRNAs as described above, and HA-Erk2 was transfected 2 days later as described under “Materials and Methods.” After starvation for 14 h, cells were stimulated with 3 μm CytD for 30 min and lysed. HA-Erk2 was immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-HA antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with myelin basic protein (MBP) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. HA-Erk2 was also analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Erk and antiphospho-Erk antibodies. D, rescue of CytD-mediated Erk activation by p46Shc and p52Shc; indirect immunofluorescence. The stable cell lines indicated were transfected with siRNA, starved, and stimulated with CytD as described above. Cells were fixed and permeabilized, and the actin cytoskeleton and phospho-Erk were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using phalloidin and antiphospho-Erk antibodies, respectively, as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Involvement of ShcA Tyrosine Phosphorylation in CSR-induced Erk Activation—ShcA is phosphorylated by receptor or non-receptor tyrosine kinases on three tyrosine residues, Tyr-317 (Tyr-313 in mouse) and the twin Tyr-239/Tyr-240 (11van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1435-1444Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation at these residues has been attributed to different functions of ShcA (40Gotoh N. Tojo A. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6197-6204Google Scholar, 41Ishihara H. Sasaoka T. Wada T. Ishiki M. Haruta T. Usui I. Iwata M. Takano A. Uno T. Ueno E. Kobayashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 139-144Google Scholar), we looked at the relative importance of these tyrosine residues in CSR-mediated Erk activation by a rescue experiment similar to that described above. Stable cells lines expressing silent mutants of p52Shc Y313F, p52Shc Y239F/Y240F, and p52Shc Y239F/Y240F/Y313F (3YF) were prepared. Suppression of CSR-induced Erk activation by ShcA siRNA was rescued by the expression of either p52Shc Y313F or p52Shc Y239F/Y240F mutants (Fig. 3A) but not by the triple tyrosine mutant p52Shc 3YF (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that CytD treatment can induce ShcA tyrosine phosphorylation at either of these residues, which contributes equally well to the mediation of Erk activation. To confirm this, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of these mutants and their association with Grb2. As shown in Fig. 3C, CytD treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p52Shc WT, Y313F, and Y239F/Y240F mutants but not of 3YF."
