https://openalex.org/W1975853346,"Within the wr-orbital axis vector theory, the total rehybridization required for closure of the fullerenes is approximately conserved. This result allows the development of a structure-based index of strain in the fullerenes, and it is estimated that about 80 percent of the heat of formation of the carbon atoms in C60 may be attributed to a combination of v strain and steric inhibition of resonance. Application of this analysis to the geometries of structurally characterized organometallic derivatives of C60 and C70 shows that the reactivity exhibited by the fullerenes may be attributed to the relief of a combination of local and global strain energy. C60 is of ambiguous aromatic character with anomalous magnetic properties but with the reactivity of a continuous aromatic molecule, moderated only by the tremendous strain inherent in the spheroidal structure."
https://openalex.org/W1974875620,"Arrays of weakly coupled quantum systems might compute if subjected to a sequence of electromagnetic pulses of well-defined frequency and length. Such pulsed arrays are true quantum computers: Bits can be placed in superpositionsof 0 and 1, logical operations take place coherently, and dissipation is required only for error correction. Operated with frequent error correction, such a system functions as a parallel digital computer. Operated in a quantum-mechanically coherent manner, such a device functions as a generalpurpose quantum-mechanical micromanipulator, capable of both creating any desired quantum state of the array and transforming that state in any desired way."
https://openalex.org/W2158440045,"A detailed molecular model for ion transfer across the interface between water and 1,2-dichloroethane provides insight into the mechanism of the transfer across the interface between two immiscible liquids. Extensive molecular dynamics computer simulations underscore the roles of surface roughness and capillary distortions in this process, demonstrate that ion transfer is an activated rather than a simple diffusive process, and provide a test for the applicability of theoretical models."
https://openalex.org/W1980897832,"The buried Chicxulub impact structure in Mexico, which is linked to the Cretaceous- Tertiary (K-T) boundary layer, may be significantly larger than previously suspected. Reprocessed gravity data over Northern Yucatan reveal three major rings and parts of a fourth ring, spaced similarly to those observed at multiring impact basins on other planets. The outer ring, probably corresponding to the basin's topographic rim, is almost 300 kilometers in diameter, indicating that Chicxulub may be one of the largest impact structures produced in the inner solar system since the period of early bombardment ended nearly 4 billion years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2024535537,"The photoluminescence of porous silicon can be quenched by adsorbates, and the degree of quenching can be tuned by chemical derivatization of the porous silicon surface. Thus, as-prepared porous silicon has a hydrophobic, hydrogen-terminated surface, and the photoluminescence is strongly quenched by ethanol and weakly quenched by water. Mild chemical oxidation (iodine followed by hydrolysis) produces a hydrophilic porous silicon surface. Photoluminescence from this hydrophilic material is quenched to a lesser extent by ethanol and to a greater extent by water, relative to the original surface. This demonstrates that the visible luminescence from porous silicon is highly surface-sensitive, and the surface interactions can be tuned by specific chemical transformations."
https://openalex.org/W2027957297,"A combination of satellite imagery, shipboard profiles, drifter tracks, and moored current observations reveals that an anticyclonic eddy off the coast of northern California transported plumes of suspended sediments from the continental shelf into the deep ocean. The horizontal scale of the eddy was about 90 kilometers, and the eddy remained over the continental shelf and slope for about 2 months during the summer of 1988. The total mass of sediments transported by the eddy was of order 105 metric tons. Mesoscale eddies are recurrent features in this region and occur frequently in eastern boundary currents. These results provide direct evidence that eddies export sediments from continental shelves."
