https://openalex.org/W2161527093,"We examined the role of common genetic variation in schizophrenia in a genome-wide association study of substantial size: a stage 1 discovery sample of 21,856 individuals of European ancestry and a stage 2 replication sample of 29,839 independent subjects. The combined stage 1 and 2 analysis yielded genome-wide significant associations with schizophrenia for seven loci, five of which are new (1p21.3, 2q32.3, 8p23.2, 8q21.3 and 10q24.32-q24.33) and two of which have been previously implicated (6p21.32-p22.1 and 18q21.2). The strongest new finding (P = 1.6 × 10−11) was with rs1625579 within an intron of a putative primary transcript for MIR137 (microRNA 137), a known regulator of neuronal development. Four other schizophrenia loci achieving genome-wide significance contain predicted targets of MIR137, suggesting MIR137-mediated dysregulation as a previously unknown etiologic mechanism in schizophrenia. In a joint analysis with a bipolar disorder sample (16,374 affected individuals and 14,044 controls), three loci reached genome-wide significance: CACNA1C (rs4765905, P = 7.0 × 10−9), ANK3 (rs10994359, P = 2.5 × 10−8) and the ITIH3-ITIH4 region (rs2239547, P = 7.8 × 10−9)."
https://openalex.org/W2144796561,"Whether there exists a human memory T cell population with stem cell–like properties of self-renewal and multipotency is under active investigation. Here Gattinoni et al. characterize a subset of human T cells that phenotypically resemble naive T cells yet have properties associated with memory T cells. These T cells show enhanced ability to self renew and to give rise to differentiated memory cell subsets, suggesting a stem cell–like functionality. Immunological memory is thought to depend on a stem cell–like, self-renewing population of lymphocytes capable of differentiating into effector cells in response to antigen re-exposure. Here we describe a long-lived human memory T cell population that has an enhanced capacity for self-renewal and a multipotent ability to derive central memory, effector memory and effector T cells. These cells, specific to multiple viral and self-tumor antigens, were found within a CD45RO−, CCR7+, CD45RA+, CD62L+, CD27+, CD28+ and IL-7Rα+ T cell compartment characteristic of naive T cells. However, they expressed large amounts of CD95, IL-2Rβ, CXCR3, and LFA-1, and showed numerous functional attributes distinctive of memory cells. Compared with known memory populations, these lymphocytes had increased proliferative capacity and more efficiently reconstituted immunodeficient hosts, and they mediated superior antitumor responses in a humanized mouse model. The identification of a human stem cell–like memory T cell population is of direct relevance to the design of vaccines and T cell therapies."

https://openalex.org/W1993588417,"We conducted a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 7,481 individuals with bipolar disorder (cases) and 9,250 controls as part of the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium. Our replication study tested 34 SNPs in 4,496 independent cases with bipolar disorder and 42,422 independent controls and found that 18 of 34 SNPs had P < 0.05, with 31 of 34 SNPs having signals with the same direction of effect (P = 3.8 × 10(-7)). An analysis of all 11,974 bipolar disorder cases and 51,792 controls confirmed genome-wide significant evidence of association for CACNA1C and identified a new intronic variant in ODZ4. We identified a pathway comprised of subunits of calcium channels enriched in bipolar disorder association intervals. Finally, a combined GWAS analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder yielded strong association evidence for SNPs in CACNA1C and in the region of NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4. Our replication results imply that increasing sample sizes in bipolar disorder will confirm many additional loci."
https://openalex.org/W1994216131,"The small intestine epithelium renews every 2 to 5 days, making it one of the most regenerative mammalian tissues. Genetic inducible fate mapping studies have identified two principal epithelial stem cell pools in this tissue. One pool consists of columnar Lgr5-expressing cells that cycle rapidly and are present predominantly at the crypt base. The other pool consists of Bmi1-expressing cells that largely reside above the crypt base. However, the relative functions of these two pools and their interrelationship are not understood. Here we specifically ablated Lgr5-expressing cells in mice using a human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) gene knocked into the Lgr5 locus. We found that complete loss of the Lgr5-expressing cells did not perturb homeostasis of the epithelium, indicating that other cell types can compensate for the elimination of this population. After ablation of Lgr5-expressing cells, progeny production by Bmi1-expressing cells increased, indicating that Bmi1-expressing stem cells compensate for the loss of Lgr5-expressing cells. Indeed, lineage tracing showed that Bmi1-expressing cells gave rise to Lgr5-expressing cells, pointing to a hierarchy of stem cells in the intestinal epithelium. Our results demonstrate that Lgr5-expressing cells are dispensable for normal intestinal homeostasis, and that in the absence of these cells, Bmi1-expressing cells can serve as an alternative stem cell pool. These data provide the first experimental evidence for the interrelationship between these populations. The Bmi1-expressing stem cells may represent both a reserve stem cell pool in case of injury to the small intestine epithelium and a source for replenishment of the Lgr5-expressing cells under non-pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1991568270,"Right hemisphere dominance for visuospatial attention is characteristic of most humans, but its anatomical basis remains unknown. We report the first evidence in humans for a larger parieto-frontal network in the right than left hemisphere, and a significant correlation between the degree of anatomical lateralization and asymmetry of performance on visuospatial tasks. Our results suggest that hemispheric specialization is associated with an unbalanced speed of visuospatial processing."
https://openalex.org/W2070851476,"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and especially anterior cingulate cortex is central to higher cognitive function and many clinical disorders, yet its basic function remains in dispute. Various competing theories of mPFC have treated effects of errors, conflict, error likelihood, volatility and reward, using findings from neuroimaging and neurophysiology in humans and monkeys. No single theory has been able to reconcile and account for the variety of findings. Here we show that a simple model based on standard learning rules can simulate and unify an unprecedented range of known effects in mPFC. The model reinterprets many known effects and suggests a new view of mPFC, as a region concerned with learning and predicting the likely outcomes of actions, whether good or bad. Cognitive control at the neural level is then seen as a result of evaluating the probable and actual outcomes of one's actions."
https://openalex.org/W2021540124,"Adam Siepel and colleagues estimate key parameters for ancient human demography using a Bayesian analysis of the whole-genome sequences of six individuals from diverse populations. They present new methods for coalescent-based inference of demographic parameters as well as a custom pipeline for genotype inference. Whole-genome sequences provide a rich source of information about human evolution. Here we describe an effort to estimate key evolutionary parameters based on the whole-genome sequences of six individuals from diverse human populations. We used a Bayesian, coalescent-based approach to obtain information about ancestral population sizes, divergence times and migration rates from inferred genealogies at many neutrally evolving loci across the genome. We introduce new methods for accommodating gene flow between populations and integrating over possible phasings of diploid genotypes. We also describe a custom pipeline for genotype inference to mitigate biases from heterogeneous sequencing technologies and coverage levels. Our analysis indicates that the San population of southern Africa diverged from other human populations approximately 108–157 thousand years ago, that Eurasians diverged from an ancestral African population 38–64 thousand years ago, and that the effective population size of the ancestors of all modern humans was ∼9,000."
https://openalex.org/W2050161704,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of human disease, responsible for half a million infections and approximately 20,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. This pathogen secretes α-hemolysin, a pore-forming cytotoxin that contributes to the pathogenesis of pneumonia. α-hemolysin injures epithelial cells in vitro by interacting with its receptor, the zinc-dependent metalloprotease ADAM10 (ref. 6). We show here that mice harboring a conditional disruption of the Adam10 gene in lung epithelium are resistant to lethal pneumonia. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of toxin-receptor function revealed that α-hemolysin upregulates ADAM10 metalloprotease activity in alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in cleavage of the adherens junction protein E-cadherin. Cleavage is associated with disruption of epithelial barrier function, contributing to the pathogenesis of lethal acute lung injury. A metalloprotease inhibitor of ADAM10 prevents E-cadherin cleavage in response to Hla; similarly, toxin-dependent E-cadherin proteolysis and barrier disruption is attenuated in ADAM10-knockout mice. Together, these data attest to the function of ADAM10 as the cellular receptor for α-hemolysin. The observation that α-hemolysin can usurp the metalloprotease activity of its receptor reveals a previously unknown mechanism of pore-forming cytotoxin action in which pathologic insults are not solely the result of irreversible membrane injury and defines ADAM10 inhibition as a strategy to attenuate α-hemolysin-induced disease."
https://openalex.org/W1999707299,"Mechanical stresses elicit cellular reactions mediated by chemical signals. Defective responses to forces underlie human medical disorders such as cardiac failure and pulmonary injury. The actin cytoskeleton's connectivity enables it to transmit forces rapidly over large distances, implicating it in these physiological and pathological responses. Despite detailed knowledge of the cytoskeletal structure, the specific molecular switches that convert mechanical stimuli into chemical signals have remained elusive. Here we identify the actin-binding protein filamin A (FLNA) as a central mechanotransduction element of the cytoskeleton. We reconstituted a minimal system consisting of actin filaments, FLNA and two FLNA-binding partners: the cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin, and FilGAP. Integrins form an essential mechanical linkage between extracellular and intracellular environments, with β-integrin tails connecting to the actin cytoskeleton by binding directly to filamin. FilGAP is an FLNA-binding GTPase-activating protein specific for RAC, which in vivo regulates cell spreading and bleb formation. Using fluorescence loss after photoconversion, a novel, high-speed alternative to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we demonstrate that both externally imposed bulk shear and myosin-II-driven forces differentially regulate the binding of these partners to FLNA. Consistent with structural predictions, strain increases β-integrin binding to FLNA, whereas it causes FilGAP to dissociate from FLNA, providing a direct and specific molecular basis for cellular mechanotransduction. These results identify a molecular mechanotransduction element within the actin cytoskeleton, revealing that mechanical strain of key proteins regulates the binding of signalling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2058079617,"Nonsense suppression, or reassigning stop codons to encode for other amino acids, offers a method for expanding the genetic code of proteins. Deletion of release factor 1 in an Escherichia coli strain enables the incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins at multiple sites. Stop codons have been exploited for genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids (Uaas) in live cells, but their low incorporation efficiency, which is possibly due to competition from release factors, limits the power and scope of this technology. Here we show that the reportedly essential release factor 1 (RF1) can be knocked out from Escherichia coli by 'fixing' release factor 2 (RF2). The resultant strain JX33 is stable and independent, and it allows UAG to be reassigned from a stop signal to an amino acid when a UAG-decoding tRNA-synthetase pair is introduced. Uaas were efficiently incorporated at multiple UAG sites in the same gene without translational termination in JX33. We also found that amino acid incorporation at endogenous UAG codons is dependent on RF1 and mRNA context, which explains why E. coli tolerates apparent global suppression of UAG. JX33 affords a unique autonomous host for synthesizing and evolving new protein functions by enabling Uaa incorporation at multiple sites."
https://openalex.org/W2043209972,"A virtual screen of the GPCR D3R based on a homology model prior to publication of the crystal structure and a subsequent virtual screen based on the crystal structure of the receptor once it became available both identified new ligands with verified activities. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are intensely studied as drug targets and for their role in signaling. With the determination of the first crystal structures, interest in structure-based ligand discovery increased. Unfortunately, for most GPCRs no experimental structures are available. The determination of the D3 receptor structure and the challenge to the community to predict it enabled a fully prospective comparison of ligand discovery from a modeled structure versus that of the subsequently released crystal structure. Over 3.3 million molecules were docked against a homology model, and 26 of the highest ranking were tested for binding. Six had affinities ranging from 0.2 to 3.1 μM. Subsequently, the crystal structure was released and the docking screen repeated. Of the 25 compounds selected, five had affinities ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 μM. One of the new ligands from the homology model screen was optimized for affinity to 81 nM. The feasibility of docking screens against modeled GPCRs more generally is considered."

https://openalex.org/W2063250341,"Anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins such as Bcl-xL protect cells from death by sequestering apoptotic molecules, but also contribute to normal neuronal function. We find in hippocampal neurons that Bcl-xL enhances the efficiency of energy metabolism. Our evidence indicates that Bcl-xLinteracts directly with the β-subunit of the F1FO ATP synthase, decreasing an ion leak within the F1FO ATPase complex and thereby increasing net transport of H+ by F1FO during F1FO ATPase activity. By patch clamping submitochondrial vesicles enriched in F1FO ATP synthase complexes, we find that, in the presence of ATP, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Bcl-xL activity increases the membrane leak conductance. In addition, recombinant Bcl-xL protein directly increases the level of ATPase activity of purified synthase complexes, and inhibition of endogenous Bcl-xL decreases the level of F1FO enzymatic activity. Our findings indicate that increased mitochondrial efficiency contributes to the enhanced synaptic efficacy found in Bcl-xL-expressing neurons. ATP production by mitochondria requires the efficient flow of protons through the F1FO ATP-synthase complex. Jonas and colleagues show that Bcl-xL interacts with the F1FO complex in the mitochondrial matrix and increases the efficiency of this enzyme by decreasing proton leak."
https://openalex.org/W2065828105,"Dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) are multi-domain GTPases that function via oligomerization and GTP-dependent conformational changes to play central roles in regulating membrane structure across phylogenetic kingdoms. How DRPs harness self-assembly and GTP-dependent conformational changes to remodel membranes is not understood. Here we present the crystal structure of an assembly-deficient mammalian endocytic DRP, dynamin 1, lacking the proline-rich domain, in its nucleotide-free state. The dynamin 1 monomer is an extended structure with the GTPase domain and bundle signalling element positioned on top of a long helical stalk with the pleckstrin homology domain flexibly attached on its opposing end. Dynamin 1 dimer and higher order dimer multimers form via interfaces located in the stalk. Analysis of these interfaces provides insight into DRP family member specificity and regulation and provides a framework for understanding the biogenesis of higher order DRP structures and the mechanism of DRP-mediated membrane scission events."
https://openalex.org/W2113287691,"Whole genome amplification by the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) method allows sequencing of DNA from single cells of bacteria that cannot be cultured. Assembling a genome is challenging, however, because MDA generates highly nonuniform coverage of the genome. Here we describe an algorithm tailored for short-read data from single cells that improves assembly through the use of a progressively increasing coverage cutoff. Assembly of reads from single Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus cells captures >91% of genes within contigs, approaching the 95% captured from an assembly based on many E. coli cells. We apply this method to assemble a genome from a single cell of an uncultivated SAR324 clade of Deltaproteobacteria, a cosmopolitan bacterial lineage in the global ocean. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that SAR324 is aerobic, motile and chemotaxic. Our approach enables acquisition of genome assemblies for individual uncultivated bacteria using only short reads, providing cell-specific genetic information absent from metagenomic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2148394396,"Tumors are thought to be sustained by a reservoir of self-renewing cells, termed tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells. Osteosarcomas are high-grade sarcomas derived from osteoblast progenitor cells and are the most common pediatric bone malignancy. In this report we show that the stem cell transcription factor Sox2 is highly expressed in human and murine osteosarcoma (mOS) cell lines as well as in the tumor samples. Osteosarcoma cells have increased ability to grow in suspension as osteospheres, that are greatly enriched in expression of Sox2 and the stem cell marker, Sca-1. Depletion of Sox2 by short-hairpin RNAs in independent mOS-derived cells drastically reduces their transformed properties in vitro and their ability to form tumors. Sox2-depleted osteosarcoma cells can no longer form osteospheres and differentiate into mature osteoblasts. Concomitantly, they exhibit decreased Sca-1 expression and upregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Thus, despite other mutations, these cells maintain a requirement for Sox2 for tumorigenicity. Our data indicate that Sox2 is required for osteosarcoma cell self renewal, and that Sox2 antagonizes the pro-differentiation Wnt pathway that can in turn reduce Sox2 expression. These studies define Sox2 as a survival factor and a novel biomarker of self renewal in osteosarcomas, and support a tumor suppressive role for the Wnt pathway in tumors of mesenchymal origin. Our findings could provide the basis for novel therapeutic strategies based on inhibiting Sox2 or enhancing Wnt signaling for the treatment of osteosarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W2070345867,"Muscle atrophy is caused by accelerated protein degradation and occurs in many pathological states. Two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, MAFbx/atrogin-1 and muscle RING-finger 1 (MuRF1), are prominently induced during muscle atrophy and mediate atrophy-associated protein degradation. Blocking the expression of these two ubiquitin ligases provides protection against muscle atrophy. Here we report that miR-23a suppresses the translation of both MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 in a 3′-UTR-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of miR-23a is sufficient to protect muscles from atrophy in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, miR-23a transgenic mice showed resistance against glucocorticoid-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. These data suggest that suppression of multiple regulators by a single miRNA can have significant consequences in adult tissues. Muscle atrophy is caused by accelerated protein degradation and occurs in many pathological states.

Furthermore, miR-23a transgenic mice showed resistance against glucocorticoid-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. These data suggest that suppression of multiple regulators by a single miRNA can have significant consequences in adult tissues. Adult skeletal muscle has tremendous plasticity due in part to a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Increased protein synthesis leads to muscle hypertrophy, whereas increased protein degradation leads to muscle atrophy. Physical activity, particularly resistance training, induces muscle hypertrophy, which is characterized by growth of existing myofibers and often brings about health benefits. On the other hand, various chronic diseases result in skeletal muscle atrophy, exacerbating the disease and compromising quality of life. Therefore, preventing and attenuating skeletal muscle atrophy is an important clinical issue. Muscle atrophy occurs in response to fasting, chronic disease (e.g. cancer, diabetes, AIDS, sepsis, and sarcopenia), and disuse. Under these diverse conditions, atrophying muscles undergo accelerated protein degradation primarily through activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (1Glass D.J. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab.

Overexpression of either MAFbx/atrogin-1 or MuRF1 in skeletal muscle fibers leads to atrophy or remarkable ubiquitination of muscle proteins, suggesting that increased expression of these genes induces muscle atrophy through protein degradation (5Bodine S.C. Latres E. Baumhueter S. Lai V.K. Nunez L. Clarke B.A. Poueymirou W.T. Panaro F.J. Na E. Dharmarajan K. Pan Z.Q. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J.

Interestingly, knock-out mice lacking either of the enzymes are resistant to various types of atrophy, suggesting that these two genes are essential for atrophy-related protein degradation (5Bodine S.C.

Recent studies have revealed a new aspect of muscle gene regulation in which small, non-coding RNAs, known as microRNAs (miRNAs), play fundamental roles in diverse biological and pathological processes, including differentiation and morphogenesis of skeletal muscle (7van Rooij E. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). miRNAs are ∼22 nucleotides in length and inhibit target mRNA expression through translational repression or mRNA decay by interacting with their 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) (8Chen K. Rajewsky N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 9Djuranovic S. Nahvi A. Green R. Science. 2011; 331: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 10Huntzinger E. Izaurralde E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). miRNAs are usually transcribed as pri-miRNAs that range in length from a few hundred to thousands of nucleotides, have a characteristic hairpin secondary structure, and are cleaved to pre-miRNAs by the RNase III enzyme, Drosha. These pre-miRNAs are exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5 and processed into ∼22 nucleotide miRNAs by another RNase III enzyme, Dicer. Finally, single-stranded miRNAs are integrated into the RNA-induced silencing complex that directs miRNA binding to the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs. miRNAs inhibit target mRNA translation and thereby alter the levels of critical regulators. Thus, they play fundamental roles in diverse biological and pathological processes. In the skeletal muscle several muscle-specific miRNAs have been reported to play multiple roles in the control of muscle growth and differentiation. Chen et al. (11Chen J.F. Mandel E.M. Thomson J.M. Wu Q. Callis T.E. Hammond S.M. Conlon F.L. Wang D.Z. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) showed that muscle-specific miRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, down-regulate serum-responsive factor and histone deacetylase 4, respectively, to control muscle differentiation. It has also been shown that the myogenic regulatory factor, MyoD, induces miR-206 to promote myogenesis (12Kim H.K. Lee Y.S. Sivaprasad U. Malhotra A. Dutta A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 13Rosenberg M.I. Georges S.A. Asawachaicharn A. Analau E. Tapscott S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed the importance of muscle-specific miRNAs in skeletal muscle development, but there have been few reports on the function of miRNAs in adult skeletal muscle plasticity. Here we report that a single miRNA regulates two key molecules involved in muscle atrophy, MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1. A bioinformatics approach identified miR-23a as a potential miRNA that targets MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1. We showed that miR-23a binds to the 3′-UTRs of both MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 mRNAs to inhibit their translation and forced expression of miR-23a in myotubes and myofibers results in resistance to muscle atrophy. Furthermore, miR-23a transgenic mice were resistant to dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy. These findings strongly support a functional role for miR-23a in muscle physiology and suggest a new therapeutic target for skeletal muscle atrophy. C2C12 (American Type Culture Collection) mouse skeletal myoblasts were maintained at subconfluent densities in 20% FBS in DMEM. At 80–100% confluence, myogenesis was induced by changing the medium to 2% horse serum in DMEM. After incubating for 4 days in 2% horse serum in DMEM, more than 80% of cells formed multinuclear myotubes. To induce muscle atrophy in vitro, cells were incubated with 10 μm dexamethasone (Dex) in 2% horse serum in DMEM for 12 or 24 h. After treatment, cells were harvested in appropriate buffers or used for morphological analysis. C2C12 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of each vector or 20 nm concentrations of synthesized miRNA duplex (WAKO, Osaka, Japan) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Medium was replaced with FBS-containing medium after incubation for 6 h. 24 h after the plasmid transfection, the medium was replaced again with differentiation medium containing 2% horse serum in DMEM, and cells were cultured for 4 days. Finally, 10 nm (final concentration) concentrations of locked nucleic acid (LNA; underlined) antisense oligonucleotides (5′-GGA AAT CCC TGG CAA TGT GAT-3′) or random LNA (for negative control) were transfected and treated with 10 μm dexamethasone for 24 h. After Dex treatment, myotubes were photographed directly in culture plates using an IX71 fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with an EM-CCD digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shizuoka, Japan). The diameters of more than 50 myotubes were measured using ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). For pCXbG-miR-23a, a region including miR-23a was amplified from human genomic DNA by PCR using two primers, 5′-AAA GTC GAC CTT TCT CCC CTC CAG GTG C-3′ and 5′-AAG ATA TCT CGA GAC AGG CTT CGG GGC CTC TC-3′. The PCR product was digested with SalI and EcoRV and introduced into pCXbG at the XhoI and EcoRV sites. The chicken β-actin promoter in the pCXbG drives a common transcript for eGFP, and pri-miR-23a is processed to generate eGFP mRNA and mature miR-23a. pCXbG was generated from pCX-eGFP (14Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment including the eGFP fused with the blasticidin resistance gene, XhoI, and EcoRV sites was amplified by PCR using pTracer-EF/Bsd (Invitrogen) and peGFP (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA) as templates. This fragment was inserted into the EcoRI sites of pCX-eGFP to yield pCXbG. For pLuc2EXN-atrogin-1 3′-UTR and pLuc2EXN-MuRF1 3′-UTR, a 300-bp fragment of the MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 3′-UTRs, including the putative miR-23a binding sites, were amplified from mouse cDNA by PCR using Ex TaqHS (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan). Primer sequences for amplifying the MAFbx/atrogin-1 3′-UTR were 5′-TCT CTA GAA TCC CAG CAC ACG ACA ACA CTT C-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTC TCG AGG ACT CCG TTT CCA TGG CTG AC-3′ (reverse). Primer sequences for amplifying the MuRF1 3′-UTR were 5′-AAG AAT TCG GAA GTG TGT CTT CTC TCT GCT C-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAG AAT TCA AGG AAA GGA AGT AGG CAT CTC-3′ (reverse). Amplified fragments were cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pLuc2EXN plasmid. pLuc2EXN was generated from pGL3-Control (Promega Co., Madison, WI) by cloning the Luc2 gene upstream of additional EcoRI and XbaI sites. pLuc2EXN-atrogin-1 3′-UTRΔ and pLuc2EXN-MuRF1 3′-UTRΔ were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (15Akimoto T.

Briefly, pLuc2EXN-atrogin-1 3′-UTR and pLuc2EXN-MuRF1 3′-UTR plasmids were used as templates for PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers used to generate pLuc2EXN-atrogin-1 3′-UTRΔ (mutated nucleotides are underlined) were 5′- GCC GAT GGA AAT TTA CAC ACT ATA ATT CCA CAT G-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAT GTG GAA TTA TAG TGT GTA AAT TTC CAT CGG C-3′ (reverse) primers. Primers 5′-GTA TGT TTT TAA AAT AAC CGT TTT GTA TAT ACT TGT ATA TG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAT ATA CAA GTA TAT ACA AAA CGG TTA TTT TAA AAA CAT AC-3′ (reverse) and additional mutagenic primers 5′-GTA TGC TTT TAA TCC AAC CGT TTT GTA TAT ACT TG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAA GTA TAT ACA AAA CGG TTG GAT TAA AAG CAT AC-3′ (reverse) were used for pLuc2EXN-MuRF1 3′-UTRΔ. To confirm translation inhibition of MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 by miR-23a, we constructed expression vectors of FLAG-tagged MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 with/without their 3′-UTRs. Both MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 ORFs with 3′-UTRs were amplified from mouse cDNA by PCR using Ex TaqHS polymerase (TaKaRa) and cloned into the tibialis anterior (TA) vector (Invitrogen). Specific primers for the cloning of atrogin-1 ORF+3′-UTR were 5′-AGG ATC CAT GCC GTT CCT TGG GCA GGA C-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACT CGA GGC TTG TTT GCC AAG AGC ATG CAT AG-3′ (reverse). Primers for cloning MuRF1 ORF+3′-UTR were 5′-AAG GAT CCA TGG ATT ATA AAT CTA GCC TGA TTC CTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAG AAT TCT TTA TTT TTG AGG CAG AGT CTC TCT ATG-3′ (reverse). The PCR fragments, atrogin-1 ORF+3′-UTR and MuRF1 ORF+3′-UTR, were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 using BamHI-XhoI or BamHI-EcoRI sites, respectively. After cloning, a DNA fragment containing the FLAG tag of f:PGC-1 (a kind gift form Bruce Spiegelman, Harvard Medical School) was inserted upstream of each insert with a BamHI site. For expression vectors of FLAG-tagged MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 without their 3′-UTRs (atrogin-1 Δ and MuRF1Δ, respectively), we truncated the 3′-UTRs. A reporter vector for pri-miR-23a∼27a∼24–2, pGL3–23P639 (16Lee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S. Baek S.H. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4051-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (3240) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. V. Narry Kim (Seoul National University). All plasmid DNAs were transformed and amplified in Escherichia coli DH5-α and were purified using the plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen, Duesseldorf, Germany). HeLa cells (ATCC) were seeded in 6-well plates 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of pLuc2EXN-atrogin-1 3′-UTR, pLuc2EXN-MuRF1 3′-UTR, or pGL3–23P639 (16Lee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S. Baek S.H. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4051-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (3240) Google Scholar), 0.1 μg of LacZ, and 1.8 μg of pCXbG-miR-23a with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to LacZ activity as previously described (17Akimoto T. Sorg B.S. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C790-C796Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cells and animal tissues using ISOGEN (WAKO) according to the manufacturer's protocols, and 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (RT; Invitrogen). Oligo-dT primers were used to generate cDNA, and an aliquot of the RT reaction was used directly for PCR with Ex TaqHS (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan) and gene-specific primers. Primer sequences were: MAFbx/atrogin-1, 5′-GGG AGG CAA TGT CTG TGT TT-3′ and 5′-TTG TGA AAA AGT CCC GGT TC-3′; MuRF1, 5′-ACC GAG TGC AGA CGA TCA TCT C-3′ and 5′-AAA GTC AAT GGC CCT CAA GGC-3′; GAPDH, 5′-GTG GCA AAG TGG AGA TTG TTG CC-3′ and 5′-GAT GAT GAC CCG TTT GGC TCC-3′; β-actin, 5′-TGA CAG GAT GCA GAA GAA GA-3′ and 5′-GCT GGA AGG TGG ACA GTG AG-3′. GAPDH and β-actin were used as internal standards. For microarray expression profiling of miRNAs, C57BL6/J mouse skeletal muscle, embryonic fibroblast, and ES cell RNA preparations were labeled and hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA Array in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Normalized microarray data were managed and analyzed by GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies), and unsupervised hierarchical clustering using Pearson's correlation was performed with GenePattern software (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). The TaqMan MicroRNA reverse transcription kit and TaqMan MicroRNA assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used according to the manufacturer's protocols for real-time PCR quantification of mature miRNA expression. In miRNA quantification, each RT reaction contained 10 ng of purified total RNA. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 16 °C, 30 min at 42 °C, and 5 min at 85 °C. Real-time PCR reactions for each miRNA (10 μl volume) were performed in triplicate, and each 10-μl reaction mixture included 1 μl of RT product. Reactions were carried out with an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system in 96-well plates at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. By using specific RT primers for pri- and pre-miR-23a, 500 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with ThermoScriptRT (Invitrogen) as previously reported (18Jiang J. Lee E.J. Gusev Y. Schmittgen T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5394-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ng of total RNA, 1 μl of 10 mm concentrations of specific RT primer (5′-TGG TAA TCC CTG GCA ATG TG-3′), and 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP were mixed, and distilled water was added to a total volume of 12 μl. The mixture was heated at 85 °C for 5 min, then at 57 °C for 5 min. After chilling on ice for 2 min, 4 μl of 5× cDNA synthesis buffer, 1 μl each of 0.1 m DTT, RNase inhibitor (ToYoBo, Osaka, Japan), and ThermoScriptRT (15 units/μl) were added to the mixture. The contents were gently mixed and incubated at 57 °C for 60 min and heated at 85 °C for 5 min to terminate the reaction. For quantification of pri- and pre-miR-23a, 1 μl of RT product was amplified by PCR using Ex TaqHS (TaKaRa) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. Primer sequences for PCR were as follows: Pri-miR-23a forward (5′-TCC AGG TGC CAG CCT CTG-3′), pre-miR-23a forward (5′-CTG GGG TTC CTG GGG AT-3′), and a common reverse primer with the same sequence as the specific RT primer for pri- and pre-miR-23a. PCR conditions for both pri- and pre-miR-23a were 35 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 57 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 15 s for extension. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels containing 5 × 10−5 % ethidium bromide for 30 min, and fluorescent images were acquired under UV light by LAS3000 (FujiFilm Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Western blot was performed as described elsewhere (15Akimoto T. Pohnert S.C. Li P. Zhang M. Gumbs C. Rosenberg P.B. Williams R.S. Yan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19587-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) with following antibodies: anti-fast-MyHCs (MY-32, Sigma), anti-eIF3-f (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), and anti-γ-tubulin (AK-15, Sigma) antibodies. Adult (8 weeks) male C57BL/6 mice (Clea Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were housed in temperature-controlled quarters (21 °C) with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and provided with water and food ad libitum. To induce skeletal muscle atrophy, 25 mg Dex/kg of body weight was injected intraperitoneally for 7 days at 9:00 a.m. For control mice, normal saline was injected intraperitoneally for 7 days. After Dex treatment, animals were sacrificed, and muscles were harvested in appropriate buffer or embedded with O.C.T. compound. The animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Tokyo and Waseda University. Electric pulse-mediated gene transfer was performed as described previously (17Akimoto T. Sorg B.S. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C790-C796Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, both TA muscles were injected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA under anesthesia (50 mg/kg of intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital). Within 1 min after injection, an electrical field was delivered to the injected tibialis anterior muscle using a SEN-3401 electric stimulator (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) through a Model 532 two-needle array (BTX Instrument Division Harvard Apparatus, Inc., Holliston, MA). Eight pulses that were 100 ms in duration, 1 Hz in frequency, and 100 V in amplitude (200 V/cm) were delivered by placing the needle arrays on the medial and lateral sides of the TA muscle so that the electrical field was perpendicular to the long axis of the myofibers. The mice were allowed to recover for 4 days before dexamethasone injection. For muscle-specific miR-23a transgenic mice, a 4.8-kb XhoI-EcoRI DNA fragment of the mouse muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter from the MCK-hGHpolyA plasmid (15Akimoto T. Pohnert S.C. Li P. Zhang M. Gumbs C. Rosenberg P.B. Williams R.S. Yan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19587-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) was excised and inserted upstream of the eGFP coding region of pCXbG-miR-23a using SalI-EcoRI sites. The muscle creatine kinase promoter, preferentially active in adult skeletal muscle, drove the expression of miR-23a independent of upstream signals. For conventional miR-23a transgenic mice, pCXbG-miR-23a was linearized using SalI-EcoRI sites and injected into C57BL6/J oocytes. Genotyping was carried out by PCR, and fluorescence microscopy was used to confirm transgene expression in adult skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle samples were harvested from the F1 generation of transgenic lines (#345 and #355) and wild-type littermates (C57BL6/J background) at 8 weeks of age. Anti-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) 2a (SC-71) and 2b (BF-F3) monoclonal antibodies were used as primary antibodies for immunostaining of O.C.T.-embedded cross-sections from mouse skeletal muscle (19Schiaffino S. Gorza L. Sartore S. Saggin L. Ausoni S. Vianello M. Gundersen K. L⊘mo T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-dystrophin antibody (D8043, Sigma) with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody was used to identify muscle fiber shape. Cross-sections were fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100, and incubated with primary antibody overnight. Secondary antibodies were either FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or R-PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (for MyHC 2a and MyHC 2b, respectively; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Finally, coverslips were mounted in VECTA SHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Ltd., Burlingame, CA). Cross-sectional area was measured with ImageJ Software. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined by Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by the Dunnett test for comparisons between two groups or multiple groups, respectively. To investigate miRNA function in muscle atrophy, we first employed microarrays to identify miRNAs in skeletal muscle (supplemental Table S1). We then narrowed down the miRNAs that could potentially interact with MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 using a bioinformatics approach. As a result, 48 and 44 candidate miRNAs were nominated to interact with MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 3′-UTRs, respectively. These results were based on computationally predicted target genes found in the online data base TargetScan5.1 (Fig. 1A). Among them, two miRNAs, miR-23a and 23b, were nominated as common candidate miRNAs that could potentially interact with both MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1. Another online data base, MicroCosm Targets, also nominated miR-23a and 23b as candidates. The sequence for miR-23a differs by a single nucleotide from that of miR-23b, but otherwise the two genes have identical seed sequences; hence, they likely target the same mRNAs. The functional difference between them has yet to be determined. Notably, microarray (supplemental Table S1) and TaqMan probe-based quantitative real-time-PCR (data not shown) revealed dominant expression of miR-23a in skeletal muscle. miR-23a has been previously reported to be up-regulated in hypertrophic hearts of mice with transgenic expression of activated calcineurin A (20van Rooij E. Sutherland L.B. Liu N. Williams A.H. McAnally J. Gerard R.D. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18255-18260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar) and mice treated with a β-adrenergic agonist (21Lin Z. Murtaza I. Wang K. Jiao J. Gao J. Li P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12103-12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, there is no report addressing the physiological function of miR-23a in skeletal muscle. We first found that miR-23a was highly expressed in slow-twitch soleus muscle compared with fast-twitch plantaris muscle (Fig. 1B). Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that the putative miR-23a binding sites in the 3′-UTRs of both MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 are highly conserved in human, mouse, and rat (Fig. 1C). To investigate the functional interaction of miR-23a and these molecules, the 3′-UTRs of MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 mRNA were subcloned downstream of a luciferase reporter (Fig. 2A). We co-transfected a miR-23a overexpression vector (pCXGb-miR-23a) and each reporter vector (pLuc2EXN-atrogin-1 3′-UTR and pLuc2EXN-MuRF1 3′-UTR) into HeLa cells and measured luciferase activity 24 h later. We also constructed reporter vectors with mutations in the putative miR-23a binding sites of the 3′-UTRs (pLuc2EXN-atrogin-1 3′-UTRΔ and pLuc2EXN-MuRF1 3′-UTRΔ). A luciferase vector without any 3′-UTR sequence, pLuc2EXN, was also transfected as a negative control. As expected, luciferase activity was markedly reduced when the miR-23a expression vector was co-transfected with pLuc2EXN-atrogin-1 3′-UTR or pLuc2EXN-MuRF1 3′-UTR (Fig. 2B). The miR-23a-induced decrease in luciferase activity was not observed for any of the mutant reporter vector. Luciferase mRNA levels were not affected by miR-23a overexpression (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that miR-23a mediated translational repression of MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 in a 3′-UTR-dependent manner. To confirm the translational inhibition of these genes, we cloned the MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 genes, including their 3′-UTRs, into an expression vector with a FLAG tag (Fig. 2C). We also generated expression vectors for MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 without 3′-UTRs (atrogin-1Δ and MuRF1Δ, respectively) as controls (Fig. 2C). Protein, but not mRNA expression in FLAG-tagged MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1, was reduced by co-transfection with the miR-23a expression vector (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, neither mRNA nor protein expression in atrogin-1Δ and MuRF1Δ was suppressed by miR-23a (Fig. 2D). Next, we confirmed whether overexpression of miR-23a affected endogenous mRNA expression in MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1. C2C12, a mouse myoblast cell line was transfected with an miR-23a expression vector and treated with 10 μm Dex for 12 h. Despite high expression of miR-23a, no change was observed in MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 mRNA expression in response to dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 2, E and F), suggesting that miR-23a could interact with the 3′-UTRs of MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 to down-regulate their translation. We investigated miR-23a function using an in vitro model of muscle atrophy with forced expression of miR-23a. The miR-23a expression vector with GFP was transfected into C2C12 cells followed by induction of myogenesis. We then treated the myotubes with 10 μm Dex for 24 h and measured myotube diameter using GFP expression as a transgene marker. We also employed LNA antisense-mediated silencing of miR-23a to ascertain if miR-23a expression is necessary for atrophy resistance. LNA antisense oligonucleotides bind selectively to miRNAs and down-regulate their function by forming rigid duplexes with their complementary miRNAs (22Elmén J. Lindow M. Silahtaroglu A. Bak M. Christensen M. Lind-Thomsen A. Hedtjärn M. Hansen J.B. Hansen H.F. Straarup E.M. McCullagh K. Kearney P. Kauppinen S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). In mock-transfected cells, myotube diameter decreased significantly with Dex treatment (27.9 ± 1.2 versus 20.7 ± 1.0 μm, p < 0.001), whereas the diameters of myotubes expressing miR-23a did not decrease with random control LNA oligos (29.2 ± 0.1 versus 29.2 ± 1.2 μm) (Fig. 3, A and B, left). As expected, an anti-miR-23a LNA oligos canceled myotube atrophy resistance despite miR-23a overexpression (mock, 26.3 ± 1.2 versus 19.3 ± 0.8 μm, p < 0.001; miR-23a, 26.2 ± 1.1 versus 22.4 ± 0.9 μm, p < 0.01) without affecting MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3, A–C). We also examined if the miR-23a-mediated modulation of MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expressions affects their target proteins. As a result, fast-MyHCs, which are targets for MuRF1, were decreased with dexamethasone treatment, and overexpression of miR-23a attenuated the Dex-induced protein degradation of fas"

Our previous studies have shown that cysteine 203 of cyclophilin D (CypD), a critical mPTP mediator, undergoes protein S-nitrosylation (SNO). To investigate the role of cysteine 203 in mPTP activation, we mutated cysteine 203 of CypD to a serine residue (C203S) and determined its effect on mPTP opening. Treatment of WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with H2O2 resulted in an 50% loss of the mitochondrial calcein fluorescence, suggesting substantial activation of the mPTP. Consistent with the reported role of CypD in mPTP activation, CypD null (CypD−/−) MEFs exhibited significantly less mPTP opening. Addition of a nitric oxide donor, GSNO, to WT but not CypD−/− MEFs prior to H2O2 attenuated mPTP opening. To test whether Cys-203 is required for this protection, we infected CypD−/− MEFs with a C203S-CypD vector. Surprisingly, C203S-CypD reconstituted MEFs were resistant to mPTP opening in the presence or absence of GSNO, suggesting a crucial role for Cys-203 in mPTP activation. To determine whether mutation of C203S-CypD would alter mPTP in vivo, we injected a recombinant adenovirus encoding C203S-CypD or WT CypD into CypD−/− mice via tail vein. Mitochondria isolated from livers of CypD−/− mice or mice expressing C203S-CypD were resistant to Ca2+-induced swelling as compared with WT CypD-reconstituted mice. Our results indicate that the Cys-203 residue of CypD is necessary for redox stress-induced activation of mPTP.

The opening of mPTP during I/R injury results in loss of membrane potential, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, matrix swelling, ATP depletion, and production of reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to cell death. mPTP opening is reported to be a major cause of reperfusion injury, and thus it is an important target for cytoprotection. Interestingly, mPTP has been shown to be redox-sensitive (12Chernyak B.V. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Linard D. Kandlbinder A. Degand H. Morsomme P.

CypD is a mitochondrial matrix protein from a family of cyclophilin proteins that have peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity, catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of peptidylprolyl bonds. In addition, CypD catalyzes the folding of newly imported mitochondrial proteins. In light of the redox sensitivity of mPTP, it is also interesting that CypD has recently been shown to be regulated by redox-sensitive processes (12Chernyak B.V. Biosci.

S-nitrosylation (SNO), the covalent attachment of an NO moiety to a protein thiol group, is a reversible, redox-dependent post-translational modification that has been shown to reduce I/R injury (22Sun J.

NO donors such as GSNO have been shown to increase SNO of a number of proteins. SNO could exert protective effects by modifying cysteine residues and thereby shielding crucial cysteine residues from further irreversible modification such as oxidation in I/R injury (23Sun J.

Moreover, SNO has the ability to modify the activity of target proteins such as enzymes that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation (25Sun J. Morgan M. Shen R.F. Steenbergen C. Murphy E. Circ.

Res. 2011; 108: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Kohr et al. (34Kohr M.J. Aponte A.M. Sun J. Wang G. Murphy E. Gucek M. Steenbergen C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

These observations led us to hypothesize that Cys-203 of CypD might be important in CypD regulation of the mPTP. Therefore, the goal of this work was to determine the effect of mutation of Cys-203 of CypD on mPTP opening. In this work, we show that mutation of the SNO site Cys-203 of CypD significantly reduced mPTP opening in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), suggesting that Cys-203 of CypD is required for mPTP opening. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was purchased from Calbiochem/EMD Bioscience (La Jolla, CA). Hydrogen peroxide, trypsin, glutamate, malate, carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone, and all other standard chemicals (unless indicated otherwise) were purchased from Sigma. DMEM was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Hank's buffered salt solution and tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester were purchased from Invitrogen. Protease/phosphatase inhibitor tablets were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Sources for other reagents/chemicals are specified for each procedure outlined below. All animals were treated and cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, revised 1996), and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male C57BL/6 mice (12 to 15 weeks) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). After anesthesia, mouse hearts were excised and quickly placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer: 120 mmol of NaCl, 11 mmol of d-glucose, 25 mmol of NaHCO3, 1.75 mmol of CaCl2, 4.7 mmol of KCl, 1.2 mmol of MgSO4, and 1.2 of mmol KH2PO4. The aorta was cannulated on a Langendorff apparatus and the heart was perfused in retrograde fashion with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 37 °C. After 20 min of equilibrium perfusion, hearts were perfused for an additional 40 min or subjected to ischemic preconditioning (four cycles of 5 min of ischemia and 5 min of reperfusion). At the end of the perfusion period, hearts were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crude mouse heart homogenates were prepared as described previously (33Kohr M.J. Sun J. Aponte A. Wang G. Gucek M. Murphy E. Steenbergen C. Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34Kohr M.J. Aponte A.M. Sun J. Wang G. Murphy E. Gucek M. Steenbergen C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2011; 300: H1327-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, each heart was powdered on liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. Powdered hearts were then resuspended in 1.5 ml of homogenization buffer containing the following: sucrose (300 mm), HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.7 (250 mm), EDTA (1 mm), and neocuproine (0.1 mm). An EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) was introduced just before use. Samples were then homogenized via Dounce glass homogenization on ice and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was recovered as total crude homogenate. S-Nitrosylated proteins were identified using the SNO-resin-assisted capture method as described previously (33Kohr M.J. Sun J. Aponte A. Wang G. Gucek M. Murphy E. Steenbergen C. Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34Kohr M.J. Aponte A.M. Sun J. Wang G. Murphy E. Gucek M. Steenbergen C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2011; 300: H1327-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (1 mg) were diluted in HEPES EDTA neocuproine buffer with 2.5% SDS and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Diagnostics). Samples were then incubated with 50 mmol/liter N-ethylmaleimide for 20 min at 50 °C to block unmodified (i.e. free) thiol groups; N-ethylmaleimide was removed via acetone precipitation. Samples were resuspended in HEN buffer with 1% SDS and incubated with 20 mmol/liter ascorbate and thiopropyl-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) for 4 h at room temperature to reduce and capture SNO cysteine residues. Samples were then subjected to tryptic digestion, and the remaining resin-bound peptides were eluted via 10 mmol/liter DTT and identified using an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). The MASCOT search engine was used for protein identification as described previously (33Kohr M.J. Sun J. Aponte A. Wang G. Gucek M. Murphy E. Steenbergen C. Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34Kohr M.J. Aponte A.M. Sun J. Wang G. Murphy E. Gucek M. Steenbergen C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2011; 300: H1327-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The expression vector of mutated C203S-CypD was constructed using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using plasmid pCMV6-XL5-CypD as a template. The human full-length CypD clone was constructed using the pCMV6-XL5 mammalian expression vectors obtained from OriGene (Rockville, MD). The forward (TCATCACAGACTCTGGCCAGTTGAGC) and reverse complement (CTCAACTGGCCAGAGTCTGTGATGAC) primers containing a base mismatch (indicated by boldface letters) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (San Diego, CA). DNA sequencing was confirmed using VP1.5 (GGACTTTCCAAAATG-TCG) and XL 39 (ATTAGGACAAGGCTGGT-GGG) primers by Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ). The mutated C203S-CypD plasmid was digested with the restriction enzyme NotI to release the CypD insert, and the resulting sample was analyzed on 1% agarose gel. As expected, after digestion with NotI, the CypD plasmid generated two fragments: the pCMV6-XL5 vector (4.7 kb) and CypD insert (1.7 kb) (Fig. 3A). The mutation was further confirmed by DNA sequencing and analyzed using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). The cysteine corresponding codon TGT was replaced with the serine corresponding codon TCT (Fig. 3B). MEFs were isolated from CypD+/+ and CypD−/− embryos from 12.5 to 14.5-day-pregnant mice by trypsin digestion, as described previously (3Baines C.P. Kaiser R.A. Purcell N.H. Blair N.S. Osinska H. Hambleton M.A. Brunskill E.W. Sayen M.R. Gottlieb R.A. Dorn G.W. Robbins J. Molkentin J.D. Nature. 2005; 434: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). MEFs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Isolated WT MEFs were transfected with pCMV-XL5 (control vector) (OriGene, Rockville, MD). CypD−/− MEFs were transfected with control vector, WT CypD, or mutated C203S-CypD plasmids using Fugene HD (Roche Diagnostics). MEFs were cultured for 48 h prior to experiments. After transfections, MEFs were treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 6 h to induce cell death. Cell death was assessed using the LIVE/DEAD viability kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. mPTP opening in MEFs was assessed using the MitoProbe Transition Pore Assay Kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were loaded with 40 nm of calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then washed with Hank's buffered salt solution and were treated with 0.4 mm CoCl2 or 0.4 mm CoCl2 plus 1 mm H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were then analyzed using a CYAN flow cytometer with appropriate excitation and emission filters for fluorescein. The change in fluorescence intensity between samples incubated with only calcein AM/CoCl2 and samples incubated with calcein AM/CoCl2+H2O2 indicates mPTP-induced opening by H2O2. Adenoviral CypD and mutated CypD were generated using the AdEasy adenoviral vector system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Adenovirus stocks were further amplified in AD-293 cells, and adenovirus titers were determined using the AdEasy viral titer kit (Genomics), an enzyme-linked immunoassay, according the manufacturer's instructions. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to the liver was carried out by tail vein injection of 5.4 × 107 pfu/g of adenoviral particles. Three experimental groups were evaluated after 72 h. In group 1, CypD−/− mice received intravenous injection of adenovirus CMV-GFP (control). In group 2, CypD−/− mice received a recombinant adenovirus encoding WT CypD. In group 3, CypD−/− mice were injected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding mutated C203S-CypD. Liver tissue was rinsed four times with PBS, and the tissue was homogenized in 225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 5 mm MOPS, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm taurine (pH 7.25) (Buffer B) with protease/phosphatase inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 11,000 × g to pellet the mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in Buffer B and protease/phosphatase inhibitors. Oxygen consumption was measured in a chamber connected to a Clark-type O2 electrode (Instech) and O2 monitor (Model 5300, YSI, Inc.) at 25 °C. Mitochondria were incubated in respiration buffer (120 mm KCl, 5 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm KH2PO4, and 0.2% BSA). After addition of 10 mm glutamate/2 mm malate, state 3 respiration was measured by addition of 0.5 mm ADP. Ca2+-induced swelling of isolated liver mitochondria were measured spectrophotometrically as a decrease in absorbance at 540 nm. Isolated liver mitochondria (100 μg) were washed twice with Buffer B with protease/phosphatase inhibitors without EGTA and resuspended in swelling buffer (120 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MOPS, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm glutamate, and 2 mm malate) in a total volume of 200 μl. Pore opening was induced by 250 μm of CaCl2 in the presence and absence of 200 nm cyclosporine A (CsA), a known mPTP inhibitor, and measured at 540 nm. In addition, mPTP opening of MEFs expressing WT CypD or mutated CypD was assessed using the calcium retention capacity (CRC) assay. To measure CRC of MEFs, after transfections, MEFs were harvested using trypsin, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.002% digitonin for 10 min. After permeabilization of the plasma membrane, MEFs were washed once in PBS before being resuspended in the swelling buffer. CRC was assessed using 10 μm fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Calcium Green-5N (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) with the addition of 5 μm Ca2+ pulses to induce mPTP opening. Membrane potential of isolated mitochondria was measured using 1 μm tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester in a quenching mode in 200 μl of swelling buffer. To dissipate the membrane potential, 1 μm protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone was used. PPIase activity was measured spectrophometrically using recombinant CypD (Abnova, Walnut, CA) with buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Immediately before assaying activity, freshly prepared α-chymotrypsin (60 mg/ml, final concentration, 6 mg/ml, Sigma) was added. The freshly made PPIase substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanilide (substrate) (Sigma) was dissolved in the solvent trifluoroethanol with LiCl (470 mm) to a 3 mm stock concentration. The PPIase substrate was added to the reaction to give a final concentration of 75 nm. The absorbance was recorded at 410 nm. All assay solutions/reagents were at 4 °C. Data were fitted into a first-order rate equation. The assay relies on the ability of α-chymotrypsin to release p-nitroanilide from N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanilide only if the bond on the N-terminal side of the proline side is in the trans conformation. Addition of the substrate in the presence of α-chymotrypsin causes a very rapid release of p-nitroanilide since a large proportion (70–80%) of the substrate is in the trans conformation, followed by the slower release of p-nitroanilide as the cis isomer spontaneously isomerizes to the trans form. CypD enhances the rate of the second stage of the reaction. The rate constant of the second stage of the reaction represents PPIase activity. Data obtained in the presence of 20 nm CypD were fitted to a first order rate equation to obtain the kobs as described (13Linard D. Kandlbinder A. Degand H. Morsomme P. Dietz K.J. Knoops B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 491: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The spontaneous PPIase activity or non-enzymatic rate (Ko, in the absence of recombinant CypD) was also calculated from each independent experiment. The data presented as kobs − Ko. After 48 h of transfection, proteins were extracted in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Scientific). Equivalent amounts of protein (40 μg) from each sample were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Gel transfer efficiency and equal loading were verified using reversible Ponceau S staining. The resulting blots were probed with cyclophilin D and β-ATP synthase antibodies (Mitosciences, Eugene, OR) or β-actin antibody (Sigma). All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. The Student's two-sample t test or one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc analyses were used for comparison of differences between groups, and a p value 0.05 was considered to be significant. Protein SNO has been shown to play important role in cardioprotection (22Sun J. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Sun J. Steenbergen C. Murphy E.

To determine whether CypD was S-nitrosylated with cardioprotection, we subjected Langendorff perfused hearts to ischemic preconditioning as described in the methods. Using a modified SNO-Resin-Assisted Capture method (33Kohr M.J. Sun J. Aponte A. Wang G. Gucek M. Murphy E. Steenbergen C. Circ.

A representative spectrum for CypD identification is shown in Fig. 1. This finding is consistent with our previous data (34Kohr M.J. Aponte A.M. Sun J. Wang G. Murphy E. Gucek M. Steenbergen C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2011; 300: H1327-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) showing that Cys-203 is S-nitrosylated in heart homogenates following GSNO treatment. Addition of NO donors, which lead to an increase in protein SNO, have been shown to be cytoprotective and to reduce mPTP opening (25Sun J. Morgan M. Shen R.F. Steenbergen C. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 33Kohr M.J. Sun J. Aponte A. Wang G. Gucek M. Murphy E. Steenbergen C. Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As CypD has the ability to undergo SNO at Cys-203, we wanted to examine whether mutation of Cys-203 to a serine would block GSNO-mediated protection or modulate mPTP opening. Initially, we assessed mPTP opening induced by H2O2 in WT CypD MEFs transfected with control plasmids or CypD−/− MEFs transfected with WT CypD using the calcein AM-cobalt chloride quenching method (Fig. 2A). In this technique, calcein/acetoxy-methyl ester enters the cell (cytosol and mitochondria) and becomes fluorescent upon de-esterification. Co-loading of cells with cobalt chloride quenches the fluorescence in the cytosol but not in the mitochondria since cobalt is not transported across the mitochondrial membranes. H2O2 is used as it is a known inducer of mPTP opening (3Baines C.P. Kaiser R.A. Purcell N.H. Blair N.S. Osinska H. Hambleton M.A. Brunskill E.W. Sayen M.R. Gottlieb R.A. Dorn G.W. Robbins J. Molkentin J.D. Nature. 2005; 434: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). As mPTP is induced, mitochondrial calcein fluorescence is quenched by cobalt. Treatment of WT MEFs with H2O2 for 10 min induced a 46 ± 4.4% quenching of calcein fluorescence consistent with mPTP opening in 46% of the mitochondria (Fig. 2A). CypD−/− MEFs that were reconstituted with WT CypD showed similar induction of mPTP as WT MEFs. Furthermore, as expected, H2O2 treatment of CypD−/− MEFs resulted in a much reduced quenching of calcein fluorescence consistent with resistance to mPTP opening in the absence of CypD. As NO can decrease mPTP opening (28Maejima Y. Adachi S. Morikawa K. Ito H. Isobe M. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2008174897,"Faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which monitors kinetochore attachment to the mitotic spindle. Unattached kinetochores generate mitotic checkpoint proteins complexes (MCCs) that bind and inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex, or cyclosome (APC/C). How the SAC proficiently inhibits the APC/C but still allows its rapid activation when the last kinetochore attaches to the spindle is important for the understanding of how cells maintain genomic stability. We show that the APC/C subunit APC15 is required for the turnover of the APC/C co-activator CDC20 and release of MCCs during SAC signalling but not for APC/C activity per se. In the absence of APC15, MCCs and ubiquitylated CDC20 remain 'locked' onto the APC/C, which prevents the ubiquitylation and degradation of cyclin B1 when the SAC is satisfied. We conclude that APC15 mediates the constant turnover of CDC20 and MCCs on the APC/C to allow the SAC to respond to the attachment state of kinetochores."
https://openalex.org/W2019308540,"Metazoan internal organs are assembled from polarized tubular epithelia that must set aside an apical membrane domain as a lumenal surface. In a global Caenorhabditis elegans tubulogenesis screen, interference with several distinct fatty-acid-biosynthetic enzymes transformed a contiguous central intestinal lumen into multiple ectopic lumens. We show that multiple-lumen formation is caused by apicobasal polarity conversion, and demonstrate that in situ modulation of lipid biosynthesis is sufficient to reversibly switch apical domain identities on growing membranes of single post-mitotic cells, shifting lumen positions. Follow-on targeted lipid-biosynthesis pathway screens and functional genetic assays were designed to identify a putative single causative lipid species. They demonstrate that fatty-acid biosynthesis affects polarity through sphingolipid synthesis, and reveal ceramide glucosyltransferases (CGTs) as end-point biosynthetic enzymes in this pathway. Our findings identify glycosphingolipids, CGT products and obligate membrane lipids, as critical determinants of in vivo polarity and indicate that they sort new components to the expanding apical membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1966476186,"CD161 is a C-type lectin-like receptor expressed on human natural killer (NK) cells and subsets of T cells. CD161 has been described as an inhibitory receptor that regulates NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production. Its role on T cells has remained unclear. Studies have shown that triggering of CD161 enhances NK T cell proliferation and T cell-IFN-γ production while inhibiting TNF-α production by CD8+ T cells. Lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1), the ligand of CD161, was found to be expressed on Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated plasmacytoid and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) and on activated B cells. Using newly developed anti-LLT1 mAbs, we show that LLT1 is not expressed on the surface of circulating B and T lymphocytes, NK cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells but that LLT1 is up-regulated upon activation. Not only TLR-stimulated dendritic cells and B cells but also T cell receptor-activated T cells and activated NK cells up-regulate LLT1. Interestingly, IFN-γ increases LLT1 expression level on antigen-presenting cells. LLT1 is also induced on B cells upon viral infection such as Epstein-Barr virus or HIV infection and in inflamed tonsils. Finally, expression of LLT1 on B cells inhibits NK cell function but costimulates T cell proliferation or IFN-γ production, and coengagement of CD161 with CD3 increases IL-17 secretion. Altogether, our results point toward a role for LLT1/CD161 in modulating immune responses to pathogens.

Not only TLR-stimulated dendritic cells and B cells but also T cell receptor-activated T cells and activated NK cells up-regulate LLT1. Interestingly, IFN-γ increases LLT1 expression level on antigen-presenting cells. LLT1 is also induced on B cells upon viral infection such as Epstein-Barr virus or HIV infection and in inflamed tonsils. Finally, expression of LLT1 on B cells inhibits NK cell function but costimulates T cell proliferation or IFN-γ production, and coengagement of CD161 with CD3 increases IL-17 secretion. Altogether, our results point toward a role for LLT1/CD161 in modulating immune responses to pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2138022747,"Most helicases — ubiquitous motor proteins that catalyse strand separation of base-paired nucleic acids — use ATP as an energy source. The hexameric helicase of T7 bacteriophage, the gene 4 protein, does not unwind DNA efficiently in the presence of ATP but instead uses deoxythymine triphosphate (dTTP). Using a single-molecule approach, Michelle Wang and colleagues show that with this helicase, ATP allows repeated slips during unwinding that prevent unwinding over any significant distance. This behaviour is not observed with dTTP. Using these two nucleotides, they show that the six subunits act together to coordinate nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in a way that promotes processive unwinding of the DNA. Helicases are vital enzymes that carry out strand separation of duplex nucleic acids during replication, repair and recombination1,2. Bacteriophage T7 gene product 4 is a model hexameric helicase that has been observed to use dTTP, but not ATP, to unwind double-stranded (ds)DNA as it translocates from 5′ to 3′ along single-stranded (ss)DNA2,3,4,5,6. Whether and how different subunits of the helicase coordinate their chemo-mechanical activities and DNA binding during translocation is still under debate1,7. Here we address this question using a single-molecule approach to monitor helicase unwinding. We found that T7 helicase does in fact unwind dsDNA in the presence of ATP and that the unwinding rate is even faster than that with dTTP. However, unwinding traces showed a remarkable sawtooth pattern where processive unwinding was repeatedly interrupted by sudden slippage events, ultimately preventing unwinding over a substantial distance. This behaviour was not observed with dTTP alone and was greatly reduced when ATP solution was supplemented with a small amount of dTTP. These findings presented an opportunity to use nucleotide mixtures to investigate helicase subunit coordination. We found that T7 helicase binds and hydrolyses ATP and dTTP by competitive kinetics such that the unwinding rate is dictated simply by their respective maximum rates Vmax, Michaelis constants KM and concentrations. In contrast, processivity does not follow a simple competitive behaviour and shows a cooperative dependence on nucleotide concentrations. This does not agree with an uncoordinated mechanism where each subunit functions independently, but supports a model where nearly all subunits coordinate their chemo-mechanical activities and DNA binding. Our data indicate that only one subunit at a time can accept a nucleotide while other subunits are nucleotide-ligated and thus they interact with the DNA to ensure processivity. Such subunit coordination may be general to many ring-shaped helicases and reveals a potential mechanism for regulation of DNA unwinding during replication."
https://openalex.org/W2067328729,"Transduction and synaptic noise generated in retinal cone photoreceptors determine the fidelity with which light inputs are encoded, and the readout of cone signals by downstream circuits determines whether this fidelity is used for vision. We examined the effect of cone noise on visual signals by measuring its contribution to correlated noise in primate retinal ganglion cells. Correlated noise was strong in the responses of dissimilar cell types with shared cone inputs. The dynamics of cone noise could account for rapid correlations in ganglion cell activity, and the extent of shared cone input could explain correlation strength. Furthermore, correlated noise limited the fidelity with which visual signals were encoded by populations of ganglion cells. Thus, a simple picture emerges: cone noise, traversing the retina through diverse pathways, accounts for most of the noise and correlations in the retinal output and constrains how higher centers exploit signals carried by parallel visual pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2053162845,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a multi-functional secreted protein, and it has been shown either to promote or suppress tumor progression among different kinds of cancers. Here, we investigated the role of CTGF in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) invasion and metastasis. In five OSCC cell lines, endogenous CTGF negatively correlated with invasiveness. Exogenous CTGF protein or forced expression of CTGF gene in the oral cancer cell line SAS significantly decreased their invasive and migratory abilities. MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis was performed in CTGF-overexpressed SAS cells (SAS/CTGF-M3) versus control cells to investigate the mechanism of CTGF-mediated inhibition of OSCC invasion. Among the miRNAs regulated by CTGF, miR-504 and miR-346 were the top two miRNAs downregulated in CTGF transfectants, and the result was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Ectopic miR-504 increased migration and invasion in SAS/CTGF-M3, however, miR-346 did not have such impact on migration/invasion. Furthermore, we identified FOXP1, a member of forkhead transcription factors, as a target gene that takes part in the miR-504-induced cellular invasion. Knockdown of FOXP1 increased invasiveness in SAS/CTGF-M3, confirming the signal axis of CTGF/miR-504/FOXP1 in OSCC. Animal experiments showed that SAS/CTGF-M3-formed orthotopic tumors were associated with a lesser invasive phenotype than control cells. Expression of miR-504 in SAS/CTGF-M3 increased lymph node metastasis, and co-expression of FOXP1 in miR-504-transfected SAS/CTGF-M3 alleviated miR-504-induced metastasis. In OSCC samples, high CTGF was associated with a lower clinical stage and a better outcome. A reverse correlation between CTGF and miR-504, miR-504 and FOXP1, and a positive correlation between CTGF and FOXP1 were shown. Our study discovers a novel signal pathway involving the regulation of miRNA machinery by a secreted cytokine, which will be beneficial for developing therapeutic strategy against advanced OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2072141039,"Tumor progression is intrinsically tied to the clonal selection of tumor cells with acquired phenotypes allowing to cope with a hostile microenvironment. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) master the transcriptional response to local tissue hypoxia, a hallmark of solid tumors. Here, we report significantly longer patient survival in breast cancer with high levels of HIF-2α. Amphiregulin (AREG) and WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-2 (WISP2) expression was strongly HIF-2α-dependent and their promoters were particularly responsive to HIF-2α. The endogenous AREG promoter recruited HIF-2α in the absence of a classical HIF–DNA interaction motif, revealing a novel mechanism of gene regulation. Loss of AREG expression in HIF-2α-depleted cells was accompanied by reduced activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family members. Apparently opposing results from patient and in vitro data point to an HIF-2α-dependent auto-stimulatory tumor phenotype that, while promoting EGF signaling in cellular models, increased the survival of diagnosed and treated human patients. Our findings suggest a model where HIF-2α-mediated autocrine growth signaling in breast cancer sustains a state of cellular self-sufficiency, thereby masking unfavorable microenvironmental growth conditions, limiting adverse selection and improving therapy efficacy. Importantly, HIF-2α/AREG/WISP2-expressing tumors were associated with luminal tumor differentiation, indicative of a better response to classical treatments. Shifting the HIF-1/2α balance toward an HIF-2-dominated phenotype could thus offer a novel approach in breast cancer therapy."

The specificity of its components and the wide range of biological processes in which it is involved make the ubiquitylation pathway a promising source of suitable targets for anti-malarial drug development. Here, we combined immunofluorescent microscopy, biochemical assays, in silico prediction, and mass spectrometry analysis using the multidimensional protein identification technology, or MudPIT, to describe the P. falciparum ubiquitome. We found that ubiquitin conjugates are detected at every morphological stage of the parasite erythrocytic cycle. Furthermore, we detected that more than half of the parasite's proteome represents possible targets for ubiquitylation, especially proteins found to be present at the most replicative stage of the asexual cycle, the trophozoite stage. A large proportion of ubiquitin conjugates were also detected at the schizont stage, consistent with a cell activity slowdown to prepare for merozoite differentiation and invasion. Finally, for the first time in the human malaria parasite, our results strongly indicate the presence of heterologous mixed conjugations, SUMO/UB. This discovery suggests that sumoylated proteins may be regulated by ubiquitylation in P. falciparum.

https://openalex.org/W2034898388,"Stress response gene ATF3 is one of the p53 target genes and has a tumor suppressor role in cancer. However, the biological role of p53–ATF3 pathway is not well understood. Death receptor 5 (DR5) is a death domain-containing transmembrane receptor that triggers cell death upon binding to its ligand TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), and a combination of TRAIL and agents that increase the expression of DR5 is expected as a novel anticancer therapy. In this report, we demonstrate that ATF3 is required for efficient DR5 induction upon DNA damage by camptothecin (CPT) in colorectal cancer cells. In the absence of ATF3, induction of DR5 messenger RNA and protein is remarkably abrogated, and this is associated with reduced cell death by TRAIL and CPT. By contrast, exogenous expression of ATF3 causes more rapid and elevated expression of DR5, resulting in enhanced sensitivity to apoptotic cell death by TRAIL/CPT. Reporter assay and DNA affinity precipitation assay demonstrate that at least three ATF/CRE motifs at the proximal promoter of the human DR5 gene are involved in the activation of DNA damage-induced DR5 gene transcription. Furthermore, ATF3 is shown to interact with p53 to form a complex on the DR5 gene by Re-chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Taken together, our results provide a novel insight into the role of ATF3 as an essential co-transcription factor for p53 upon DNA damage, and this may represent a useful biomarker for TRAIL-based anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2093696635,"Somatostatin receptors (sst1–5) are present in different types of tumors, where they inhibit key cellular processes such as proliferation and invasion. Although ssts are densely expressed in breast cancer, especially sst2, their role and therapeutic potential remain uncertain. Recently, we identified a new truncated sst5 variant, sst5TMD4, which is related to the abnormal response of certain pituitary tumors to treatment with somatostatin analogs. Here, we investigated the possible role of sst5TMD4 in breast cancer. This study revealed that sst5TMD4 is absent in normal mammary gland, but is abundant in a subset of poorly differentiated human breast tumors, where its expression correlated to that of sst2. Moreover, in the MCF-7 breast cancer model cell, sst5TMD4 expression increased malignancy features such as invasion and proliferation abilities (both in cell cultures and nude mice). This was likely mediated by sst5TMD4-induced increase in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and p-Akt levels, and cyclin D3 and Arp2/3 complex expression, which also led to mesenchymal-like phenotype. Interestingly, sst5TMD4 interacts physically with sst2 and thereby alters its signaling, enabling disruption of sst2 inhibitory feedback and providing a plausible basis for our findings. These results suggest that sst5TMD4 could be involved in the pathophysiology of certain types of breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2028760429,"Cisplatin (CDDP: cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) resistance is a major hurdle in the treatment of human ovarian cancer (OVCA). A better understanding of the mechanisms of CDDP resistance can greatly improve therapeutic outcome for patients. A determinant of CDDP sensitivity in OVCA, p53, is activated by checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) in response to DNA damage. Although the oncogenic phosphatase protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1 (PPM1D) can deactivate both p53 and Chk1 through site-specific dephosphorylation, whether PPM1D has a role in CDDP resistance is unknown. Here, using pair-matched wild-type p53 CDDP-sensitive (OV2008) and -resistant (C13*) cells, and p53-compromised CDDP-resistant cells (A2780cp, OCC-1, OVCAR-3 and SKOV3), we have demonstrated (i) the existence of site-specific differences in phospho-Ser-Chk1 content between sensitive and resistant cells in response to CDDP; (ii) PPM1D, but not phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related kinase Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein (ATR), is important in the regulation of CDDP-induced Chk1 activation and OVCA cell chemosensitivity; (iii) PPM1D downregulation sensitizes resistant cells to CDDP primarily by activating Chk1 and p53. Our findings establish for the first time that PPM1D confers CDDP resistance in OVCA cells through attenuating CDDP-induced, Chk1-mediated, p53-dependent apoptosis. These findings extend the current knowledge on the molecular and cellular basis of cisplatin resistance and offer the rationale for PPMID as a potential target for treatment of chemoresistant OVCA."

https://openalex.org/W2023104359,"Intracellular palmitoylation dynamics are regulated by a family of 24 DHHC (aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine) palmitoyltransferases, which are localized in a compartment-specific manner. The majority of DHHC proteins localize to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes, and a small number target to post-Golgi membranes. To date, there are no reports of the fine mapping of sorting signals in mammalian DHHC proteins; thus, it is unclear how spatial distribution of the DHHC family is achieved. Here, we have identified and characterized lysine-based sorting signals that determine the restricted localization of DHHC4 and DHHC6 to ER membranes. The ER targeting signal in DHHC6 conforms to a KKXX motif, whereas the signal in DHHC4 is a distinct KXX motif. The identified dilysine signals are sufficient to specify ER localization as adding the C-terminal pentapeptide sequences from DHHC4 or DHHC6, which contain these KXX and KKXX motifs, to the C terminus of DHHC3, redistributes this palmitoyltransferase from Golgi to ER membranes. Recent work proposed that palmitoylation of newly synthesized peripheral membrane proteins occurs predominantly at the Golgi. Indeed, previous analyses of the peripheral membrane proteins, SNAP25 and cysteine string protein, are fully consistent with their initial palmitoylation being mediated by Golgi-localized DHHC proteins. Interestingly, ER-localized DHHC3 is able to palmitoylate SNAP25 and cysteine string protein to a similar level as wild-type Golgi-localized DHHC3 in co-expression studies. These results suggest that targeting of intrinsically active DHHC proteins to defined membrane compartments is an important factor contributing to spatially restricted patterns of substrate palmitoylation."

Here, we study a mouse model of autoantibody-mediated cardiac allograft vasculopathy to clarify the alloimmune responses mediated by intragraft TLOs and whether blocking lymphotoxin-β-receptor (LTβR) signaling, a pathway essential for lymphoid organogenesis, abrogates TLO development. TLOs (defined as discrete lymphoid aggregates associated with high endothelial venules) were detectable in 9 of 13 heart allografts studied and were predominantly B cell in composition, harboring germinal-center activity. These are most likely manifestations of the humoral autoimmunity triggered in this model after transplantation; TLOs did not develop if autoantibody production was prevented. Treatment with inhibitory LTβR-Ig fusion protein virtually abolished allograft TLO formation (mean TLOs/heart: 0.2 vs. 2.2 in control recipients; P=0.02), with marked attenuation of the autoantibody response. Recipients primed for autoantibody before transplantation rejected grafts rapidly, but this accelerated rejection was prevented by postoperative administration of LTβR-Ig (median survival time: 18 vs. >50 d, respectively, P=0.003). Our results provide the first demonstration that TLOs develop within chronically rejecting heart allografts, are predominantly B cell in origin, and can be targeted pharmacologically to inhibit effector humoral responses.—Motallebzadeh, R., Rehakova, S., Conlon, T.

This study showed that MUC1 expression promoted the synthesis and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through the AKT signaling pathway. Increase VEGF production through MUC1 expression had a number of effect. First, MUC1 transfection increased expression of VEGF in breast cancer cells. Second, MUC1-mediated VEGF induction was attenuated by a chemical inhibitor of AKT or MUC1 knock-down by MUC1 siRNA. Third, MUC1 expression led to the activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, which correlated with VEGF expression. In addition, when MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were directly injected into NOD/SCID mice, MUC1 expression accelerated xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Finally, MUC1 expression enhanced tumor growth and angiogenesis in a PyMT-MMTV/hMUC1 transgenic mouse model. Concurrent with these results, analysis of a human tissue microarray identified a high correlation between MUC1 and VEGF expression in human breast carcinoma. The current report is the first to demonstrate that MUC1 expression promotes angiogenesis in human breast cancer in vivo and in vitro."

The biological activity of DOCK180 is tightly linked to its binding partner ELMO. We previously reported that autoinhibited ELMO proteins regulate signaling from this pathway. One mechanism to activate the ELMO-DOCK180 complex appears to be the recruitment of this complex to the membrane via the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of ELMO.

However, a later study demonstrated that RhoG is not required for integrin-mediated Rac signaling and motility (23Meller J. Vidali L. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), implying that additional proteins may bind the ELMO RBD to target the protein to the membrane. It is evident that understanding the molecular events that regulate ELMO-DOCK180 recruitment to the membrane is an important area of investigation to fully comprehend how these proteins are controlled. This study aimed to identify novel ELMO-interacting proteins to define the molecular events capable of controlling ELMO recruitment to the membrane. Using two complementary approaches, we identified an Arf-related GTPase, Arl4A, as a novel ELMO binding partner and membrane recruitment signal. Moreover, ELMO localization via Arl4A promoted cytoskeletal reorganization via an ELMO-DOCK180-Rac signaling pathway. Our data reveal that the ELMO N terminus has the ability to interact with GTPases from Rho and Arf families leading to the conclusion that ELMO contains a versatile RBD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a RBD with dual specificity for Rho and Arf family GTPases. The following antibodies were obtained commercially: anti-DOCK180 (C-19, H-4, and H-70) and anti-Myc (9E10) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, anti-Rac was from Millipore, and anti-FLAG M2 and anti-FLAG-M2-HRP were from Sigma. The Arl4A antibody was described previously (24Li C.C. Chiang T.C. Wu T.S. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Lee F.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were transfected by calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using standard procedures. Biochemical and cell biological studies were performed 24–48 h after transfection. pCNX2 FLAG-DOCK180 was a gift from M. Matsuda (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). pcDNA3.1 Myc-ELMO1 was previously described (3Côté J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Plasmids coding for Myc-ELMO1 proteins (residues 1–113 and 212–727) were generated by PCR and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1Myc. The yeast constructs for ELMO1 (WT and residues 1–113, 1–212, 1–315, 1–495, 315–727, 212–727, 113–727, Δ114–524, Δ213–524, and Δ310–492) were generated via PCR and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pEG202 (LexA tagged vector (gift from Dr. J. Archambault, Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal, Montreal, Canada)). Myc-ELMO11–212 (L43A) has been described previously (14Patel M. Margaron Y. Fradet N. Yang Q. Wilkes B. Bouvier M. Hofmann K. Côté J.F. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). FLAG-Arl4AWT was generated via PCR and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pcDNA-FLAG vector. FLAG-Arl4AQ79L and FLAG-Arl4AT34N were generated via site-directed mutagenesis. Arl4A-3XFLAG was generated via PCR and cloned into the KpnI/BamHI sites of the p3XFLAG-CMV-14 vector. Arl4AQ79L-3XFLAG and Arl4AT34N-3XFLAG were generated via site-directed mutagenesis. Nontagged ARL4A (WT, T34N, and Q79L) constructs have been described previously (24Li C.C. Chiang T.C. Wu T.S. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Lee F.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The yeast constructs of Arl4 (Arl4AWT, Arl4AT34N, and Arl4AQ79L; Arl4CWT, Arl4CT27N, and Arl4CQ72L; and Arl4DWT, Arl4DT35N, and Arl4DQ80L) were generated via PCR and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pJG4–5alt (B42-tagged vector (gift from Dr. J. Archambault)). pJG4–5alt-Arl4AL43A was generated via site-directed mutagenesis. Sequences coding for all members of Rho, Ras, and Arf families (84 GTPases) were retrieved via PubMed. cDNAs coding for these Rho, Ras, and Arf subfamily members, in their constitutively active forms, were generated by gene synthesis and cloned in pUC57 (GenScript). AttB sites were added at both ends of the gene coding for the GTPases to enable use in the Gateway system. Each clone was recombined with pDONR221 to generate a collection of 84 GTPases in an ENTRY vector. Site-specific recombination was used to generate the yeast two-hybrid compatible plasmids pJG4–5alt-GTPase (84 of Ras superfamily members). The pJG4–5alt-ccdB plasmid used for the LR recombination was constructed as follows: a DNA fragment coding for the ccdB protein and flanked with attR sites was generated by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pJG4–5alt. Immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiment protocols have been described previously (12Komander D. Patel M. Laurin M. Fradet N. Pelletier A. Barford D. Côté J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4837-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed for 10 min in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). For immunoprecipitation, clarified cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody, and immune complexes were allowed to form for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added for 30 min to isolate the immune complex. For cross-linking prior to immunoprecipitation, the cells were treated with DSP (2 mm) (Pierce) for 30 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. For GST fusion protein pulldowns, the GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of the various GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B were next incubated with cell extracts (500 μg of protein/condition). In both types of assays, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Two separate screens were performed to identify ELMO-binding partners. First, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed by Hybrigenics Services (Paris, France) using full-length ELMO1 as a bait to probe an embryonic mouse brain cDNA library. More specifically, the coding sequence for full-length mouse ELMO1 (GenBankTM accession number gi: 17933765) was PCR-amplified and cloned into pB27 as a C-terminal fusion to LexA (N-LexA-ELMO1-C). The construct was checked by sequencing the entire insert and used as a bait to screen a random-primed mouse embryo brain cDNA library constructed into pP6. pB27 and pP6 derive from the original pBTM116 (25Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and pGADGH (26Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Stemglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar) plasmids, respectively. 83 million clones (8-fold the complexity of the library) were screened using a mating approach with Y187 (matα) and L40ΔGal4 (mata) yeast strains as previously described (27Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). 252 His+ colonies were selected on a medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. The prey fragments of the positive clones were amplified by PCR and sequenced at their 5′ and 3′ junctions. The resulting sequences were used to identify the corresponding interacting proteins in the GenBankTM data base (NCBI) using a fully automated procedure. A confidence score (predicted biological score) was attributed to each interaction as previously described (28Formstecher E. Aresta S. Collura V. Hamburger A. Meil A. Trehin A. Reverdy C. Betin V. Maire S. Brun C. Jacq B. Arpin M. Bellaiche Y. Bellusci S. Benaroch P. Bornens M. Chanet R. Chavrier P. Delattre O. Doye V. Fehon R. Faye G. Galli T. Girault J.A. Goud B. de Gunzburg J. Johannes L.

Genome Res. 2005; 15: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Second, a yeast two-hybrid screen was developed to specifically interrogate ELMO/GTPases interactions using the collection of activated Ras GTPases generated in our lab (for more details, see “Construction of an Activated GTPase Library” under “Experimental Procedures”). Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed as previously mentioned (14Patel M. Margaron Y. Fradet N. Yang Q. Wilkes B. Bouvier M. Hofmann K. Côté J.F. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the cell spreading assay on fibronectin, HeLa cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were subject to cell morphology as previously described (4Côté J.F. Motoyama A.B. Bush J.A. Vuori K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and serum-starved (0.5% FBS) overnight. The cells were gently detached (0.01% trypsin and 5 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced solution) and washed in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA, and 40,000 cells were then allowed to spread for the indicated time (50 min or 2 h) before fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked in PBS-1% BSA prior to staining with DAPI and phalloidin. The remainder of the cells was lysed to verify the expression levels of the exogenous proteins by Western blotting. For colocalization assays, experiments were performed as previously described (14Patel M. Margaron Y. Fradet N. Yang Q. Wilkes B. Bouvier M. Hofmann K. Côté J.F. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Statistical differences between groups of data were analyzed using an analysis of variance test and Bonferroni's multiple comparison procedures (minimum of n = 3). Stress fiber disassembly assays were performed as previously described (24Li C.C. Chiang T.C. Wu T.S. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Lee F.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Statistical differences between groups of data were analyzed using Student's t test. PAK-PBD pulldown assays were performed as previously described (12Komander D. Patel M. Laurin M. Fradet N. Pelletier A. Barford D. Côté J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4837-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the formation of an ELMO-DOCK180 complex is essential for Rac GTP-induced cytoskeletal changes but not for Rac GTP-loading per se, the latter being solely dependent on the intrinsic GEF activity of DOCK180 (12Komander D. Patel M. Laurin M. Fradet N. Pelletier A. Barford D. Côté J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4837-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our recent data also highlighted that the RBD of ELMO is essential for targeting ELMO to the membrane upon integrin activation (14Patel M. Margaron Y. Fradet N. Yang Q. Wilkes B. Bouvier M. Hofmann K. Côté J.F. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results suggested that additional GTPase(s) might bind the RBD. To further explore the molecular events regulating the localization of ELMO at the membrane, we undertook two independent but complementary approaches to identify novel partners of ELMO1. First, using ELMO1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system, we scanned an embryonic mouse brain cDNA library. Second, we investigated specifically whether ELMO can interact with additional GTP-loaded GTPases. To do so, we constructed a library of the superfamily of Ras GTPases in their active conformation (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1). We individually tested the ability of all Rho, Ras, and Arf GTPases (84 members) to interact with ELMO in a yeast two-hybrid assay. The combination of these experiments confirmed active RhoG, DOCK proteins (DOCK1-DOCK5), and BAI family receptors (BAI1 and BAI3) as known ELMO binding partners. Interestingly, our two approaches also converged on Arl4A, a small GTPase of the Arf family, as a putative novel ELMO interactor. The Arf family member, Arf6, is heavily implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization via numerous signaling events (8Santy L.C. Ravichandran K.S. Casanova J.E. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1749-1754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Li C.C. Chiang T.C. Wu T.S. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Lee F.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29White D.T. McShea K.M. Attar M.A. Santy L.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 562-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hofmann I. Thompson A. Sanderson C.M. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 711-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). One such pathway places Arf6 upstream of DOCK180 and ELMO and ensuing Rac activation and signaling (8Santy L.C. Ravichandran K.S. Casanova J.E. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1749-1754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism by which Arf6 controls ELMO-DOCK180-mediated Rac signaling is unclear. Arl4A belongs to the large family of Arf-related proteins. The Arl4 family consists of three closely related members: A, C, and D (32Kahn R.A. Cherfils J. Elias M. Lovering R.C. Munro S. Schurmann A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Unlike the other members of this family, Arl4s are preferentially GTP-loaded because of their weak affinity for nucleotides and therefore exhibit high spontaneous nucleotide exchange rates (33Jacobs S. Schilf C. Fliegert F. Koling S. Weber Y. Schürmann A. Joost H.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that Arl4s are involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement through their ability to bind the Arf6 guanine exchange factor, ARNO, and localize it to the cell periphery for Arf6 activation (24Li C.C. Chiang T.C. Wu T.S. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Lee F.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Hofmann I. Thompson A. Sanderson C.M. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 711-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We used the yeast two-hybrid system to verify which isoforms of Arl4s interact with ELMO proteins. Using ELMO1 as bait revealed specificity for the Arl4A protein because no interaction was noted for Arl4C or Arl4D (Fig. 1A). Moreover, ELMO1 binding to Arl4A was nucleotide state-dependent, with ELMO1 selectively interacting with the WT and constitutively active (Q79L) forms but not with dominant negative (T34N) Arl4A (Fig. 1A). To validate these results in a mammalian cell context, we coexpressed Myc-ELMO1 with the WT, Q79L, and T34N forms of Arl4A in 293T cells. Similar to what was observed in yeast, specific interaction between ELMO1 and both Arl4AWT and Arl4AQ79L was observed (Fig. 1B). Finally, we could generalize the binding of Arl4A to all isoforms of ELMO because we found a specific interaction in coimmunoprecipitation between Arl4AWT and Myc-ELMO1, Myc-ELMO2, and Myc-ELMO3 (Fig. 1C). To map the active ELMO1 binding interface for Arl4A, we used a panel of ELMO1 truncation mutants (Fig. 2A) in the yeast two-hybrid system. Our data suggest that the first 113 amino acids of ELMO1 is the smallest fragment with the ability to complex with Arl4A (Fig. 2B). Similarly, a deletion of the first 113 amino acids was sufficient to abrogate binding of ELMO1 to Arl4A (Fig. 2B). Moreover, we also found that ELMO11–113 was sufficient to bind Arl4A in 293T cells (Fig. 2C). A mutant of ELMO1 lacking the first 113 amino acids was difficult to express, but we could demonstrate that the first 212 amino acids of ELMO1 are required for interacting with Arl4A because ELMO1212–727 is unable to coprecipitate Arl4A (Fig. 2C). Our discovery that the Arl4A-binding site encompasses the ELMO RBD led to the following possibility: similar to active RhoG, Arl4A may also have specific affinity for this protein module. Our prior findings disclosed ELMO1 residue leucine 43 as the cornerstone for forging the ELMO1 RBD/RhoG-GTP contact (14Patel M. Margaron Y. Fradet N. Yang Q. Wilkes B. Bouvier M. Hofmann K. Côté J.F. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that both Arl4AWT and Arl4AQ79L were unable to interact with ELMO11–212 (L43A) in comparison with its wild-type counterpart (Fig. 2D). Our data identifies, for the first time, an RBD with the ability to interact with both Rho and Arf family GTPases and supports the notion that the ELMO RBD may have the potential to attract GTPases of different families. Our results are consistent with the model that Arl4A interacts with the RBD of ELMO proteins to favor membrane recruitment. RhoG was previously reported to activate the ELMO-DOCK180 pathway by localizing ELMO to the membrane in a manner dependent on its nucleotide state (22Katoh H. Hiramoto K. Negishi M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To test whether Arl4A also promotes membrane recruitment of ELMO1, we analyzed the cellular distribution of ELMO1 in cells expressing the various forms of Arl4A (WT, Q79L and T34N). Although Myc-ELMO1 alone is cytoplasmic, coexpression with WT and active Arl4A led to its membrane recruitment (Fig. 3). Arl4AT34N displayed a punctate staining in cells and, when expressed with ELMO1, did not redistribute ELMO to the cell periphery (Fig. 3, see figure legend for more details on the scoring system). Moreover, the Arl4A binding-defective mutant of ELMO (ELMO1L43A) was unable to localize to the cell periphery and instead demonstrated a diffuse cytosolic expression when coexpressed with Arl4AQ79L (Fig. 3). The specificity of ELMO binding to Arl4A was further demonstrated by colocalization experiments revealing that ELMO1 does not colocalize at the membrane with either Arl4CQ72L or Arl4DQ80L, with these cells showing less membrane ruffles (Fig. 3). We additionally observed that although Arl4D has been noted to induce membrane protrusions in COS-7 cells (24Li C.C. Chiang T.C. Wu T.S. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Lee F.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), in our hands, Arl4D in HeLa cells does not extensively promote lamellipodia-like structures, suggesting that the effect of Arl4 proteins on membrane remodeling may be context-dependent. This suggests that ELMO proteins are bona fide effectors of active Arl4A and act by localizing ELMO-DOCK180 to the membrane for potential Rac activation. Previous studies demonstrated that activated Arl4A, C, and D could recruit ARNO GEFs to the membrane (24Li C.C. Chiang T.C. Wu T.S. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Lee F.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Hofmann I. Thompson A. Sanderson C.M. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 711-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Arl4D was studied in more detail and was reported to induce actin stress fiber disassembly through an ARNO-Arf6 dependent pathway (24Li C.C. Chiang T.C. Wu T.S. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Lee F.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4420-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Independent work also reported that the ARNO-Arf6 pathway might facilitate membrane recruitment of ELMO-DOCK180 and promote Rac-dependent migration (8Sant"
https://openalex.org/W2082107715,"Recently, immunohistochemical analysis of myoglobin (MB) in human breast cancer specimens has revealed a surprisingly widespread expression of MB in this nonmuscle context. The positive correlation with hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) and carbonic anhydrase IX suggested that oxygen regulates myoglobin expression in breast carcinomas. Here, we report that MB mRNA and protein levels are robustly induced by prolonged hypoxia in breast cancer cell lines, in part via HIF-1/2-dependent transactivation. The hypoxia-induced MB mRNA originated from a novel alternative transcription start site 6 kb upstream of the ATG codon. MB regulation in normal and tumor tissue may thus be fundamentally different. Functionally, the knockdown of MB in MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells resulted in an unexpected increase of O(2) uptake and elevated activities of mitochondrial enzymes during hypoxia. Silencing of MB transcription attenuated proliferation rates and motility capacities of hypoxic cancer cells and, surprisingly, also fully oxygenated breast cancer cells. Endogenous MB in cancer cells is apparently involved in controlling oxidative cell energy metabolism, contrary to earlier findings on mouse heart, where the targeted disruption of the Mb gene did not effect myocardial energetics and O(2) consumption. This control function of MB seemingly impacts mitochondria and influences cell proliferation and motility, but it does so in ways not directly related to the facilitated diffusion or storage of O(2). Hypothetically, the mitochondrion-impairing role of MB in hypoxic cancer cells is part of a novel tumor-suppressive function."

In addition to a PX domain, SNX27 is the only sorting family member that contains a PDZ domain. To identify novel SNX27-PDZ binding partners, we performed a proteomic screen in mouse principal kidney cortical collecting duct cells using a GST-SNX27 fusion construct as bait.

The endocytic system is a series of compartments that determine the fate of intracellular protein cargo. Such cargo is commonly delivered from the plasma membrane to endosomal compartments where a number of trafficking decisions can be made. For example, the protein may be delivered to lysosomes and degraded or recycled to the cell surface (1Gould G.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been proposed that endosomes may also serve as a platform for protein-protein interactions to regulate a range of cellular processes such as migration, polarity, and cytokinesis (1Gould G.W.

Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are one of the largest domain families involved in protein-protein interactions. They primarily function by interacting with short amino acid motifs at the C termini of target proteins (6Lee H.J. Zheng J.J. Cell Commun. Signal. 2010; 8: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To date, the PDZ domain of SNX27 has been shown to interact with enzymes, receptors, and ion channels (7Lauffer B.E. Melero C.

Commun. 2007; 359: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The PX domain is responsible for SNX27 localization (7Lauffer B.E. Melero C. Temkin P. Lei C. Hong W. Kortemme T. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Lunn M.L. Nassirpour R. Arrabit C. Tan J. McLeod I. Arias C.M. Sawchenko P.E. Yates 3rd, J.R. Slesinger P.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain of SNX27 has been proposed to traffic a growing list of proteins via endosomal-mediated pathways. For example, Lunn et al. (9Lunn M.L. Nassirpour R. Arrabit C. Tan J. McLeod I. Arias C.M. Sawchenko P.E. Yates 3rd, J.R. Slesinger P.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have proposed that SNX27 regulates Kir3 potassium channel endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. More recently, data by Lauffer et al. (7Lauffer B.E. Melero C. Temkin P. Lei C. Hong W. Kortemme T. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) suggest a role for SNX27 in the recycling of β2-adrenoreceptors from the early endosome to the plasma membrane. In this study we demonstrate intracellular trafficking of a novel protein complex via an interaction with SNX27. In a proteomic screen using the SNX27-PDZ domain as bait, we identified the proteins β-Pix (PAK-interacting exchange factor) 2The abbreviations used are: β-PixPAK-interacting exchange factorGitG-protein receptor kinase interacting targetSHDSpa-2 homology domainmpkCCDmouse primary kidney cortical collecting ductPAKp21-activated kinase. and Git (G-protein receptor kinase interacting target) as novel SNX27 interacting proteins. PAK-interacting exchange factor G-protein receptor kinase interacting target Spa-2 homology domain mouse primary kidney cortical collecting duct p21-activated kinase. β-Pix (also known as Cool-1 and ARHGEF7) was first identified as a binding partner to the PAK family of Cdc42/Rac1-activated kinases (12Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In the same article, β-Pix was identified in focal complexes and demonstrated to be involved in PAK recruitment to these sites (12Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). β-Pix has also been shown to target the Rac1 GTPase to focal adhesions (13ten Klooster J.P. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Hordijk P.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Both Rac and PAK compete for the Src homology 3 domain of β-Pix (13ten Klooster J.P. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Hordijk P.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the absence of PAK, elevated levels of Rac1 in complex with β-Pix were observed, a condition that led to increased cell spreading (13ten Klooster J.P. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Hordijk P.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Hence, interplay between β-Pix, Rac1, and PAK may modulate cell adhesion and motility. Regulation of cell motility by β-Pix might also involve the Git family of proteins (14Hoefen R.J. Berk B.C. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1469-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Like β-Pix, two members of this family, Git1 and Git2, localize to focal complexes (15Loo T.H. Ng Y.W. Lim L. Manser E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3849-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Git proteins contain an amino-terminal ARF GTPase-activating protein domain, three ankyrin repeats, a Spa-2 homology domain (SHD), a coiled-coil domain, and a carboxyl-terminal binding site for paxillin (14Hoefen R.J. Berk B.C. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1469-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A number of binding partners have been shown to interact with each domain. For example, the SHD domain has been found to interact with β-Pix, which enables Git to interact with PAK, Rac, and Cdc42 (15Loo T.H. Ng Y.W. Lim L. Manser E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3849-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that the β-Pix-Git interaction is constitutive and may exist in complexes in excess of 1 MDa. Recent data has also demonstrated the existence of an unusually stable heteropentameric complex with dimeric Git interacting with trimeric Pix (17Botrugno O.A. Paris S. Za L. Gualdoni S. Cattaneo A. Bachi A. de Curtis I. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Premont R.T. Perry S.J. Schmalzigaug R. Roseman J.T. Xing Y. Claing A.

The interaction between Git and β-Pix may be weakened by phosphorylation of β-Pix at Tyr442 (20Feng Q. Baird D. Yoo S. Antonyak M. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18806-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the Git-paxillin interaction is facilitated and proposed to disassemble focal adhesions (20Feng Q. Baird D. Yoo S. Antonyak M. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18806-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Git proteins have also been observed in endosomes (21Di Cesare A. Paris S. Albertinazzi C. Dariozzi S. Andersen J. Mann M. Longhi R. de Curtis I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Matafora V. Paris S. Dariozzi S. de Curtis I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4509-4520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Location of Git proteins to these sites is mediated by the first of the three amino-terminal ankyrin repeats (21Di Cesare A. Paris S. Albertinazzi C. Dariozzi S. Andersen J. Mann M. Longhi R. de Curtis I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here, Git proteins were proposed to mediate membrane recycling between endosomes and the plasma membrane where nascent focal contacts form (21Di Cesare A. Paris S. Albertinazzi C. Dariozzi S. Andersen J. Mann M. Longhi R. de Curtis I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Taken together, the involvement of β-Pix-Git in cell migration is complex and involves phosphorylation events, transient protein-protein interactions, and intracellular trafficking. Here we present evidence of a SNX27·β-Pix·Git complex. The interaction between SNX27 and β-Pix is direct, with β-Pix as the central component of this trimeric complex. We also show that SNX27 is responsible for recruitment of the β-Pix·Git complex to endosomal sites and propose that, during cell motility, the β-Pix·Git complex recycles between the endocytotic system and focal contact sites. A polyclonal antibody to a GST-SNX27 fusion (amino acids 1–265) was generated by Lampire Biological Laboratories (Pipersville, PA) and Primm Biotech (Cambridge, MA). Monoclonal antibodies against fusion proteins tagged with c-Myc (clone 9E10), HA (clone HA-11), and GFP (clone JL8) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), Covance (Princeton, NJ), and Clontech (Mountain View, CA), respectively. Anti-paxillin, anti-Git1, anti-Git2, and anti-β-Pix monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-β-Pix and Git1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA) and Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), respectively. Anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. β-Pix/ARHGEF7 variant 1 and 3 plasmid DNA molecules (catalog numbers sc117668 and sc318985) were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). Git1 and Git2 plasmid DNA molecules were purchase from Open Biosytems (Huntsville, AL). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. The cDNA sequence of human SNX27b was amplified by PCR and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pCMV-Myc (Invitrogen), PET28c (Novagen EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ), and pEGFP (Clontech). SNX27b mPDZ point mutation was generated using the QuikChange® Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions using primers 5′-caagtccgagtccggcggcggcggcaacgtgcggggccaag-3′ and 5′-cttggccccgcacgttgccgccgccgccggactcggacttg-3′. A SNX27b mutant lacking the PDZ domain was generated by inverse PCR using primers 5′-P-gtacctcctcatgaggcagataacc-3′ and 5′-P-ggcgcagtggagcccagaccccc-3′. PCR-based cloning was also used to clone Git1 into pEYFPc1 (Clontech) and β-Pix into pCMV-HA (Invitrogen) or mCherry-c1 (Clontech). DNA primer sequences and protocols for these procedures and all others herein are available upon request. All constructs were sequenced to ensure the absence of undesired secondary mutations (Macrogen, Rockville, MD). Mouse primary kidney cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD) clone 3 cells were kindly provided by Mark Knepper (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health). MpkCCD and HeLa cells were maintained in high glucose, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) in humidified chambers with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in high glucose, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% normal calf serum (Invitrogen). MpkCCD cells were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX reagent including Plus reagent (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's recommended instructions. Similarly, HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were transfected using FuGENE HD (Roche). Cells were typically analyzed for protein expression using Western blotting or immunofluorescence 24–48 h post-transfection. Transfection of siRNA molecules in NIH3T3 or mpkCCD cells was performed with OligofectamineTM (Invitrogen) using a reverse transfection protocol as per the manufacturer's instructions. Murine-specific β-Pix/ARHGEF7 siRNA molecules were purchased from Dharmacon (number L063023-01-0010). Stable shRNA expressing cells were generated using an inducible lentiviral shRNA system (pINDUCER10) and selected with puromycin (23Meerbrey K.L. Hu G. Kessler J.D. Roarty K. Li M.Z. Fang J.E. Herschkowitz J.I. Burrows A.E. Ciccia A. Sun T. Schmitt E.M. Bernardi R.J. Fu X. Bland C.S. Cooper T.A. Schiff R. Rosen J.M. Westbrook T.F. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 3665-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). A set of shRNA sequences specific for SNX27 were purchased from Open Biosystems (number RHS4531-NM_030918). The clone IDs for each shRNA are shRNA#2 V3LHS_412022, shRNA#5 V3LHS_383895, shRNA#6 V3LHS_383896, shRNA#7 V2LHS_273547, shRNA#8 V2LHS_237898, and shRNA#9 V3LHS_383899, respectively. Clone number 5 may be used to target human or mouse SNX27. These sequences were subcloned from pGIPZ to pINDUCER10 with MluI and XhoI digests. An identical method was used to prepare control (firefly luciferase) lentivirus. Lentiviral supernatants were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). HeLa and mpkCCD stable cell lines were generated by lentiviral transduction as described (23Meerbrey K.L. Hu G. Kessler J.D. Roarty K. Li M.Z. Fang J.E. Herschkowitz J.I. Burrows A.E. Ciccia A. Sun T. Schmitt E.M. Bernardi R.J. Fu X. Bland C.S. Cooper T.A. Schiff R. Rosen J.M. Westbrook T.F. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 3665-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). shRNA expression on puromycin-resistant clones were routinely induced with 1 μg/ml of doxycycline for 72–96 h prior to experimental analysis. To investigate whether the interaction of SNX27 with β-Pix is direct, β-Pix variant 1, variant 3, or variant 1 with the PDZ binding motif deleted (ΔETNL) were subcloned (SalI-NotI) into pBlueScript SK (Stratagene). One microgram of each construct was translated using ([35S]Met) and the TnT® T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. Ninety percent of the translated product was diluted in NETN buffer (125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors. The diluted translated product was tumbled with 2 μg of the indicated GST fusion proteins conjugated to Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times, boiled in sample buffer, and run on an SDS-PAGE gel. Ten percent of the translated product was used as input. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to film. The PDZ domain of human SNX27 was cloned by PCR into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX2T using the following primers: 5′-CATGGATCCCCGCGGGTCGTGCGCATC-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCCAGATAACACTGTCAAGATCAATTC-3′ and transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene). SNX27-PDZ fusion protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at room temperature. The bacterial cells were lysed by sonication for 1 min in PBS and proteins were solubilized in Triton X-100 diluted to 1% final volume. Fusion proteins were collected by incubation at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). The fusion proteins were quantified by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. For GST pulldown experiments, mpkCCD, HeLa, or NIH3T3 cells were lysed in binding buffer 150 (BB150: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS, 10 mm EDTA) plus CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). GST pulldowns were typically performed using ∼500 μg of protein and 10–20 μg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and boiled in sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2) containing CompleteTM protease inhibitors. The protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Immunoprecipitations were routinely performed using 1–2 mg of protein and 2–5 μg of purified SNX27 antibody or Myc polyclonal antibody conjugated to Sepharose beads and incubated at 4 °C (Sigma). SNX27-immune complexes were precipitated using protein A-Sepharose, washed twice with lysis buffer, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Immune complexes and proteins bound to GST fusion proteins were analyzed by Western blotting and detected using the indicated primary antibodies incubated at 1:500 (Git1/2) or 1:1000 (SNX27) followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to IRdye 780 nm (rabbit) or IRdye 680 nm (mouse) (Licor, Lincoln NE) at 1:10,000 dilution. Detection of Myc tag by Western blotting was performed using the 9E10 monoclonal antibody used at 1:5,000 dilution followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (1:10,000; Millipore). To identify novel proteins bound to SNX27-PDZ, samples were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the bands were visualized by silver staining. Protein identification by mass spectrometry was done in the NHLBI proteomics core, at the National Institutes of Health. The band of interest was excised and digested with trypsin at a 1:50 enzyme/substrate ratio. The dried tryptic digest was analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo-Fisher Scientific LLC) interfaced with an Eksigent nano-LC one-dimensional plus system (Eksigent Technologies LLC, Dublin, CA) using CID fragmentation. Samples were loaded onto an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 trap column at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 10 min, and then separated on a reversed-phase PicoFrit analytical column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) using a 40-min linear gradient of 2–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. LTQ-Orbitrap XL settings were as follows: spray voltage, 1.5 kV; full MS mass range, m/z 200 to 2000. The LTQ-Orbitrap XL was operated in a data-dependent mode; i.e. MS1 in the ion trap, scan for precursor ions followed by six data-dependent MS2 scans for precursor ions above a threshold ion count of 2000 with collision energy of 35%. The raw file generated from the LTQ-Orbitrap XL was analyzed using Proteome Discoverer version 1.2 software (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, LLC) using our six-processor Mascot cluster search engine at the NIH (biospec.nih.gov, version 2.3). The following search criteria was set to: data base, Sprot (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics); taxonomy, Mus musculus (mouse); enzyme, trypsin; miscleavages, 2; fixed modification, carbamidomethylation (+57 Da); variable modification, methionine oxidation (+16 Da); deamidation (N,Q), acetyl (protein N-terminal); MS peptide tolerance as 1.0 Da; MS/MS tolerance as 0.8 Da. Protein identifications were based on 2 or more unique peptides with a false discovery rate set to 0.01. HeLa or NIH3T3 cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (coated overnight, 4 °C; 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) and transfected as indicated. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. The fixed coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies at the following concentrations (HA, 1:1000; Myc, 1:1000; polyclonal β-Pix, 1:100; monoclonal Git1 or -2, 1:100) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed extensively with PBS and incubated with the indicated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 568, 594, or 647 nm, Invitrogen) used at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Following further washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted using FluorSaveTM (Calbiochem). Wide-field images were collected using a Personal DeltaVision system (Applied Precision Inc., Issaquah, WA) mounted on an inverted Olympus IX71 microscope with an oil immersion PlanApo N ×60/1.42 objective lens. All images were acquired using a CoolSNAP ES2 CCD camera with 2 × 2 binning and a 512 × 512 pixels imaging field. All images were deconvolved using an iterative constrained method with 10 cycles of medium noise filtering in Applied Precision's SoftWoRx software package version 4.0.0. TIRF microscopy and quantification of endogenous β-Pix at focal contact sites was performed as previously described (24Kuo J.C. Han X. Hsiao C.T. Yates 3rd, J.R. Waterman C.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To analyze the changes of focal abundance of endogenous β-Pix in HeLa cells expressing SNX27 WT and SNX27 ΔPDZ, double-labeled immunofluorescence images were quantified in the following manner: images of immunolocalized paxillin and β-Pix were median filtered with a 3-pixel square kernel and background flattened with a 13-pixel square kernel. Next, regions of the cell were manually selected to include all segmented paxillin-marked focal adhesions. The regions were transferred to the β-Pix immunofluorescence image of the same cell. The mean β-Pix intensity of the focal adhesion in SNX27 WT or SNX27 ΔPDZ-expressing cells was divided by the mean intensity of β-Pix at focal adhesions in GFP-expressing cells (control) to generate the fractional focal adhesion immunofluorescence signal change ± S.D. as reported in the figures. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was measured by a Student's t test between control and SNX27 WT-expressing cells or control and SNX27 ΔPDZ-expressing cells. The velocity of individual HeLa or mpkCCD cells was measured using Image-Pro Plus version 7.0 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). As a first step in the identification of novel binding partners to the PDZ domain of SNX27, we generated a recombinant GST fusion protein containing this domain. GST-PDZ or GST recombinant proteins were incubated with mpkCCD cell lysates or with lysis buffer alone (Fig. 1a). After washing, proteins bound to GST beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1a). Two proteins of approximate molecular mass of 80 and 90 kDa were both readily stained with Coomassie and uniquely present in pulldowns of GST-PDZ from kidney cell lysates (Fig. 1a, column 4). The two protein bands were excised, subjected to in-gel trypsin digest, and the identity of each determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS). The protein of 80 kDa was identified as β-Pix/ARHGEF7 (49% peptide coverage) (Fig. 1b). Two members of the Git family were present in the 90-kDa band; they were identified as Git1 and Git2 (62.8 and 46.5% peptide coverage), respectively (Fig. 1b). To validate the finding that SNX27 can bind β-Pix, we performed GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2). Lysates from mpkCCD and HeLa cells were incubated with GST alone, GST-PDZ, or a mutant GST-PDZ protein where a conserved GΦGΦ (GYGF in SNX27) is mutated to GGGG (mPDZ). This conserved hydrophobic sequence is found within a loop connecting strands βA and βB and is responsible for binding C-terminal peptide ligands on binding partners (25Jeleń F. Oleksy A. Smietana K. Otlewski J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2003; 50: 985-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GST beads were washed and bound β-Pix was identified by Western blotting. Whereas β-Pix did not bind to GST or GST-mPDZ, it was associated with GST-PDZ in both mpkCCD and HeLa cells (Fig. 2a). To further verify that the PDZ domain on SNX27 is involved in β-Pix interaction, a series of Myc-tagged SNX27 constructs were expressed in mpkCCD cells (Fig. 2b). Along with full-length SNX27 (wild type), mPDZ or deletion mutants lacking the PDZ (ΔPDZ) or FERM/RA (ΔFERM) domains were engineered into full-length SNX27 (Fig. 2b). Expressed Myc-SNX27 proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation and the presence of β-Pix was identified by Western blot (Fig. 2b). β-Pix co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-SNX27 WT and Myc-SNX27 ΔFERM immunoprecipitates, but Myc-SNX27 mPDZ and Myc-SNX27 ΔPDZ mutants were defective for β-Pix binding (Fig. 2b). We also detected the presence of a lower molecular weight β-Pix species in protein lysates but not Myc pulldowns. This may be a previously reported shorter form of β-Pix (26Koh C.G. Manser E. Zhao Z.S. Ng C.P. Lim L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4239-4251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of additional note was the reproducible observation of increased β-Pix binding to Myc-ΔFERM/RA, suggesting that this domain may negatively regulate protein-protein interactions with SNX27 PDZ. In conclusion, we have confirmed the novel interaction between SNX27 and β-Pix and demonstrated that the association between the two proteins involves the PDZ domain of SNX27. To determine whether the SNX27-β-Pix interaction occurs at normal physiological levels, endogenous SNX27 was immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 cell lysate using SNX27 polyclonal antiserum. First, as a test for specificity, this antibody (1 μg) was preincubated in t"
https://openalex.org/W1968347043,"Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) is a multifunctional protein well characterized as the E3 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. Previously, conditions predicted to destabilize the DLD dimer revealed that DLD could also function as a diaphorase and serine protease. However, the relevance of these cryptic activities remained undefined. We analyzed human DLD mutations linked to strikingly different clinical phenotypes, including E340K, D444V, R447G, and R460G in the dimer interface domain that are responsible for severe multisystem disorders of infancy and G194C in the NAD(+)-binding domain that is typically associated with milder presentations. In vitro, all of these mutations decreased to various degrees dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase activity, whereas dimer interface mutations also enhanced proteolytic and/or diaphorase activity. Human DLD proteins carrying each individual mutation complemented fully the respiratory-deficient phenotype of yeast cells lacking endogenous DLD even when residual dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase activity was as low as 21% of controls. However, under elevated oxidative stress, expression of DLD proteins with dimer interface mutations greatly accelerated the loss of respiratory function, resulting from enhanced oxidative damage to the lipoic acid cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and other mitochondrial targets. This effect was not observed with the G194C mutation or a mutation that disrupts the proteolytic active site of DLD. As in yeast, lipoic acid cofactor was damaged in human D444V-homozygous fibroblasts after exposure to oxidative stress. We conclude that the cryptic activities of DLD promote oxidative damage to neighboring molecules and thus contribute to the clinical severity of DLD mutations."

Alterations in this pathway can have deleterious effects, including sexual development impairment, spontaneous abortion, and breast cancer. 3βHSD2, synthesized in the cytosol, is imported into the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) by translocases. Steroidogenesis requires that 3βHSD2 acts as both a dehydrogenase and isomerase. To achieve this dual functionality, 3βHSD2 must undergo a conformational change; however, what triggers that change remains unknown. We propose that 3βHSD2 associates with IMM or outer mitochondrial membrane translocases facing the intermembrane space (IMS) and that this interaction promotes the conformational change needed for full activity. Fractionation assays demonstrate that 3βHSD2 associated with the IMM but did not integrate into the membrane. Through mass spectrometry and Western blotting of mitochondrial complexes and density gradient ultracentrifugation, we show that that 3βHSD2 formed a transient association with the translocases Tim50 and Tom22 and with Tim23. This association occurred primarily through the interaction of Tim50 with the N terminus of 3βHSD2 and contributed to enzymatic activity. Tim50 knockdown inhibited catalysis of dehydroepiandrostenedione to androstenedione and pregnenolone to progesterone. Although Tim50 knockdown decreased 3βHSD2 expression, restoration of expression via proteasome and protease inhibition did not rescue activity. In addition, protein fingerprinting and CD spectroscopy reveal the flexibility of 3βHSD2, a necessary characteristic for forming multiple associations. In summary, Tim50 regulates 3βHSD2 expression and activity, representing a new role for translocases in steroidogenesis.

Loosely associated protein complexes at the mitochondrial membranes, termed translocases, mediate protein import and sorting. Translocase complexes found at the OMM are called Tom (translocase, outer membrane), whereas those at the IMM are called Tim (translocase, inner membrane) (3Koehler C.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Most proteins enter the mitochondria via the Tom40 channel. After crossing the OMM, Tim50 of the Tim23 complex receives proteins that contain a presequence. Interaction of Tim50 with the preprotein promotes binding of the presequence to the IMS domain of Tom22 (9Chacinska A. Lind M. Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E.

In steroidogenic tissues, the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc, catalyzes cholesterol to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroids.

We hypothesize that the bifunctional activity of 3βHSD2 requires the protein to undergo a conformational change. We propose that 3βHSD2 associates with the IMM or OMM translocases facing the IMS and that this interaction promotes a conformational change leading to the two different enzymatic activities. We found that 3βHSD2 associated with the IMM but did not integrate into it. This likely was the result of the interaction between 3βHSD2 and Tim50, resulting in a transient complex formation of 3βHSD2, Tom22, Tim23, and Tim50. The study demonstrates the flexibility of 3βHSD2, which allowed the protein to interact with the membrane bound domains of Tim50. Cytochrome P450c17, expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Brière N. Martel D. Cloutier M. LeHoux J.G. J. Histochem.

Moreover, restoration of 3βHSD2 expression in the Tim50 knockdown cells via proteasome and protease inhibition did not rescue steroidogenic activity. Thus, the association of 3βHSD2 with the translocase appears to play a key role in the regulation of enzymatic activity. Mitochondria were obtained from cell lines or, as a control, from pig adrenal glands. The pig adrenals were excised immediately after animal sacrifice at the Department of Animal Sciences, University of Florida. The adrenal tissues were diced in mitochondrial isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4), whereas the cell lines were washed with PBS two times and then incubated with 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C. Next, tissues and cells were homogenized in a hand-held all-glass Dounce homogenizer with 40 gentle up and down strokes, and the cell debris was removed by spinning at 3500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the mitochondrial fraction was purified by differential centrifugation following a previously reported procedure (25Bose M. Adams B.P. Whittal R.M. Bose H.S. Electrophoresis. 2008; 29: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Bose M. Debnath D. Chen Y. Bose H.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 39: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the pellet was washed and then resuspended in an energy regeneration buffer (125 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm isocitrate, 1.0 mm ATP, 1.0 mm NADP, 0.1 mm ADP, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) before storage at either −86 °C or in liquid nitrogen. To synthesize [35S]methionine labeled proteins, the cDNAs for 3βHSD2 and the COX IV dihydrofolate reductase fusion were subcloned into the SP6 vector, and proteins were synthesized in a cell-free system in the presence of [35S]Met using TNT-rabbit reticulocyte (Promega). Ribosomes and associated incompletely translated polypeptide chains were removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (27Schwartz M.P. Matouschek A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13086-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For all protein import experiments, a 100-μl mixture of isolated mitochondria (100 μg) and synthesized protein was incubated in a 26 °C water bath with or without proteinase K, and the import reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm mCCCP and an equal volume of boiling 2× SDS sample buffer. The import reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis through SDS-polyacrylamide gels, fixing the gels in methanol/acetic acid (40:10), and then drying and exposing gels to a phosphorimaging screen. To analyze complex formation, 35S-labeled 3βHSD2 was incubated with mitochondria isolated from MA-10 cells, and the reaction was stopped by placing the mix on ice. Membranes were then lysed with buffer containing digitonin, and the samples were electrophoresed through 3–16% gradient native gels. In some cases gels were fixed, dried, and then exposed to phosphorimaging In other cases protein complexes were transferred to a membrane and then probed with antibodies against 3βHSD2, Tom22, Tim50, or Tim23. The mitochondrial compartments were individually purified following a standard procedure with minor modifications. In brief, the OMM fraction was extracted with 1.2% digitonin, and the remaining mixture of matrix and IMM was purified through 0.5% Lubrol, where the matrix fraction remained in solution after centrifugation, and the IMM fraction formed the pellet (28Komarov A.G. Deng D. Craigen W.J. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3950-3959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Proteins with a nonspecific association or loose association with the membranes were removed by incubation with proteinase K. Fractions were then processed for Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. Limited proteolytic digestion experiments were performed at room temperature or 4 °C using 5 μg of 3βHSD protein and different concentrations of trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) for either 15 or 45 min. The reactions were terminated by adding of an equal volume of SDS-sample buffer containing 2 mm PMSF and then incubating in a boiling water bath. After electrophoresis, the samples were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver nitrate. Complexes were excised, destained, reduced with DTT (Roche Applied Science), alkylated with iodoacetamide (Sigma), and then digested with trypsin (Promega Sequencing Grade Modified) overnight (29Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). The extracted peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry via LC-MS/MS on a nanoAcquity UPLC (Waters, MA) coupled with a Q-TOF-Premier mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK/Waters, MA). Tryptic peptides were separated using a linear water/acetonitrile gradient (0.1% formic acid) on a nano Acquity column (3-μm Atlantis dC18, 100 Å pore size, 75-μm inner diameter × 15 cm) (Waters, MA) with an in-line Symmetry column (5-μm C18, 180-μm inner diameter × 20 mm) (Waters, MA) as a loading/desalting column. Protein identification using the generated MS/MS spectra was performed by searching the NCBI non-redundant data base using Mascot MS/MS Ion Search at Matrix Science with consideration for the carbamidomethylation of cysteine and the oxidation of methionine. Complexes were resolved by a sucrose density gradient (top 10% to bottom 30%) with a cushion of 200 μl of 68% (2.0 m) sucrose in a final volume of 2 ml. Approximately 100 μg of protein in a volume of 100 μl was layered on the top and centrifuged at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA55 rotor at 55,000 rpm for 1 or 4 h. After centrifugation, fractions of 125 μl were collected. Gradient fractions were analyzed by native PAGE to show that the complexes were not degraded during centrifugation through the sucrose density gradient. Fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation to determine specific interactions. An aliquot of 20 μl of each fraction was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the components were analyzed by Western blot. siRNA (5′-GGGACATCATGTGAAGGACtt-3′) and (5′-GGACATCTCCTGTCTGAATtt-3′) for Tim50, (5′-GCCAGTCTGGAGTTGCTTTtt-3′) and (5′-CGCTATCTCGTTCAGGATAtt-3′) for Tim23, and (5′-GAAGATGTACAGATTTTCCtt-3′) and (5′-CCTTGGCACATGGATCTATtt-3′) for Tom22 were obtained from Ambion/Invitrogen. COS-1 and MA-10 cells were transfected with 30 and 60 pmol of siRNA, respectively, using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Non-targeting siRNA as well as a combination of two non-targeting scrambled siRNAs (Ambion) were included as controls in all experiments. The pSilencer siRNA expression plasmid for Tim50 was constructed by ligating the 55-mer siRNA template into a pSilencer 4.1 CMV expression vector (Ambion). Complementary 55-mer siRNA oligonucleotides (5′-GATCGGACATCATGTGAAGGACTTCAAGAGAGTCCTTCACATGATGTCCCTTTTTTAGGAAA-3′ and 3′-GCCCUGTAGUACACTTCCTGAAGTTCTCTAACTATGGACCCAGGAAGTGTACTACAGGGAAAAAACCTTTTCGA-5′) were annealed, ligated into pSilencer neovector (Ambion), and transformed into competent Escherichia coli to screen for positive hairpin siRNA inserts. The accuracy of the knockdown was determined by Western blotting. For generation of stable cell lines, COS-1 and MA-10 cells were independently transfected with the purified plasmid using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Single clones were generated 48 h after transfection by limiting dilution into a selection medium containing 600 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin). Individual clones were then transferred to 24-well plates (Greiner) for propagation and then later transferred to 6-cm plates for transfection. Individual clones were examined for Tim50 expression by Western blotting. Western blotting was performed with 12.5 mg of protein and with specific primary antibodies. Signals were developed with West-Pico chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). Specific antibodies were preincubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (0.5 μg/μl, GE Healthcare) in 100 μl of 1× co-immunoprecipitations buffer (1% Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 2 h at 4 °C. To remove unbound antibody, beads were washed with 1× co-immunoprecipitations buffer and then incubated with a rabbit IgG control antibody (Sigma) for 1 h to block unbound beads and then washed. The freshly isolated mitochondrial pellet (25 mg for each sample) was resuspended with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris HCl pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA), and unsolubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation (30 min at 100,000 × g). The supernatants were incubated with antibody-bound protein A-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the protein A-Sepharose pellets were resuspended in 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0, for 10 s, and then a pretitrated volume of 1.0 m Tris, pH 9.5, was added to adjust the pH to 7.4. Immune complexes were then analyzed by Western blotting. Isolated mitochondria (300 μg) were incubated in potassium phosphate buffer for the conversion of [3H]pregnenolone to progesterone. Three million counts of [3H]pregnenolone were used for each reaction and chased with 30 μg of cold unlabeled progesterone. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NAD and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in a shaking water bath. To measure the conversion of DHEA to androstenedione, mitochondria were incubated with 80,000 counts of [14C]DHEA, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of NAD and incubated as above. For some of the experiments, protease or proteasome inhibitors were included. For both reactions, the steroids were extracted with ether/acetone (9:1 v/v), and equal amounts of a cold pregnenolone-progesterone (50:50, Sigma) mixture in CH2Cl2 were added as a carrier. The extracts were concentrated under a stream of nitrogen or air and then separated by TLC (Whatman) using a chloroform/ethyl acetate (3:1) mobile phase. The radioactivity was enhanced using [3H]Enhancer, and the amounts of each steroid were determined using phosphorimaging. The spots extracted from TLC plates were subjected to GCMS analysis on an Agilent 7890 GC with 5975C mass spectrometer. The column used was an Agilent HP-5 with dimensions 30-m × 0.25-mm inner diameter with a 0.25-μm film thickness. Samples were dissolved in 50 μl of dichloromethane, and 1 μl was injected onto the column using a pulsed splitless injection. The temperature program was as follows: ramp at 10 °C/min from 70 to 310 °C and hold for 6 min. Spectra were collected in full scan mode over the mass range m/z 50–500 to facilitate comparison of MS spectra with the NIST/EPA/NIH NIST08 mass spectral library. Human 3βHSD2 was purified from mitochondria of recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (30Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using DEAE ion-exchange chromatography in the presence of Igepal CO-720 detergent (Rhodia, Inc., Cranbury, NJ) as previously described (31Thomas J.L. Mack V.L. Sun J. Terrell J.R. Bucholtz K.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 120: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The low critical micelle concentration (CMC) Igepal detergent was exchanged for the high-CMC detergent, Cymal-5 (Anatrace, Inc., Maumee, OH), using hydroxylapatite chromatography. The 3βHSD2 fraction pool from the DEAE column was applied to the hydroxylapatite column (1 mg of protein/ml of packed gel), washed with 3.5 column volumes of 0.025 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01 m NAD, 1.8 mm Cymal-5, and eluted with 0.30 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01 m NAD, 1.8 mm Cymal-5. The peak of 3βHSD2 activity was pooled and found to be free of Igepal CO-720 based on absorbance at 280 nm due to the Igepal CO-720. The specific location of 3βHSD2 within the mitochondria is not yet known. Thus, we did fractionation studies using isolated mitochondria from mouse Leydig MA-10 cells and found 3βHSD2 localized to the IMM (Fig. 1B). The size of the 3βHSD2 associated with the IMM fraction appeared similar to that of the control 3βHSD2 purified from baculovirus, indicating that the protein did not undergo signal sequence cleavage. We then evaluated if 3βHSD2 integrates into the IMM or if it merely associates with the membrane by performing import assays with cell-free-synthesized 35S-labeled 3βHSD2 and isolated mitochondria from MA-10 cells (Fig. 1, C–E). We separated the non-imported (S) from the imported fraction (P) by centrifugation and analyzed membrane integration by extracting the pellet with Na2CO3. Sodium carbonate breaks protein-protein interactions but not lipid-protein interactions (3Koehler C.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 309-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although the identical size of 35S-labeled 3βHSD2 before and after import suggests an uncleaved N terminus, a common characteristic for IMM proteins, our observation that 3βHSD2 returned to the supernatant after carbonate extraction indicates that the protein was not integrated into the IMM. A brief incubation with a protease results in the digestion of proteins with a nonspecific membrane association as the enzyme cannot enter the membrane. Thus, the fact that incubation of fractions with proteinase K only ablated signal in the non-imported fractions suggests that a specific association between 3βHSD2 and the IMM. As a control, we evaluated each fraction for the presence of COX IV, an integrated IMM protein facing the matrix. The Western blots validated the mitochondrial integrity during fractionation, extraction, and proteolysis (Fig. 1C). In summary, the results confirm that 3βHSD2 was imported like a typical inner membrane protein and suggest that 3βHSD2 may specifically associate with the IMM without integration into the membrane. To determine the compartment specific localization of 3βHSD2 at the IMM, we performed Western analysis on mitochondrial fractions from steroidogenic MA-10 cells and included antibodies directed against proteins known to localize in the IMM or OMM. We found that the IMM fraction contained both Tim50 and Tim23 (Fig. 1, F and G). To confirm that we successfully separated the OMM from the IMM, we probed fractions for the presence of voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC2), an OMM protein, and saw that VDAC2 primarily localized to the OMM (Fig. 1H). 3βHSD2 was seen in the IMM fractions (Fig. 1, G and H). Similarly, 3βHSD2 also localized to the IMM in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and human adrenal NCI H295 cells (data not shown). From the above studies we found that 3βHSD2 specifically associated with the IMM but was not integrated into the membrane (Fig. 1, B–E). This association with the IMM led us to evaluate what proteins 3βHSD2 may bind to in the mitochondria. We did import assays using cell-free-synthesized 35S-labeled 3βHSD2 and mitochondria isolated from steroidogenic MA-10 cells. Samples were treated with proteinase K to proteolyze non-specifically associated proteins. Digitonin lysis of the imported 35S-labeled 3βHSD2 and subsequent native gradient gel electrophoresis resulted in the appearance of three 3βHSD2-containing complexes, 750, 490, and 390 kDa in size (Fig. 2A). The two smaller complexes may represent a breakdown from the larger complex, but resistance to proteinase K suggests tightly associated protein complexes. LC-MS/MS analysis of the major 750-kDa complex revealed several mitochondrial proteins (supplemental Table ST1), including outer membrane translocase Tom22, inner membrane translocase Tim50, and 3βHSD2. These results suggest that the outer and inner mitochondrial translocases may coordinate their functions through 3βHSD2. Tranlocases help ensure the proper localization of mitochondrial proteins. Most mitochondrial proteins, synthesized as precursor proteins in the cytosol (3Koehler C.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 309-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 5Rehling P.

Proteins then reach their final destination within the mitochondria through the action of additional translocase complexes. For example, Tim23 at the IMM directs proteins with a presequence to either the IMM or matrix. Each translocase complex consists of multiple proteins that can transiently associate with proteins in other complexes (7Kutik S. Guiard B. Meyer H.E. Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. J.

Tim50, a component of the Tim23 complex, binds to proteins emerging from the Tom40 channel and stimulates interaction between the presequence and Tom22 (9Chacinska A. Lind M. Frazier A.E. Dudek J.

https://openalex.org/W2093303714,"Mtss1 is located within chromosomal region 8q23-24, which is one of the three most commonly amplified regions in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Mtss1 is lost in metastatic cells, but confusingly is commonly overexpressed in primary tumors. Here we address possible reasons why Mtss1 is positively selected for in primary tumors. We find that Mtss1 enhances the localization of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor to the plasma membrane, prolonging EGF signaling and resulting in enhanced proliferation in HNSCC. Depletion of Mtss1 results in decreased EGF receptor levels and decreased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt. However, when cells are at high density and adherent to each other, analogous to conditions in a solid tumor, Mtss1 does not confer any growth advantage, either in basal conditions or following EGF stimulation. This could indicate why Mtss1 might be lost in metastases, but preserved in early primary tumors. This is supported by an organotypic assay showing that Mtss1-expressing cells display a less proliferative more epithelial-like morphology on top of a collagen matrix. Furthermore, xenograft tumors expressing Mtss1 initially grow more rapidly, but later show less proliferation and more differentiation. Mtss1 positively modulates EGF signaling at low cell densities to promote proliferation and, therefore, may be beneficial for the early stages of primary HNSCC tumor growth. However, at high cell densities, Mtss1 impacts negatively on EGF signaling and this suggests why it inhibits metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2043142643,"Live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is a promising bacterial vector able to induce a T-cell response to tumor-associated antigens and demonstrates great potential for use in vaccine development. A novel recombinant LM-based vaccine (Lmdd (LM ΔdalΔdat)-MPFG (multiple peptide fusing genes)) was developed with the ability to express and secrete hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related tumor-associated antigens fragments due to the insertion of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-X protein (HBx)-derived epitopes HBx52−60 and HBx140−148, the universal T-helper epitope, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) epitope AFP158−166, and melanoma antigen gene (MAGE)-3271−279 into the HBV core protein. Following immunization with the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine, macrophages exhibited uptake of the bacteria; the vaccine was then nearly cleared 3 days after the first administration. It disappeared even more quickly following subsequent vaccinations. However, recombinant Lmdd-MPFG allowed for the full development of an antitumor response towards the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A0201 epitopes of MPFG. Each epitope stimulated an augmented T-cell proliferation and enhanced the supernatant level of interferon (IFN)-γ in vitro. In addition, IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells as well as in vivo cytolytic activity were significantly increased in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Additionally, the Lmdd-MPFG developed a strong antitumor response, as indicated by the significant resistance of immunized mice to MPFG-positive Hepa1-6 cell challenge in both a prophylactic and therapeutic setting. Tumor regression was accompanied by an enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and a decrease of regulatory T cells in the tumor. Collectively, these results suggest that utilizing attenuated LM as a vaccine vector, able to carry the MPFG gene, presents a potentially feasible strategy for prevention of HCC."

The “protein-only” hypothesis states that prions consist of PrPSc, a conformational isomer of the ubiquitous host glycoprotein PrPC, and that their replication comes about by PrPSc-directed conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. The seeding model proposes that PrPC is in equilibrium with PrPSc (or a precursor thereof); however, with the equilibrium strongly favoring PrPC, and that PrPSc is only stabilized when it forms an aggregate containing a critical number of monomers. Once such a seed is present, monomer addition ensues rapidly (1Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar, 2Gajdusek D.C. J.

We have developed the cell panel assay, which allows the distinction of several prion strains, in particular RML, 22L, ME7, and 301C, by determining their cell tropism using the standard scrapie cell assay (SSCA) (21Klöhn P.C.

Swainsonine (swa), an inhibitor of Golgi α-mannosidase II, leads to the replacement of asparagine-linked, Endo-H-resistant complex glycoproteins by Endo-H-sensitive, mannose-rich hybrid-type complex glycoproteins (supplemental Fig. S1) (25Tulsiani D.R.

We found that swa inhibited infection of PK1 cells by RML, 79A and 22F about 99%, by 139A prions about 90% but did not inhibit infection by 22L prions nor did it affect propagation of RML or any of the aforementioned strains in LD9 or CAD5 cells. Other inhibitors of N-glycosylation, kifunensine and castanospermine, which inhibit α-mannosidase I and α-glucosidase, respectively, also inhibited prion infection in both a strain-specific and cell-specific manner but were not studied in further detail. Thus, these inhibitors extend the ability of the cell panel assay to discriminate between prions strains. In addition, acquisition of swa sensitivity by 22L prions on being transferred from brain to PK1 cells (28Li J. Browning S. Mahal S.P. Oelschlegel A.M. Weissmann C.

Furthermore, the discovery that swa-sensitive prion populations can acquire swa resistance when propagated in the presence of the drug revealed that pathogens devoid of nucleic acid can undergo Darwinian evolution (28Li J.

The RML strain (RML I856-II) was obtained from the Medical Research Council Prion Unit, University College London, and propagated in CD1 mice. ME7 and 22L strains were from the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy Resource Centre, Compton, Newbury, UK, and were propagated in C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Frozen brains were homogenized for 10 s in PBS (9 ml per g) using a hand-held Ultramax T18 basic homogenizer (IKA Works Inc., Bloomington, NC) at 20,000–25,000 rpm. Homogenates were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Thawed homogenates were re-homogenized by passing through a 28-gauge needle; they were not centrifuged at any stage. The titers, determined by mouse bioassay, in LD50 units/g brain, were 108.8 for RML, 108.3 for ME7, and 108.3 for 22L. To prepare cell lysates, 2.5 × 107 cells suspended in 1 ml of PBS (containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) were frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed three times, and passed eight times through a 28.5-gauge needle.

After about 10 days, individual colonies were transferred to the wells of 96-well plates. Duplicate 96-well plates were generated, and one set was screened by the SSCA for response to 5 × 10−6 RML. The highest responding clones were expanded to 107 cells in 15-cm dishes and frozen down in aliquots in OBGS, 6% DMSO. The SSCA was essentially performed as described previously (21Klöhn P.C.

The cells were split 1:7 into OBGS and, after reaching confluence, were split two more times. After reaching confluence, 20,000 cells were deposited on the membrane of a Multiscreen IP96-well 0.45-μm filter plate (Millipore, Danvers, MA), and rPrPSc-positive cells were identified by PK-ELISA. In short, after drying at 50 °C, the samples were lysed, digested with PK, denatured with guanidinium thiocyanate, and exposed to anti-PrP antibody D18 (30Williamson R.A. Peretz D. Pinilla C. Ball H.

When the SSCA was performed in the presence of swa (Logan Natural Products) or mannostatin A (Toronto Research Chemicals or Enzo Life Sciences), the inhibitors were present during the entire assay. The samples, in PBS, 0.5% Triton, were adjusted to 3 mg of protein/ml and digested with PK (Roche Applied Science, 20.2 mg/ml; volume activity (hemoglobin) 967 units/ml; specific activity (hemoglobin) 47.9 units/ml) at 20 μg/ml. Samples with a lower concentration of protein were digested with a proportionately lower concentration of PK (1:150 ratio of PK to protein). Digestion was for 1 h at 37 °C; the reaction was stopped with 2 mm PMSF. Cell lysate (300 μg of protein in 120 μl of 1% SDS, 80 mm DTT) was denatured at 100 °C for 10 min. Aliquots (60 μg) were incubated with or without 1500 units of Endo-H (500 units/μl, New England Biolabs) in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, for 1.5 h at 37 °C. To generate unglycosylated PrP as reference, 60-μg samples were digested with 1500 units of PNGaseF (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (final volume, 30 μl) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Digestions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 4× XT MES sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and heating 10 min at 100 °C. For Western blotting, 30-μg aliquots were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% polyacrylamide, Bio-Rad Criterion System precast gels) 1 h at 120 V and transferred to PVDF Immobilon membranes (Millipore) by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad).

To determine cell surface PrP, cells were grown for 11 days with and without 2 μg of swa/ml and resuspended in fresh medium, and 106 cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Following resuspension in 0.5 ml of FB (1× PBS containing 1% BGS), the cells were incubated on ice for 20 min in FB containing 2.2 μg/ml anti-PrP antibody D18, washed twice by centrifugation and resuspension in fresh FB, and incubated in 0.5 ml of FB containing 8 μg of Alexa488-linked anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen)/ml for 20 min on ice in the dark. Following two washes in FB, fluorescent cells were analyzed on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), gated for singlets. PrP expression was transiently knocked down in PK1 cells with a serial dilution of siRNA against PrP. siRNA directed against PrP (Qiagen mM PrnP 3 SI01389549) at 100 pmol/ml in Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) 1:100 in Opti-MEM® was incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature, serially diluted 1:2 with Opti-MEM®, and 100 μl/well of each dilution was placed into wells of 96-well plates. A Lipofectamine-only control was included. To each well 20,000 PK1 cells were added, and after 24 h, the medium was replaced with OBGS. After a further 24 h, the cells from 24 wells of each siRNA dilution were pooled (to give about 2 × 106 cells) and subjected to the SSCA, with or without 2 μg/ml swa, 5000 cells in sextuplicate for each condition. The remaining cells were suspended in PBS + protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 107 cells/ml and lysed, and the relative PrPC levels were determined by Western blotting as described above. PMCA was carried out by subjecting a PrPC-containing substrate (uninfected brain homogenate or cell lysate), primed with a PrPSc “seed” (prion-infected brain homogenate or cell lysate), to repeated cycles of sonication and incubation. “Brain substrate” was prepared as described previously (31Saá P. Castilla J. Soto C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 299: 53-65PubMed Google Scholar) but not subjected to centrifugation. PMCA using cell lysates as substrate has been described (32Mays C.E. Yeom J. Kang H.E. Bian J. Khaychuk V. Kim Y. Bartz J.C. Telling G.C. Ryou C. PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e18047Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To prepare “cell substrate,” PK1 cells were grown for 7 days in the presence or absence of 2 μg of swa/ml, collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, suspended at 4 × 107 cells/ml, and lysed in cell conversion buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (PIC, Roche Applied Science) in 1× PBS). Substrates were stored at −80 °C. “RML cell seed” was prepared from PK1[RML] cells grown for 7 days in the presence or absence of 2 μg of swa/ml. Cells were suspended at 2.5 × 107/ml in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS), lysed by three cycles of rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing, and passed eight times through a 22-gauge needle. The PrPC content of the “+swa” and “−swa” lysates, as measured by Western blot analysis after PNGase treatment, did not differ significantly (one-way analysis of variance, p < 0.01). “Cell PMCA” reaction mixtures consisted of 445.5 μl of cell substrate or brain homogenate as control, seeded with 4.5 μl of 6.25 × 10−2 RML brain homogenate in 1× PBS. “Brain PMCA” reaction mixtures consisted of 445.5 μl of brain substrate seeded with 4.5 μl of 6 × 10−3 RML brain homogenate in 1× PBS or 4.5 μl of cell lysate adjusted to contain the same rPrPSc level as the brain homogenate. For PMCA, 80-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were dispensed into 200-μl PCR tubes (Axygen) containing 37 ± 3 mg of 1.0-mm Zirconia/Silica beads (Biospec Products), and samples were subjected to cycles of 20 s of sonication and 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, for 0, 2, 4, 8, or 12 h, using a Misonix 3000 sonicator at the 8.5 power setting. All reactions were performed in triplicate. To measure rPrPSc amplification, 40-μl aliquots were incubated with 40 μg of PK (Roche Applied Science)/ml for 1 h at 56 °C with shaking. Digestion was terminated by adding 12.5 μl of 4× XT-MES sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and heating 10 min at 100 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were run through SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4–12% polyacrylamide, Bio-Rad Criterion System precast gels) for 10 min at 80 V followed by 1 h at 150 V. Proteins were transferred to PVDF Immobilon membranes (Millipore) by wet transfer (Bio-Rad), and PrP was visualized by incubation with the anti-PrP humanized antibody D18 (0.5 μg/ml) and HRP-conjugated anti-Hu IgG secondary antibody (40 ng/ml, Southern Biotech). Chemiluminescence was induced by ECL-Plus (Pierce) and recorded by CCD imaging (BioSpectrum AC Imaging System; UVP). Densitometric data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and plotted with GraphPad Prism. PageRuler Plus Prestained Protein Ladder (Fermentas) was run as molecular weight marker. Cells were grown on glass culture slides (BD Biosciences) in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml swa for 3 days, after which cells were exposed to 10−3 RML or 22L-infected brain homogenate. At 4, 24, or 48 h after infection, cells were processed and stained for rPrPSc essentially as described (33Marijanovic Z. Caputo A. Campana V. Zurzolo C. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000426Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, procedures were carried out at room temperature. Cells were treated with 50 μg of thermolysin/ml in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, which removes PrPC at the cell surface but does not degrade rPrPSc or dislodge the cells (34Cronier S. Gros N. Tattum M.H.

Demczyk, J. Li, and C. Weissmann, unpublished observations. Cells were washed once with cold PBS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 μg of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin/ml (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in PBS to biotinylate cell surface proteins. The cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1 m glycine, once with PBS, and fixed 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% digitonin in PBS. Slides were incubated 10 min in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride followed by two washes in PBS, 1% BSA. After blocking for 30 min in PBS, 1% BSA, slides were stained at 37 °C with 0.7 μg of monoclonal antibody D18/ml for 30 min, followed by Alexa488-conjugated anti-human IgG and Alexa635-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min. Slides were mounted in Prolong Gold (Molecular Probes) and viewed with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope using a 100× oil-immersion objective. Cells were imaged throughout their entire vertical extent in 0.2-μm-thick optical sections. Three-dimensional rPrPSc objects were quantified using the three-dimensional Object Counter plugin (http://rsbweb.nih.gov) for Mac Biophotonics ImageJ for microscopy. An “rPrPSc object” was defined as having a minimum D18 fluorescence intensity over a contiguous region at least 0.025 μm3 in size; the minimum intensity was set such that no events were identified in uninfected cells thermolysin-digested, biotinylated, fixed, stained, and imaged in parallel. rPrPSc objects with coincident biotin signals were scored as being extracellular. Images were constructed from maximum intensity Z-projections of at least 15 sections from about 1 to 4 μm from the culture surface. PK1 or LD9 cells (106 in 10-cm dishes, in Opti-MEM®-4.5% BGS) were exposed to a 10−4 dilution of RML-infected brain homogenate. After 4 days, the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without 2 μg of swa/ml, and the cells were propagated for 4 more days, with an additional medium change on day 7. Eight days after infection, cells were starved of methionine and cysteine for 1 h using Pulse Medium (DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine (Invitrogen) with 1% dialyzed BGS), exposed to Pulse Medium supplemented with 0.2 mCi/ml 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine (EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix, [35S], PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h, washed with PBS, and incubated in normal OBGS medium. Cells were harvested at the times indicated, washed with 10 ml of PBS, resuspended, and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate). rPrPSc was precipitated with sodium phosphotungstic acid as described previously (35Wadsworth J.D. Joiner S. Hill A.F. Campbell T.A. Desbruslais M. Luthert P.J. Collinge J. Lancet. 2001; 358: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 5 mg of BSA/ml. The samples were digested with 80 μg of PK/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, precipitated with methanol/chloroform, and denatured in 200 μl of 3 m guanidinium thiocyanate in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. After another methanol/chloroform precipitation, the denatured rPrPSc was resuspended in 1 ml of DLPC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Sarkosyl, 0.4% l-α-lecithin), incubated with D18 antibody (5 ng/ml) overnight at 4 °C, and exposed to 200 μl of protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 90 min at 4 °C with shaking. The beads were washed once with 1 ml of DLPC buffer for 30 min, once with TN-1% S buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Sarkosyl) for 30 min, and five times with TN-1% S buffer for 10 min, all at 4 °C. Tubes were changed after each washing step to minimize carry-over of background radioactivity. The beads were boiled in 200 μl of 1× Glycoprotein Denaturation Buffer (New England Biolabs) for 10 min at 100 °C and deglycosylated with PNGaseF according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). Samples were precipitated with methanol/chloroform and resuspended in 20 μl of 1× XT-MES sample buffer (Roche Applied Science). One aliquot was subjected to Western blot analysis (at 1:20 dilution), as described above, to determine the recovery of rPrPSc, and another aliquot was run through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4–12% bis-tris Criterion gel, Bio-Rad). The gel was dried for 2 h in a Bio-Rad gel dryer in a vacuum generated by a water aspirator, exposed to a phosphorscreen (Storage Phosphor Screen, GE Healthcare) for 1 or 2 days, and imaged with a Storm 860 scanner (Amersham Biosciences). We determined the susceptibility of a cell line to persistent infection by a prion strain by the SSCA (21Klöhn P.C. Stoltze L. Flechsig E. Enari M. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11666-11671Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 23Mahal S.P. Demczyk C.A. Smith E.W. Klöhn P.C. Weissmann C. Hill A.F. Methods in Molecular Biology: Prions. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2008Google Scholar). In short, we exposed the cells to various dilutions of prion-infected mouse brain homogenate, propagated them for three splits, and measured the proportion of PrPSc positive cells by an ELISA-based procedure. We designated as Response Index (RI) a sample the reciprocal of the dilution that gives rise to a designated proportion of infected cells under standard assay conditions (usually 1.5% of the population). Because PrP glycosylation has been proposed to play a role in prion strain specificity (36DeArmond S.J. Qiu Y. Sànchez H. Spilman P.R. Ninchak-Casey A. Alonso D. Daggett V. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of glycosylation inhibitors on the propagation of several prion strains in PK1, R33, CAD5, and LD9 cells (22Mahal S.P.

We observed a surprising effect of swa, an inhibitor of Golgi α-mannosidase II. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, it inhibited persistent infection of PK1 cells by RML, 79A and 22F about 99%, with an ED50 of about 1.7–5.2 ng/ml (10–30 nm) (supplemental Fig. S2), but it had no effect on infection by 22L and only moderately diminished infection by 139A prions. Moreover, it did not inhibit infection of CAD5, R33, or LD9 cells by any of the above-mentioned strains (Fig. 1). Infection of PK1 cells with 22L or of CAD5 cells by RML was not inhibited by swa concentrations as high as 40 μg/ml (supplemental Fig. S3). We also examined the effect of other inhibitors of N-glycosylation on the SSCA. Both kifunensine, an inhibitor of α-mannosidase I, and to a lesser extent castanospermine, an inhibitor of α-glucosidase, caused cell- and strain-specific inhibition with similar patterns, which differed, however, from that given by swa ("

Because homocysteine, which accumulates intracellularly during folate deficiency, stimulated interactions between heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNP-E1) and an 18-base FR-α mRNA cis-element that led to increased FR biosynthesis and net up-regulation of FR at cell surfaces, hnRNP-E1 was a plausible candidate sensor of folate deficiency. Accordingly, using purified components, we evaluated the physiological basis whereby l-homocysteine triggered these RNA-protein interactions to stimulate FR biosynthesis. l-Homocysteine induced a concentration-dependent increase in RNA-protein binding affinity throughout the range of physiological folate deficiency, which correlated with a proportionate increase in translation of FR in vitro and in cultured human cells. Targeted reduction of newly synthesized hnRNP-E1 proteins by siRNA to hnRNP-E1 mRNA reduced both constitutive and l-homocysteine-induced rates of FR biosynthesis. Furthermore, l-homocysteine covalently bound hnRNP-E1 via multiple protein-cysteine-S-S-homocysteine mixed disulfide bonds within K-homology domains known to interact with mRNA. These data suggest that a concentration-dependent, sequential disruption of critical cysteine-S-S-cysteine bonds by covalently bound l-homocysteine progressively unmasks an underlying RNA-binding pocket in hnRNP-E1 to optimize interaction with FR-α mRNA cis-element preparatory to FR up-regulation. Collectively, such data incriminate hnRNP-E1 as a physiologically relevant, sensitive, cellular sensor of folate deficiency. Because diverse mammalian and viral mRNAs also interact with this RNA-binding domain with functional consequences to their protein expression, homocysteinylated hnRNP-E1 also appears well positioned to orchestrate a novel, nutrition-sensitive (homocysteine-responsive), posttranscriptional RNA operon in folate-deficient cells.

Because nutritional folate deficiency induced a marked (100-fold) increase in cell surface FR protein without a proportionate increase in FR mRNA in a cervical cancer cell line, we pursued the possibility of posttranscriptional regulation of FR. Initially, we identified an interaction between an 18-base cis-element in the 5′-UTR of FR-α mRNA and a trans-factor protein that was critical for the biosynthesis of FR (11Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J.

Subsequent studies led to a model that established a linkage between perturbed folate metabolism and coordinated up-regulation of FR at the translational level (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); in this scheme, the accumulated intracellular homocysteine resulting from folate deficiency triggered the interaction of FR-α mRNA cis-element with hnRNP-E1, which then stimulated the biosynthesis and up-regulation of FR (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance remained unclear because such RNA-protein interactions must be highly responsive to even small increases of homocysteine beyond 14 μm, as would be found during mild folate deficiency (1Antony A.C. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Silberstein L.E. McGlave P. Heslop H. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 5th Ed. Churchill Livingstone-Elsevier, Philadelphia2009: 491-524Google Scholar), but we could only consistently detect RNA-protein interactions at dl-homocysteine concentrations of 25 μm and beyond (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whether this stemmed from the use of dl-homocysteine rather than physiological l-homocysteine was not clear. Moreover, we had not yet captured cellular RNA-protein complexes in direct response to the small increases in intracellular concentration of l-homocysteine found in mild folate deficiency. Furthermore, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) whereby physiological concentrations of homocysteine triggered these RNA-protein interactions was also obscure. The latter issue is of particular importance because the binding of FR-α mRNA cis-element by hnRNP-E1 is a necessary prelude to its translation (11Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the factors and events that trigger the initial RNA-protein interaction can be operationally conceived as comprising the “afferent (sensing) limb” of translation, whereas all subsequent events (leading to recruitment of the ribosome and initiation of polypeptide synthesis) constitute the more complex “efferent (executing) limb” of translation. In this context, any entity that can recognize a fall in intracellular folate with a high degree of sensitivity and respond by facilitating the restoration of folate levels toward normalcy by up-regulating FR would fulfill criteria of a bona fide “folate sensor.” Therefore, to increase understanding of the molecular basis for an induction of the RNA-protein interaction (reflecting the afferent sensing limb of translation of FR), we tested the hypothesis that hnRNP-E1 incurred one or more dose-dependent posttranslational modifications as a result of the increasing intracellular concentrations of homocysteine accompanying physiological cellular folate deficiency and that this led to a progressive increase in affinity of homocysteinylated hnRNP-E1 for binding FR-α mRNA cis-element, which determined the extent of translation of FR. Collectively, our results suggest that hnRNP-E1 fulfills the characteristics of a physiological sensor of folate deficiency and is an intrinsic component of the afferent limb of translation of FR and shed new light on the molecular basis underlying the physiological activation of a nutritional folate deficiency-sensitive (and homocysteine-responsive) posttranscriptional RNA operon that is orchestrated by homocysteinylated hnRNP-E1. Folate-replete HeLa-IU1-HF cells and folate-deficient HeLa-IU1-LF cells were obtained (25Sun X.L. Murphy B.R. Li Q.J. Gullapalli S. Mackins J. Jayaram H.N. Srivastava A. Antony A.C. J. Clin.

Briefly, HeLa-IU1-HF cells were propagated long term at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in high folate minimum essential medium (MEM-HF) (Invitrogen) containing 10% nondialyzed fetal bovine serum and 9 nm 5-methyltetrahydrofolate plus 2.3 μm pteroylglutamate. HeLa-IU1-LF cells, which were derived from HeLa-IU1-HF cells, were stably propagated in low folate MEM-LF medium, which contained 10% nondialyzed fetal bovine serum added to folate-free MEM, that resulted in a final concentration of 9 nm 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. 1 × 105 cpm of each of the 32P-labeled mRNA cis-elements (see supplemental Methods) were reacted with 0.5 μg of purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-hnRNP-E1 protein in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations (0–100 μm) of dl- or l-homocysteine followed by analysis of RNA-protein complexes by native PAGE (60:1), autoradiography, and densitometric analysis (24Antony A.C.

To determine the influence of homocysteine on the dissociation constant (KD) of the RNA-protein interaction, binding assays between 0.1 μg of purified recombinant GST-hnRNP-E1 and 35S-labeled 18-base FR-α mRNA cis-element (0–12 nm) were carried out in a final volume of 750 μl of binding buffer in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations (0–100 μm) of dl- or l-homocysteine at 4 °C for 1 h. BSA (0.1 μg) was used as a control in place of hnRNP-E1 for background determination. The mixture was then filtered through a Microcon YM-30 column by centrifugation at 12,000 × g followed by three consecutive washes, each with 500 μl of binding buffer. The retentate containing RNA-protein complexes (in 50 μl) was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Counts from samples containing hnRNP-E1 reflected total binding, and those from samples containing BSA reflected nonspecific binding. Specific binding for each concentration of radioligand was determined by subtracting the values of nonspecific binding from those of total binding. The KD was calculated from a Scatchard plot (26Motulsky H. Christopoulos A. Fitting Models to Biological Data Using Linear and Nonlinear Regression. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, New York2004: 296-338Google Scholar) using GraphPad Prism 4 from GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA). The binding affinity of 35S-labeled 18-base FR-α mRNA cis-element and purified recombinant GST-hnRNP-E1 in the presence of various thiol amino acids was also determined to compare the influence of l-cysteine and l-homocysteine on the KD of this RNA-protein interaction (Table 1).TABLE 1Comparison of the dissociation constants (KD) reflecting the binding affinity of 35S-labeled 18-base FR-α mRNA cis-element and purified recombinant GST-hnRNP-E1 in the presence of various concentrations of thiol amino acidsThiolKDp valuenml-Cysteine (25 μm)12.42 ± 0.26l-Homocysteine (25 μm)8.11 ± 0.34p < 0.001l-Cysteine (25 μm) + l-homocysteine (25 μm)7.52 ± 0.29l-Cysteine (25 μm) + l-homocysteine (100 μm)3.21 ± 0.23p < 0.001 Open table in a new tab XhoI-linearized pSPTFR (0.5 μg/reaction) was added to the transcription mixture and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. After adding 1 μl of N-ethylmaleimide (to achieve a final concentration of 2 mm) for 15 min, 1 μl of dl- or l-homocysteine (to achieve final concentrations of 0–100 μm), 8 μl of transcription reaction mixture, and 1.6 μl of [35S]methionine were added to 38.4 μl of the translation mixture followed by incubation for 1 h at 30 °C and analysis of the translation product by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The pXL37 plasmid DNA and pYST19 plasmid DNA were both linearized first by EcoRI. After inclusion of [α-35S]UTP in each transcription reaction, transcripts containing 35S-labeled antisense RNA to 18-base FR-α mRNA cis-element or 35S-labeled antisense RNA to 19-base 15-lipoxygenase mRNA cis-element were purified. HeLa-IU1-HF cells cultured at ∼80% confluence in 100-mm plates were treated for 2 h at 37 °C in MEM-HF (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) containing increasing concentrations of l-homocysteine (0, 12.5, 25, and 50 μm). After removal of medium, the plates (20 plates for each l-homocysteine concentration) were irradiated once at 120 mJ/cm2 in a UV Stratalinker 1800 cross-linker set at auto-cross-link mode (Stratagene) with the cover off to enable RNA-binding proteins to cross-link bound RNA (27Ule J. Jensen K. Mele A. Darnell R.B. Methods. 2005; 37: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The cells were then harvested, and those from each concentration of l-homocysteine used were pooled and centrifuged at 1000 × g, and pellets were frozen at −80 °C. The cross-linked RNA·hnRNP-E1 protein complexes from S-100 cytosolic proteins derived from these cell pellets were then isolated (11Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and specifically immunoprecipitated using anti-hnRNP-E1 antiserum (described below). The pellets from these immunoprecipitates were then treated with 100 μl of RNase A (1:5000 dilution) for 15 min and washed four times with 1 ml of Buffer A (11Sun X.L. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25539-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (The addition of RNase led to cleavage of RNA that was not protected through direct cross-linking with hnRNP-E1.) The pellet was finally resuspended in 0.2 ml of Proteinase K (4 mg/ml), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h on a shaker. (This step led to the release of small RNA fragments that were originally cross-linked to hnRNP-E1 in response to various concentrations of l-homocysteine (27Ule J. Jensen K. Mele A. Darnell R.B. Methods. 2005; 37: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).) Next, extraction of these small RNA fragments was carried out using the PureLink microRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). The supernatant (control) sample to which non-immune serum had been added was also treated similarly. The final concentration of total extracted cellular RNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE), which allowed measurement of RNA concentration in a volume of 1 μl. Whereas a sufficient amount of small RNA fragments (for slot blot hybridization) was recovered from the anti-hnRNP-E1 antiserum-treated sample, the RNA concentration of non-immune serum-treated sample was undetectable. Equal amounts (maximum of 100 ng) of small RNA fragments that originally reacted with hnRNP-E1 in response to l-homocysteine were isolated, as described above, together with control plasmids containing the cDNAs of either 18-base sense FR-α cis-element, 19-base 15-lipoxygenase cis-element, or HPV-16 L2 cis-element were transferred to Nylon Membranes using a Hybri-SlotTM Manifold (BRL Invitrogen). In addition, the entire sample representing RNA that was eluted from non-immune serum samples was also transferred to nylon membranes. After UV cross-linking of transferred RNA to the membrane (27Ule J. Jensen K. Mele A. Darnell R.B. Methods. 2005; 37: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), these were tested for hybridization with 35S-labeled antisense probes to either the 18-base FR-α mRNA cis-element or the 19-base 15-lipoxygenase mRNA cis-element (28Waggoner S.A. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7055-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes for RNA cross-linking were wet in 1× TBE buffer before insertion into Stratagene hybridization tubes. Then 20 ml of hybridization buffer (6% SDS, 200 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) was added, and prehybridization was carried out at 60 °C for 2 h in a hybridization oven, followed by the addition of relevant probes and incubation at 60 °C overnight. The blots were washed sequentially three times with 25 ml of prewarmed 2× SSC buffer at 60 °C for 20 min, followed by 25 ml of prewarmed 1× SSC buffer at 60 °C for 20 min before autoradiography and densitometric scanning analysis. Prior studies have employed RNAi to reduce hnRNP-E1/PCBP1 in Huh7 cells (29Shi H. Bencze K.Z. Stemmler T.L. Philpott C.C. Science. 2008; 320: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Because HeLa-IU1-HF cells have a basal expression rate of FR that is further increased by l-homocysteine at the translational level (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we transfected these cells with siRNA directed against hnRNP-E1/PCBP1 mRNA (29Shi H. Bencze K.Z. Stemmler T.L. Philpott C.C. Science. 2008; 320: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and a non-targeted scrambled RNA sequence (from Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, when the hnRNP-E1 mRNA level was reduced by 72%, we assessed the biosynthesis of newly synthesized hnRNP-E1 and FR (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a second set of experiments, the same procedure was followed, except that 2 h before assessment of the biosynthesis of FR, cells were treated with 50 μm l-homocysteine. Briefly, HeLa-IU1-HF cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated in 6-well dishes with 1.5 × 105 cells in serum-free MEM-HF. Transfection using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX was carried out on the second day, when cells achieved a confluence of ∼30%, by following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). This transfection reaction mixture, containing either 180 nm siRNA duplex or scrambled control and 5 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX in a final volume of 500 μl of Opti-MEM, was first incubated at 22 °C for 30 min and then added to cells containing 2.5 ml of MEM-HF at 37 °C. After 6 h, the medium was replaced with MEM-HF, and incubation continued until cells were harvested on each day until the fifth day. RNA isolated from these cells was tested by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine the extent of hnRNP-E1 mRNA inhibition. The hnRNP-E1 mRNA level was determined by qRT-PCR using the primers 5′-GGATATGCTGCCCAACTCCA-3′ and 5-Carboxyfluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 5′-GACGCCGGAGACTGGGAGAGCG5C-3′ (Invitrogen). Primers for a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), which was labeled with 6-Carboxy-4′,5′-dichloro-2′,7′-dimethoxyfluorescein (Invitrogen) and used as the internal control, were run in parallel to standardize the input. In other experiments, hnRNP-E2 mRNA levels were also determined on various days by qRT-PCR following transfection of HeLa-IU1-HF cells with siRNA against hnRNP-E1 mRNA (supplemental Fig. S4). qRT-PCR was performed on a TaqMan ABI 7900HT sequence detection system (PE Biosystems, Forest City, CA) using the SuperScript III Platinum one-step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Cycle conditions were as follows. After the first step of 15 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, samples were cycled 40 times at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 60 s. For all quantitative analyses, we used the comparative CT method using instructions from PE Biosystems. All PCRs were performed in triplicate for at least three independent studies. Controls consisting of RNase-free water were negative in all runs. The biosynthesis of FR was assessed on the second day after transfection of siRNA directed against hnRNP-E1 mRNA or non-targeted scrambled RNA sequence (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were starved overnight in cysteine-free MEM-HF and exposed to 2 ml of cysteine-free medium either without or with 50 μm l-homocysteine for 2 h the next day. Cells were then pulsed with 100 μCi of l-[35S]cysteine in 1 ml of cysteine-free MEM-HF/well and harvested at various times (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h), and the biosynthetic rate of FR was assessed after immunoprecipitation using anti-FR antiserum (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar methods were also employed to evaluate the biosynthesis of hnRNP-E1 using anti-hnRNP-E1 antiserum (12Xiao X. Tang Y.S. Mackins J.Y. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Hansen D.K. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41510-41517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) substituted for anti-FR antiserum (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We determined if less l-[35S]homocysteine was bound to hnRNP-E1 isolated from cells stably propagated in low folate medium (HeLa-IU1-LF cells) (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) compared with cells in high folate medium (HeLa-IU1-HF cells), where endogenous cellular homocysteine was lower (i.e. 126 μm versus 47 μm, respectively) (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our anti-hnRNP-E1 peptide antiserum (12Xiao X. Tang Y.S. Mackins J.Y. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Hansen D.K. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41510-41517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) developed against the hnRNP-E1 peptide sequence SLAQYLINARLSSEKGMGC contained shared sequences (underlined) with hnRNP-E2 (a closely related protein with 83% homology in its total amino acid sequence), predicting that this antiserum would recognize shared epitopes in both proteins, which are expressed in these HeLa cells (30Fujimura K. Katahira J. Kano F. Yoneda Y. Murata M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 878-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Indeed, Western blots of cytosolic S-100 fractions of HeLa-IU1 cells using this antiserum (see Fig. 5B) confirmed a major band corresponding to hnRNP-E1 and a minor band corresponding to hnRNP-E2 (and no other contaminant proteins); this pattern was not dissimilar to the doublet found on SDS-PAGE of hnRNP-E1 isolated from human placenta (12Xiao X. Tang Y.S. Mackins J.Y. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Hansen D.K. Antony A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41510-41517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or Western blots of rat brain probed with anti-hnRNP-E1 and -E2 antiserum (31Thyagarajan A. Szaro B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49680-49688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because there was no change in the expression of hnRNP-E1 per mg of cytosolic (S-100 fraction) proteins from HeLa-IU1-HF and HeLa-IU1-LF cells on Western blots (Fig. 5B) and Northwestern blots (24Antony A.C. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), this allowed for direct comparison of the amount of l-[35S]homocysteine bound to hnRNP-E1 (and hnRNP-E2) between these cells. Moreover, because all cytosolic S-100 fractions were routinely sequentially pre-exposed to IgGsorb (a 10% suspension of formalin fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells bearing protein A) to remove nonspecific bound proteins that interacted with this matrix and then to non-immune serum followed by IgGsorb, the fraction of l-[35S]homocysteine that was specifically bound to hnRNP-E1 (and hnRNP-E2) was the difference in values obtained when aliquots of the samples were finally incubated with either anti-hnRNP-E1 antiserum followed by IgGsorb or non-immune serum followed by IgGsorb. Briefly, cytosolic S-100 fraction (25 μg) from ∼80% confluent HeLa-IU1-HF or HeLa-IU1-LF cells was incubated with 100 μm l-[35S]homocysteine in 100 μl of binding buffer. These S-100 fractions are identified as “in vitro” (Fig. 5A) to distinguish them from other “in vivo” studies that involved the addition of 100 μm l-[35S]homocysteine in 4 ml of medium to 3 × 106 intact HeLa-IU1-HF or HeLa-IU1-LF cells cultured to ∼80% confluence. Following incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and exten"
https://openalex.org/W1987340426,"Tumour-initiating cells (TICs) are rare cancer cells isolated from tumours of different origins including high-grade tumours that sustain neoplasic progression and development of metastatic disease. They harbour deregulated stem cells pathways and exhibit an unchecked ability to self-renew, a property essential for tumour progression. Among the essential factors maintaining embryonic stem (ES) cells properties, OCT-4 (also known as POU5F1) has been detected in tumours of different origins. Although ectopic expression results in dysplasic growth restricted to epithelial tissues, overexpression expands the proportion of immature cells in teratomas. However, OCT-4-expressing cells have not been purified from spontaneously occurring tumours, thus information concerning their properties is rather scant. Here, using p53−/− mice expressing green fluorescent protein and the puromycin resistance gene under the control of the Oct-4 promoter, we show that OCT-4 is expressed in 5% onwards of the undifferentiated tumour cell populations derived from different organs. OCT-4 expression was low as compared with ES cells, but was associated with a ‘stemness’ signature and expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. These cells displayed cancer stem cell features, including increased self-renewal and differentiation ability in vitro and in vivo. They not only formed allografts containing immature bone regions but also disseminated into different organs, including lung, liver and bone. Experiments based on RNA interference revealed that Oct-4 expression drives both their engraftment and metastasis formation. This work points out the crucial contribution of Oct-4-expressing TICs in the hierarchical organization of the malignant potential, leading to metastasis formation. Consequently, it provides an appropriate model to develop novel therapies aiming to strike down TICs by targeting self-renewal genes, therefore efficient to reduce tumour growth and metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2088602682,"Cellular senescence is important for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and has recently been shown to pose a natural barrier to tumorigenesis. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, E6AP, has been linked to a number of protein regulators of the cell cycle as well as the cellular stress response. We therefore explored the role of E6AP in the cellular response to stress. We found that mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking E6AP escape replicative senescence, as well as Ras-induced senescence associated with impaired markers. E6AP-deficient MEFs exhibit a range of transformed phenotypes: these include the ability to grow under stress conditions (such as low serum and DNA damage), enhanced proliferation, anchorage independent growth and enhanced growth of xenografts in mice. The transformed phenotype of E6AP-deficient MEFs is associated with lower basal and stress-induced accumulation of p53. Overall, our study implicates E6AP as an important regulator of the cellular response to stress, in particular through the regulation of replicative and oncogene-induced senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1968811807,"PRELID1, the only late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) domain-containing protein in humans, exerts cytoprotective effects through its LEA domain within the mitochondria. Although PRELID1 homologs in vertebrates contain the LEA domain, homologs in lower eukaryotes are thought to lack this domain. In this study, we identify a novel LEA-like domain in a yeast PRELID1 homolog, Ups2p, which contains sequence conservation with the LEA domain of human PRELID1. PRELID1 homologs, including Ups2p, are known to contain the PRELI/MSF1 domain. Our study reveals that the MSF1 domain of Ups2p maintains proper mitochondrial electron transport chain function, respiratory competency, and mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine metabolism. The Ups2p MSF1 domain mediates cardiolipin depletion in the absence of Ups1p. However, the Ups2p LEA-like domain is responsible for cardiolipin depletion resulting from UPS2 overexpression. The regulation of phosphatidylethanolamine levels by the MSF1 domain is antagonized by the Ups2p LEA-like domain. We demonstrate that the yeast LEA-like domain protects cells from oxidative stress and can be functionally replaced by the human LEA domain. Together our studies suggest distinct roles of MSF1 and LEA-like domains in mitochondrial function and resistance to oxidative stress."

Furthermore, constitutively active EhRho1 induces actin stress fiber formation in mammalian fibroblasts, thereby identifying it as a functional Rho family GTPase. EhRho1 exhibits a fast rate of nucleotide exchange relative to mammalian Rho GTPases due to a distinctive switch one isoleucine residue reminiscent of the constitutively active F28L mutation in human Cdc42, which for the latter protein, is sufficient for cellular transformation. Nonconserved, nucleotide-interacting residues within EhRho1, revealed by the crystal structure models, were observed to contribute a moderating influence on fast spontaneous nucleotide exchange.
