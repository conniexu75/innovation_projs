https://openalex.org/W1591881963,"The promoter of the murine gene encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) contains an NF-kappa B site beginning 55 base pairs upstream of the TATA box, designated NF-kappa Bd. Reporter constructs containing truncated promoter regions, when transfected into macrophages, revealed that NF-kappa Bd is necessary to confer inducibility by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Oligonucleotide probes containing NF-kappa Bd plus the downstream 9 or 47 base pairs bound proteins that rapidly appeared in the nuclei of LPS-treated macrophages. The nuclear proteins bound to both probes in an NF-kappa Bd-dependent manner, but binding was resistant to cycloheximide only for the shorter probe. The proteins binding both probes reacted with antibodies against p50 and c-rel but not RelB; those binding the shorter probe also reacted with anti-RelA (p65). Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, which acts as a specific inhibitor of NF-kappa B, blocked both the activation of the NF-kappa Bd-binding proteins and the production of NO in LPS-treated macrophages. Thus, activation of NF-kappa B/Rel is critical in the induction of iNOS by LPS. However, additional, newly synthesized proteins contribute to the NF-kappa Bd-dependent transcription factor complex on the iNOS promoter in LPS-treated mouse macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1983960385,"The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) initiates signals by interacting with cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) through a 17-residue sequence motif [called the antigen recognition activation motif (ARAM)] that is contained in the TCR zeta and CD3 chains. TCR stimulation induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular substrates, including the ARAMs. Lck kinase activity is required for phosphorylation of two conserved tyrosine residues in an ARAM. This phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of a second cytoplasmic PTK, ZAP-70, through both of the ZAP-70 Src homology 2 domains and its phosphorylation. Thus, TCR signal transduction is initiated by the sequential interaction of two PTKs with TCR ARAMs."

https://openalex.org/W2014954180,"Encounters with antigen can stimulate T cells to become activated and proliferate, become nonresponsive to antigen, or to die. T cell death was shown to be a physiological response to interleukin-2-stimulated cell cycling and T cell receptor reengagement at high antigen doses. This feedback regulatory mechanism attenuates the immune response by deleting a portion of newly dividing, antigen-reactive T cells. This mechanism deleted autoreactive T cells and abrogated the clinical and pathological signs of autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice after repetitive administration of myelin basic protein."
https://openalex.org/W2012038403,"L-Glutamate and norepinephrine are examples of a major excitatory neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator in the cerebral cortex, respectively. Little is known of how chemical signaling between the anatomically distinct chemical pathways occurs. Specific activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) class of glutamate receptor in synaptosomal preparations from guinea pig cerebral cortex caused release of both of these chemicals, and this release was blocked by agents that inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production or remove NO from the extracellular space. Furthermore, neurotransmitter release correlated with cortical NO production after NMDA receptor stimulation. These results suggest that NO production and its extracellular movement may be links in the pathway from NMDA receptor activation to changes in chemical signaling in surrounding synaptic terminals in the cerebral cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1974424738,"The diversity of known glutamate-gated channels has been markedly increased by the discovery of multiple subunits and their spliced and edited variants. These subunits can potentially form different oligomeric complexes with diverging properties. A crucial question is therefore to determine the actual subunit composition of naturally occurring glutamate receptors. We have coupled patch-clamp recordings and reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification to correlate the presence of mRNAs for each subunit and the functional properties of native glutamate receptors at the single-cell level. In a homogeneous population of functionally identified hippocampal neurons (type 11) in culture bearing a glutamate receptor of the AMPA subtype with a high calcium permeability, we found that, among the multiple subunits, only two, the flop forms of GIuR1 and GluR4, were expressed. In particular, GIuR2 was never detected. This composition explains the uncommon properties of AMPA receptors in type 11 neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1942718916,"JAK family tyrosine kinases have recently been implicated in intracellular signal transduction by transmembrane cytokine receptors of the interferon (IFN) and hematopoietin receptor families. Using the prolactin (PRL)-dependent rat pre-T cell line Nb2, a PRL receptor-associated, candidate tyrosine kinase of 120-130 kDa was recently characterized (1). In the present work this protein is identified as JAK2, based upon reciprocal anti-JAK2 and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. JAK2 underwent rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation in response to receptor activation, reaching peak levels within 5 min of exposure to 100 nM PRL at 37 degrees C. In vitro tyrosine kinase assays using either [gamma-32P]ATP and autoradiography or unlabeled ATP combined with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, demonstrated that the activity of JAK2 was stimulated by PRL. Phosphoamino acid analysis of JAK2 after in vitro tyrosine kinase assay revealed that the majority of phosphate was incorporated into tyrosine residues. Furthermore, JAK2 was associated with PRL receptors to a comparable extent before and after PRL binding, as demonstrated by anti-receptor immunoprecipitation and subsequent anti-JAK2 immunoblotting. We propose that binding of ligand to the PRL receptor activates preassociated JAK2, and that this enzyme generates the initial signal in the intracellular communication cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2000626734,"mRNAs for AMPA- and kainate-preferring glutamate receptor subunits are expressed abundantly in the CNS, yet functional studies of neurons and glia from brain suggest selective expression of AMPA receptors. We now show that glial cells of the O-2A lineage express rapidly desensitizing responses to kainate, mRNAs for GluR6, GluR7, KA-1, and KA-2, rapidly desensitizing responses to AMPA, and mRNAs for GluR-B, -C, and -D. Analysis of glutamate receptor currents in single cells reveals two receptor populations with high and low affinity for kainate and different sensitivity for potentiation by concanavalin A and for block of desensitization by cyclothiazide. Our experiments describe the characterization of native kainate-preferring receptors in glia and reveal coexpression in single cells of functional AMPA- and kainate-preferring receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1545383294,"Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis in mouse macrophages occurs by a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway (Greenberg, S., Chang, P., and Silverstein, S.C. (1993) J. Exp. Med. 177, 529-534). To identify proteins that are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues during phagocytosis, we used anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to perform immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation of lysates derived from Fc receptor-stimulated macrophages. Proteins of 26, 30, 35, 37, 40, 43, 47, 56, 60, 68, 83, 116, and 150 kDa displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation during Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was not a consequence of actin polymerization since treatment with cytochalasin D did not alter the pattern of Fc receptor-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The 68-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein was identified as paxillin, a cytoskeletal-associated tyrosine kinase substrate previously identified in fibroblasts and shown to localize to focal adhesions (Turner, C.E., Glenney, J.R., and Burridge, K. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 111, 1059-1068). Paxillin colocalized with F-actin beneath nascent phagosomes. In addition to the above proteins detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, the gamma subunit of FcRI and III was shown to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation during Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Of several candidate tyrosine kinases that may be activated during Fc receptor stimulation, p72syk, but not p125FAK, displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation during Fc receptor aggregation. The coordinated tyrosine phosphorylation of the gamma subunit of macrophage Fc receptors, the tyrosine kinase syk, and the cytoskeletal-associated protein, paxillin, may be important steps in integrating signals between Fc receptors and the underlying cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1587138541,"Agonist-induced cytosolic Ca2+ (Ca2+i) signals begin as apical-to-basal Ca2+i waves in pancreatic acinar cells and in other polarized epithelia. However, the basis of this polarized Ca2+i signaling pattern is unknown. Here we use immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that the type 3 inositol trisphosphate receptor is localized to the extreme apex of pancreatic acinar cells, the region which corresponds to the trigger zone from which Ca2+i signals originate in this cell type (Kasai, H., Li, Y.X., and Miyashita, Y. (1993) Cell 74, 669-677). We also show that inositol trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release induces amylase release from permeabilized pancreatic acini. Since Ca2+i signals begin by inositol trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release, these findings suggest that localization of the type 3 inositol trisphosphate receptor to the trigger zone is responsible for the generation of apical-to-basal Ca2+i waves, and that this organization may be important for regulating apical exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells."

https://openalex.org/W1487173514,"Sulfatides have been established recently as ligands for L-selectin, and we investigated whether they trigger transmembrane signals through ligation of L-selectin. We found that sulfatides trigger the increase of cytosolic free calcium in neutrophils and that this effect was strictly dependent on sulfation of the galactose ring, as non-sulfated galactocerebrosides were not stimulatory. Chymotrypsin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of neutrophils caused shedding of L-selectin, but not of class I major histocompatibility complex antigens or beta 2 integrins, and blunted the capability of neutrophils to respond to sulfatides with an increase of cytosolic free calcium. Four different anti-L-selectin antibodies (DREG-200, LAM1/3, LAM1/6, and LAM1/10), but not four control antibodies directed against different surface molecules of neutrophils, also triggered an increase of cytosolic free calcium. The anti-L-selectin antibodies were stimulatory both if used in a soluble form, after cross-linking with anti-mouse F(ab')2 fragments, and immobilized to protein A of Staphylococcus aureus through the Fc fragment. With immobilized antibodies, an increase of cytosolic free calcium was found also by plating neutrophils on antibodies bound to protein A-coated coverslips and monitoring the increase of cytosolic free calcium by fluorescence microscopy. Both sulfatides and anti-L-selectin antibody effects were not inhibited by pertussis toxin, thus indicating that a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein was not involved in signal transduction. Sulfatides also triggered an increase of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 mRNAs in neutrophils. Also to act as stimuli of cytokine mRNA expression, sulfatides required sulfation of the galactose ring, as non-sulfated galactocerebrosides were not stimulatory, and depended on expression of L-selectin, as shedding of this molecules induced by chymotrypsin blunted their effects. These findings suggest that L-selectin can transduce signals activating selective cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1528378220,"Mouse sperm contain a major phosphotyrosine-containing protein of M(r) 95,000 (nonreducing conditions) which has been implicated as a sperm membrane receptor for the egg zona pellucida glycoprotein, ZP3 (Leyton, L., and Saling, P. (1989) Cell 57, 1123-1130; Leyton, L., LeGuen, P., Bunch, D., and Saling, P. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 11692-11695). This protein was purified and subjected to limited tryptic digestion and subsequent amino acid analysis. Three sequenced peptides revealed 100% amino acid identity to a mouse hepatoma hexokinase (Arora, K. K., Fanciulli, M., and Pederson, P. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6481-6488). The purified protein, which migrated at M(r) 116,000 under reducing conditions (p95/116), reacted with an antiserum to the purified rat brain hexokinase, type 1, and comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the purified rat brain enzyme under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. Unlike p95/116, the rat brain enzyme was not a phosphotyrosine-containing protein. The p95/116 protein could be immunoprecipitated with the hexokinase antiserum or an O-phosphotyrosine antibody. Limited tryptic digestion of the purified p95/116 and the rat brain enzyme generated subsets of identical peptides which reacted with the hexokinase antiserum. However, p95/116 also contained phosphotyrosine-containing peptides that were not present in the rat brain hexokinase. When different mouse tissues were probed with the hexokinase antiserum all tissues, with the exception of liver, contained immunoreactive protein. In contrast, only sperm and testis possessed a phosphotyrosine-containing form of hexokinase. These data suggest that the germ cell component of the testis possesses a unique tyrosine-phosphorylated form of hexokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1539475327,"Signaling mechanisms leading to regulation of gene transcription by growth hormone (GH) and other molecules that signal via the cytokine receptor family have been elusive. Based upon recent findings that GH and interferons activate JAK family tyrosine kinases, we have identified a novel signaling pathway leading from the GH receptor to the nucleus. We report that in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, GH stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of a protein recognized by antibody to p91, a component of DNA-binding complexes that are activated by tyrosyl phosphorylation in response to interferons alpha and gamma. In addition, a GH-inducible DNA binding factor (GHIF) is identified that binds to the c-sis-inducible element of the c-fos promoter. GHIF contains a protein antigenically related to p91 and is tyrosyl-phosphorylated. These findings indicate that in signaling between their receptors and the nucleus, GH and interferons utilize related or identical components, including JAK family tyrosine kinases and proteins in the p91 family. When combined with recent findings that many members of the cytokine receptor family activate JAK kinases, including some cytokines that activate p91-related proteins, these findings suggest that signaling pathways involving JAK kinases and p91 family members may be broadly distributed."
https://openalex.org/W1505478389,"A novel lipoxygenase cDNA (3,007 base pairs) was isolated from rice leaves (Oryza sativa cv. Aichiasahi) which had been infected with an incompatible race of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. A single copy of the gene is present in the rice genome and encodes a protein of 923 residues with a molecular weight of 102,714. This gene product shares the least amino acid sequence homology among plant lipoxygenases identified to date. A novel feature of this gene product is a putative transit peptide sequence at the amino terminus, suggesting the enzyme is localized in chloroplasts. An active lipoxygenase was expressed from the cDNA in Escherichia coli and characterized. The lipoxygenase introduces molecular oxygen exclusively into the C-13 position of linoleic and linolenic acids. The gene is expressed at high levels 15 h after inoculation with an incompatible race of M. grisea, at a low level after inoculation with a compatible race of the pathogen, and is not expressed in mock-infected leaves. Gene expression begins at the same time that the pathogen begins to penetrate into leaf tissue. This novel lipoxygenase gene expression is a part of the early response of the host to pathogenic attack."
https://openalex.org/W1593199101,"Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, and steel factor induce proliferation of hematopoietic cells through binding to specific, high affinity, cell surface receptors. However, little is known about post-receptor signal transduction pathways. Here we report that an SH2 domain containing protein previously implicated in the activation of p21ras, Shc, is transiently tyrosine phosphorylated in myeloid cells after stimulation with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, or steel factor. Also, Shc was found to be constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in myeloid cell lines made factor independent by expression of p210BCR/ABL. A Shc-associated 140-kDa protein was identified, which was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues transiently after cytokine stimulation and constitutively after expression of p210BCR/ABL. These findings suggest that Shc could play an important role in a signal transduction pathway, which leads to the proliferation of myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1602819342,"The mechanism by which cAMP inhibits growth factor-induced DNA synthesis in fibroblasts is not understood. Here we show that in Rat-1 fibroblasts, cAMP-raising agents inhibit p21ras-mediated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation induced by either epidermal growth factor or lysophosphatidic acid. Under the same conditions, however, epidermal growth factor- or lysophosphatidic acid-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, Ca2+ mobilization, and activation of Na+/H+ exchange are not attenuated. In ras-transformed Rat-1 cells, 8-bromo-cAMP rapidly deactivates constitutively active MAP kinase without reducing p21ras.GTP levels; long term 8-bromo-cAMP treatment of these cells leads to growth arrest and reversion of the transformed phenotype. These results show that elevation of intracellular cAMP levels abrogates the p21ras MAP kinase pathway at a step downstream of p21ras activation. This finding provides a molecular basis for the growth-inhibitory action of cAMP in normal and transformed fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1559986791,"Regulation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells was investigated. Both TRH and epidermal growth factor (EGF) acutely activated this enzyme, via tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation. Down-regulation of cellular protein kinase C (PKC) only partly inhibited the phosphorylation of MAP kinase by TRH, suggesting both PKC-dependent and -independent pathways. Both TRH and EGF similarly increased the phosphorylation of raf-1, by a PKC-independent mechanism. Both TRH and EGF stimulated the formation of a ras-GTP complex. This activation of ras by growth factors is thought to involve the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. EGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of three Shc proteins and their subsequent association with its receptor. TRH stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 52-kDa Shc protein, although neither phorbol esters nor the calcium ionophore A23187 had any effect, indicating that this effect of TRH was not dependent on PKC. Both TRH and EGF induced the association of tyrosine phosphorylated Shc proteins with a fusion protein containing SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2, another important component in ras activation. These results provide evidence that MAP kinase is acutely activated by TRH through a PKC-dependent pathway as well as a second pathway possibly involving tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1595612667,"Activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is a common sequel to tyrosine kinase activation and appears to be essential for tyrosine kinases to induce proliferation. Since multiple hemopoietic growth factors activate tyrosine kinases, we investigated whether these growth factors activate PI 3-kinase. We show that interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and steel factor (SLF) all activate PI 3-kinase. These cytokines increased the amount of PI 3-kinase activity that could be immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies from the MC-9 mast cell line or from the hemopoietic progenitor cell line FDC-P1. Increases in this assay frequently correlate with PI 3-kinase activation in vivo. To determine directly whether these factors activate PI 3-kinase in vivo, we measured the levels of 3-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids in intact 32P-labeled MC-9 cells. IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, and SLF all caused increased synthesis of the PI 3-kinase products phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate with a relative potency of SLF >> IL-3 > IL-5, GM-CSF > IL-4. In contrast, IL-4 caused the largest increase in the in vitro anti-phosphotyrosine immune complex PI 3-kinase assay. Thus, the in vitro assay does not accurately reflect in vivo activation of PI 3-kinase. Cytokine treatment did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of either the 85-kDa regulatory subunit or the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase and is therefore not required for activation of PI 3-kinase by these factors. Cytokine treatment did induce PI 3-kinase to associate with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in a cytokine-specific manner. PI 3-kinase associated with c-kit after SLF stimulation, a 170-kDa protein after IL-4 stimulation, and a 70-kDa protein after treatment with IL-3 or GM-CSF. Thus, multiple hemopoietic growth factors that act through different types of receptors activate PI 3-kinase in vivo and induce factor-specific interactions of PI 3-kinase with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1608624851,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent endogenous vasodilator of large blood vessels but its role in the physiological and pathological control of the human microcirculation is not known. This study was designed to assess whether NO contributes to the control of blood flow in the human skin microcirculation in vivo. Local changes in blood flow were measured in the forearm skin microcirculation of normal volunteers. The responses to agents injected intradermally were assessed with a laser Doppler flow probe. NO was generated in local areas of skin by the injection of the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside. Endogenous NO was generated by the injection of acetylcholine and the exposure of skin to ultraviolet light (UVB) to stimulate the constitutive and inducible forms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), respectively. The skin microvasculature was comparatively insensitive to exogenous NO derived from the NO donor sodium nitroprusside, being 10,000-fold more sensitive to the vasodilator prostaglandin PGE2 (P < 0.001). However, the rapid onset, dose-dependent local vasodilation caused by acetylcholine was blocked by the NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, L-NMMA (P < 0.05), but not by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. The delayed local blood flow response to UVB was attenuated by either L-NMMA or indomethacin (P < 0.05 in each case). The UVB response was abolished by a combination of L-NMMA and indomethacin or by local, topical corticosteroid treatment (P < 0.01 in each case). This study indicates that NO increases blood flow in the human microcirculation in vivo. NOS inhibition attenuated both the rapid blood flow response to acetylcholine and the delayed response to UVB. Both NOS and cyclooxygenase contributed to the erythema response to UVB, and dual inhibition of both enzymes would explain the mechanism of action of the corticosteroid in this model of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1488724125,"We have examined the involvement of insulin receptor (IR) substrate-1 (IRS-1) and/or Shc in the upstream of Ras activation in insulin signaling using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines overexpressing wild-type (CHO-IR) cells) or mutant insulin receptors. In CHO-IR cells, insulin rapidly phosphorylated IRS-1 and Shc at tyrosine residues and stimulated the formation of the active GTP-bound Ras (Ras.GTP). In contrast, a CHO cell line overexpressing the kinase-negative mutant insulin receptor substituting Arg1018 for Lys1018 was unable to tyrosine-phosphorylate IRS-1 and Shc and failed to activate Ras in response to insulin. A CHO cell line overexpressing the mutant insulin receptor, substituting Ala960 for Tyr960 and which was known to exhibit impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and biological effects evoked by insulin, showed severely impaired insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and moderately impaired activation of Ras. Another cell line overexpressing the mutant insulin receptor, lacking 82 amino acids of the C terminus of beta-subunit and which was recently reported to retain normal insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, showed slightly impaired Ras activation at 10(-7) M insulin with severely reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc protein. Furthermore, insulin did not induce the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and Shc in CHO-IR cells. These results suggest that Shc and IRS-1 lie in the separate signaling pathways and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 with or without some low level of Shc phosphorylation may be enough to stimulate the submaximal accumulation of Ras.GTP complex and may need synergistically the higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc to induce the full activation of Ras in insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1524668340,"Rat-1 fibroblasts stably overexpressing high levels of human insulin receptor were used as a model system to study the effects of hyperglycemia on insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRK) activity and protein kinase C (PKC) translocation in parallel in the intact cell. Glucose (10-25 mM) induced a significant reduction of IRK activity (tyrosine phosphorylation of IR-beta-subunit and IR-substrate-1) within 10 min. This effect was paralleled by a rapid translocation of several PKC isoforms (cPKC alpha, nPKC delta, nPKC epsilon, nPKC zeta) to the plasma membrane within 1 min. Kinetics of IRK inhibition and PKC translocation are consistent with the idea that the glucose effect on IRK is mediated by PKC activation. This hypothesis is supported by further observations. Addition of the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 can prevent the effect of glucose on IRK. Inhibition of IRK is also observed after stimulation of the cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which can substitute for a physiological activator of PKC. Glucose (25 mM) increases the 32P incorporation in serine residues of the beta-subunit of IRK. We conclude that high levels of glucose induce inhibition of IRK in vivo. There is indirect evidence that this effect is mediated by a glucose-induced PKC translocation/activation and serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1504842322,"Human alpha 2-macroglobulin is a broad-spectrum, homotetrameric antiproteinase that can maximally bind up to two proteinase molecules in a ternary complex. Proteinases cleave the inhibitor within a peptide stretch termed the bait region and induce the emergence of internal thiol esters whose nucleophilic scission precede a major conformational change which entraps enzymes within molecular cages. In a previous study, leukocyte-generated hypohalous acids and N-haloamines were identified as the first examples of physiologically relevant inactivators of the antiproteolytic activity of alpha 2-macroglobulin (Reddy, V. Y., Pizzo, S. V., and Weiss, S. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13801-13809), but the mechanisms whereby the oxidants damaged the inhibitor remained undefined. We now demonstrate that N-chloramines (RNCl) destroy the antiproteolytic activity of alpha 2-macroglobulin in an unusual biphasic process that results in the formation of inactive alpha 2-macroglobulin half-molecules. In the first phase, 8 eq of RNCl reacted with each alpha 2-macroglobulin subunit to generate a partially oxidized antiproteinase containing 8 methionyl sulfoxide residues/monomer. Structure-function analyses demonstrated that the oxidized inhibitor retained its homotetrameric structure as well as its ability to entrap proteinases. In marked contrast, the oxidation of an additional 6 methionyl residues and a single tryptophanyl residue fractured the alpha 2 M homotetramer across its non-covalent axis into two pairs of disulfide-linked dimers. Despite the fact that the oxidized dimers displayed normal bait regions whose cleavage by proteinases initiated thiol ester scission, all antiproteolytic activity was lost. Furthermore, the oxidized dimers were unable to undergo the critical conformational changes normally associated with bait region cleavage or thiol ester scission. Together, these results demonstrate that chlorinated oxidants destroy the antiproteolytic activity of alpha 2-macroglobulin by attacking a subset of methionyl and tryptophanyl residues whose oxidation mediates the dissociation of the native homotetramer into conformationally locked dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1555431201,"The mechanisms of signaling pathways shared by interleukin (IL)-11, IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and oncostatin M (ONC) remain elusive. We report here that treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with IL-11, IL-6, LIF, and ONC induces overlapping but distinct patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation and activates indistinguishable primary response genes. We further demonstrate for the first time that IL-11, IL-6, LIF, and ONC can trigger the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and the 85-92-kDa ribosomal S6 protein kinase (pp90rsk). In addition, our data also show that preincubation of cells with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A, but not with a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7, blocks activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and pp90rsk. Interestingly, H7, but not herbimycin A, inhibits pp90rsk activity in the in vitro kinase assays. These results suggest that pp90rsk is one of the potential candidates for the H7-sensitive protein kinase(s), which is critical for the activation of primary response genes by these cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1546376686,"The integrin receptor alpha 4 beta 1 binds to two different ligands, the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin and the endothelial cell surface protein vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Using probes derived from each ligand and a variety of cell adhesion and ligand-receptor binding assays, we have investigated the relationship between the mechanisms of fibronectin and VCAM-1 interaction with alpha 4 beta 1. CS1 peptide, which represents the dominant active site from the HepII/IIICS recognition domain in fibronectin, was found to inhibit VCAM-1-dependent adhesion in three different assays: MOLT-4 T lymphoblastic leukaemia cell attachment to immobilized recombinant soluble VCAM-1 (rsVCAM-1), MOLT-4 cell attachment to monolayers of VCAM-1-transfected COS-1 cells, and A375-SM melanoma cell spreading on immobilized rs VCAM-1. Half-maximal inhibition required CS1 concentrations of 1.7-3.0 mg/ml, some 3-7-fold higher than that needed to autoinhibit adhesion to CS1-IgG conjugate. Using a more sensitive solid-phase receptor-ligand binding assay, CS1 was found to be a potent inhibitor of the binding of rsVCAM-1 to alpha 4 beta 1 (half-maximal inhibition at 13 micrograms/ml). In agreement with cell-based assays, severalfold lower concentrations of CS1 were required to inhibit binding of recombinant HepII/IIICS region of fibronectin (half-maximal inhibition at 3 micrograms/ml). VCAM-1-alpha 4 beta 1 binding was blocked not only by CS1 peptide but also by the recombinant HepII/IIICS region of fibronectin. Kinetic analysis of CS1 inhibition of VCAM-1 binding revealed that it was directly competitive in nature, indicating that VCAM-1 and fibronectin recognize either identical or spatially overlapping binding sites on alpha 4 beta 1. The implications of these results for the future design of VCAM-1 antagonists are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1595934817,"The vav proto-oncogene product (p95vav) is specifically expressed in cells of the hematopoietic system, contains one Src homology 2 and two Src homology 3 domains, and is a substrate for receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Immunoblotting experiments using an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody showed that interferon alpha (IFN alpha) induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav after binding to its cell surface receptor in the U-266 human myeloma cell line. The IFN alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav was time- and dose-dependent, confirming the specificity of the process. IFN alpha-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav was also observed in other hematopoietic cell lines of B-cell origin (Daudi), T-cell origin (MOLT-4), and promyelocytic origin (HL-60). Immunoprecipitation experiments performed with 32P-labeled U-266 cells and phosphoaminoacid analysis of the bands corresponding to p95vav showed that p95vav is phosphorylated on serine residues prior to IFN alpha stimulation of the cells. After IFN alpha stimulation significant amounts of phosphorylation of p95vav on tyrosine residues were detectable. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav in U-266 and HL-60 cells was also induced by two other Type I IFNs, IFN beta and IFN omega. Altogether these data suggest that the vav proto-oncogene product is a substrate for a Type I IFN-regulated tyrosine kinase(s) and may be involved in the signal transduction pathway of Type I IFNs in hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1639729138,"Human serum macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) is a disulfide-linked heterodimer that induces motile and phagocytic activity of mouse resident peritoneal macrophages. It is a member of the family of kringle proteins, which typically exist in extracellular fluid as single chain precursors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. In this work, we expressed [35S]cysteine-labeled recombinant pro-MSP in MSP cDNA-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and studied proteolytic processing of pro-MSP and the requirement of cleavage for biological activity. In media containing heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, the protein was secreted as single chain pro-MSP, which was cleaved over a period of hours to the mature heterodimer. Cleavage was prevented by serine protease inhibitors such as leupeptin or aprotinin; it did not occur if cells were cultured in serum-free medium. Nanomolar concentrations of coagulation proteases kallikrein, factor XIIa or factor XIa cleaved pro-MSP to MSP within 30 min. Pro-MSP had no biological activity. After cleavage by kallikrein, biological activity was quantitatively comparable to that of natural MSP isolated from human plasma. These results support our hypothesis that MSP circulates as the biologically inactive precursor and can be activated by enzymes of the intrinsic coagulation cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1515234734,"The albumin multigene family encodes proteins synthesized in the liver and secreted in the serum to fulfill ligand-carrier functions. The albumin (ALB), alpha 1-fetoprotein (AFP), and vitamin D-binding protein genes are syntenic, the ALB and AFP genes are organized in tandem, and the AFP gene is selectively expressed in the fetal liver. We now report the existence of a fourth member of the albumin gene family, located 10 kilobases downstream from the AFP locus. The new gene, named alpha-albumin (alpha ALB), is selectively expressed in the liver at late stages of development. The alpha ALB mRNA sequence encodes a predicted secreted protein with the typical triple domain disulfide cross-linked structure. Comparisons of coding and promoter sequences suggest that alpha ALB could be a phylogenetic intermediate between the ALB and AFP genes. The developmental switch between alpha ALB gene activation and AFP gene repression suggests new regulatory interplays at the albumin locus and adult stage-specific ligand binding functions carried out by the alpha ALB gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1597489805,"We have examined the phosphorylation of the alpha dynein heavy chain (DHC) from the outer arm of the Chlamydomonas flagellum. Quantitative analysis indicates that this DHC is phosphorylated at a minimum of six sites. Using previously identified proteolytic and photocleavage sites (King, S. M., and Witman, G. B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9244-9255), we have mapped two regions that are phosphorylated in vivo. One is located in a 20-kDa section immediately N-terminal to the site of V1 photocleavage. Thus, this region is close to the ATP hydrolytic site and also to the predicted junction between the head and stem domains of the particle. The second encompasses the 90-kDa C-terminal region of the molecule. In this latter section, at least one site is found in an approximately 2-kDa region close to domains that are predicted to adopt a coiled-coil structure in those DHCs that have been sequenced. The alpha DHC also is specifically labeled by endogenous kinases in demembranated, washed axonemes, suggesting that at least one alpha DHC kinase is located close to, or is a component of, the outer arm in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1505536548,"The nuclear envelope represents a structural and functional barrier between cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Small molecules and solutes passively cross the nuclear envelope, whereas the transport of large proteins and RNA requires metabolic energy. Using in situ Xenopus oocyte nuclei, we characterized ATP-dependent ionic permeabilities on the external surface of the envelope. The presence, but not necessarily the hydrolysis, of ATP is crucial to maintaining the channels in an open state. Localization of the ionic channels is still unclear. From morphologic and current kinetics data, we suggest a relation between the ionic channels and the nuclear pores. We try, in this way, to explain the apparent contradiction between the presence of ion-selective channels in parallel with large aqueous pores on the nuclear envelope. Under this hypothesis, variations in the metabolic energy content of the cytoplasm would induce nucleocytoplasmic passive exchanges. The distribution and movement of charged particles across the nuclear envelope may influence many cytoplasmic functions. Regulation of the current by ATP could play an important role in hormonal stimulation, divalent ion permeation into the nucleus, and cell cycle mechanisms.—Mazzanti, M., Innocenti, B., Rigatelli, M. ATP-dependent ionic permeability on nuclear envelope in in situ nuclei of Xenopus oocytes. FASEB J. 8: 231-236; 1994."
https://openalex.org/W1675172692,"Integrins undergo conformational alterations in response to extracellular or intracellular stimuli, suggesting that structural elements within their exo- and cytoplasmic domains cooperate during transmembrane signaling. In this report, we identify a beta turn in the cytoplasmic tail of the alpha v subunit that impacts the ligand binding and conformation of the alpha v beta 3 heterodimer. Cells expressing a mutant alpha v beta 3 heterodimer composed of a truncated alpha v subunit, alpha v1000, lacking 18 carboxyl-terminal amino acids exhibits wild-type receptor structure and function. However, a truncation mutant, alpha v995, lacking five additional residues (PPQEE), which define a beta turn, is deficient in vitronectin and fibrinogen adhesion. This alteration in adhesive function is associated with two detectable structural changes in the alpha v beta 3 heterodimer. First, the alpha v995 membrane-spanning light chain exhibits retarded electrophoretic mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Second, the alpha v995 beta 3 receptor shows an altered chymotryptic profile as measured by the loss of a 39-kDa proteolytic fragment from its ectodomain. These findings demonstrate that the ligand binding and structural properties of the intact alpha v beta 3 heterodimer can be influenced by a beta turn within the cytoplasmic tail of its alpha v subunit. The presence of homologous beta turns within other alpha subunit cytoplasmic tails suggests that this structural motif may play a role in regulating integrin-mediated bidirectional transmembrane signals."
https://openalex.org/W1618797045,"Cystic fibrosis is associated with mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-regulated plasma membrane Cl- channel. Mutations in the CFTR have been reported to not only impair Cl-transport at the plasma membrane but also inhibit organelle acidification and disrupt cAMP-regulated plasma membrane recycling. Comparisons of cultured pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells expressing the delta 508 mutant CFTR (CFPAC-1 cells) with genetically matched CFPAC-1 cells transfected with the wild-type CFTR demonstrate that expression of wild-type CFTR restores cAMP-mediated plasma membrane Cl- transport, but has no effect on pH regulation of endosomes labeled with either transferrin or wheat germ agglutinin. Endosome pH was, in all cases, similar in the two cell lines and unaffected by treatment with the cAMP agonist forskolin. Forskolin treatment had no effect on transferrin internalization, but increased recycling by 30-40% in both cell lines. The kinetics of wheat germ agglutinin recycling were negligibly affected by forskolin in either cell line. These results demonstrate that endocytic acidification and cAMP-mediated endocytic protein redistribution are similar in genetically matched CFPAC-1 cells which differ only in the expression of mutant or wild-type CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W1663227557,"Stimulation of neutrophils with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) results in an enhanced respiratory burst, prolonged survival, and increased tumor cell killing. The effects of G-CSF are mediated by binding to specific, high affinity receptors. G-CSF receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, but activation of the receptor results in the rapid induction of tyrosine kinase activity. Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots of whole cell lysates prepared from neutrophils show that the G-CSF rapidly induces prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of a relative molecular mass of 80 kDa. Using monospecific antibodies, the 80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein has been shown to be p80c-rel, a proto-oncogene belonging to a family of transcriptional regulators which include NF-kB. The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel was unique to G-CSF in that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor which also stimulates neutrophils and induces tyrosine phosphorylation does not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel. The consequences of p80c-rel tyrosine phosphorylation are not yet known; however, tyrosine-phosphorylated p80c-rel is capable of binding to DNA, and G-CSF stimulation results in an increase in the amount of p80c-rel which binds to DNA. These results demonstrate that one of the first biochemical events which occurs in neutrophils following G-CSF stimulation, activation of a tyrosine kinase, leads directly to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel. Thus, the tyrosine kinase activated by G-CSF appears to directly transduce a signal to a protein which functions as a transcriptional regulator."
https://openalex.org/W1582890977,"To study the structural characteristics of E-selectin necessary for mediating cell adhesion, we examined the role of the consensus repeat (CR) domains in E-selectin function. Soluble constructs containing different numbers of CR domains were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. The minimum functional unit of soluble E-selectin consisted of the lectin (Lec) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains alone (Lec-EGF) as indicated by its ability to mediate in vitro HL-60 cell adhesion. However, E-selectin containing all six CR domains (Lec-EGF-CR6) at its COOH terminus was the most potent in blocking neutrophil or HL-60 cell adhesion to either immobilized E-selectin or cytokine-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This increased potency of Lec-EGF-CR6 in blocking cell adhesion was not due to CR-mediated oligomerization of the protein. Lec-EGF-CR6 was most likely monomeric in solution, as judged by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography, membrane ultrafiltration, and chemical cross-linking analysis. Therefore, although the lectin and EGF domains are necessary and sufficient for mediating cell adhesion, the additional six CR domains, present in native E-selectin, contribute to the enhanced binding of E-selectin to its ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1559269272,"Selected agonists convert the leukocyte integrin alpha M beta 2 on monocytes from a low to a high affinity state competent to bind factor X and fibrinogen. Conformational changes of alpha M beta 2 re hypothesized to account for this functional transition. Here we report that cytochalasins known to interfere with actin filaments induce the alpha M beta 2 functional transition. Upon exposure to cytochalasin B, isolated human blood monocytes and cells of the monocytic cell line THP-1 bound 125I-factor X (X) or 125I-fibrinogen (Fg) in a Ca(2+)-dependent, saturable manner. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the alpha M subunit and the common beta 2 subunit of leukocyte integrins inhibited X and Fg binding, whereas mAbs to the alpha chains of the other leukocyte integrins had no effect. Anti-alpha M mAb immunoprecipitated 125I-X that had been chemically cross-linked to its cognate receptor. Specific binding was not associated with an increased surface density of beta 2 integrins consistent with conformational remodeling of the receptor. Simultaneous analysis of actin forms in viable monocytes indicated a dynamic redistribution of cellular actin. The transient increase in G actin concurrent with an agonist action such as cytochalasin or ADP was reversed by an increase in F actin coincident with X/Ca2+ binding. A potential role of actin redistribution in alpha M beta 2 functional transition is supported by the finding that cells in which cellular actin is restricted to G rather than F form bound X and initiated a rapid coagulant response. We propose that a transient disassembly of actin filaments may relieve constraints on alpha M beta 2 via the cytoplasmic domains, permitting the conformational dynamics required for recognition of ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1588946275,"A 39-kDa protein binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP/alpha 2MR) and inhibits the binding of ligands to this receptor. We recently reported that inhibition of tissue-type plasminogen activator binding to LRP/alpha 2MR is mediated by both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the 39-kDa protein, whereas inhibition of alpha 2-macroglobulin-proteinase binding is mediated only by amino-terminal regions. In this report we show that amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the 39-kDa protein bind specifically and with high affinity to LRP/alpha 2MR on rat hepatoma MH1C1 cells. Following binding, these amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the 39-kDa protein are each rapidly endocytosed and degraded with kinetics identical to the full-length 39-kDa protein. Competition binding experiments with these constructs demonstrate that amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the 39-kDa protein compete with one another for binding to LRP/alpha 2MR. A model is proposed in which amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the 39-kDa protein bind to different sites on LRP/alpha 2MR in order to inhibit ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1543322752,"Active diphtheria toxin consists of two parts, fragments A and B. Fragment A has enzymatic activity and inhibits protein synthesis. Fragment B binds to cellular receptors, and upon exposure to low pH it inserts into the membrane and facilitates translocation of the A fragment into the cytosol, concomitantly with formation of cation-selective channels. Reduction of the interfragment disulfide bridge is required for release of fragment A and intoxication. In cells treated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which inhibits reduction of the disulfide bridge, fragment A was translocated to the cytosol but not released from fragment B. In the presence of NEM a peptide larger than fragment A was protected against extracellularly added Pronase. This peptide (M(r) approximately 24,000) was released to the supernatant fraction of saponin-treated cells. This indicates that fragment A, which is 21 kDa, is covalently attached via a disulfide bond to an N-terminal (M(r) approximately 3,000) piece of fragment B. The 24-kDa fragment disappeared upon reduction, and the 21-kDa fragment A appeared instead. NEM did not prevent channel activity by fragment B in the context of full-length toxin, demonstrating that channel formation occurs in spite of inhibited reduction of the disulfide bond. Thus, channel formation is not dependent on release of fragment A from the toxin-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1516235379,"Monoamine-activated alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) has been shown to inhibit beta-nerve growth factor (NGF)-promoted neurite outgrowth and the survival of embryonic sensory and forebrain neurons, whereas normal alpha 2M has little or no such activity. The objective of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition by monoamine-activated alpha 2M. Methylamine-activated alpha 2M (MA-alpha 2M) and serotonin-activated alpha 2M (5HT-alpha 2M) dose dependently inhibit NGF-promoted neurite outgrowth of the pheochromocytoma PC12 cell and its subline PC12(6-24) which overexpresses human trk protooncogene product, but have no effect on their viability, and this inhibition can be blocked by high concentrations of NGF. The binding of MA-alpha 2M to trk, which is a part of high-affinity NGF receptor, was studied with PC12(6-24) cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing trk (trk-3T3). In each case MA-alpha 2M readily forms stable complexes with trk in vivo, whereas normal alpha 2M does not. Both 5HT-alpha 2M and MA-alpha 2M also dose dependently block NGF-promoted autophosphorylation of trk in vivo, whereas normal alpha 2M and plasmin-reacted alpha 2M are inactive or much less active. MA-alpha 2M also blocks NGF-promoted incorporation of 32P from [32P]ATP into trk receptors in vitro. Neither MA-alpha 2M, 5HT-alpha 2M, nor normal alpha 2M, however, blocks either platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated or epidermal growth factor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the respective receptors. Tyrosine phosphorylation of two of the intracellular substrates, phospholipase C-gamma 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2, in the NGF-promoted pathways is also dose dependently blocked by MA-alpha 2M. However, by comparison MA-alpha 2M is more effective in inhibiting the activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 than trk. We conclude that monoamine-activated alpha 2M may block neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival by its specific binding to NGF receptors, thus inhibiting the NGF-promoted activation of intracellular second messenger pathways."

Single nucleotide incorporation on template-primer 1 was used to study the DNA polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT while template-primer 2 was used to study the effect of TIBO on the RNase H activity (polymerase independent). The drug was found to decrease the amplitude of the presteady-state burst when preequilibrated with the enzyme-substrate complex besides decreasing the steady-state rate of single nucleotide incorporations. In the absence of preincubation, TIBO did not affect the burst amplitude but decreased the steady-state rate after the pre-transient phase. This suggested that binding of TIBO to RT was affected by the presence of template-primer and required dissociation of the enzyme from the template-primer for effective binding. The polymerase-independent RNase H activity was activated in the presence of TIBO. The effect of TIBO on the overall process of DNA strand transfer is a balance between its inhibition of the polymerase activity and its activation of the RNase H activity."
https://openalex.org/W1541505332,"We reported previously that most of the phosphotyrosine-containing cellular proteins were quickly dephosphorylated at the very early stage of erythroid differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. These and other experimental results implicated a specific protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) (PTPase(s)) involved in the commitment of the erythroid differentiation. We have investigated the pattern of transcripts of PTPases during MEL cell differentiation and found that while the transcripts of most PTPases were unchanged or undetected in the cells, transcripts for two PTPases (PTP beta 2 and RIP) exhibited distinct patterns of induction at a very early stage of differentiation. Some of the mutant cells defective in differentiation did not show the induction of these PTPase transcripts. We discuss the possible role played by the PTPases in the commitment of MEL cell differentiation."

Each was further purified on heparin-Sepharose, butyl-agarose, and/or Cibacron blue F3GA to yield products of similar specific activity (70-100 mumol/min/mg protein, 1000-2000-fold purification). Salt was required to stabilize activity and dithiothreitol was required to preserve maximum activity and to prevent or reverse aggregation that resisted disruption by mercaptoethanol and/or SDS. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared that recognized several components in the partially purified preparations. Immunoabsorption of activity by monoclonal antibodies that had been chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of absorbed proteins was used to identify the active components as a 155-kDa protein in Q-1 and a 115-kDa protein in Q-2. Two antibodies recognized different epitopes in the 155-kDa phosphatase. A third antibody recognized a common epitope in both phosphatases indicating that the two enzymes are related. Both phosphatases were Mg(2+)-dependent, exhibited similar kinetic properties, and hydrolyzed PtdIns(4,5)P2 but not PtdIns(4)P, phosphatidic acid, or several other phosphate monoesters. They hydrolyzed inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate at 30% of the rate with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and this activity co-purified with PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase activity. High molecular weight PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatases may be precursors of lower molecular weight soluble Type II inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatases shown to account for the PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase activity in platelets (Matzaris, M., Jackson, S.P., Laxminarayan, M., Speed, C.J., and Mitchell, C.A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3397-3402). The three antibodies did not inhibit activity but recognized both native and denatured (Western blots) phosphatases and should be useful tools to study the distribution, structure, and regulation of the two forms of PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase."

The rate of appearance of both ligands in bile was increased 5-fold in estradiol-treated rats compared with controls. In contrast, no increase was observed in the transcytosis of dimeric IgA. The majority of the ASF recovered from the bile of estradiol-treated rats was undegraded, indicating transcytic delivery rather than lysosomal discharge. No increase in the rate of endocytosis of ASF was observed. When transcytosis of 125I-LDL was measured in the presence of excess ASF the rate decreased by approximately 70%. Moreover, sialidase treatment of LDL in vitro increased the biliary appearance of LDL 2-fold in estradiol-treated rats, suggesting that the effect of estradiol on both ligands was mediated via the asialoglycoprotein receptor. We conclude that 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol increases the transcytosis of ASF and LDL through mechanisms that alter the intracellular trafficking of the asialoglycoprotein receptor."

Trypsin was found to cleave the gamma subunit at four sites, Arg70, Lys199, Lys201, and Lys212. Cleavage at these four sites did not greatly reduce the high ATPase activity of the enzyme that is obtained when the epsilon subunit is removed by the protease treatment. However, prolonged trypsin cleavage led to loss of inhibition by epsilon subunit added back to the trypsin-treated enzyme. Endoproteinase-Lys-C cleaves the gamma subunit of ECF1 at three of the four sites, i.e. Lys199, Lys201, and Lys212, but not at Arg70. The enzyme was activated by treatment with this protease because of degradation and release of the epsilon subunit, but added pure epsilon subunit still caused inhibition of ATPase activity. Therefore, cleavage at Arg70 by trypsin is responsible for the loss of response to the epsilon subunit inhibition. Biotin was reacted with Cys residues at positions 8, 106, 179, and 286 in different gamma subunit mutants and the accessibility of the biotin to avidin monitored in the intact ECF1 from the different mutants. Avidin was able to react with biotin when incorporated at position 106, not at 8, 179, or 286. The four trypsin cleavage sites, Arg70, Lys199, Lys201, and Lys212, as well as Thr106 are in regions of the gamma subunit predicted to be mainly beta-sheet and beta-turn structures."
