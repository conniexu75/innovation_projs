Here, we report the first open-label, phase Ib clinical trial of a personalized neoantigen-based vaccine, NEO-PV-01, in combination with PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or bladder cancer. This analysis of 82 patients demonstrated that the regimen was safe, with no treatment-related serious adverse events observed. De novo neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were observed post-vaccination in all of the patients. The vaccine-induced T cells had a cytotoxic phenotype and were capable of trafficking to the tumor and mediating cell killing. In addition, epitope spread to neoantigens not included in the vaccine was detected post-vaccination. These data support the safety and immunogenicity of this regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02897765).

The repertoire of tumor-specific T cells in cancer patients is shaped by interactions between the tumor and the host’s immune response. Neoantigens, encoded by mutations that are unique to a patient’s tumors, are key targets of effective anti-tumor immune responses (Hu et al., 2018Hu Z. Ott P.A. Wu C.J.

Recent first-in-human clinical trials, harnessing the ability to identify neoantigens in real time using next-generation sequencing technology and computational pipelines, have demonstrated that personalized neoantigen vaccines are feasible, safe, and immunogenic in cancer patients (Carreno et al., 2015Carreno B.M.

Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has revolutionized the treatment of cancer patients over the past decade. Treatment with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and anti-PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies have demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor types (Havel et al., 2019Havel J.J.

Med. 2017; 377: 2500-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Despite the success of anti-PD-1 therapy across a wide range of tumor types, only a subset of patients receives long-term clinical benefit from the treatment (Sharma and Allison, 2015Sharma P. Allison J.P. The future of immune checkpoint therapy.Science. 2015; 348: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Consequently, there has been a great deal of interest in combination therapies to improve the efficacy of ICI and ultimately patient outcomes. Neoantigens arise from mutations in cancer cells and are important targets of T cell-mediated immunity. A high neoantigen burden in tumors is associated with favorable clinical response and improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with multiple tumor types treated with anti-PD-1 (Łuksza et al., 2017Łuksza M.

Goldinger S.M. et al.Genomic correlates of response to CTLA-4 blockade in metastatic melanoma.Science. 2015; 350: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Given the early promise of personalized neoantigen vaccines in the adjuvant setting (Ott et al., 2017Ott P.A. Hu Z. Keskin D.B. Shukla S.A. Sun J. Bozym D.J. Zhang W. Luoma A. Giobbie-Hurder A. Peter L. et al.An immunogenic personal neoantigen vaccine for patients with melanoma.Nature. 2017; 547: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar; Sahin et al., 2017Sahin U. Derhovanessian E. Miller M. Kloke B.P. Simon P. Löwer M. Bukur V. Tadmor A.D. Luxemburger U. Schrörs B. et al.Personalized RNA mutanome vaccines mobilize poly-specific therapeutic immunity against cancer.Nature. 2017; 547: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), coupled with the observation that the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 inhibition in melanoma is largely limited to patients with tumors exhibiting a preexisting T cell infiltrate (Tumeh et al., 2014Tumeh P.C. Harview C.L. Yearley J.H. Shintaku I.P. Taylor E.J. Robert L. Chmielowski B. Spasic M. Henry G. Ciobanu V. et al.PD-1 blockade induces responses by inhibiting adaptive immune resistance.Nature. 2014; 515: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (3499) Google Scholar), there is a strong rationale for combining these modalities in the metastatic setting. We reasoned that this strategy could augment the response rates and durability of responses over the results of PD-1 inhibition alone by inducing, expanding, and broadening the tumor-directed T cell repertoire. We report here the first clinical trial combining a personalized neoantigen vaccine (NEO-PV-01) with PD-1 inhibition, in patients with high TMB metastatic tumors including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and urothelial carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder (NCT02897765). In addition to addressing the feasibility and safety of this combination in a large phase Ib study, we performed comprehensive molecular and immune analyses to define the parameters associated with progression-free survival. These analyses revealed that there were few preexisting neoantigen responses. However, following vaccination, there was induction of neoantigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that can traffic to the tumor. In addition, epitope spread to non-vaccinating epitopes and major pathological responses were seen post-vaccination. The approach described here presents a treatment strategy for metastatic tumors based on increasing the frequencies of neoantigen-specific T cells to control tumor growth and spread. The study was open to patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, smoking-associated NSCLC, and TCC of the bladder, who were enrolled at nine major cancer centers in the United States. The protocol specified at most one prior regimen for metastatic disease and no prior immunotherapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1, although at the start of the study, nivolumab monotherapy was not approved for the first-line treatment of NSCLC or TCC. Enrollment was not restricted based on PD-L1 status. The major study endpoints included evaluations for safety, objective response, progression-free survival, and comprehensive immune analysis in blood and tumor (Method Details, study protocol). To produce the personalized neoantigen vaccine NEO-PV-01, tumor mutations were first identified by whole exome and RNA sequencing of each patient’s formalin-fixed tumor and matched normal cells from blood as outlined in the vaccine manufacturing schema (Figure 1A). High-quality neoepitopes encoded by somatic mutations were then selected using bioinformatics algorithms, as previously described (Abelin et al., 2017Abelin J.G. Keskin D.B. Sarkizova S.

NetMHCpan-3.0; improved prediction of binding to MHC class I molecules integrating information from multiple receptor and peptide length datasets.Genome Med. 2016; 8: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Neoepitopes were prioritized based on the expression of mutated alleles by RNA sequencing, binding to autologous human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A) and HLA-B, and additional variables. Details of the production, including the selection of vaccine peptides, are provided in Method Details. Each neoantigen vaccine consisted of up to 20 unique peptides, 14–35 amino acids in length, and was formulated in up to 4 distinct pools and mixed with the adjuvant poly-ICLC for administration. Patients were treated with nivolumab for 12 weeks while the vaccines were generated (Figure 1B, study schema). Starting at week 12, 1.5 mL NEO-PV-01 was administered subcutaneously into each of 4 separate, non-rotating anatomical sites per administration. Five priming and 2 booster vaccinations were administered within a 3-month period, which made up a full NEO-PV-01 course. Nivolumab was continued during both the vaccine and post-vaccine time periods. Between November 2016 and August 2018, 82 patients were enrolled across 9 clinical sites and received at least 1 dose of nivolumab. This set was defined as the intention-to-treat (ITT) set (Figure 1C). Among these patients, 41% of melanoma, 67% of NSCLC, and 71% of bladder cancer patients had prior therapy (Table 1). Thirty-eight percent of melanoma patients had received prior immunotherapy, including ipilimumab (29%) and interferon-α (9%). Nineteen percent of bladder cancer patients had received prior immunotherapy, in all cases Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).Table 1Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics by Cancer TypeMelanomaNSCLCBladder CancerITT Set (N = 34)Vaccinated Set (N = 27)ITT Set (N = 27)Vaccinated Set (N = 18)ITT Set (N = 21)Vaccinated Set (N = 15)Male sex, %687044397167Median age, y606266666767M-stage, %M034NANANANAM1a2422NANANANAM1b2933NANANANAM1c4441NANANANAAJCC stage, %III34762933IV979693947167Elevated LDH, %3841NANANANAMedian TMB (TMB range)267 (20–8,431)363 (50–8,431)185 (65–760)221 (109–760)142 (42–1,447)194 (48–1,447)PD-L1 < 1%292041276157PD-L1 < 50%929071649493Median tumor size (cm)5.35.27.26.85.24.7ECOG, %082894150486011811595048402000050Prior therapy413067617173Prior chemotherapy0067616767Prior platinumNANA63615753Prior immune therapy3830001920Prior ipilimumab2922NANANANAIn the NSCLC cohort, all of the patients had a history of smoking, 67% of NSCLC patients in the ITT and 61% of NSCLC patients in the NEO-PV-01 sets, respectively, had adenocarcinoma; the remaining NSCLC patients had squamous cell carcinoma.

Of the 82 patients in the ITT set, 22 (27%) were not vaccinated for reasons that included radiographic or clinical progression (N = 11), insufficient tumor cellularity or low tumor mutational burden (N = 4), and other reasons (N = 7) (Figure 1C). Therefore, the vaccinated set included 60 patients, each of whom received at least 1 dose of vaccine (27 melanoma, 18 NSCLC, 15 bladder cancer). Of the 60 patients, 14 (23%) received the vaccine after radiographic progression on nivolumab by RECIST 1.1 criteria (6 melanoma, 4 NSCLC, and 4 bladder cancer). Although the role of pseudo-progression was considered in progressors, this is a relatively rare phenomenon with anti-PD-1 therapy alone (Hodi et al., 2018Hodi F.S. Ballinger M. Lyons B. Soria J.C. Nishino M. Tabernero J. Powles T. Smith D. Hoos A. McKenna C. et al.Immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (imRECIST): Refining Guidelines to Assess the Clinical Benefit of Cancer Immunotherapy.J. Clin.

Oncol. 2018; 15: 267-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the vaccinated set, 30% of melanoma, 61% of NSCLC, and 73% of bladder cancer patients had prior therapy (Table 1). Eleven of the vaccinated patients had BRAF mutations (2 NSCLC and 9 melanoma) and 3 had KRAS mutations (all codon 12 and all in NSCLC). No other specific mutations (same amino acid change in the same gene) occurred in ≥5 patients in the study. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NEO-PV-01 in combination with nivolumab (Tables S1–S3). The most common adverse events in vaccinated patients were injection-site reactions and influenza-like illness (52% and 35% of the patients, respectively). Injection site reactions typically manifested as transient, localized warmth and erythema. These events were mild (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 1) in all cases except in 1 patient, who had a grade 2 injection site erythema. Injection site-related adverse events did not lead to NEO-PV-01 dose interruption or discontinuation for any patient (Table S2). Treatment-related events of grade ≥3 severity were noted for only 2 patients in the vaccinated group, with 1 case each of hypokalemia and rash, and 1 patient in the vaccinated group discontinued treatment for grade 2 gastritis (Table S3). No treatment-related serious adverse events were observed. The objective response rates (ORRs, RECIST version 1.1), PFS and overall survival (OS) were analyzed with a minimum follow-up of 12 months as of the August 2019 data cutoff. Figure 2 summarizes the radiographic response profiles (RECIST 1.1) for each patient by tumor type (change in sum of target lesions) who received anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with NEO-PV-01. The pair of bar plots (top panel) for the vaccinated patients allow for the comparison of the best response before vaccine initiation (dark shade) and the best response overall (light shade). The difference indicates a further reduction in tumor size following the start of the vaccine. The PD-L1 status of the vaccinated patients did not correlate with the ORR in any of the three cohorts (Figure S1A). We note that the further tumor regression observed after vaccination could reflect delayed responses following nivolumab monotherapy, although vaccine-induced anti-tumor T cell responses may be a component of these responses. Among the vaccinated patients (N = 60), ORRs (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 59% (39%–78%), 39% (17%–64%), and 27% (8%–55%) for melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer patients, respectively. The median duration of response was not reached for any of the three cohorts. Efficacy data for the ITT and the vaccinated sets are included in Table S4. Overall, 8 of 60 vaccinated patients met the criteria for tumor response conversions, for a response conversion rate (RCR) of 13%. The RCRs for the melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer patient cohorts were 15%, 17%, and 7%, respectively. Among the 14 patients who had progressive disease before vaccination, 1 patient with NSCLC had a partial response and 1 patient with bladder cancer experienced stable disease after vaccination.Figure S1Radiographic Responses with Pre-treatment Tumor PD-L1 Levels in Vaccinated Patients and OS/PFS by Tumor Type; Additional Data Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A): Radiographic responses with pre-treatment PD-L1 levels in tumors of patients who received at least one dose of NEO-PV-01.

Kaplan-Meier estimates for PFS and OS in both the ITT and vaccinated cohorts for the melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer patients are shown in Figures S1B and S1C, respectively. The median PFS (95% CI) among vaccinated patients was 23.5 months (6.6, NE), 8.5 months (3.9, NE), and 5.8 months (2.8, 12.7) in the melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer cohorts, respectively. The median OS for vaccinated patients was not reached in the melanoma and NSCLC cohorts, while for the bladder cancer cohort, the median OS was 20.7 months (4.8, NE). The 1-year OS rates were 96% (76%–99%), 83% (57%–94%) and 67% (38%–85%) for melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer patients, respectively (Table S4).

The clinical data indicate that vaccination with personalized neoantigens is feasible and safe in multiple solid tumor types when co-administered with anti-PD-1 therapy. The single-arm design of the trial does not allow attribution of responses specifically to the vaccine since it was administered in combination with anti-PD-1. We next investigated the presence of biomarkers that could correlate with PFS across all three tumor cohorts. For this post hoc analysis, we introduced an exploratory endpoint defined by lack of progression at 9 months (PFS-9) post-initiation of nivolumab therapy for the melanoma and the NSCLC cohorts and lack of progression at 6 months (PFS-6) for the bladder cancer cohort. Patients were classified into two groups who either did or did not achieve PFS-9 or PFS-6, respectively. The time point for bladder cancer was set at 6 months to ensure sufficient patient numbers in both groups (PFS-6 or no PFS-6, respectively) due to higher dropout in this cohort.

Adolescents and their families may be particularly affected by this enforced proximity, as adolescents strive to become more independent. Yet, whether these measures impact emotional well-being in families with adolescents has not been examined. In this ecological momentary assessment study, we investigated if the COVID-19 pandemic affected positive and negative affect of parents and adolescents and parenting behaviors (warmth and criticism). Additionally, we examined possible explanations for the hypothesized changes in affect and parenting. To do so, we compared daily reports on affect and parenting that were gathered during two periods of 14 consecutive days, once before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018–2019) and once during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multilevel analyses showed that only parents’ negative affect increased as compared to the period before the pandemic, whereas this was not the case for adolescents’ negative affect, positive affect and parenting behaviors (from both the adolescent and parent perspective). In general, intolerance of uncertainty was linked to adolescents’ and parents’ negative affect and adolescents’ positive affect. However, Intolerance of uncertainty, nor any pandemic related characteristics (i.e. living surface, income, relatives with COVID-19, hours of working at home, helping children with school and contact with COVID-19 patients at work) were linked to the increase of parents’ negative affect during COVID-19. It can be concluded that on average, our sample (consisting of relatively healthy parents and adolescents) seems to deal fairly well with the circumstances. The substantial heterogeneity in the data however, also suggest that whether or not parents and adolescents experience (emotional) problems can vary from household to household. Implications for researchers, mental health care professionals and policy makers are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W3092902204,"Lung ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a common clinical pathology associated with high mortality. Ferroptosis, a novel mode of cell death elicited by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, has been implicated in ischemic events. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) is one of the main enzymes in pro-ferroptotic lipid metabolism. In this study, the involvement of ferroptotic death in different durations of reperfusion was evaluated by assessing the iron content, malondialdehyde, and glutathione levels, ferroptosis-related protein expression, and mitochondria morphology. The roles of ferroptosis-specific inhibitor, liproxastin-1 (Lip-1), and ACSL4 modulation in a preventive regimen were assessed in vivo and in vitro. The hallmarks of pulmonary function, such as histological lung injury score, wet/dry ratio, and oxygenation index, were evaluated as well. Results showed that lung IR increased the tissue iron content and lipid peroxidation accumulation, along with key protein (GPX4 and ACSL4) expression alteration during reperfusion. Pretreatment with Lip-1 inhibited ferroptosis and ameliorated lung IR-induced injury in animal and cell models. In addition, administering ACSL4 inhibitor rosiglitazone before ischemia diminished the ferroptotic damage in IR-injured lung tissue, consistent with the protective effect of ACSL4 knockdown on lung epithelial cells subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Thus, this study delineated that IR-induced ferroptotic cell death in lung tissue and ACSL4 were correlated with this process. Inhibition of ferroptosis and ACSL4 mitigated the ferroptotic damage in IR-induced lung injury by reducing lipid peroxidation and increasing the glutathione and GPX4 levels."
https://openalex.org/W3093320311,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is a mutualistic interaction between most land plants and fungi of the glomeromycotina subphylum. The initiation, development and regulation of this symbiosis involve numerous signalling events between and within the symbiotic partners. Among other signals, phytohormones are known to play important roles at various stages of the interaction. During presymbiotic steps, plant roots exude strigolactones which stimulate fungal spore germination and hyphal branching, and promote the initiation of symbiosis. At later stages, different plant hormone classes can act as positive or negative regulators of the interaction. Although the fungus is known to reciprocally emit regulatory signals, its potential contribution to the phytohormonal pool has received little attention, and has so far only been addressed by indirect assays. In this study, using mass spectrometry, we analyzed phytohormones released into the medium by germinated spores of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. We detected the presence of a cytokinin (isopentenyl adenosine) and an auxin (indole-acetic acid). In addition, we identified a gibberellin (gibberellin A4) in spore extracts. We also used gas chromatography to show that R. irregularis produces ethylene from methionine and the α-keto γ-methylthio butyric acid pathway. These results highlight the possibility for AM fungi to use phytohormones to interact with their host plants, or to regulate their own development."
https://openalex.org/W3093337245,"At present nearly half of the world’s population is under some form of government restriction to curb the spread of COVID-19, an extremely contagious disease. In Bangladesh, in the wake of five deaths and 48 infections from COVID-19, between March 24 and May 30, 2020, the government imposed a nationwide lockdown. While this lockdown restricted the spread of COVID-19, in the absence of effective support, it can generate severe food and nutrition insecurity for daily wage-based workers. Of the 61 million employed labor force in Bangladesh, nearly 35% of them are paid on a daily basis. This study examines the food security and welfare impacts of the COVID-19 induced lockdown on daily wage workers both in the farm and nonfarm sectors in Bangladesh. Using information from more than 50,000 respondents complied with the 2016–17 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) in Bangladesh, this study estimates daily wage rates as Bangladesh Taka (BDT) 272.2 in the farm sector and BDT 361.5 in the nonfarm sector. Using the estimated daily wage earnings, this study estimates that a one-day complete lockdown generates a US$64.2 million equivalent economic loss only considering the wage loss of the daily wage workers. After estimating the daily per capita food expenditure separately for farm and nonfarm households, this study estimates a minimum compensation package for the daily wage-based farm and nonfarm households around the US $ 1 per day per household to ensure minimum food security for the daily wage-based worker households."

The new order will need strengthened continental and national public health institutions; local manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; attraction, training, and retention of a public health workforce; and fostering of respectful local and international partnerships. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has revealed that Africa needs a new public health order to be resilient, to adapt, and to cope with 21st-century disease threats. The new order will need strengthened continental and national public health institutions; local manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; attraction, training, and retention of a public health workforce; and fostering of respectful local and international partnerships. Infectious diseases remain a great threat to Africa’s aspiration to achieve its 2063 developmental blueprint: “Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want.” Health, as a development issue, continues to have a significant impact on the economic and social security of countries and regions across Africa. Africa’s underlying burden of endemic diseases is the largest in the world. Infectious diseases play a particularly severe role on the continent. Every year they account for over 227 million years of health life lost and produce an annual productivity loss of over $800 billion (World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa, 2019World Health Organization Regional Office for AfricaA Heavy Burden: The Productivity Cost of Illness in Africa. WHO Regional Office for Africa, 2019Google Scholar). Moreover, outbreak-prone diseases are an increasingly devastating force. Of the estimated 10 million deaths per year resulting from infectious diseases, the majority occur in Africa. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has clearly shown how infectious diseases are a serious threat to health, global economies, and security. Economically, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is forecast to cause a 5.2% contraction in global gross domestic product and to a 2.8% contraction in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2020 (World Bank, 2020World BankGlobal Economic Prospects, June 2020. The World Bank, 2020Crossref Google Scholar). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has underlined the datum that disease does not respect boundaries. While we seek to flatten the epidemiological curve of SARS-CoV-2 globally, the virus has also “flattened the world.” It has shown us that we are more connected than we thought, that we are vulnerable regardless of where we live, and that we have tremendous shared responsibilities and vast inequalities. In the midst of this, Africa has learned how fragile international cooperation can be when the world is collectively threatened and challenged by a common disease threat. For instance, the ease with which Africa was shoved out of the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics market exposed how easily global cooperation and international solidarity can collapse (Nkengasong, 2020Nkengasong J. Let Africa into the market for COVID-19 diagnostics.Nature. 2020; 580: 565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Africa could find itself at the end of the queue for access to any available vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 with the rise of global protectionism and vaccine nationalism (Callaway, 2020Callaway E. The unequal scramble for coronavirus vaccines—by the numbers.Nature. 2020; 584: 506-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One of the greatest lessons learned by Africa is the urgent need to invest in its healthcare systems as a critical instrument to secure its economic development as it implements the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement and other flagship projects of Agenda 2063. About 50 years ago, Julian Tudor-Hart proposed the principle of the inverse care law, stating that the availability of good medical or social care tends to vary inversely with the need of the population served (Hart, 1971Hart J.T. The inverse care law.Lancet. 1971; 1: 405-412Abstract PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). This principle vastly prevails in Africa today, and a new public health order must aim to deconstruct this law. Here, we provide a historical perspective of where Africa is coming from and where it might be heading to understand why we need a new public health order to fight the inverse care law. We propose that the new public health order must stand on four pillars: strengthened public health institutions; local manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; a strengthened public health workforce; and respectful local and international partnerships. Africa finds itself balancing its developmental aspirations with strengthening its health systems to help it fight synergistic concurrent epidemics (i.e., the “syndemic”). It is faced with a set of linked health problems that interact synergistically, contributing to its excess burden of disease: rising rates of non-communicable diseases, emerging and re-emerging infections, and endemic diseases. The syndemic is a result of five major factors: (1) the rapid population growth of the continent, resulting in rapid population movement across the continent (the estimated population of Africa was 280 million in 1960 and 1.2 billion in 2016 and is projected to be 2.4 billion by 2050; United Nations ECA, 2016United Nations ECAThe Demographic Profile of African Countries. United National Economic Commission for Africa, 2016Google Scholar) (Although Africa is still significantly rural, the continent is projected to be the world’s fastest-urbanizing population.); (2) widespread infectious disease, including endemic diseases such as HIV, TB, and malaria, which together account for more than 1.2 million deaths per year on the continent; emerging infectious pathogens; and the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which will cause an estimated 4 million deaths by 2050 (O’Neill, 2014O’Neill J. Antimicrobial Resistance: tackling a crisis for the health and wealth of nations.https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/AMR Review Paper - Tackling a crisis for the health and wealth of nations_1.pdfDate: 2014Google Scholar); (3) increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases and injuries (Gouda et al., 2019Gouda H.N. Charlson F. Sorsdahl K. Ahmadzada S. Ferrari A.J. Erskine H. Leung J. Santamauro D. Lund C. Aminde L.N. et al.Burden of non-communicable diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, 1990-2017: results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.Lancet Glob. Health. 2019; 7: e1375-e1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar); (4) persistently high maternal mortality rates; and (5) threats posed by environmental, climatic, and ecological changes. As a result of this balancing act, over 30 novel infectious diseases have emerged over the last three decades. When most African countries gained independence in the 1960s, several of the major infectious diseases that threaten the society, economy, and security of the continent were unknown or were thought to have been brought under control. However, as the human population continues to expand, there is increased use of agricultural land, which increases the exposure of livestock and humans to infections in wildlife. Once these new infections enter the population, air traffic facilitates their rapid spread across the world. Climate change is also increasingly modifying the ecosystem and concentration of animal vectors, thereby introducing diseases to new geographic locations. However, these factors are just part of the story. Ultimately, the reasons for the rapid emergence of so many novel infectious diseases are multifactorial and also include microbial adaptation, poverty and social inequality, instability, and fragile health systems. To emphasize the broad and enduring impact of infectious disease in Africa, we constructed a timeline of how some of the notable infectious diseases, with pandemic potential, have emerged and re-emerged in Africa since independence (Figure 1). These, together with emerging, re-emerging, and other diseases in Africa in 2020 (Figure 2), represent a wake-up call for the continent. Some of the infections are emerging and re-emerging more frequently.Figure 2A Map of Emerging, Re-emerging, and Other Diseases Reported to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) in 2020Show full captionThe size of the circles corresponds to the number of reported cases compiled as of August 28, 2020.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The size of the circles corresponds to the number of reported cases compiled as of August 28, 2020. Given the above, in order to secure its future and guarantee its development, Africa will need a new public health order to address infectious disease threats and the overall syndemic in the 21st century. This new order will necessitate (1) a strengthened Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and national public health institutions (NPHIs); (2) local production of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; (3) investment in public health workforce and leadership programs; and (4) respectful partnerships. The Africa CDC must play a central role in the new public health order. To better understand the critical role that a well-resourced and enabled Africa CDC could potentially play in such a new public health order, it is important to look back on how some of the oldest public health institutions were established in response to challenges posed by disease threats of their time and have since transformed public health practice in those countries. The oldest public health institution in the world is the Brazilian Oswaldo Cruz Institute, founded in 1900 under the name “Instituto Soroterápico Federal” (Federal Serotherapic Institute). It was established as an immediate response to address several public health challenges, including the bubonic plague, yellow fever, and smallpox, which were Brazil’s greatest threats at the time. These diseases were decimating the population, hindering the economic and social development of the country. Foreign ships, the only international mechanism of transport at that time, were not allowed to anchor in Brazilian ports because of the potential risk of exporting these diseases—a situation similar to that of today, where air and sea transportation halted across the globe due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Today the institution has a remarkably broad range of public health responsibilities, including hospital and ambulatory care; health-related research; development and production of vaccines, drugs, reagents, and diagnostic kits; training of public health and health workers; and providing information and communications related to health, science, and technology. Another example is the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) that was founded in 1946 as the Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Its work was initially focused on malaria control. It subsequently expanded its mandate to include all communicable diseases and supported all the States. In 1949 it launched the first-ever disease surveillance program. Subsequently, disease surveillance became the cornerstone of the CDC’s mission and, in time, changed the practice of public health. Strikingly, the start of the Korean War in 1950 was the stimulus for designing the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS). The threat of biological warfare loomed, creating a need to train epidemiologists who would detect ordinary threats to public health while looking out for unfamiliar pathogens. This “disease detectives” program quickly became famous for “shoe-leather epidemiology,” through which they hunted out the cause of disease outbreaks. Other public health agencies have emerged fairly recently due to several disease challenges, including the China CDC in 2002, the Public Health Agency of Canada in 2003, and the European CDC in 2003, which were established as a consequence of the 2002 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The political leadership of Africa must learn lessons from these experienced institutions on how to support and resource the Africa CDC so that it can play a central role in the new public health order, safeguarding the health security and economic development of the continent (Nkengasong et al., 2017Nkengasong J.N. Maiyegun O. Moeti M. Establishing the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention: responding to Africa’s health threats.Lancet Glob. Health. 2017; 5: e246-e247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). African heads of state and governments established the Africa CDC following the largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, which resulted in over 28,000 infections and 11,300 deaths. The mission of the Africa CDC is to strengthen the capacity and capability of Africa’s public health institutions to detect and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats and outbreaks based on science, policy, and data-driven interventions and programs. In order to enable an effective response to disease threats, all five Africa CDC Regional Collaborating Centres (RCCs) should house a Regional Integrated Surveillance and Laboratory Network (Africa CDC RISLNET). The Africa CDC RISLNET is expected to leverage all existing public health assets in each region. The Africa CDC should then facilitate the establishment and/or strengthening of NPHIs in each African country, which will network with the RCCs. Functional NPHIs will then conduct core public health functions: surveillance, laboratory networking, innovative information management, workforce development, management of an emergency operation center, and conducting high-priority public health research. Strong continental public health institutions are critical to harmonize and coordinate public health responses across sectors, disciplines, and borders. Below are some examples of how the Africa CDC has supported over 10 member states to respond to nearly 15 disease outbreaks over 4 years. Perhaps the greatest challenge the nascent organization has faced was the EVD outbreaks in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa CDC supported the government of the DRC in several key areas: by deploying over 65 epidemiologists, laboratory experts, logisticians, infection control experts, and risk communicators; conducting 170,500 contact tracings and/or supervisions; establishing 11 laboratories across the affected areas and testing over 35,000 samples; training about 3,100 health care workers, traditional rulers, and points of entry; and providing personal protective equipment to 14 health districts. Furthermore, in 2019, the Africa CDC convened a meeting of health ministers of the DRC and its nine neighboring countries to develop a cross-border collaboration framework on Ebola preparedness and response and other health security risks. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, Africa CDC mobilized a continent-wide response and held an emergency meeting of African health ministers that led to the adoption and approval of the Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 (Massinga Loembé et al., 2020Massinga Loembé M. Tshangela A. Salyer S.J. Varma J.K. Ouma A.E.O. Nkengasong J.N. COVID-19 in Africa: the spread and response.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Since then, the Africa CDC has trained more than 1,000 laboratory personnel and 9,000 public health and medical professionals on surveillance, infection prevention and control (IPC), risk communication, and case management. Africa CDC has distributed more than 5 million tests and provided over 10 million pieces of medical equipment across Africa, including personal protective equipment. Furthermore, Africa CDC deployed rapid responders (205) and community health workers (more than 10,000) to support COVID-19 testing and contact tracing across 22 member states. Local production of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics is critical to safeguard Africa’s health security. Despite the threats posed by infectious diseases in Africa, as outlined above, it is remarkable that the continent only produces 1% of its vaccines and lacks the adequate capacity to manufacture them at scale. Vaccines are essential to reduce mortality, improve life expectancy, and promote economic growth. The Global Alliance for Vaccines Immunization (GAVI) has been instrumental in introducing new vaccines in Africa. However, introducing new vaccines after countries graduate from eligibility for the GAVI program will be a challenge for the continent. The rapid population and economic growth in Africa make it a very attractive market for vaccine manufacturing. Therefore, African governments must invest in addressing barriers to local vaccine production, including process development and maintenance, production facilities, life cycle management, and product portfolio management. In addition, efforts like the African Vaccine Manufacturers Initiative must be promoted and encouraged. The geopolitics surrounding access to vaccines in the present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic further highlight the need for Africa to embark on local vaccine manufacturing to avoid depending on externalities for its health security. Local production of medicines is equally critical. Africa imports between 70% and 90% of its drugs (Chaudhuri and West, 2015Chaudhuri S. West A. Can local producers compete with low-cost imports? A simulation study of pharmaceutical industry in low-income Africa.Innov. Dev. 2015; 5: 23-38Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This considerably exceeds the percentage of medicines imported into China (5%) and India (20%), despite comparable populations (McKinsey, 2019McKinsey Evaluating the sub-Saharan African pharmaceutical market.https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/should-sub-saharan-africa-make-its-own-drugsDate: 2019Google Scholar). Local pharmaceutical manufacturing is vital for Africa’s development; effective drugs against HIV infections became available in 1996 in developed countries and led to drastic decrease in mortalities from AIDS. However, these drugs only became accessible in Africa in 2002. As a result of the delay, millions of Africans died needlessly. The African Union’s initiative to establish the Africa Medicine Agency (AMA) must be fully supported as part of the new public health order. The goals of AMA are to (1) coordinate ongoing regulatory systems for drugs; (2) strengthen and harmonize drug-manufacturing efforts across the continent; (3) provide regulatory guidance; and (4) improve patients’ access to quality, safe, and efficacious medical products and health technologies on the continent. Africa’s high disease burden constitutes a great incentive and a significant market for the pharmaceutical industry. In 2017, the World Health Organization estimates that the annual earnings from substandard and/or counterfeit drugs were over US$30 billion (World Health Organization, 2017World Health OrganizationA Study on the Public Health and Socioeconomic Impact of Substandard and Falsified Medical Products. World Health Organization, 2017Google Scholar). Lastly, Africa needs to invest in the local production of diagnostics, especially for newly emerging pathogens. The present COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the serious challenges for the continent to quickly access diagnostics in the wake of an emerging disease threat (Nkengasong, 2020Nkengasong J. Let Africa into the market for COVID-19 diagnostics.Nature. 2020; 580: 565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, prior to COVID-19, no African countries were investing in the local manufacturing of diagnostics. Adequate investment to develop and maintain a prepared cadre of public health experts and leaders will be fundamental for the continent to cope with its disease threats. The Africa CDC needs to be enabled to run a competency-based workforce development program similar to the US CDC’s EIS program. Africa needs about 6,000 field epidemiologists at both advanced and intermediate levels. However, there are only an estimated 1,900 epidemiologist graduates from various field epidemiology training programs across the continent. The continent also needs an estimated 25,000 frontline epidemiologists but currently has only trained about 5,000. Moreover, in 2017, the heads of state and government of the continent launched an initiative to deploy 2 million community healthcare workers who can help to transform the interface between public health services and communities. This cadre of workers can truly be the nexus between universal health coverage and health security, as they can improve access and uptake of health services, sanitation and hygiene, and primary health care to the community and improve overall health outcomes. Africa must also prioritize training for the next generation of global health leaders to embrace a multi-dimensional approach to solving health challenges. This will include arming the next generation to understand that public health agendas must be pushed politically and diplomatically. They must aim at propelling any public health causes into political circles, because protecting Africa’s public health requires the promotion of evidence-based estimates to predict resource needs before a disease threat occurs. Unfortunately, because of the major competing emergencies that the continent faces, the risks of future diseases do not appear imminent; thus, convincing policy makers to invest in disease preparedness may be a challenge. The Africa CDC recently launched the Kofi Annan Global Health Leadership and Scholar Program, which is aimed at providing emerging public health leaders with such skill sets (Africa Union, 2020Africa UnionAfrican Union Commission announces the Africa CDC Kofi Annan Global Health Leadership Programme.https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20200525/african-union-commission-announces-africa-cdc-kofi-annan-global-healthDate: 2020Google Scholar). A new public order will require that Africa develop effective and trusting partnerships with the private sector and establish a new mechanism to ensure that efforts by donors and development partners are better coordinated and aligned with continental aspirations—Agenda 2063—and that African-originated and -defined health priorities and solutions are respected. Such coordination is critical to ensure efficiencies and to minimize fragmentation and duplications of efforts and undermining of African-driven agendas. The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated how interrelated disease threats are with economies. As Africa implements the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement, close collaboration with the Africa CDC is essential to ensure that public health and disease threats are central to its operations. Lastly, committed partnerships across the continent will be required to establish an Africa Disease Threat Fund, similar to The Global Fund, to effectively implement the new public health order in Africa."

However, the transcriptional landscapes underlying brain development are poorly characterized.

Here, we investigate premotor sequences in HVC (proper name) of the adult zebra finch forebrain that are central to the performance of the temporally precise courtship song. We use high-density silicon probes to measure song-related population activity, and we compare these observations with predictions from a range of network models. Our results support a circuit architecture in which heterogeneous delays between sequentially active neurons shape the spatiotemporal patterns of HVC premotor neuron activity. We gauge the impact of several delay sources, and we find the primary contributor to be slow conduction through axonal collaterals within HVC, which typically adds between 1 and 7.5 ms for each link within the sequence. Thus, local axonal ""delay lines"" can play an important role in determining the dynamical repertoire of neural circuits."

Moreover, neuronal discrimination in CA1, but not in the dentate gyrus, reflects behavioral performance. Our results suggest that CA1 weights the decorrelated information from the dentate gyrus according to its relevance, producing a map of memory representations that can be used by downstream circuits to guide learning and behavior."

https://openalex.org/W3093100650,"Objective In vivo functional changes in white matter during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have not been previously reported. Our objectives are to measure changes in white matter functional connectivity (FC) in an elderly population undergoing cognitive decline as AD develops, to establish their relationship to neuropsychological scores of cognitive abilities, and to assess the performance in prediction of AD using white matter FC measures as features. Methods Analyses were conducted using resting state functional MRI and neuropsychological data from 383 ADNI participants, including 136 cognitive normal (CN) controls, 46 with significant memory concern, 83 with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 37 with MCI, 46 with late MCI, and 35 with AD dementia. FC metrics between segregated white matter tracts and discrete gray matter volumes or between white matter tracts were quantitatively analyzed and characterized, along with their relationships to 6 cognitive measures. Finally, supervised machine learning was implemented on white matter FCs to classify the participants and performance of the classification was evaluated. Results Significant decreases in FC measures were found in white matter with prominent, specific, regional deficits appearing in late MCI and AD dementia patients from CN. These changes significantly correlated with neuropsychological measurements of impairments in cognition and memory. The sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing AD dementia and CN using white matter FCs were 0.83 and 0.81 respectively. Conclusions and relevance The white matter FC decreased in late MCI and AD dementia patients compared to CN participants, and this decrease was correlated with cognitive measures. White matter FC is valuable in the prediction of AD. All these findings suggest that white matter FC may be a promising avenue for understanding functional impairments in white matter tracts during AD progression."
https://openalex.org/W3093355754,"The abuse of prescription opioids and heroin by women of childbearing age over the past decade has resulted in a five-fold increase in the number of infants born opioid-dependent. Daily opioid substitution treatment with methadone is associated with less maternal illicit opioid use and improved antenatal care. However, research on the neurobehavioral effects of daily prenatal exposure to methadone on the infant is limited. Using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), we compared the neurobehavior at birth of 86 infants born to opioid-dependent mothers receiving methadone treatment (MMT) with 103 infants unexposed to methadone. Generalized linear models, adjusted for covariates, showed methadone exposed infants had significantly poorer attention, regulation, and quality of movement. They were also significantly more excitable, more easily aroused, exhibited more non-optimal reflexes, hypertonicity, and total signs of stress abstinence. Maternal MMT was also associated with more indices of neonatal abstinence, including: CNS, visual, genitourinary (GI), and state. Latent profile analysis of the NNNS summary scores revealed four distinct neurobehavioral profiles with infants characterized by the most disturbed neurobehavior at birth having the poorest clinical outcomes at birth, and poorer cognitive and motor development at 24 months of age."
https://openalex.org/W3093436181,"Germanium has long been considered a therapeutic agent with anticancer, antitumor, antiaging, antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Numerous clinical studies have explored the promising therapeutic effects of organic germanium on cancer, arthritis and senile osteoporosis. The immune activation property of organic germanium is considered the foundation of its various therapeutic effects. However, previous human clinical studies investigating immune activation with organic germanium compounds have certain limitations, as some studies did not strictly follow a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. To build a more clinically substantiated foundation for the mechanism underlying its immunostimulation, we structured by far the most rigorous clinical study to-date with a group of 130 human subjects to examine changes in immune profiles following germanium supplementation. We used Bio-Germanium, an organic germanium compound naturally synthesized via a yeast fermentation process. An 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with 130 subjects with leukocyte counts of 4–8 (×103/μL) divided into the Bio-Germanium group and the placebo group. Anthropometric measurements; blood collection; biochemical analysis; urinalysis; and natural killer cell activity, cytokine and immunoglobulin assays were conducted. Results showed the Bio-Germanium group exhibited NK cell activity increases at effector cell:target cell (E:T) ratios of 50:1, 10:1, 5:1 and 2.5:1 (12.60±32.91%, 10.19±23.88%, 9.28±16.49% and 7.27±15.28%, respectively), but the placebo group showed decreases (P<0.01). The difference in the IgG1 change from baseline to follow-up between the Bio-Germanium and placebo groups was significant (P = 0.044). Our results and earlier clinical study of Bio-Germanium confirm that Bio-Germanium acts as an effective immunostimulant by increasing the cytotoxicity of NK cells and activating immunoglobulin, B cells and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (P<0.05). As we have added newly discovered clinical findings for germanium’s immunostimulation mechanism, we believe Bio-Germanium is a highly promising therapeutic agent and should certainly be further explored for potential development opportunities in immunotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W3092658159,"The study of plant-frugivore interactions is essential to understand the ecology and evolution of many plant communities. However, very little is known about how interactions among frugivores indirectly affect plant reproductive success. In this study, we examined direct interactions among vertebrate frugivores sharing the same fruit resources. Then, we inferred how the revealed direct interspecific interactions could lead to indirect (positive or negative) effects on reproductive success of fleshy fruited plants. To do so, we developed a new analytical approach that combines camera trap data (spatial location, visitor species, date and time, activity) and tailored null models that allowed us to infer spatial-temporal interactions (attraction, avoidance or indifference) between pairs of frugivore species. To illustrate our approach, we chose to study the system composed by the Mediterranean dwarf palm, Chamaerops humilis, the Iberian pear tree, Pyrus bourgaeana, and their shared functionally diverse assemblages of vertebrate frugivores in a Mediterranean area of SW Spain. We first assessed the extent to which different pairs of frugivore species tend to visit the same or different fruiting individual plants. Then, for pairs of species that used the same individual plants, we evaluated their spatial-temporal relationship. Our first step showed, for instance, that some prey frugivore species (e.g. lagomorphs) tend to avoid those C. humilis individuals that were most visited by their predators (e.g. red foxes). Also, the second step revealed temporal attraction between large wild and domestic frugivore ungulates (e.g. red deer, cows) and medium-sized frugivores (e.g. red foxes) suggesting that large mammals could facilitate the C. humilis and P. bourgaeana exploitation to other smaller frugivores by making fruits more easily accessible. Finally, our results allowed us to identify direct interaction pathways, that revealed how the mutualistic and antagonistic relations between animal associates derived into indirect effects on both plants seed dispersal success. For instance, we found that large-sized seed predators (e.g. ungulates) had a direct positive effect on the likelihood of visits by legitimate seed dispersers (e.g. red foxes) to both fleshy fruited plants. Then, seed predators showed an indirect positive effect on the plants’ reproductive success. Our new analytical approach provides a widely applicable framework for further studies on multispecies interactions in different systems beyond plant-frugivore interactions, including plant-pollinator interactions, the exploitation of plants by herbivores, and the use of carcasses by vertebrate scavengers."
https://openalex.org/W3092735135,"Mental disorders (MD) are one of the main causes of the disease burden worldwide. Associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and presence of MD in parents have been related with increased odds of MD in offspring. However, there is a lack of population-based research in this field. The aim of the present study was to examine together the relationship between the presence of MD in children, and the SES and presence of MD in their parents, in a whole of population data. A gender approach was undertaken aiming to discern how these variables influence children’s mental health when related with the father and the mother. Using administrative individual data from the National Health System, a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted. The entire children population aged 6 to 15 resident in Catalonia in 2017 was examined. A logistic regression model was performed. Low SES was associated with increased odds of children’s MD. Offspring of a parent with MD were at more risk of presenting MD than offspring of parents without these problems. Although these associations were consistent for both boys and girls when looking at the father’s or mother’s SES and MDs, the mother’s SES and MDs showed a higher association with the offspring’s MDs than the father’s. Lowest associations, found for boys when looking at the father’s SES and MDs, were: OR of 1.21, 95%CI 1.16 to 1.27 for lowest SES, and OR of 1.66, 95%CI 1.61 to 1.70 for parental MDs. Children’s familiar environment, which includes SES and mental health of parents, plays an important role in their mental health. Socially constructed gender roles interfere with SES and parent’s MD. These findings support the relevance of examining MD and its risk factors within a gender approach."
https://openalex.org/W3092156010,"Although sleep disturbances are common co-morbidities of metabolic diseases, the underlying processes linking both are not yet fully defined. Changes in the duration of sleep are paralleled by changes in the levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), an anabolic hormone that shows a circadian pattern in the circulation and activity-dependent entrance in the brain. However, the specific role, if any, of IGF-I in this universal homeostatic process remains poorly understood. We now report that the activity of orexin neurons, a discrete cell population in the lateral hypothalamus that is involved in the circadian sleep/wake cycle and arousal, is modulated by IGF-I. Furthermore, mice with blunted IGF-I receptor activity in orexin neurons have lower levels of orexin in the hypothalamus, show altered electro-corticographic patterns with predominant slow wave activity, and reduced onset-sleep latency. Collectively, these results extend the role in the brain of this pleiotropic growth factor to shaping sleep architecture through the regulation of orexin neurons. We speculate that poor sleep quality associated to diverse conditions may be related to disturbed brain IGF-I input to orexin neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3093220931,"Dynamin 1 is a neuronal endocytic protein that participates in vesicle formation by scission of invaginated membranes. Dynamin 1 is also expressed in the kidney; however, its physiological significance to this organ remains unknown. Here, we show that dynamin 1 is crucial for microtubule organization and stabilization in glomerular podocytes. By immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, dynamin 1 was concentrated at microtubules at primary processes in rat podocytes. By immunofluorescence of differentiated mouse podocytes (MPCs), dynamin 1 was often colocalized with microtubule bundles, which radially arranged toward periphery of expanded podocyte. In dynamin 1-depleted MPCs by RNAi, α-tubulin showed a dispersed linear filament-like localization, and microtubule bundles were rarely observed. Furthermore, dynamin 1 depletion resulted in the formation of discontinuous, short acetylated α-tubulin fragments, and the decrease of microtubule-rich protrusions. Dynamins 1 and 2 double-knockout podocytes showed dispersed acetylated α-tubulin and rare protrusions. In vitro, dynamin 1 polymerized around microtubules and cross-linked them into bundles, and increased their resistance to the disassembly-inducing reagents Ca2+ and podophyllotoxin. In addition, overexpression and depletion of dynamin 1 in MPCs increased and decreased the nocodazole resistance of microtubules, respectively. These results suggest that dynamin 1 supports the microtubule bundle formation and participates in the stabilization of microtubules."

Mass drug administration (MDA) can rapidly reduce the burden of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). However, concerns remain about its contribution to select for antimalarial drug resistance.


Methods 
We used Sanger sequencing and real-time PCR to determine the proportion of molecular markers associated with antimalarial resistance (k13, pfpm2, pfmdr1 and pfcrt) in Pf isolates collected before (n = 99) and after (n = 112) the implementation of two monthly MDA rounds with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (DHAp) for two consecutive years in Magude district of Southern Mozambique.


Results 
None of the k13 polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance were observed in the Pf isolates analyzed. The proportion of Pf isolates with multiple copies of pfpm2, an amplification associated with piperaquine resistance, was similar in pre- (4.9%) and post-MDA groups (3.4%; p = 1.000). No statistically significant differences were observed between pre- and post-MDA groups in the proportion of Pf isolates neither with mutations in pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes, nor with the carriage of pfmdr1 multiple copies (p>0.05).


Conclusions 
This study does not show any evidence of increased frequency of molecular makers of antimalarial resistance after MDA with DHAp in southern Mozambique where markers of antimalarial resistance were absent or low at the beginning of the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3093230578,"It has been reported that supplementing certain amino acids has therapeutic effects on ulcerative colitis (UC). We intend to explore whether citrulline (Cit) supplementation has protective effects on UC. Fifteen male Wistar rats were divided into normal control group (NC group), UC group and UC+Cit group, with five rats in each group. The UC model was established by TNBS/ethanol method. Rats in UC+Cit group were intragastrically administered with Cit for 7 consecutive days after modeling. All rats were sacrificed after 7 days. Blood samples were collected to detect the number of monocytes. Colon tissues were taken for HE staining. Immunohistochemistry staining for CD68 and p-STAT3 were performed to detect the infiltration of monocytes and the phosphorylation of STAT3 in colon tissues. The concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-17A and the protein expression of p-STAT3 in colon tissues were measured by ELISA and western blot methods, respectively. The body weight of UC group rats decreased significantly after 7 days (p<0.05). However, the weight loss of UC+Cit group rats was not statistically significant (p>0.05). The number of peripheral blood monocytes in UC+Cit group was significantly lower than that in UC group (p<0.05), and the infiltration of CD68-positive monocytes in the colon tissue of UC+Cit group was significantly reduced than that in UC group. The concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-17A and the expression of p-STAT3 in colon tissues of UC+Cit group rats were significantly lower than those in UC group (both p<0.05). Our study suggests that Cit supplementation may be a potential therapy for UC."
https://openalex.org/W3092676660,"Emerging evidence indicates that alternative splicing plays a critical role in cancer progression through abnormal expression or mutation of splicing factors. Small-molecule splicing modulators have recently attracted considerable attention as a novel class of cancer therapeutics. CDC-like kinases (CLKs) are central to exon recognition in mRNA splicing and CLK inhibitors exhibit anti-tumour activities. Most importantly, molecular mechanism-based combination strategies for cancer therapy must be considered. However, it remains unclear whether CLK inhibitors modulate expression and splicing of apoptosis-related genes, and whether CLK inhibitors enhance cytotoxicity in combination with apoptosis inducers. Here we report an appropriate mechanism-based drug combination approach. Unexpectedly, we found that the CLK inhibitor T3 rapidly induced apoptosis in A2780 cells and G2/M cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells. Regardless of the different phenotypes of the two cancer cell types, T3 decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, cFLIP and Mcl-1) for a short period of exposure and altered the splicing of the anti-apoptotic MCL1L and CFLAR isoform in A2780 and HCT116 cells. In contrast, other members of the Bcl-2 family (i.e., Bcl-xL and Bcl-2) were resistant to T3-induced expression and splicing modulation. T3 and a Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitor synergistically induced apoptosis. Taken together, the use of a CLK inhibitor is a novel therapeutic approach to sensitise cancer cells to Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W3093284586,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) and reproductive coercion (RC)–largely in the form of pressuring pregnancy—appear to contribute to low use of contraceptives in India; however, little is known about the extent to which these experiences differentially affect use of specific contraceptive methods. The current study assessed the association of IPV and RC with specific contraceptive methods (Intrauterine Devices [IUDs], pills, condoms) among a large population-based sample of currently married women (15–49 years, n = 1424) living in Uttar Pradesh. Outcomes variables included past year modern contraceptive use and type of contraceptive used. Primary independent variables included lifetime experience of RC by current husband or in-laws, and lifetime experiences of physical IPV and sexual IPV by current husband. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to determine the effect of each form of abuse on women’s contraceptive use. Approximately 1 in 7 women (15.1%) reported experiencing RC from their current husband or in-laws ever in their lifetime, 37.4% reported experience of physical IPV and 8.3% reported experience of sexual IPV by their current husband ever in their lifetime. Women experiencing RC were less likely to use any modern contraceptive (AOR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.9–0.36). Such women also less likely to report pill and condom use but were more likely to report IUD use. Neither form of IPV were associated with either overall or method specific contraceptive use. Study findings highlight that RC may influence contraceptive use differently based on type of contraceptive, with less detectable, female-controlled contraceptives such as IUD preferred in the context of women facing RC. Unfortunately, IUD uptake remains low in India. Increased access and support for use, particularly for women contending with RC, may be important for improving women’s control over contraceptive use and reducing unintended pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3092933268,"Background Older people are more likely to be living with cancer and multiple long-term conditions, but their needs, preferences for treatments, health priorities and lifestyle are often not identified or well-understood. There is a need to move towards a more comprehensive person-centred approach to care that focuses on the cumulative impact of a number of conditions on daily activities and quality of life. This paper describes the intervention planning process for CHAT& PLANTM, a structured conversation intervention to promote personalised care and support self-management in older adults with complex conditions. Methods A theory-, evidence- and person-based approach to intervention development was undertaken. The intervention planning and development process included reviewing relevant literature and existing guidelines, developing guiding principles, conducting a behavioural analysis and constructing a logic model. Optimisation of the intervention and its implementation involved qualitative interviews with older adults with multimorbidity (n = 8), family caregivers (n = 2) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) (n = 20). Data were analysed thematically and informed changes to the intervention prototype. Results Review findings reflected the importance of HCPs taking a person-centred (rather than disease-centred) approach to their work with older people living with multimorbidity. This approach involves HCPs giving health service users the opportunity to voice their priorities, then using these to underpin the treatment and care plan that follow. Findings from the planning stage indicated that taking a structured approach to interactions between HCPs and health service users would enable elicitation of individual concerns, development of a plan tailored to that individual, negotiation of roles and review of goals as individual priorities change. In the optimisation stage, older adults and HCPs commented on the idea of a structured conversation to promote person-centred care and on its feasibility in practice. The idea of a shared, person-centred approach to care was viewed positively. Concerns were raised about possible extra work for those receiving or delivering care, time and staffing, and risk of creating another “tick-box” exercise for staff. Participants concluded that anyone with the appropriate skills could potentially deliver the intervention, but training was likely to be required to ensure correct utilisation and self-efficacy to deliver to the intervention. Conclusions CHAT&PLAN, a structured person-centred conversation guide appears acceptable and appealing to HCPs and older adults with multimorbidity. Further development of the CHAT&PLAN intervention should focus on ensuring that staff are adequately trained and supported to implement the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3093050800,"Introduction Measuring nurses’ cultural competence is an important aspect in monitoring the acceptable quality in multicultural populations, and is a means for efficient modification of the educational process of nurses based on this assessment. Purpose The goal of this article is to offer a preliminary assessment of the cultural competence of nurses based on a Polish-language and -culture version of the Nurse Cultural Competence Scale (NCCS). Research method An adaptive and diagnostic cross-disciplinary concept was used in the research. Two hundred thirty-eight professionally active nurses in the southeast region of Poland took part in this study. The NCCS-Polish version (NCCS-P) questionnaire was used after linguistic adaptation and analysis of psychometric properties. Results Moderate levels of competence in the Cultural Knowledge Subscale (M = 3.42) were found in the group of nurses studied. The results indicate lowest competency levels in the Cultural Skill Subscale (M = 3.14). The highest values were obtained for the Cultural Awareness Subscale (M = 3.98) and the Cultural Sensitivity Subscale (M = 3.72). The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for the NCCS-P scale was 0.94, with the subscale values ranging from 0.72 to 0.95. Factor validity analysis of the Polish adaptation of the NCCS-P scale pointed to its four-factor structure. The Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin sampling adequacy test was 0.905, and the Bartlett test of sphericity result was χ2 = 5755.107; df = 820; p<0.001. The four-factor structure is affirmed by the Kaiser criterion and the scree test result. Conclusions The NCCS-P psychometric properties were highly reliable and significant because of the opportunity for using them for research in Poland. Practical implications The scale can be used in intercultural research for comparing cultural competence of nurses, including Polish ones. This scale facilitates the precise monitoring of cultural competence among nurses and nurse managers, which may help in developing nursing policies geared toward a commitment to expanding cultural competence."

A causative role for plasmin (ogen) as a ""second hit"" in kidney disease progression has yet to have been demonstrated in vivo. Additionally, association between plasmin (ogen) uria and kidney function in glomerular diseases remains unclear. We performed comparative studies in a puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy rat model treated with amiloride, an inhibitor of plasminogen activation, and measured changes in plasmin (ogen) uria. In a glomerular disease biorepository cohort (n = 128), we measured time-of-biopsy albuminuria, proteinuria, and plasmin (ogen) uria for correlations with kidney outcomes. In cultured human podocytes, plasminogen treatment was associated with decreased focal adhesion marker expression with rescue by amiloride. Increased glomerular plasmin (ogen) was found in PAN rats and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) patients. PAN nephropathy was associated with increases in plasmin (ogen) uria and proteinuria. Amiloride was protective against PAN-induced glomerular injury, reducing CD36 scavenger receptor expression and oxidative stress. In patients, we found associations between plasmin (ogen) uria and edema status as well as eGFR. Our study demonstrates a role for plasmin (ogen)-induced podocyte injury in the PAN nephropathy model, with amiloride having podocyte-protective properties. In one of the largest glomerular disease cohorts to study plasminogen, we validated previous findings while suggesting a potentially novel relationship between plasmin (ogen) uria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Together, these findings suggest a role for plasmin (ogen) in mediating glomerular injury and as a viable targetable biomarker for podocyte-sparing treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3092716432,"Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histological pattern frequently found in patients with nephrotic syndrome that often progress to end-stage kidney disease. The initial step in development of this histologically defined entity is injury and ultimately depletion of podocytes, highly arborized interdigitating cells on the glomerular capillaries with important function for the glomerular filtration barrier. Since there are still no causal therapeutic options, animal models are needed to develop new treatment strategies. Here, we present an FSGS-like model in zebrafish larvae, an eligible vertebrate model for kidney research. In a transgenic zebrafish strain, podocytes were depleted, and the glomerular response was investigated by histological and morphometrical analysis combined with immunofluorescence staining and ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy. By intravenous injection of fluorescent high-molecular weight dextran, we confirmed leakage of the size selective filtration barrier. Additionally, we observed severe podocyte foot process effacement of remaining podocytes, activation of proximal tubule-like parietal epithelial cells identified by ultrastructural cytomorphology, and expression of proximal tubule markers. These activated cells deposited extracellular matrix on the glomerular tuft which are all hallmarks of FSGS. Our findings indicate that glomerular response to podocyte depletion in larval zebrafish resembles human FSGS in several important characteristics. Therefore, this model will help to investigate the disease development and the effects of potential drugs in a living organism."

Methods In total, 116 patients with stage I–III rectal cancer who underwent preoperative CCRT and robotic-assisted surgery between September 2013 and February 2019 were enrolled. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the time interval: group A (10–12 weeks) and group B (≥ 12 weeks). Results Among the 116 enrolled patients, 98 (84.5%) had middle and lower rectal cancers. Two (1.7%) patients underwent abdominoperineal resection with a sphincter preservation rate of 98.3%. Thirty-seven (31.9%) patients had a pathologic complete response (pCR). The circumferential resection margin and distal resection margin were positive in 2 (1.7%) and 1 (0.9%) patients, respectively. Therefore, the R0 resection rate was 97.4%. A total of 24 (22.4%) patients experienced postoperative relapse and 12 (10.3%) patients died; these were slightly more common in group B than in group A (28.8% vs 15.8% and 15.3% vs 5.3%, respectively; both P > 0.05); however, this difference was nonsignificant. Three-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 75% and 89%, respectively, among all patients. Non-significant trend of favorable 3-year DFS, 3-year OS, 3-year locoregional control rate and 3-year distant metastasis control rate were observed in group A compared with group B (all P > 0.05). Conclusion Robotic-assisted surgery after a longer interval is safe and feasible for patients with rectal cancer undergoing preoperative CCRT. The present study’s results suggested that the time interval of 10–12 weeks can be considered because comparable clinical and perioperative outcomes and preferable oncological outcomes were observed for interval of this length. However, future prospective randomized clinical trials are required to verify the present finding."

Materials and methods From Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 33152 patients with stage I/II colon cancer undergoing surgery between 2004 and 2011. The cumulative incidence of CCSM and NCSM was calculated, and competing risk analysis was performed to investigate prognostic factors for cause-specific mortality. Results In patients <50, 50–75, and >75 years of age, 5-year cumulative incidence of CCSM was 5.7%, 7.8%, and 16.1%, respectively (overall, 10.6%); 5-year cumulative incidence of NCSM was 2.2%, 7.1%, and 26.9%, respectively (overall, 13.8%). The probability of CCSM and NCSM increased with advanced age. The 5-year cumulative incidence of CCSM was higher than NCSM in patients <50 years of age, whereas lower in patients >75 years of age. The probability of CCSM and NCSM was similar in patients 50–75 years of age. Competing-risk multivariable analysis demonstrated that increasing age was a strong predictor of CCSM (per year increase, SHR 1.03,95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03–1.04). Age was most predictive of NCSM: (per year increase, SHR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.08–1.08). Conclusion Age was significantly associated with an increased cumulative incidence of CCSM and NCSM of patients with stage I/II colon cancer underwent surgery. NCSM was a significant competing event and should be adequately considered when performing survival analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3092800327,"Polyphyllin I (PPI) is a natural phytochemical drug isolated from plants which can inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. One of the PPI tumor-inhibitory effects is through downregulating the expression of Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), the latter, is found upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and participates in the development of AD. In this study, we explored the application of PPI in experimental AD treatment in CIP2A-overexpressed cells and 3XTg-AD mice. In CIP2A-overexpressed HEK293 cells or primary neurons, PPI effectively reduced CIP2A level, activated PP2A, and decreased the phosphorylation of tau/APP and the level of Aβ. Furthermore, synaptic protein levels were restored by PPI in primary neurons overexpressing CIP2A. Animal experiments in 3XTg-AD mice revealed that PPI treatment resulted in decreased CIP2A expression and PP2A re-activation. With the modification of CIP2A-PP2A signaling, the hyperphosphorylation of tau/APP and Aβ overproduction were prevented, and the cognitive impairments of 3XTg-AD mice were rescued. In summary, PPI ameliorated AD-like pathology and cognitive impairment through modulating CIP2A-PP2A signaling pathway. It may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of AD."

Phosphorylation of site S122 in ERα has been shown in vitro to affect ERα activity, but the tissue-specific role in vivo is unknown. We herein developed and phenotyped a novel mouse model with a point mutation at the phosphorylation site 122 in ERα (S122A). Female S122A mice had increased fat mass and serum insulin levels but unchanged serum sex steroid levels, uterus weight, bone mass, thymus weight, and lymphocyte maturation compared to WT mice. In conclusion, phosphorylation site S122 in ERα has a tissue-dependent role with an impact specifically on fat mass in female mice. This study is the first to demonstrate in vivo that a phosphorylation site in a transactivation domain in a nuclear steroid receptor modulates the receptor activity in a tissue-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3093317565,"Our previous research revealed that steroid receptor coactivators (Src)-1 and -2 serve a critical cooperative role in production of parturition signals, surfactant protein A and platelet-activating factor, by the developing mouse fetal lung (MFL). To identify the global landscape of genes in MFL affected by Src-1/-2 double-deficiency, we conducted RNA-seq analysis of lungs from 18.5 days post-coitum (dpc) Src-1-/- /-2-/- (dKO) vs. WT fetuses. One of the genes most highly downregulated (~4.8 fold) in Src-1/-2 dKO fetal lungs encodes 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which catalyzes conversion of inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligand, corticosterone. Glucocorticoids were reported to upregulate 11β-HSD1 expression in various cell types via induction of C/EBP transcription factors. We observed that C/ebpα and C/ebpβ mRNA and protein were markedly reduced in Src-1/-2 double-deficient (Src-1/-2d/d ) fetal lungs, compared to WT. Moreover, glucocorticoid induction of 11β-hsd1, C/ebpα and C/ebpβ in cultured MFL epithelial cells was prevented by the SRC family inhibitor, SI-2. Cytokines also contribute to the induction of 11β-HSD1. Expression of IL-1β and TNFα, which dramatically increased toward term in lungs of WT fetuses, was markedly reduced in Src-1/-2d/d fetal lungs. Our collective findings suggest that impaired lung development and surfactant synthesis in Src-1/-2d/d fetuses are likely caused, in part, by decreased GR and cytokine induction of C/EBP and NF-κB transcription factors. This results in reduced 11β-HSD1 expression and glucocorticoid signaling within the fetal lung, causing a break in the glucocorticoid-induced positive feedforward loop."
https://openalex.org/W3092969537,"Bacterial “stand-alone” response regulators (RRs) are pivotal to the control of gene transcription in response to changing cytosolic and extracellular microenvironments during infection. The genome of group A Streptococcus (GAS) encodes more than 30 stand-alone RRs that orchestrate the expression of virulence factors involved in infecting multiple tissues, so causing an array of potentially lethal human diseases. Here, we analysed the molecular epidemiology and biological associations in the coding sequences (CDSs) and upstream intergenic regions (IGRs) of 35 stand-alone RRs from a collection of global GAS genomes. Of the 944 genomes analysed, 97% encoded 32 or more of the 35 tested RRs. The length of RR CDSs ranged from 297 to 1587 nucleotides with an average nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.012, while the IGRs ranged from 51 to 666 nucleotides with average π of 0.017. We present new evidence of recombination in multiple RRs including mga, leading to mga-2 switching, emm-switching and emm-like gene chimerization, and the first instance of an isolate that encodes both mga-1 and mga-2. Recombination was also evident in rofA/nra and msmR loci with 15 emm-types represented in multiple FCT (fibronectin-binding, collagen-binding, T-antigen)-types, including novel emm-type/FCT-type pairings. Strong associations were observed between concatenated RR allele types, and emm-type, MLST-type, core genome phylogroup, and country of sampling. No strong associations were observed between individual loci and disease outcome. We propose that 11 RRs may form part of future refinement of GAS typing systems that reflect core genome evolutionary associations. This subgenomic analysis revealed allelic traits that were informative to the biological function, GAS strain definition, and regional outbreak detection."
https://openalex.org/W3093238641,"Background Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents and more knowledge from high risk groups is needed in order to develop effective preventive strategies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between sexual minority status and suicidality in a multinational sample of European school pupils. Methods A self-report questionnaire was delivered to 2046 adolescents (mean age 15.34±1.01; 56.3% females) recruited from 27 randomly selected schools in 6 European countries. Suicidal ideation, measured with the Paykel Suicide Scale (PSS), and lifetime suicide attempts were compared between heterosexual and sexual minority (i.e. those with a non-heterosexual orientation) youth. Poisson regression analyses studied the longitudinal association between sexual minority status and the rate of serious suicidal ideation, measured at three time-points during a 4-month period. Several variables, including alcohol and illegal drugs use, bullying, family interaction, school-related stress, economic status, and religiosity, were included in multivariable analysis. Sex-stratified analyses evaluated the association respectively among females and males. Results Of 1958 pupils included in analysis (mean age 15.35±1.00; females 56.8%), 214 (10.9%) were categorized as sexual minority youth (SMY). When compared to heterosexual youth (HSY), SMY were significantly more exposed to substance abuse, bullying, school-related stress, and lower economic status. SMY pupils had significantly higher suicidal ideation scores (p<0.001; r 0.145) as well as higher prevalence of serious suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR] 2.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.83–3.79) and previous suicide attempts (OR 2.72, 95%CI 1.77–4.18), compared to their HSY peers. The rate of serious suicidal ideation reports during the study was significantly higher among SMY compared to HSY (rate ratio [RR] 2.55, 95%CI 1.90–3.43). A significant difference was found even when controlling for the pupils’ country as well as after adjustment for alcohol and illegal drugs use, bullying, family interaction, school-related stress, economic status, and religiosity (adjusted RR 1.73, 95%CI 1.23–2.48). Stratified analyses showed significant associations between SMY status and persistent serious suicidal ideation for both sexes, with a notably strong association among male pupils (females aRR 1.51, 95%CI 1.01–2.24; males aRR 3.84, 95%CI 1.94–7.59). Conclusions European sexual minority youth are a high-risk group for suicidality, independently from objective factors such as victimization or substance abuse. There is a need to develop primary and secondary preventive measures for sexual minority youth, including the management of context vulnerabilities and related distal stressors, before the establishment of proximal stressors. Context-targeting interventions may effectively focus on social and economic factors, as well as on the potentially different risk profile of female and male sexual minority youth."
https://openalex.org/W3093327763,"UPLC-MS/MS profiling of Cassia glauca leaves extract revealed the identification of 10 flavonoids. Kaempferol 3-O-β-D-rutinoside was isolated and studied for its cytotoxic activity. It showed high cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 (IC50 of 4.6±0.038 μg/ml) and HepG-2 (IC50 of 8.2±0.024 μg/ml) cancer cell lines, compared to the leaves extracts, their Ag nanoparticles, and doxorubicin. Moreover, Kaempferol 3-O-β-D-rutinoside exerted a synergistic cytotoxic effect with doxorubicin on MCF-7 cell lines. It was discovered as kinases and aldose reductase inhibitor while rationalizing its cytotoxic activity through molecular docking study. Thus, it is expected that the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin can be also decreased by using Kaempferol 3-O-β-D-rutinoside due to its aldose reductase inhibitory effect. These findings suggested that Kaempferol 3-O-β-D-rutinoside could be used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs to increase the sensitivity to their cytotoxic activity and protect against their side effects."

The current study investigated whether this timing deficit has a cause independent of those of memory and attention using rhythmic stimuli that reduce the demand for these higher cognitive functions. In Study 1, participants took part in two rhythmic timing tasks: explicit and implicit. Participants had to distinguish regular from irregular sequences while processing temporal information explicitly or implicitly. Results showed that while the accuracy in the implicit timing task was preserved, older adults had more noise in their performance in the explicit and implicit tasks. In Study 2, participants took part in a dual-implicit task to explore whether the performance of temporal tasks differed with increasing task difficulty. We found that increasing task difficulty magnifies age-related differences."
https://openalex.org/W3093271503,"During bronchoscopy, discomfort is mainly caused by an unavoidable cough; however, there are no reports of any predictive factors for strong cough during bronchoscopy identified before the procedure. To clarify the factors underlying the discomfort status and predictive factors for strong cough during bronchoscopy, we prospectively evaluated patients who underwent bronchoscopy at Kyorin University Hospital between March 2018 and July 2019. Before and after bronchoscopy, the enrolled patients answered a questionnaire regarding the procedure. At the same time, bronchoscopists evaluated cough severity using a four-grade cough scale. We evaluated patient characteristics and predictive factors associated with bronchoscopy from the perspective of discomfort and strong cough. A total of 172 patients were ultimately enrolled in this study. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, comparison of the subjective data between the discomfort and comfort groups revealed that factors that were more common in the former group were younger age (OR = 0.96, p = 0.002), less experienced bronchoscopist (OR = 2.08, p = 0.047), and elevation of cough score per 1 point (OR = 1.69, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the predictive factors for strong cough prior to performing bronchoscopy were female sex (OR = 2.57, p = 0.009), EBUS-TBNA (OR = 2.95, p = 0.004), and prolonged examination time of more than 36 min (OR = 2.32, p = 0.022). Regarding patients’ discomfort, younger age, less experienced bronchoscopist, and the elevation of cough score per 1 point were important factors for discomfort in bronchoscopy. On the other hand, female sex, EBUS-TBNA, and prolonged examination time were crucial factors for strong cough."
https://openalex.org/W3093401404,"PCNA sliding clamp binds factors through which histone deposition, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair are coupled to DNA replication. PCNA also directly binds Eco1/Ctf7 acetyltransferase, which in turn activates cohesins and establishes cohesion between nascent sister chromatids. While increased recruitment thus explains the mechanism through which elevated levels of chromatin-bound PCNA rescue eco1 mutant cell growth, the mechanism through which PCNA instead worsens cohesin mutant cell growth remains unknown. Possibilities include that elevated levels of long-lived chromatin-bound PCNA reduce either cohesin deposition onto DNA or cohesin acetylation. Instead, our results reveal that PCNA increases the levels of both chromatin-bound cohesin and cohesin acetylation. Beyond sister chromatid cohesion, PCNA also plays a critical role in genomic stability such that high levels of chromatin-bound PCNA elevate genotoxic sensitivities and recombination rates. At a relatively modest increase of chromatin-bound PCNA, however, fork stability and progression appear normal in wildtype cells. Our results reveal that even a moderate increase of PCNA indeed sensitizes cohesin mutant cells to DNA damaging agents and in a process that involves the DNA damage response kinase Mec1(ATR), but not Tel1(ATM). These and other findings suggest that PCNA mis-regulation results in genome instabilities that normally are resolved by cohesin. Elevating levels of chromatin-bound PCNA may thus help target cohesinopathic cells linked that are linked to cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3093416571,"Piper is one of two large genera in the Piperaceae, and with ca. 2600 species, is one of the largest plant genera in the world. Species delimitation and evaluation of genetic diversity among populations are important requisites for conservation and adequate exploitation of economically important species. DNA barcoding has been used as a powerful tool and a practical method for species characterization and delimitation. The present work aims to evaluate molecular markers for barcoding three Piper species native to Brazil: P. gaudichaudianum (“jaborandi” or “pariparoba”), P. malacophyllum (“pariparoba-murta”) and P. regnellii (“caapeba” or “pariparoba”). A reference DNA barcode library was developed using sequences of three candidate regions: ITS2, trnH-psbA and rbcL. Transferability of the microsatellite (SSR) primers Psol 3, Psol 6 and Psol 10, designed originally for Piper solmsianum, to the three Piper species was also evaluated. The discriminatory power of the markers was based on the determination of inter- and intraspecific distances, phylogenetic reconstruction, and clustering analysis, as well as BLASTn comparison. Sequences of ITS2 enabled efficient species identification by means of the BLASTn procedure. Based on these sequences, intraspecific divergence was lower than interspecific variation. Maximum Parsimony analyses based on ITS2 sequences provided three resolved clades, each corresponding to one of the three analysed species. Sequences of trnH-psbA and rbcL had lower discriminatory value. Analyses combining sequences of these regions were less effective toward the attainment of resolved and strongly supported clades of all species. In summary, robustly supported clades of P. regnellii were obtained in most of the analyses, based either on isolated or combined sequences. The SSRs primers Psol 3, Psol 6 and Psol 10 were shown to be transferable to P. gaudichaudianum and P. regnellii, but not to P. malacophyllum. Preliminary cluster analyses based on the polymorphism of the amplified products suggested that Psol 3 has lower potential than Psol 6 and Psol 10 for discrimination of Piper species."

https://openalex.org/W3029357829,"Raymond L. Erikson, discoverer of the SRC protein and a giant in the fields of signal transduction and cell proliferation control, died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on March 30, 2020 from complications of bladder cancer. He was 84 and professor emeritus in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University. A great scientist, generous colleague, dedicated mentor, devoted husband, and father, and brother, Erikson leaves an enduring legacy of landmark scientific contributions, generations of well-trained, highly influential investigators in their own right, and friends from all walks of life who were enriched by their personal connection with him. Born into the jaws of the Depression in 1936, Ray grew up on a family dairy farm near the village of Eagle, Wisconsin, where he attended a one-room, two-student classroom. The first in his family to go to college, he arrived at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with the goal of becoming a high school agricultural sciences teacher. But these plans were waylaid when, inspired by his professor, James F. Crow, and fascinated by the new field of molecular biology, he discovered a love for “the science of biology.” By his nature taciturn, Ray nevertheless spoke often—and passionately—about how his college experience had changed his life. That commitment to learning and education began at Madison but continued throughout his life to the ultimate benefit of the many undergraduates who attended his classes and his multiple graduate student and postdoctoral trainees. Erikson graduated in 1958 and then continued at Madison for graduate studies at the famous McArdle Laboratory, receiving his PhD in 1963 under Waclaw Szybalski. During this time, Raymond had the great fortune to meet his first wife and long-time scientific collaborator, Eleanor “Jo” Erikson. Her scientific support was invaluable, and she would be his most important colleague for many years and friend for life. After leaving Wisconsin, he pursued postdoctoral training with Richard Franklin at the University of Colorado Medical School, where he studied RNA bacteriophages. Appointed to the University of Colorado faculty, his interests soon turned to the emerging field of RNA tumor viruses. Erikson initially investigated viral RNAs and virus-associated small (4S, 5S, 7S) RNAs, advancing to the rank of professor. But a sabbatical at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in the early 1970s changed his focus to the question of how Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) transforms cells. Classic experiments by the groups of G. Steven Martin, Peter Vogt, Peter Duesberg, and the late Hidesaburo Hanafusa had separated viral replication from transforming ability and localized a putative “sarcoma (src) gene” toward the 3′end of the RSV genome. The identification of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants by the Martin, Vogt, and Hanafusa laboratories was particularly influential. These mutants replicate without transforming host cells at the non-permissive temperature but quickly induce transformation following shift to the permissive temperature. Remarkably, transformation is restored even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. In concert, these findings argued that the putative src gene encoded a temperature-labile protein. The next four years changed the history of cancer biology. In 1976, Stehelin, Varmus, Bishop, and Vogt prepared hybridization probes specific for the Src gene by using RNA from transformation-defective deletion (td) mutants of RSV to deplete viral sequences unrelated to transformation. Using this “viral src” (v-src) probe, they discovered that normal cells contained src-related sequences, providing the first evidence for what are now termed cellular proto-oncogenes. Key questions remained, however: what does v-src encode, is there a related c-SRC protein, and most importantly, how does v-Src transform cells? These problems were as difficult to solve as they were tantalizing. Despite being a virus-encoded protein, v-Src levels in cells were much lower than those of proteins typically studied at the time. At a time when no mammalian gene had been cloned, much less sequenced, inferring the v-SRC sequence from the nucleotide sequence of v-src was inconceivable. Other modern techniques either didn’t exist, were rudimentary, or were extremely expensive. For example, Erikson lab members didn’t buy radioactive methionine for cell labeling experiments; they made it by incubating bacteria with the much less expensive 35HSO4 and purifying the hydrolysate. Likewise, synthesizing γ32P-ATP from ADP, radioactive orthophosphate, and an ATP-regenerating system was a legendary—and mandatory—right-of-passage for all Erikson trainees. Protein-A Sepharose beads could not be purchased. Instead, sometimes accompanied by an intrepid postdoc or student and usually on a Sunday to avoid risk to others, Erikson would prepare fixed Staphylococcus aureus for use in immunoprecipitations. There were no kits for in vitro translation (for that matter, there were no kits at all!); rabbit reticulocyte lysates had to be prepared de novo. Nevertheless, Erikson and his colleagues adopted an ingenious, two-pronged approach to solve these daunting problems. First, a graduate student in the lab, Tony Purchio, established conditions for in vitro translation of RSV RNA, with the goal of identifying the putative protein produced by the 3′ end of RSV. In parallel, inspired by earlier approaches that identified SV40, polyoma virus, and adenovirus transformation antigens, Joan Brugge developed antisera from newborn rabbits bearing RSV-induced tumors. Using this “tumor-bearing rabbit serum” for immunoprecipitations, she identified a protein produced in RSV-infected, but not in uninfected or td-RSV-infected, cells. Remarkably, in 1978, the two approaches converged on the same molecule, p60-Src, as confirmed by peptide mapping (Brugge and Erikson, Nature 269, 346–348; Purchio et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 4661–4665; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 75, 1567–1571). These seminal findings were rapidly confirmed by others, and the race was on to discover what v-Src does. Again, Erikson’s group made the key discovery. Their finding that v-Src was a phosphoprotein (leading it to be renamed pp60), combined with the rapid reversibility and protein synthesis independence of ts-RSV transformation, led Erikson and Marc Collett, a new postdoc in the lab, to suspect that v-Src might be a protein kinase—but how could this be tested? Collett then performed an experiment that now seems elementary, but at the time it was revolutionary. He mixed v-Src immunoprecipitates with standard kinase substrates (casein and histones) and γ32-ATP. Neither casein nor histone underwent phosphorylation, but instead, Collett observed strong labeling of immunoglobulin heavy chains (and to a lesser extent, v-Src). Jo Erikson and Collett soon obtained identical results with in vitro translated v-Src, proving that the kinase activity was intrinsic to, and not associated with, the oncoprotein (Collett and Erikson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 75, 2021–2024; Erikson et al., Nature 274, 919–921). Shortly thereafter, c-SRC was identified and found to have kinase activity using similar methodology (Collett et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 3159–3163). Collett’s elegant “immune-complex kinase assay” was soon adapted by multiple laboratories to study many other protein kinases, lipid kinases, and even protein and lipid phosphatases. But the SRC story had one final twist. Collett and Erikson, using the standard methodology at the time, had found that the amino acid phosphorylated by SRC co-migrated with phosphothreonine. But in a remarkable discovery (underpinned by careful attention to buffer pH!), in 1980, Tony Hunter and Walter Eckhart found that SRC is actually a tyrosine kinase. Shortly thereafter, Stanley Cohen’s group reported that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also has tyrosine kinase activity, uniting the fields of viral oncology, normal and malignant cell proliferation, and growth factor action. There are now countless examples of reversible phosphorylation events that control cell proliferation, but all bear the intellectual footprints of Ray Erikson’s discovery of SRC. His pivotal work was recognized with multiple major awards, including the 1982 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award, the 1983 General Motors Cancer Research Foundation Prize, the 1994 Hammer Prize for Cancer Research, and many others. He also was a long-standing American Cancer Society Research Professor and a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The Raymond Leo Erikson Professor of Life Sciences at Harvard University is named in his honor. In 1982, Ray joined the faculty of Harvard University, but the excitement of the days of the discovery of SRC and its kinase activity never subsided, and Colorado always held a special place in his heart. At Harvard, Erikson led a new generation of researchers to a series of other major discoveries. His group identified, purified, and/or cloned MEK, S6K, and RSK, the latter with Jo Erikson and Jim Maller, and made multiple contributions to our understanding of their regulation (Crews and Erikson, Cell 74, 215–217; Erikson, J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6007–6010). Work initiated while he was a postdoctoral fellow in Ray’s lab led Dan Simmons and his laboratory to identify a v-Src-induced gene as a novel isoform of cyclooxygenase, ultimately leading to COX2 inhibitors (Xie et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 2692–2696). Another v-Src-induced gene, initially named serum-induced kinase, was subsequently found to be related to the polo-like kinase and renamed PLK2 (Simmons et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 12, 4164–4169). Ray reasoned that PLK kinases likely had important actions in cell cycle control, and in the 21st century, his group contributed to understanding the molecular details of their actions in centrosome biology and cytokinesis (Liu and Erikson, Cell Cycle 2, 424–425). Ray was at least as proud of his many successful trainees as he was of his own laboratory’s accomplishments. Those of us who had the privilege to be his graduate students or postdocs recognize several keys to his success as a mentor. Every morning, he would make the strongest coffee in the world. The hardy souls who drank that coffee never were tired even after long hours in the laboratory, although some of us do blame him for our lifelong caffeine addiction. Although he always stood ready to give advice if asked, he expected trainees to manage their own projects and think deeply about their results. He expected—and elicited—serious effort from laboratory members, but he never insisted on specific work hours. As he frequently said, “It’s your career.” He exemplified scientific integrity and despised scientific fads, flash, puffery, and prima donnas. He liked good ideas, but he loved beautiful experiments. Ray Erikson’s scientific contributions were monumental, but his interests extended beyond the laboratory. He was a prolific reader of literature, loved the theater, enjoyed good food and wine, and traveled widely. Paris and Santa Fe were particular favorites. But most important to him was his family. He spent time each summer running his family farm in Wisconsin, allowing his younger brother Gordon and sister-in-law Karen to go on vacation. He was married to his wife Donna for 31 years and viewed his daughter Amanda as his greatest contribution to the world. Another mentor once said that one could only judge a scientific career when it was over. By any standard, Raymond L. Erikson had a remarkable career. Perhaps the Lasker Award citation said it best, “he was a pioneer’s pioneer.” He will be sorely missed. We thank Donna and Amanda Erikson for stories and photos. Our apologies to the many former laboratory colleagues and collaborators whose work with Dr. Erikson we were unable to cite owing to space limitations."

Hypothesis Clinical outcomes may differ between patients with SF-OCTs and without SF-OCTs after DES implantation. Methods A total of 576 patients undergoing OCT analysis after DES implantation were divided into SF-OCT group (n = 379, 379 lesions) and No SF-OCT group (n = 197, 197 lesions). The study population had no significant abnormal finding in final angiography. Quantification was performed for each SF-OCT. The incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, and stent thrombosis) were compared between the two groups. A median follow-up duration was 21.5 months. Results Among 379 patients with SF-OCT, 32.4% had multiple SF-OCTs. Malapposition (32.1%, IQR of maximal depth 315-580 μm) was the most frequent, followed by small MSA (31.6%), edge dissection (12.5%, IQR of maximal flap of opening 0.27-0.52 mm), thrombus (7.6%, IQR of diameter 1.31-1.97mm) and tissue protrusion (6.8%, IQR of diameter 1.05-1.67 mm). The SF-OCT group showed smaller stent diameter and longer stent length, and lower in-stent lumen expansion rate. The incidence of MACE did not differ between the two groups (3.0% for No SF-OCT vs. 5.0% for SF-OCT; HR 1.601; 95% CI 0.639 to 4.011; P = 0.310). Conclusions The presence of angiographically insignificant SF-OCTs were not associated with clinical outcomes in this study."

https://openalex.org/W3093225950,"Background 
While the link between alcohol use and male-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) has been well-established, research is needed to test whether psychosocial factors interact with alcohol use to exacerbate IPV perpetration. We tested whether depressive symptoms influenced the strength and/or direction of the alcohol-IPV relationship among men with HIV in Vietnam.


Methods 
This study is a secondary analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. Participants were clinic patients with HIV and hazardous alcohol use. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, three, six, and 12 months. Alcohol use was assessed as proportion of days alcohol abstinent. Analyses were restricted to males who reported being married/cohabitating at baseline (N = 313). Multilevel growth models were used to test whether time-varying depressive symptoms modified the time-varying effect of alcohol use on IPV perpetration.


Results 
Time-varying depressive symptoms modified the effect of proportion of days alcohol abstinent on IPV perpetration. However, the pattern of effect modification was not as expected, as reporting depressive symptoms weakened the alcohol-IPV relationship. At times when participants screened negative for depressive symptoms, those who reported higher proportion of days alcohol abstinent than usual had significantly lower odds of IPV perpetration (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.17, 95% Confidence Interval 0.06, 0.45, p = 0.0004). At times when participants screened positive for depressive symptoms, there was no observed effect of alcohol use on IPV perpetration (OR = 4.28, 95% CI 0.80, 22.78, p = 0.09).


Conclusion 
The findings highlight the complex nature of the alcohol-IPV relationship and the need to investigate the intersection between hazardous drinking, mental health, and IPV. Men who concurrently report depressive symptoms and heightened alcohol use may be socially isolated from an intimate partner or experiencing fatigue, leading to less alcohol-related IPV perpetration. Mental health interventions addressing depression and alcohol misuse integrated into HIV services may reduce IPV perpetration."
