https://openalex.org/W1963745669,"Scanning electron microscopic study of the pattern of ciliary coordination and the form of ciliary beat is now possible. Rapid fixation stops the ciliary activity instantaneously, and critical point drying avoids distortion of the cilia by surface tension forces. Such studies have been made on the ciliate Opalina with this new technique."
https://openalex.org/W2012079415,"When two immiscible liquid drops suspended in a third immiscible liquid are brought into contact, three equilibrium configurations which depend upon the spreading coefficients are possible. Experiments for a large number of systems, including three phase emulsions, confirm the theory and indicate the mechanisms of reaching equilibrium."

https://openalex.org/W2053841667,The system IrX(CO)[P(C6H5)3]2 in benzene solution adds molecular oxygen reversibly if X is chlorine and irreversibly if X is iodine. The crystal structure of the complex IrIO2(CO)[P(C6H5)3]2 ⋅ CH2Cl2 is reported here and compared with a previous study of the structure of IrClO2(CO)[P(C6H5)3]2. The O—O bond length is 1.47 ± 0.02 angstroms in the irreversibly oxygenated iodo-compound and 1.30 ± 0.03 angstroms in the reversibly oxygenated chloro-compound.

https://openalex.org/W2030629838,"Mineral particles suspended in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea were analyzed in relation to clay mineral distributions in bottom sediments, to sedimentation processes active in the region, and to the prevailing currents. Circulation in the upper layers of water flowing from the Caribbean, carrying a micaceous-rich mineral assemblage, has exercised an influence on mineral transport into the Gulf of Mexico, different from the montmorillonite-rich load delivered by the Mississippi River. Particulate matter, suspended in North Atlantic water and Amazon River discharge, enters the Caribbean through the Lesser Antilles and contributes to the detrital mineral content of Caribbean water, as does that carried by the wind."
https://openalex.org/W2080522270,"Observations of Venus made during 1967 and 1968 at a frequency of 15.4 gigahertz set an upper limits of 5 percent for the variation of brightness temperature with phase. This negative result appears to contradict earlier detections of a phase effect. By comparison with Virg A (3C 274), which has an assumed flux density of 29 x 10(-26) watt per square meter per hertz, the brightness temperature of Venus at this frequency is 485 + 60, -40 degrees K (mean error)."

https://openalex.org/W2039502973,The sedimentary phosphate method for estimating paleosalinities was tested on argillaceous sediments from different formations and environments. Results reveal that the method cannot be used generally.
https://openalex.org/W2037225273,"The circularly polarized emission from the pulsar CP 0328 has an approximately flat spectrum in the 1-megahertz band centered at 113.6 megahertz, whereas the linearly polarized emission varies with frequency and from pulse to pulse. A simple model for the source that has a constant Faraday rotation measure fits some of the linearly polarized spectra observed for individual pulses, but changes in the rotation measure of as much as 30 radians per square meter are required between adjacent pulses. The simple model does not fit the average spectrum of the linearly polarized emission, although the average spectrum had the same form on two nights."
