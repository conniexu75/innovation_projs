https://openalex.org/W1994377715,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are potent inhibitors of myoblast differentiation and inducers of bone formation both in vivo and in vitro. Expression of Id1, a negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, is up-regulated by BMPs and contributes to the antimyogenic effects of this family of cytokines. In this report, we have identified a specific BMP-2 immediate early response enhancer in the human Id1 gene. Transcriptional activation of the enhancer was increased by overexpression of BMP-responsive Smads, and Smad4 and was completely abrogated in Smad4-deficient cells. Deletion analysis demonstrates that the responsive region is composed of two separate DNA binding elements, a set of overlapping GC boxes, which bind BMP-regulated Smads upon BMP stimulation, and three repeats of CAGAC boxes. Gel shift and oligonucleotide pull-down assays demonstrated that these two types of motifs were capable of binding their corresponding Smads. However, deletion or mutation of either DNA binding element was nonadditive, since disruption of either GC or CAGAC boxes resulted in complete or severe loss of BMP-2 responsiveness. These data suggest the simultaneous requirement of two independent DNA binding elements to allow functional cooperativity of BMP-regulated Smads and Smad4 in BMP-activated gene promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2070655784,"Several genetic studies in Drosophilahave shown that the dSprouty (dSpry) protein inhibits the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway induced by various activated receptor tyrosine kinase receptors, most notably those of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). Currently, the mode of action of dSpry is unknown, and the point of inhibition remains controversial. There are at least four mammalian Spry isoforms that have been shown to co-express preferentially with FGFRs as compared with EGFRs. In this study, we investigated the effects of the various mammalian Spry isoforms on the Ras/MAP kinase pathway in cells overexpressing constitutively active FGFR1. hSpry2 was significantly more potent than mSpry1 or mSpry4 in inhibiting the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Additional experiments indicated that full-length hSpry2 was required for its full potency. hSpry2 had no inhibitory effect on either the JNK or the p38 pathway and displayed no inhibition of FRS2 phosphorylation, Akt activation, and Ras activation. Constitutively active mutants of Ras, Raf, and Mek were employed to locate the prospective point of inhibition of hSpry2 downstream of activated Ras. Results from this study indicated that hSpry2 exerted its inhibitory effect at the level of Raf, which was verified in a Raf activation assay in an FGF signaling context.

Drosophila Sprouty fibroblast growth factor FGF receptor-1 FGFR substrate-2 epidermal growth factor EGF receptor receptor tyrosine kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen activated protein MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase growth factor receptor-binding protein-2 glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin Drosophila Sprouty (dSpry)1 was discovered in genetic screens designed to detect novel genes involved in tracheal branching in the embryo (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is one of the agents involved in this phase of embryonic development, and dSpry was deemed to be an inhibitor of FGF signaling pathways. Correlative evidence suggested that the protein may be secreted and act as a competitive inhibitor at the receptor level (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Another genetic screen, which analyzed genes associated with Drosophila eye development, further indicated that the inhibition by dSpry was not confined to FGF signaling but extended also to the epidermal factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. In contrast to the first study, dSpry was found to be an endogenous, membrane-located protein that inhibited the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway between receptor stimulation and the activation of Ras (2Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The authors also provided preliminary evidence that dSpry binds directly to Drk, the Drosophila equivalent of mammalian Grb2, and to the GAP-1 protein. Another genetic-based study also found dSpry to be an endogenously acting protein that inhibited the Ras/MAP kinase pathway downstream of Ras activation around the level of Raf (3Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).While Drosophila has only one Spry protein, mammals have at least four isoforms (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D.

Development. 1999; 126: 4465-4475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This family of proteins is characterized by a highly conserved cysteine-rich C-terminal half and variable N-terminal sequences. Evidence from mammalian systems indicates that mSpry2 has an inhibitory effect on lung alveoli branching that parallels the effects on the tracheal system of insects (6Tefft J.D. Lee M. Smith S. Leinwand M. Zhao J. Bringas Jr., P. Crowe D.L. Warburton D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 219-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).The MAP kinase cascades constitute highly conserved signaling systems that have been deemed to play various roles in physiological responses such as in cell growth, differentiation, oncogenic transformation, immune responses, and apoptosis (7Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 8Schaeffer H.J. Weber M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase cascades are organized into core signaling modules consisting of three protein kinases: a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MKK), and a MAP kinase. Signals are transmitted through the module by sequential phosphorylation and activation of these component kinases (9Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase family is composed of several sub-families including the ERKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAP kinase (10Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Ferrell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 460-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In the mammalian system, the ERK cascade relays signals from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to the Ras family of small G-proteins, which then stimulates the sequential activation of Raf serine/threonine kinases (MKKK), MEK (MKK), and ERK1/2 (MAP kinase) (12Marais R. Marshall C.J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 101-125PubMed Google Scholar, 13Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar).Stimulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by FGF receptors acts via activation of the ERK pathway (14Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 15Noda M. Ko M. Ogura A. Liu D.G. Amano T. Takano T. Ikawa Y. Nature. 1985; 318: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The small adaptor protein Grb2 has been shown to play an important role in linking RTK activation to the Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathway (16Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Unlike most other RTKs, FGF receptors do not bind directly to Grb2 upon FGF stimulation. A novel lipid-anchored docking protein, FRS2, serves as a link between FGF receptor activation and the Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathway. FRS2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FGF stimulation and associates with the Grb2Â·SOS complex to relay activation signals down the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (17Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar).Apart from the genetic evidence, relatively little is known about the biochemical mode of action of the various Spry isoforms. One study demonstrated that a considerable part of the conserved C-terminal portion was involved in translocating the protein from cytosol to membrane upon RTK stimulation of cells (18Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Assuming this highly conserved sequence is involved in directing the cellular localization of the protein, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the C-terminal half of the protein is involved in binding proteins that are strategically placed to execute physiological functions such as inhibition of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway.Currently, genetic evidence derived entirely from studies inDrosophila indicates that the physiological role of dSpry is as an inhibitor of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. However, the three studies that employed genetic approaches in Drosophila are not in agreement as to the mode and site of the inhibition induced by dSpry (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 2Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 3Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian Spry isoforms may have physiological activities that differ from those of dSpry and from each other. In this study, we asked several questions. In biochemical terms, do the various mammalian Spry isoforms inhibit the Ras/MAP kinase pathway? What features of the protein are required for the inhibition? Where does this inhibition take place?RESULTSBased on the observation in mammalian embryo development that the expression of Spry isoforms coincide with the expression of FGF rather than EGF (25Chambers D. Mason I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we chose FGF-induced Ras/MAP kinase as our model system. Additionally we employed a cell culture system that best mimicked an inhibition of the pathway from the various in vivo systems reported: we reconstituted relatively long term stimulation of the FGF signaling pathway by overexpressing a wild type FGFR1 (flg) and observing the effects of overexpressed Spry isoforms at various assay points downstream with emphasis on the Ras/MAP kinase pathway.Full-length hSpry2 Is an Intracellular Inhibitor of the ERK Pathway but Not the JNK or p38 PathwaysFGFR1 was co-transfected into 293T cells with HA-tagged Spry isoforms and FLAG-tagged ERK2. Forty h after transfection, cells were lysed, and the lysates were precipitated with anti-FLAG. The immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates were subjected to Western analysis using phospho-ERK1/2 (p42/44), ERK2, FGFR1, or HA antibodies to detect for phosphorylated ERK2 or the level of transfected proteins. The results in Fig.1A show that hSpry2 significantly inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK2, whereas neither mSpry1 nor mSpry4 has any significant inhibitory effect.Similar experiments were next performed, except that the ERK precipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase analysis as outlined under âMaterials and Methods.â The data shown in Fig.1B further demonstrate a profound inhibition induced by hSpry2, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 1A.Previously we (18Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that the C-terminal half of the hSpry2 protein was responsible for the growth factor-stimulated translocation of the protein to membrane ruffles. We next asked whether this region was able to inhibit the Ras/MAP kinase pathway when cells are stimulated with overexpressed FGFR1. Our results show that neither the C-terminal nor the N-terminal of hSpry2 was able to inhibit the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, which is in contrast to the inhibitory effects of full-length hSpry2. (Fig. 1C).From an earlier study in Drosophila, it was believed that dSpry exerts its inhibitory effect by competing exogenously with FGF (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Although subsequent evidence has demonstrated that dSpry2 operated on the inside of the plasma membrane (2Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), the issue has not been totally resolved. To investigate this issue in mammalian cells, we employed cytosolic FGFR1, which auto-activates to stimulate the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Results from this experiment showed that FGFR1(cyto) stimulated phospho-ERK activity and that hSpry2 significantly inhibits this activation (Fig. 1D). Because there is no exogenous FGFR1 component, hSpry2 is exerting its inhibitory effect on the Ras/MAP kinase pathway endogenously.We next determined whether any of the other two generic MAP kinase pathways were inhibited by any of the Spry isoforms. Similar experiments to those outlined above were carried out, except that FLAG-tagged JNK1 or FLAG-tagged p38 was substituted for the ERK2 construct. The assays were calibrated using UV light (for JNK1) or Traf2 (for p38) stimulation as positive controls. The results shown in Fig. 1, E and F, indicate that none of the three Spry isoforms exert any effect on the phosphorylation of JNK1 or p38. It is apparent from the data above that hSpry2 is the only isoform that inhibits a generic MAP kinase pathway, and this inhibition is confined to the ERK pathway.hSpry2 Does Not Inhibit Either the Phosphorylation of FRS2 or the Associated Akt PathwayERK1/2 is somewhat distal from the receptor, and inhibition can potentially occur at various points along the pathway. To assess the site of inhibition of hSpry2, we decided to analyze key points along the canonical FGFR1 to ERK1/2 pathway.Current evidence indicates that FRS2 is the major âdistribution centerâ of FGFR-derived signals in mammalian cells. It has been shown to link to the Ras/MAP kinase pathway via Grb2, SHP-2, and SOS and to the Akt pathway via Grb2, Gab-1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and phosphoinositide-dependent kinases (17Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 26Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We performed experiments to investigate whether any of the Spry isoforms affected FRS2Î±, either via stimulation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation or by direct binding. FRS2 cDNA was co-transfected with FGFR1 and hSpry2 constructs. The cell lysates were later subjected to separation on SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western analysis employing PY20 antibody to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2Î±. The data in Fig.2A show that hSpry2 has no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2Î±, which eliminates any effect of hSpry2 on the transactivation of FGFR1 as well as the ability of FGFR1 to phosphorylate FRS2Î±. As these experiments involve relatively long term stimulation of the FGF pathway, it is possible that hSpry2 could either act as an in vitrocompetitor of the receptor or cause the induction of an exogenous inhibitor, as has been suggested elsewhere (27Glienke J. Fenten G. Seemann M. Sturz A. Thierauch K.H. Mech. Dev. 2000; 96: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The data shown preclude these possibilities as any impairment of receptor activity would present itself in the form of decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of its substrates, which is clearly not the case.Figure 2hSpry2 does not inhibit either the phosphorylation of FRS2Î± or the associated Akt pathway. hSpry2 has no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2Î± (A). 293T cells were transfected with wild type FRS2Î±, FGFR1, FLAG-Spry2, and empty vector constructs. Aliquots of the cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2Î±, and other related proteins were detected by immunoblotting (IB) with respective antibodies as indicated. Spry isoforms have no effect on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway activated by FGFR1 (B). 293T cells were transfected with wild type Myc-Akt, FGFR1, Gab1, FLAG-tagged Sprys, and empty vector constructs. Anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis to detect phospho-Akt and Akt using anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt, respectively. Other associated proteins in the cell lysates were detected using anti-Gab1, anti-FGFR1, and anti-FLAG. IP, immunoprecipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using GST-Spry2 pull-down experiments it was also shown that FRS2Î± does not bind to the Spry proteins (data not shown). This further indicates that the target of hSpry2 inhibition on the FGF signaling pathway is downstream of the docker protein.The activation of Akt via FRS2 and Gab1 represents a bifurcation from the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Experiments were carried out using combinations of constructs for Myc-Akt, FGFR1, Gab1, and FLAG-tagged Spry isoforms to investigate whether hSpry2 elicited any effect on the Akt pathway. The cell lysates were subjected to precipitation with anti-Myc and assayed by Western analysis using antibodies against phospho-Akt. The results shown in Fig. 2B indicate that hSpry2 does not have any effect on the Akt pathway. Since hSpry2 did not have any effect at the level of receptor interaction with FRS2, our focus shifted to the next key point downstream; the possible effects on Ras activity.hSpry2 Does Not Inhibit the Activity of RasThe activation status of Ras was measured as described under âMaterials and Methods.â The main component of the assay was a recombinant protein derived from Raf that contains a domain capable of binding only to GTP-bound Ras (Raf-1 Ras binding domain). 293T cells were transfected with various combinations of constructs for FGFR1 and Spry isoforms. The results shown in Fig. 3indicate that although transfected FGFR1 significantly enhanced the level of GTP-Ras, hSpry2 co-transfected into cells had no significant effect on these levels. Equal loading of whole cell lysates showed an inhibition of endogenous phospho-ERK by hSpry2, as demonstrated in previous experiments. Similar results were obtained in three such experiments. Accumulated data therefore indicated that hSpry2 did not inhibit the Ras/MAP kinase pathway between the point of receptor activation and the activation of Ras. These data also rule out hSpry2's sequestration of Grb2 from SOS as a likely inhibitory mechanism. It was therefore necessary to assay the effect of hSpry2 on elements of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway downstream of Ras. It is apparent that there is some inhibition by mSpry1 and mSpry4, but it is very low compared with hSpry2.Figure 3Sprys do not inhibit FGFR1 activated Ras. 293T cells were transfected with FGFR1 FLAG-tagged Sprys (S1, S2, and S4) or empty vector constructs as indicated (C). Cell lysates were incubated with GST-Raf-1 Ras binding domain (RBD) agarose-conjugated beads. Bound proteins were denatured by boiling in reducing sample buffer and then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis to detect Ras-GTP using a monoclonal anti-Ras. Aliquots of the same cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phospho-ERK1/2 and other related proteins were detected by immunoblotting (IB) as indicated. (S1, Sprouty1; S2, Sprouty2;S4, Sprouty4; PD, pull-down.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)hSpry2 Inhibits ERK Phosphorylation Downstream of Ras and Upstream of MEK and ERKExperiments were carried out to locate the position of MAP kinase inhibition along the pathway from Ras to ERK. This pathway essentially involves three proteins: the G-protein Ras, which activates the protein kinase Raf; Raf which activates Mek; and Mek, which in turn activates ERK.We took advantage of mutations in Ras, Raf, and Mek that cause an auto-activation of each of these respective proteins. Constructs were transfected into 293T cells along with FLAG-tagged ERK2 and HA-tagged Spry isoforms. In each of these experiments, the cells were lysed, and the lysates were precipitated with anti-FLAG beads and analyzed by Western blotting using phospho-ERK1/2 antibody to ascertain the activation status of ERK (MAP kinase). The data from Fig.4A show that hSpry2 can inhibit the phosphorylation (activation) of ERK2 downstream of active Ras (V12). A distinct inhibition of phosphorylated ERK2 was also observed in the mSpry1-transfected cells; however, the degree of inhibition by hSpry2 was more profound, and we subsequently focused more on the effects of this isoform. In addition, we demonstrated that the inhibition of activated ERK2 stimulated through the Ras mutant requires the full-length hSpry2 protein since neither the C- or N-terminal half was able to inhibit this activity (Fig.4B). Contrary to the inhibition of activated Ras-generated signals, full-length hSpry2 did not cause any detectable inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation when the constitutively active mutants of Raf (RafY340D) or Mek (MekS222D/S226D), respectively, were employed to activate the pathway (Fig. 4, C and D).Figure 4hSpry2 inhibits ERK phosphorylation downstream of Ras and upstream of MEK. 293T cells were transfected with the constitutively active Ras (RasV12) mutant, wild type FLAG-ERK2, HA-Sprys, or empty vector constructs as indicated (A). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates (IP) were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis to detect phospho-ERK2 and ERK2 levels using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-ERK2, respectively. Ras and Spry proteins were detected using anti-Ras and anti-HA in the total cell lysates, respectively. IB, immunoblots. Inhibition of phosphorylated ERK through active Ras requires the full-length hSpry2 (B). 293T cells were transfected with wild type FLAG-ERK2, constitutively active Ras (RasV12), HA-tagged full-length Spry2, the N- or C-terminal half of hSpry2, and empty vector constructs. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were resolved by Western blotting analysis to detect phospho-ERK2 and ERK2 using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (phospho-p42/44) and anti-ERK2, respectively. Other associated proteins in the cell lysates were detected using anti-Ras and anti-HA, respectively. Sprys do not inhibit ERK1/2 activation by the Raf (Y340D) mutant (C). 293T cells were transfected with wild type FLAG-ERK2, constitutively active mutants of Raf (RafY340D), HA-Sprys, or empty vector constructs as indicated. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis to detect phospho-ERK2 and ERK2 using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-ERK2, respectively. Raf and Spry proteins were detected in the cell lysates using anti-Raf and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. hSpry2 acts on the Ras/MAP kinase pathway upstream of MEK (D). 293T cells were transfected with wild type FLAG-ERK2, constitutively active mutants of Mek (MekS222D/S226D), HA-Sprys, or empty vector constructs as indicated. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis to detect phospho-ERK2 and ERK2 proteins using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-ERK2, respectively. MEK and Spry proteins were detected in the cell lysates using anti-HA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The above data indicate that hSpry2 is exerting its inhibitory effect at the level of activation of Raf. Raf has a complex mechanism of activation, and there currently appears to be some unidentified factors, especially kinases that may be involved. It would also appear from these data that hSpry2 should inhibit the MAP kinase pathway irrespective of what agonist stimulates it because the active Ras mutant used in this study is a generic stimulant that is independent of upstream pathways.hSpry2 Inhibits ERK Activation Induced by Î²-2 Adrenergic Receptor StimulationA wide range of agonists activates the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Sprouty has been shown to inhibit signaling pathways induced by receptor tyrosine kinases. Based on our results, we were interested in investigating the effects of hSpry when a non-RTK (for instance the isoprenaline activation of Î²2 adrenergic receptors (Î²2ARs)), was used to stimulate the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. To address this, 293T cells were transfected with constructs for Î²2AR, HA-tagged hSpry2, and FLAG-tagged ERK2. Forty-eight h post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with isoprenaline (100 Î¼m) for various times, the cells were lysed, and the lysates were subjected to Western analysis using anti-phospho ERK1/2 to detect the level of ERK phosphorylation. The data shown in Fig. 5demonstrate that ERK2 phosphorylation was elevated 5 min after isoprenaline addition and that this level was sustained for the next 25 min at least. hSpry2 substantially inhibited ERK2 phosphorylation to the degree that any level of phosphorylation in the data shown was only evident at 5 min. It has been reported that isoprenaline activation of Î²2AR can activate EGFR by âcross-talkâ and that this activation can contribute to the subsequent activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (28Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M. Miller W.E. Ahn S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9572-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The point illustrated by the above experiment is that it appears hSpry2 will inhibit the Ras/MAP kinase pathway downstream of activated Ras in a manner that is not dependent on the mode of pathway activation.Figure 5hSpry2 inhibits ERK activation induced by Î²2 adrenergic receptor stimulation.293T cells transfected with HA-hSpry2 and Î²2 adrenergic receptor were serum-depleted overnight and subsequently stimulated with isoprenaline (100 Î¼m) for various times. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody. The anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates (IP) were resolved by Western blotting analysis to detect phospho-ERK2 and ERK2 using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (phospho-p42/44) and anti-ERK2, respectively. Other associated proteins in the cell lysates were detected using anti-HA. IB, immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The accumulated data indicate that hSpry2 is the predominant inhibitor of the Ras/MAP kinase and that its inhibitory effect is exerted at the level of Raf activation. In this case, hSpry2 should inhibit the activation of Raf.hSpry2 Inhibits the Activation of RafThe effect of the various Spry isoforms on the status of Raf stimulation downstream of active FGFR1 was analyzed. FGFR1 was transiently expressed in 293T cells, and Raf kinase activity was measured by a coupled assay using GST-MEK, GST-ERK, and GST-Elk or myelin basic protein as sequential substrates. The assay measures the phosphotransferase activity in anin vitro kinase cascade reaction initiated in the immunocomplex by active Raf-1. The results show that FGFR1 significantly stimulated the Raf kinase activity in comparison with the vector control. When the cells were co-transfected with the various Spry isoforms, it can be seen that hSpry2 profoundly reduced the level of Raf kinase activity, whereas mSpry1 and mSpry4 caused lesser inhibition (Fig. 6A). A parallel inhibition of phosphorylated ERK2 was observed with hSpry2 overexpression, using the same cell lysates and Western blotting detection (Fig. 6B). In essence, hSpry2, in comparison with mSpry1 and mSpry4, causes a more profound inhibition of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, and this down-regulation occurs at the level of Raf kinase activation.Figure 6Effect of Sprys on activated Raf-1 byFGFR1. 293T cells were transfected with empty vector (V), FGFR1 (C), or FGFR1 and FLAG-Sprys (S1, S2, and S4) constructs as indicated. Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates, and Raf activity was assessed by an in vitro coupled kinase assay in which recombinant MEK, ERK, and Elk-1 were used. Raf-1 activity was determined quantitatively by scintillation counting of the P81 phosphocellulose squares spotted with the assay product. Background c"

In this study, the apoptotic potential of apicidin and its mechanism in HL60 cells was investigated. Treatment of HL60 cells with apicidin caused a decrease in viable cell number in a dose-dependent manner and an increase in DNA fragmentation, nuclear morphological change, and apoptotic body formation, concomitant with progressive accumulation of hyperacetylated histone H4. In addition, apicidin converted the procaspase-3 form to catalytically active effector protease, resulting in subsequent cleavages of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and p21WAF1/Cip1. Incubation of HL60 cells with z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, almost completely abrogated apicidin-induced activation of caspase-3, DNA fragmentation, and cleavages of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and p21WAF1/Cip1. Moreover, these effects were preceded by an increase in translocation of Bax into the mitochondria, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and cleavage of procaspase-9. The addition of cycloheximide greatly inhibited activation of caspase-3 by apicidin by interfering with cleavage of procaspase-3 and DNA fragmentation, suggesting that apicidin-induced apoptosis was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Consistent with these results, apicidin transiently increased the expressions of both Fas and Fas ligand. Preincubation with NOK-1 monoclonal antibody, which prevents the Fas-Fas ligand interaction and is inhibitory to Fas signaling, interfered with apicidin-induced translocation of Bax, cytochrome c release, cleavage of procaspase-3, and DNA fragmentation. Taken together, the results suggest that apicidin might induce apoptosis through selective induction of Fas/Fas ligand, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. We previously reported that apicidin arrested human cancer cell growth through selective induction of p21WAF1/Cip1.

One pathway is initiated by engagement of the tumor necrosis factor or Fas receptors and thereby activate caspase-8 (18Martin D.A. Siegel R.M. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol.

The caspase proteolytic cascade is a central component of the cellular machinery of the apoptotic process.

These enzymes can be divided into two groups; they are initiator caspases such as caspase-8 and caspase-9, whose main function is to activate downstream caspases, and executor caspases such as caspases-3, -6, and -7, which are responsible for dismantling cellular proteins. A number of caspase-3 substrates have now been identified, including protein kinases, the retinoblastoma protein, cytoskeletal proteins, and DNA fragmentation-inducing proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2088231104,"ATR, a human phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase, is an important component of the cellular response to DNA damage. In the present study, we evaluated the role of ATR in modulating the response of cells to S phase-associated DNA double-stranded breaks induced by topoisomerase poisons. Prolonged exposure to low doses of the topoisomerase I poison topotecan (TPT) resulted in S phase slowing because of diminished DNA synthesis at late-firing replicons. In contrast, brief TPT exposure, as well as prolonged exposure to the topoisomerase II poison etoposide, resulted in subsequent G2 arrest. These responses were associated with phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Chk1. The cell cycle responses and phosphorylation of Chk1 were markedly diminished by forced overexpression of a dominant negative, kinase-inactive allele of ATR. In contrast, deficiency of the related kinase ATM had no effect on these events. The loss of ATR-dependent checkpoint function sensitized GM847 human fibroblasts to the cytotoxic effects of the topoisomerase I poisons TPT and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, as assessed by inhibition of colony formation, increased trypan blue uptake, and development of apoptotic morphological changes. Expression of kdATR also sensitized GM847 cells to the cytotoxic effects of prolonged low dose etoposide and doxorubicin, albeit to a smaller extent. Collectively, these results not only suggest that ATR is important in responding to the replication-associated DNA damage from topoisomerase poisons, but also support the view that ATM and ATR have unique roles in activating the downstream kinases that participate in cell cycle checkpoints.

Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Google Scholar, 9Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar, 10Chaturvedi P. Eng W.K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X.

O'Connell M.J. Khanna K.K. Bugg S.J. Hogg A. Scott S.P. Hobson K. Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 249-256Google Scholar) observed that Chk1 overexpression can complement the G2/M checkpoint defect in AT cells and restore IR resistance. These results suggest redundancy and overlap in the specific roles of ATM and ATR. Several observations indicate that ATM and ATR are also important in the intra-S checkpoint, a series of biochemical reactions that inhibit DNA synthesis in the face of DNA damage or stalled replication forks (12Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Google Scholar, 13Clarke D.J. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 351-363Google Scholar, 14Walworth N.C. Curr. Opin.

ATM has been shown recently to initiate signaling through Chk2 and Cdc25A to inhibit Cdk2 and prevent DNA synthesis after IR (1Falck J. Malland N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Google Scholar). The response of AT cells to other inhibitors of DNA replication, however, appears intact despite the absence of functional ATM (10Chaturvedi P. Eng W.K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K. Winkler J.D. Zhou B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation that several proteins known to be regulated by ATM can still be activated by IR in AT cells (10Chaturvedi P. Eng W.K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K. Winkler J.D. Zhou B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Google Scholar) indicates that at least one additional upstream regulatory protein can initiate the S phase checkpoint. The possibility that ATR might play this role was initially suggested by the observation that ATR inhibition results in hypersensitivity to the replication inhibitors hydroxyurea and aphidicolin (2Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Google Scholar). Subsequent results indicated that ATR phosphorylates Chk1 in response to hydroxyurea (4Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Google Scholar). More recent experiments demonstrated thatXenopus ATR associates with chromatin in a replication-dependent manner, whereas ATM and DNA-PK do not (15Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Google Scholar). Interestingly, depletion of ATR in a cell-free Xenopusreplication system blocked the Chk1 phosphorylation that ordinarily occurs after treatment with inhibitors of DNA replication (15Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that ATR is poised to respond to DNA damage occurring specifically during S phase. In contrast to IR, which induces multiple types of DNA damage throughout the cell cycle (16Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Google Scholar), the topo I poison CPT and its derivatives produce a single type of DNA lesion that is largely replication-dependent (17Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Google Scholar, 18Kaufmann S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 195-211Google Scholar, 19Fiorani P. Bjornsti M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Early studies demonstrated that CPT is selectively toxic during S phase (22Li L.H. Fraser T.J. Olin E.J. Bhuyan B.K. Cancer Res. 1972; 32: 2643-2650Google Scholar, 23Horwitz S.B. Horwitz M.S.

Cell Res. 1991; 193: 27-35Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations demonstrated that this S phase selectivity reflects the formation of DNA ds breaks when advancing replication forks collide with drug-stabilized topo I-DNA complexes (26Avemann K. Knipper R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3026-3034Google Scholar, 27Hsiang Y.-H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082Google Scholar, 28Shin C.G. Snapka R.M. Biochem.

Additional studies revealed that brief exposure of exponentially growing cells to high CPT concentrations produces a subsequent G2 arrest (30Tobey R.A. Cancer Res. 1972; 32: 2720-2725Google Scholar) as a consequence of impaired activation of cdc2-cyclin B complexes (31Tsao Y.P. D'Arpa P. Liu L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1823-1829Google Scholar). In contrast, prolonged treatment with lower, therapeutically achievable CPT concentrations causes S phase slowing (32Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Google Scholar, 33Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035Google Scholar, 34Mullany S. Svingen P.A. Kaufmann S.H. Erlichman C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 391-399Google Scholar). Although it has been observed that CPT-induced S phase arrest is abolished by 7-hydroxystaurosporine (33Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035Google Scholar), an inhibitor of Chk1 and tac1 (35Graves P.R. Yu L. Schwarz J.K. Gales J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5600-5605Google Scholar, 36Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112Google Scholar), other events that lie upstream of the CPT-induced G2 and S phase arrests have remained unclear. The present study examines the role of ATR in the response to CPT derivatives. Because deletion of ATR is lethal at an early stage of development (37Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402Google Scholar), studying the function of this kinase in mammalian cells has been difficult. Previous studies have demonstrated that ATR enzymatic activity and function can be abrogated by overexpression of a kinase-inactivated ATR allele (2Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Google Scholar). We have utilized cells expressing this kdATR allele in an inducible fashion to (i) evaluate the role of ATR in the G2 and S phase checkpoint activation after topo poisons, (ii) determine whether the abrogation of these checkpoints is related to altered phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2, and (iii) assess the effect altered ATR function on the cytotoxic affects of topo poisons. Results of these studies provide the first evidence that ATR plays a major role in checkpoint activation and cell survival in cells with replication-associated DNA ds breaks. TPT was obtained from the Pharmaceutical Resources Branch of the National Cancer Institute. SN-38 was provided by Pharmacia. Additional reagents were purchased from the following suppliers: etoposide from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), paclitaxel and doxorubicin from Sigma, nocodazole from Aldrich, and G418 from Invitrogen. The following murine monoclonal antibodies were utilized: C-21 anti-topo I (Y.-C. Cheng, Yale University Medical School, New Haven, CT), Ki-S1 anti-topo IIÎ± (13Clarke D.J. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 351-363Google Scholar, 14Walworth N.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 697-704Google Scholar) (Dr. Udo Kellner, Kiel, Germany), anti-Chk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Chk2 (Dr. Junjie Chen, Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN), and anti-BrdUrd (Becton Dickinson). In addition, affinity-purified epitope-specific rabbit antisera that recognize phospho-345Ser-Chk1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and phospho-Thr68-Chk2 (Junjie Chen), as well as goat anti-Chk1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), were used. Affinity-purified peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were purchased from Kierkegaard and Perry (Gaithersburg, MD). GM847 is an SV40-transformed fibroblast line. The GM847/kdATR line was previously constructed to contain a kinase-inactive allele of ATR under the positive control of a doxycycline-responsive promoter (2Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Google Scholar). GM847/kdATR cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (medium A) supplemented with 400 Î¼g/ml G418. At the start of each experiment, cells were grown in the absence or presence of 1 Î¼g/ml doxycycline for 48 h in medium A. Varying concentrations of TPT or etoposide were then added for the indicated length of time. At the completion of this incubation, cells were then washed and plated in drug-free medium A in the continued presence or absence of doxycycline for the indicated length of time. Trypan blue exclusion, apoptotic morphological changes, and cell cycle distribution were then assayed as described below. AT4BI, an SV40-transformed fibroblast line from a homozygous AT patient, was obtained from Patrick Concannon (Virginia Mason Research Center, Seattle, WA) and cultured in medium A. Treatments with TPT and etoposide were performed as described above. For clonogenic assays, aliquots containing 5000 cells grown in the absence or presence of doxycycline were plated in triplicate 35-mm dishes, permitted to adhere overnight, treated with the indicated drug for 2 or 24 h, and incubated for 12â14 days to allow colonies to form. At the completion of this incubation, cells were stained with Coomassie Blue; and colonies containing â¥50 cells were manually counted. Control plates typically contained 140â180 colonies. To assess apoptotic morphological changes, adherent and floating cells were pooled, washed once with PBS, fixed with 3:1 (v/v) methanol:acetic acid, stained with 1 Î¼g/ml Hoechst 33258, and examined by fluorescence microscopy (38Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Martins L.M. Mesner Jr., P.W. Davidson N.E. Earnshaw W.C. Armstrong D.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15927-15936Google Scholar). A duplicate unfixed sample was stained with 0.2% trypan blue to determine cell viability. Control and treated cells were fixed in 50% ethanol, washed, digested with RNase A, stained with propidium iodide, and subjected to flow microfluorimetry on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) as described previously (38Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Martins L.M. Mesner Jr., P.W. Davidson N.E. Earnshaw W.C. Armstrong D.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15927-15936Google Scholar). For BrdUrd incorporation studies, cells were pretreated with 125 nm TPT or diluent for 8 h. BrdUrd was then added to a final concentration of 20 Î¼m for 30 min. Cells were then washed and incubated for an additional 0â8 h in TPT or diluent. At the completion of the incubation, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged at 1000 Ã g, washed in ice-cold PBS, and fixed in 66% (v/v) ethanol at â20 Â°C. After rehydration with PBS, samples were incubated with 0.04% (w/v) pepsin in 0.1 n HCl for 30 min, washed in PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) Tween 20 (PBS-T), incubated in 2n HCl for 30 min at 37 Â°C, neutralized with 0.1m sodium borate, and washed again in PBS-T. All further steps were performed in the dark at 20â22 Â°C unless otherwise indicated. Samples were incubated with anti-BrdUrd antibody for â¥1 h, washed in PBS-T, treated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min, washed in PBS-T, incubated for 20 min at 37 Â°C in PBS-T supplemented with 20 Î¼g/ml propidium iodide and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, and subjected to flow cytometry. BrdUrd incorporation and cell cycle distribution were analyzed using Becton Dickinson CellQuest software. GM847/kdATR cells grown in the absence or presence of doxycycline for 48 h were solubilized in buffer consisting of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 250 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Î±-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 150 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol. After preparation for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (38Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Martins L.M. Mesner Jr., P.W. Davidson N.E. Earnshaw W.C. Armstrong D.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15927-15936Google Scholar), polypeptides (40 Î¼g of protein) were separated on 5â15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed (38Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Martins L.M. Mesner Jr., P.W. Davidson N.E. Earnshaw W.C. Armstrong D.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15927-15936Google Scholar) using the reagents listed above. The effects of TPT and etoposide on Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation were assessed by subjecting Chk1 and Chk2 immunoprecipitates to blotting with phosphoepitope-specific antibodies. This analysis was impaired by the presence of a heavy IgG band on immunoblots. To reduce the IgG signal, antibodies were covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads using 20 mm dimethylpimelmidate in 0.2 msodium borate, pH 9.0, as described in Ref. 39Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1988: 522-523Google Scholar. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 m ethanolamine. After beads were thoroughly washed, cell lysates (prepared in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mmNaC1, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 2 Î¼g/ml antipain, 10 nmmicrocystin, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Î²-glycerol phosphate, and 10 mm NaF) were reacted overnight with 15 Î¼l of beads (packed volume) containing covalently bound Chk1 or Chk2 antibodies. After beads were washed twice with PBS, polypeptides were eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated on 12% acrylamide gels, and probed with antibodies as described in the individual figure legends. Experiments described below were designed to assess the potential role of ATR in modulating the response to DNA damage from topo poisons. For these studies, we employed GM847/kdATR, a recently described cell line that contains cDNA encoding kdATR under the positive control of a doxycycline-responsive promoter (2Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Google Scholar, 40Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar). In the presence of doxycycline, the kdATR expressed by these cells diminishes the ability of endogenous ATR to phosphorylate itself (2Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Google Scholar) and downstream substrates such as p53 and human Chk1 in response to DNA damage (3Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Google Scholar, 4Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Google Scholar). To assess the effect of ATR on G2arrest, 2Because GM847 cells lack p53 function, G1 arrest is not observed after DNA damage. cells grown in the absence or presence of doxycycline were exposed to 125 nmTPT for 2 h, 3The concentration of 125 nm was chosen because it has minimal effect on cell survival after a 2-h exposure (Fig. 6C), yet alters cell cycle distribution. washed, incubated in the continued absence or presence of doxycycline for 24 h, and harvested for flow cytometry. Cells grown in the absence of doxycycline underwent a TPT-induced G2 arrest, with the percentage of cells in G2/M increasing from 15% prior to TPT treatment to 42% 24 h later (Fig.1A). In contrast, cells expressing the kdATR allele had a markedly diminished G2arrest after TPT treatment, with the G2/M population increasing from 15% prior to treatment to only 24% after TPT exposure (Fig. 1B). Analysis at later time points demonstrated that this TPT-induced G2 arrest was transient in the presence of the kdATR allele, with return to essentially a pretreatment cell cycle distribution by 48 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the G2 arrest was more persistent in the presence of normal ATR function (Fig. 1A, 48 h). Prolonged exposure to topo I poisons results in slowing of DNA replication (32Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Google Scholar, 33Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035Google Scholar, 34Mullany S. Svingen P.A. Kaufmann S.H. Erlichman C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 391-399Google Scholar), presumably because of activation of the S phase checkpoint by replication-induced conversion of the stabilized DNA-topo I complexes into frank DNA ds breaks (26Avemann K. Knipper R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3026-3034Google Scholar, 27Hsiang Y.-H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082Google Scholar, 28Shin C.G. Snapka R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 135-140Google Scholar, 29Ryan A.J. Squires S. Strutt H.L. Johnson R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3295-3300Google Scholar). To evaluate the possibility that ATR might also function as part of this S phase checkpoint, we pretreated cells for 48 h with doxycycline (to inactivate ATR function) or diluent, then exposed them to 125 nm TPT for 8 h in the continued presence or absence of doxycycline. At this point cells were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd and returned to TPT-containing medium in the presence or absence of doxycycline for varying lengths of time. After staining with anti-BrdUrd and propidium iodide, the fate of the cells that synthesized DNA in the presence of TPT was then determined by multiparameter flow cytometry. Control cells (no doxycycline or TPT) uniformly incorporated BrdUrd throughout S phase after a 30-min pulse (t = 0 indicates time after the BrdUrd pulse) (Fig. 2A, gated). By 8 h after completion of the pulse, the majority of the labeled cells had completed S phase in the absence of DNA damaging agents (Fig.2Aâ², gated). These results provide a base line for comparison. When cells were exposed to TPT for 8 h (no doxycycline), an increased S phase population was observed (19% of total cells in Fig.2B versus 11% in Fig. 2A), reflecting the previously reported S phase slowing. In addition, consistent with S phase checkpoint activity, these cells incorporated decreased amounts of BrdUrd into DNA, particularly when they were in late S phase (Fig. 2B,arrowhead). Moreover, with continued TPT incubation, fewer labeled cells progressed to G2 relative to untreated cells. By 8 h after the completion of the BrdUrd pulse, almost all of the labeled cells were still in late S phase (17% of total cell population, Fig. 2Bâ², gated, versus 19% at start of incubation), again reflecting S phase arrest as a consequence of checkpoint activation. Expression of the kdATR allele abrogated all of these features of the S phase checkpoint (Fig. 2, C and Câ²). In particular, cells grown in the presence of doxycycline appeared to incorporate label equally throughout S phase after TPT treatment (Fig.2C, gated). Moreover, the majority of these cells had completed S phase 8 h after pulse labeling (Fig. 2Câ², gated), indicating that they progressed through S phase at a rate similar to that of untreated cells (Fig. 2Aâ², gated). These findings demonstrate that ATR is required for TPT-induced inhibition of DNA replication. The observation that the kdATR allele diminishes both G2 arrest (Fig. 1) and S phase slowing (Fig. 2) after TPT treatment suggested that ATR may be signaling for cell cycle arrest via Chk1 and/or Chk2, known upstream components of the G2 and S phase checkpoints. To assess these possibilities, GM847/kdATR cells grown in the absence or presence of doxycycline were exposed to 125 nm TPT for increasing lengths of time and then analyzed for the presence of phosphorylated Chk1 and Chk2. These experiments indicated that TPT treatment resulted in Chk1 phosphorylation (cf. Fig.3A, lanes 3,5, and 7). This phosphorylation was evident within 2 h (Fig. 3A, lane 3) and persisted for at least 24 h (Fig. 3A, lane 7). Expression of kdATR markedly diminished this Chk1 phosphorylation (Fig.3A, lanes 4, 6, and 8). These results indicate that Chk1 phosphorylation correlates with the intra-S phase slowing (Fig. 2, B and Bâ²), and abrogation of Chk1 phosphorylation correlates with loss of the S phase checkpoint (Fig. 2, C and Câ²). In contrast, phosphorylation of Chk2 does not correlate with the effects of ATR. In particular, prolonged TPT treatment causes a detectable increase in Chk2 phosphorylation (cf. Fig.3B, lanes 1 and 7) that occurs independent of ATR status (Fig. 3B, lane 8), suggesting that TPT-induced Chk2 phosphorylation occurs by an ATR-independent mechanism and is not responsible for the TPT-induced checkpoint activation. Topo I poisons are almost exclusively dependent upon DNA replication for the formation of secondary DNA strand breaks, whereas topo II poisons such as etoposide depend somewhat more upon RNA transcription to generate these lesions (17Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Google Scholar, 18Kaufmann S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 195-211Google Scholar, 24D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924Google Scholar, 41Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1129-1136Google Scholar). Accordingly, topo II poisons are thought to generate DNA ds breaks throughout the cell cycle. In view of this dichotomy, we investigated whether functional inactivation of ATR affected the response of cells to the topo II poison etoposide. As indicated in Fig. 4A, treatment of GM847/kdATR cells with 300 nm etoposide for 24 h resulted in a prominent G2 arrest (44% cells in G2versus 16%, untreated). Induction of the kdATR allele for 24 h before addition of etoposide diminished the number of cells arrested in G2 (Fig. 4B, 35%versus 16% untreated), although the effect was smaller than that observed with TPT. In addition, there was a relative increase in the number of cells passing through M to G1 (42% G1 in the presence of doxycycline versus 26% G1 in its absence; Fig. 4, A andB).2 These results suggest that ATR also plays a role in the cell cycle response to etoposide-induced DNA damage. Consistent with this conclusion, etoposide-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 (Fig. 4C, lanes 3, 5, and7), but not Chk2 (Fig. 4D, lanes 4 and5), was abrogated by overexpression of the kdATR allele. To rule out the possibility that the effects of kdATR described above result from inhibition of the related kinase ATM, we analyzed the effects of topo poisons on the ATM-deficient SV40-transformed human fibroblast line AT4BI. Prolonged exposure of these cells to 125 nm TPT resulted in marked S phase accumulation (49% with TPT versus 25% untreated, Fig. 5A). In addition, prolonged exposure to 300 nm etoposide resulted in G2 arrest (41% with etoposide versus 18% untreated, Fig. 5B). These results indicate that ATM is not required for the TPT-induced S phase arrest or the etoposide-induced G2 arrest observed in Figs. 2A and4A, respecti"

We have examined the spontaneous and CHI-catalyzed cyclization reactions of 4,2â²,4â²,6â²-tetrahydroxychalcone, 4,2â²,4â²-trihydroxychalcone, 2â²,4â²-dihydroxychalcone, and 4,2â²-dihydroxychalcone into the corresponding flavanones. The pH dependence of flavanone formation indicates that both the non-enzymatic and enzymatic reactions first require the bulk phase ionization of the substrate 2â²-hydroxyl group and subsequently on the reactivity of the newly formed 2â²-oxyanion during C-ring formation. Solvent viscosity experiments demonstrate that at pH 7.5 the CHI-catalyzed cyclization reactions of 4,2â²,4â²,6â²-tetrahydroxychalcone, 4,2â²,4â²-trihydroxychalcone, and 2â²,4â²-dihydroxychalcone are â¼90% diffusion-controlled, whereas cyclization of 4,2â²-dihydroxychalcone is limited by a chemical step that likely reflects the higher pK a of the 2â²-hydroxyl group. At pH 6.0, the reactions with 4,2â²,4â²,6â²-tetrahydroxychalcone and 4,2â²,4â²-trihydroxychalcone are â¼50% diffusion-limited, whereas the reactions of both dihydroxychalcones are limited by chemical steps. Comparisons of the 2.1â2.3 A resolution crystal structures of CHI complexed with the products 7,4â²-dihydroxyflavanone, 7-hydroxyflavanone, and 4â²-hydroxyflavanone show that the 7-hydroxyflavanones all share a common binding mode, whereas 4â²-hydroxyflavanone binds in an altered orientation at the active site. Our functional and structural studies support the proposal that CHI accelerates the stereochemically defined intramolecular cyclization of chalcones into biologically active (2S)-flavanones by selectively binding an ionized chalcone in a conformation conducive to ring closure in a diffusion-controlled reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1985554733,"(â)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is an important bioactive constituent of green tea that efficiently reduces epidermal cancer cell proliferation. This inhibition is associated with a reduction in activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor level and activity. However, its effects on AP1 function in normal epidermal cells have not been extensively explored. Our present studies show that EGCG regulates normal keratinocyte function. To understand the mechanism of action, we examined the effects of EGCG on AP1 factor activity, MAPK signal transduction, and expression of the AP1 factor-regulated human involucrin (hINV) gene. EGCG increases hINV promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner that requires the presence of an intact hINV promoter AP1 factor binding site. This response appears to be physiologic, as endogenous hINV gene expression is also increased. Fra-1, Fra-2, FosB, JunB, JunD, c-Jun, and c-Fos levels are increased by EGCG treatment, as is AP1 factor binding to hINV promoter AP1 site. Gel mobility shift studies show that this complex contains Fra-1 and JunD. Signal transduction analysis indicates that the EGCG response requires Ras, MEKK1, MEK3, and p38 kinases. Kinase assays and inhibitor studies suggest that p38Î´ is the p38 isoform responsible for the regulation. These changes are also associated with a cessation of cell proliferation and enhanced cornified envelope formation. These studies show that in normal human keratinocytes EGCG markedly increases, via a MAPK signaling mechanism, AP1 factor-associated responses.

These changes include an EGCG-dependent reduction in phorbol ester-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity (6Chen W. Dong Z. Valcic S. Timmermann B.N. Bowden G.T. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and reduced AP1 factor level and activity (7Barthelman M. Bair III, W.B. Stickland K.K. Chen W. Timmermann B.N. Valcic S.

Based on these studies, it has been suggested that the cancer-preventive role of EGCG may be due, in part, to its ability to reduce AP1 factor-related responses (6Chen W. Dong Z. Valcic S. Timmermann B.N. Bowden G.T. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Barthelman M. Bair III, W.B. Stickland K.K. Chen W. Timmermann B.N. Valcic S. Dong Z.

However, very little information is available regarding how EGCG effects AP1 factor-regulated responses in normal keratinocytes. Our present studies show that EGCG increases AP1 factor levels in normal keratinocytes, and increases human involucrin gene expression: an AP1 factor-controlled marker of keratinocyte differentiation (15Rice R.H. Green H. Cell. 1979; 18: 681-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). EGCG also increases cornified envelope formation. In addition, our study suggests that this EGCG-dependent regulation is mediated via a MAPK cascade that includes Ras, MEKK1, MEK3, and p38Î´. Thus, in marked contrast to the EGCG-dependent decrease in AP1 factor function that is observed in cancer cells, EGCG increases AP1 factor activity and AP1 factor-dependent gene expression in normal keratinocytes. These results suggest that the mechanism of EGCG action is markedly different in normal and transformed cells.

Third passage keratinocytes, growing in 9.5-cm2 area dishes, were transfected when â¼70% confluent. For transfection, 4 Î¼l of Fugene was added to 96 Î¼l of KSFM and incubated at 25 Â°C for 5 min. The mixture was then mixed with 2 Î¼g of involucrin promoter reporter plasmid or, for co-transfection experiments, with 1 Î¼g of involucrin reporter plasmid and 1 Î¼g of a second plasmid. The mixture was incubated at 25 Â°C for 15 min and then added directly to the cultures in 2 ml of KSFM. The final DNA concentration in all groups was adjusted to 2 Î¼g of DNA/4 Î¼l of Fugene-6 reagent/9.5-cm2 dish by addition of empty expression vector. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with KSFM in the presence or absence of EGCG. After an additional 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in 250 Î¼l of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and harvested by scraping. Luciferase activity was assayed immediately using Promega luciferase assay kit and a Berthold luminometer. All assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Luciferase activity was normalized per microgram of protein as described previously (17Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was normalized using a green fluorescent protein-encoding expression vector. Cultured keratinocytes, grown in KSFM until 80% confluent, were treated with or without 20 Î¼g/ml EGCG for 24 h prior to preparation of total cell/nuclear extracts as described previously (17Efimova T.

Nuclear extracts were prepared according to method of Schreiber et al. (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) in the presence of proteinase inhibitors including leupeptin (10 Î¼g/ml), aprotinin (10 Î¼g/ml), p-benzamide (100 Î¼m), and pepstatin (2 Î¼g/ml). The protein content was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Binding of transcription factors to the hINV promoter AP1-1 site was detected using gel mobility shift assay. Five micrograms of nuclear extract was incubated for 10 min at room temperature in a total volume of 20 Î¼l containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 Î¼g/ml poly(dI-dC), and 100,000 cpm of radioactive double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide. The nucleotide, 5â²-TGTGGTGAGTCAGGAAGGGGTT (AP1 site in bold), was end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [Î³-32P]ATP. For competition studies, radioinert DNA competitor was added to the DNA binding reaction at 10- or 100-fold molar excess. For supershift assays, AP1 factor-specific antibodies (4 Î¼g) were added to the reaction mixture after the initial 10 min incubation, and the incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at 25 Â°C. In control reactions, the AP1 antibody was replaced with a nonspecific antibody. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel using 0.25Ã TBE running buffer. The gel was then dried and the radioactivity detected by autoradiography. Keratinocytes were seeded at 10,000 cells/cm2 in 9.5-cm2 dishes in KSFM and allowed to grow for 48 h. The cells were then treated by addition of fresh KSFM in the presence of increasing concentrations of EGCG. After 4 days, the cells were harvested with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.025% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA, fixed in isotonic buffer containing 4% formaldehyde, and counted using a Coulter counter. Cornified envelopes were counted as previously described (32Agarwal C. Rorke E.A. Irwin J.C. Eckert R.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3982-3989PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gorodeski G.I. Eckert R.L. Utian W.H. Sheean L. Rorke E.A. Differentiation. 1989; 42: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether EGCG regulates AP1 factor-dependent events in keratinocytes, we examined its ability to regulate gene expression. Involucrin is a well studied, AP1-responsive marker of keratinocyte differentiation (18Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Normal keratinocytes were transfected with pINV-2473, a plasmid that encodes the full-length hINV promoter (18Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and then treated for 24 h with 20 Î¼g/ml EGCG or 50 ng/ml TPA. As shown in Fig. 1A, EGCG increases hINV promoter activity nearly as efficiently as TPA. As shown in Fig. 1B, the EGCG-associated increase is concentration-dependent with a 7-fold increase at 20 Î¼g of EGCG/ml. To assure that this response is physiologically relevant, we measured the effect of EGCG treatment on accumulation of endogenous hINV protein. As shown in Fig. 1C, EGCG increases endogenous hINV protein levels. Treatment with TPA, shown as a positive control, produces a similar level of increase. To determine whether the EGCG-associated response is linked to AP1 sites within the hINV promoter, we tested the response of a series of hINV promoter 5â² deletion constructs (18Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 35Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig.2A shows that constructs pINV-241 and pINV-128 respond to EGCG with a 3â4-fold increase in promoter activity. Plasmids pINV-110 and pINV-41, in contrast, were not responsive, suggesting that the relevant EGCG-response element is located within the segment spanning nucleotides â128 to â110. Previous studies show that the â128/â110 region of the hINV promoter contains functional Ets factor binding sties (EBS-2), and an activator protein 1 (AP1-1) transcription factor binding site (18Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the EGCG response is mediated via these elements. Fig. 2B shows that the mutation of EBS-2 site does not influence the EGCG-associated increase in promoter activity. However, in contrast, mutation of the AP1-1 site reduces overall activity and eliminates the EGCG-associated regulation. Thus, the AP1-1 site appears to be required for EGCG-dependent gene activation. To explore the mechanism responsible for this regulation, we monitored the effects of EGCG treatment on AP1 factor expression. As shown in Fig.3, EGCG treatment increases nuclear Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Fos, FosB, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD levels. To determine whether EGCG enhances AP1 factor DNA binding, we performed gel mobility shift assays using an hINV AP1-1 site-encoding oligonucleotide, 5â²-TGTGGTGAGTCAGGAAGGGGTT (AP1 binding motif in bold). Fig.4A reveals that EGCG markedly increases transcription factor binding to the hINV AP1-1 site. Moreover, this binding is specific, as addition of a 10- or 100-fold molar excess of radioinert oligonucleotide eliminates binding. In contrast, no inhibition of binding to the 32P-labeled AP1-1 oligonucleotide was observed in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide encoding a mutated AP1-1 binding site (data not shown). These results show that AP1 DNA binding is increased by EGCG. To identify the factors that interact with the AP1-1 site, nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled AP1-1 in the presence or absence of antibodies reactive with specific Jun and Fos family members. As shown in Fig. 4B, only antibodies specific for Fra-1 and JunD produced supershifted bands (indicated byasterisks). No supershift was observed in extracts incubated with a nonspecific IgG, or antibodies specific for c-Fos, FosB, Fra-2, c-Jun, or JunB, suggesting that Fra-1 and JunD are the AP1 factors associated with the complex.Figure 4Gel mobility shift analysis of binding to AP1-1 element.A, nuclear extracts were prepared from near-confluent keratinocyte cultures following a 24-h treatment in the absence (â) or presence (+) of 20 Î¼g/ml EGCG. Nuclear extracts (N. Ext.) were then incubated with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligomer, 5â²-TGTGGTGAGTCAGGAAGGGGTT (32P-AP1-1), containing the hINV AP1-1-binding site (bold). Specific binding was demonstrated by including a 10- and 100-fold molar excess of homologous competitor oligonucleotide (AP1-1) during the binding reaction.

Genistein is an efficient inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, including the dual specificity MEK. Fig.5 shows that genistein causes a concentration-dependent reduction in hINV promoter activity, suggesting a role of MAPK pathways in this regulation. As Ras is an important regulator of MAPK cascade activity in keratinocytes (17Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we evaluated the role of Ras in the EGCG-dependent regulation. As shown in Fig.6A, expression of a dominant-negative form of Ras, dnRas, results in the complete suppression of the EGCG-dependent increase in hINV promoter activity. We next assessed the role of Raf-1 and MEKK1, kinases located immediately downstream of Ras. As shown in Fig. 6B, dominant-negative MEKK1 (dnMEKK1) efficiently inhibits EGCG action. In contrast, dominant-negative Raf-1 (dnRaf-1) does not alter the response. The immunoblot results (Fig. 6C) confirm that the expression vectors do produce dnRas, dnMEKK1, and dnRaf-1 in keratinocytes. MEKK1 is known to activate, in a stimulus- and cell type-specific manner, several MAPK modules (36Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). MEK4, MEK7, and MEK3 are direct downstream targets of MEKK1 (17Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27214-27220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated whether MEK4, MEK7, or MEK3 activity is required for the EGCG-dependent regulation. As shown in Fig.7A, dominant-negative forms of MEK4 or MEK7 do not inhibit hINV promoter activation. In contrast, expression of dnMEK3 completely inhibits promoter activation, suggesting that MEK3 activity is required for EGCG-dependent regulation. Fig. 7B shows that the vector-encoded kinase mutants are expressed in keratinocytes. To assess the ability of individual MAPKs to function as mediators of the EGCG/MEK3 signal, we measured the ability of various dnMAPKs to inhibit the EGCG-related response. Dominant-negative ERK2 slightly reduces the response, whereas dominant-negative ERK1 potentiates the EGCG-associated regulation (Fig.8A). In addition, dominant-negative JNK causes a slight reduction in the EGCG-dependent response (Fig. 8B). However, the most striking response is evoked by dnp38, which completely inhibits the response to EGCG (Fig. 8B). Fig. 8C shows that the vector-encoded dominant-negative kinases are expressed in keratinocytes. Based on these results, we suggest that EGCG regulates hINV gene expression via the pathway presented in Fig.8D. The above results argue that the EGCG-dependent signal is transmitted via activation of p38 MAPK. To further test this hypothesis, we performed p38 kinase activity assays. We also assayed for EGCG-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2. As shown in Fig.9A, a transient increase in ERK1/2 activity, as measured by ELK1 phosphorylation, is observed at 15â30 min after EGCG treatment. Total p38 activity, as measured based on ATF2 phosphorylation, is increased at 15 min and remains elevated at 4 h. JNK activity is not regulated. Immunological analysis, shown in Fig. 9B, indicates that these kinase activity changes are not caused by changes in JNK1/2, ERK1/2, or p38 levels. To determine whether the ERK activity observed in Fig. 9A is preferentially caused by activation of ERK1 or ERK2, we measured the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2. Fig. 9C shows that EGCG treatment is not associated with preferential activation of ERK1 or ERK2. To determine which p38 isoform is activated by EGCG, we expressed FLAG-tagged forms of each isoform in keratinocytes and then treated with EGCG. At various times after EGCG addition, the FLAG-p38 kinases were precipitated and assayed for ability to phosphorylated ATF2. Fig.9D shows that p38Î´ is the only form activated by EGCG. We next confirmed that the endogenous p38Î´ isoform is activated. As shown in Fig. 9E, p38Î´ levels are not altered by EGCG treatment (p38Î´), but activity (P-ATF2) increases within 15 min of EGCG treatment and remains elevated at 4 h. The observation that EGCG increases AP1 expression and hINV gene expression suggests that EGCG may enhance keratinocyte differentiation. Because differentiation is associated with reduced cell proliferation (38Itin P.H. Pittelkow M.R. Kumar R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Hanley K.

Subconfluent dishes of keratinocytes were treated with increasing concentrations of EGCG for 4 days and then harvested and counted. Theopen bars in each panel show that number of cells present on the first day of treatment. As shown in Fig.10A, keratinocyte cell number is markedly reduced by EGCG concentrations greater than 10 Î¼g/ml.

In contrast, the N-terminal domain of PrP is highly flexible and typically includes five tandem copies of a conserved octapeptide repeat motif (3,4,6).

In this paper, we use chemical modification to map histidine-dependent copper binding sites in native mouse PrP. Our results are discussed in the context of the physiology and pathobiology of PrP. Two recombinant proteins were used for these studies. Purified human PrP23â98 (HuPrP23â98) contains 80 amino acids including four identical octarepeat motifs of the form PHGGGWGQ (13Brown D.R.

Fig. 1, B andC show the amino acid sequences and predicted tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of HuPrP23â98 and MoPrP23â231. Prior to MALDI-MS analysis HuPrP23â98 (90 Î¼m) was incubated with 10-fold molar excess CuCl2, ZnCl2, NiSO4, MgCl2, CaCl2, MnCl2, or FeSO4 in 25 mmN-ethylmorpholine, 30 mm KCl (NEMO-KCl) buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 30 min. In some experiments, after incubation with or without these cations, HuPrP23â98 samples were reacted with 5-fold molar excess DEPC at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were then analyzed by using MALDI-MS without further purification. 5-fold molar excess DEPC was reacted with MoPrP23â231 (90 Î¼m) in NEMO-KCl buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. In some cases, prior to the DEPC reaction, the protein was incubated with 10-fold molar excess CuCl2 for 30 min. Sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) or chymotrypsin (Roche) (the ratio of enzyme:protein was 1:20) was used to digest the intact protein, carbethoxylated protein, and carbethoxylated copper-protein complex for 2 h at 37 Â°C (trypsin) or at room temperature (chymotrypsin). The samples were analyzed by MALDI-MS without further purification. MALDI-TOF-MS analyses were carried out by using a Perseptive Biosystem Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer as described previously (27Silverman G.L. Qin K. Moore R.C. Yang Y. Mastrangelo P. Tremblay P.

The accelerating voltage was set at 20 kV, grid voltage at 75%, guide wire voltage at 0.024%, and delay time at 100 ns. The timed ion selector was pre-set to the [M+H]+ mass of the peptide. The spectra were acquired in 10â13 segments with mirror ratios 1.0â0.13 and then assembled by the instrument software. Three-dimensional images of PrP121â231 were generated using the program RasMac v2.5 and the NMR co-ordinates from Protein Data Bank file IAG2 (2Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M.

Studies of PrP/metal interactions commenced with a human PrP N-terminal fragment, HuPrP23â98 (Fig.1B), previously characterized in an equilibrium dialysis study. In earlier analyses with this recombinant polypeptide fragment, Cu(II) was used in the form of an Cu(II)-glycine2 complex. These studies yielded a stoichiometry of 5.6 Â± 0.4 Cu(II) ions per peptide at saturation and binding curves indicating that between three and four Cu(II) ions are added to (or discharged from) PrP in a highly cooperative fashion (positive cooperativity, Hill coefficient = 3.4) (13Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since the studies presented here involve mass determinations (rather than competition between glycine and peptide molecules for Cu(II) ions), Cu(II) was presented without the intervention of an amino acid chelator. Metal-protein complexes were measured using saturated sinapinic acid in 20% acetonitrile as matrix. The measured mass [M+H]+ of untreated HuPrP23â98 was 7812.3 Da (calc. 7812.4 Da) (Fig. 2A). After incubation with 10Ã molar excess of CuCl2 in NEMO-KCl buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 30 min, the Cu(II)-HuPrP23â98 complex was detected by MALDI-MS. In addition to intact protein atm/z 7812.3 Da, peaks indicative of 1 Cu(II), 2 Cu(II), 3 Cu(II), and 4 Cu(II) were observed atm/z 7874.2 Da (calc. 7873.8 Da, assuming a mass of 63.5 for copper and expulsion of two protons from the polypeptide per bound metal ion), 7935.3 Da (calc. 7935.3 Da), 7998.3 Da (calc. 7996.8 Da), and 8061.8 Da (calc. 8058.3 Da) (Fig. 2B). These data are in close accord with other MALDI-MS data (14Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and are inferred to represent a stable association with four copper binding sites in the octarepeat repeat region. In independent electrospray ionization MS analyses (ESI-MS), where protein/metal solutions mixtures are introduced into the instrument still in the aqueous phase it is possible to detect two additional, weaker binding sites (i.e. fifth and sixth binding sites) tentatively positioned at the free amino group of the N terminus and involving histidine 95, respectively (15Whittal R.M.

Chymotrypsin digestion was used to confirm the location of the four copper binding sites detected by MALDI-MS. A peak atm/z 795.39 Da corresponding to C3, C4, C5, or C6 (GQPHGGGW, calc. 795.35 Da: see Fig. 1B) was observed in the absence of copper with a new peak at m/z 857.38 Da (calc. 857.35 Da) in the presence of copper, indicating that one metal ion bound to His-60, His-68, His-76, or His-84 (data not shown). Lastly, to detect whether other divalent ions bind to the N-terminal region of PrP, HuPrP23â98 (90 Î¼m) was incubated with 10-fold molar excess Zn(II), Ni(II), Mg(II), Ca(II), Mn(II), or Fe(II) in NEMO-KCl buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 30 min before MALDI-MS analysis. No signals corresponding to metal-HuPrP23â98 complexes were detected (Fig. 2, CâH). These results are in accord with other copper-binding experiments using N-terminal PrP peptides (e.g. Ref. 24Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 214: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar)) and validate the copper-binding behavior and metal selectivity of recombinant PrP23â98. The PrP23â98 substrate was used to explore the feasibility of mapping histidine-dependent copper binding sites by protection from DEPC modification. PrP23â98 in NEMO-KCl buffer, pH 7.4, was incubated with or without 10-fold molar excess Cu(II) for 30 min then reacted with 5-fold molar excess DEPC at room temperature for 30 min prior to MALDI-MS analysis. The intact HuPrP23â98 has a mass of 7812.4 Da (Fig.3A), whereas in the presence of DEPC, species were detected at m/z 7884.8, 7956.8, 8028.4, 8100.3, 8172.5, 8244.4, 8317.1, 8389.3, and 8461.8 Da (Fig. 3B). Based on a predicted mass shift of 72.06 per DEPC adduct, these signals were interpreted as 1 mono- (â1 mâ, calc. 7884.4 Da), 2 mono- (â2 mâ calc. 7956.4 Da), 3 mono- (â3 mâ calc. 8028.5 Da), and 4 mono- (â4 mâ, calc. 8100.5 Da), 5 mono- (â5 mâ, calc. 8172.6 Da), 6 mono- (â6 mâ, calc. 8244.7 Da), 7 mono- (â7 mâ, calc. 8316.7 Da), 8 mono- (â8 mâ, calc. 8388.8 Da), and 9 mono-carbethoxylation (â9mâ, calc. 8460.8 Da), with the largest peak amplitudes corresponding to four and five modifications. The addition of up to nine mono-carbethoxylations per peptide molecule may reflect the involvement of modifications on tyrosine and serine residues and perhaps the free N terminus, in addition to the five histidine residues (Fig. 1B). A distinct mass spectrum was obtained for carbethoxylated HuPrP23â98 formed subsequent to pre-incubation with Cu(II). Here the major species were determined as the starting peptide HuPrP23â98, 1 Cu(II) (7876.5 Da, calc. 7875.9 Da), 2 Cu(II) (7940.1 Da, calc. 7939.5 Da), 3 Cu(II) (8003.5 Da, calc. 8003.3 Da), 3 mono-carbethoxylation (8029.3 Da, calc. 8028.4 Da), 4 Cu(II) (8067.2 Da, calc. 8066.6 Da), 4 mono-carbethoxylation (8099.6 Da, calc. 8100.4 Da), 4 mono-carbethoxylation and 1 Cu(II) (8163.2 Da, calc. 8163.5 Da) (Fig.3C). Since the maximum number of mono-carbethoxylations observed for HuPrP23â98 is nine (Fig. 3B) while the maximum number of mono-carbethoxylation of pre-formed copper-HuPrP23â98 complexes is four (Fig. 3C), these data imply that five histidine residues within HuPrP23â98 are typically protected by Cu(II) from DEPC modification. Of interest, the largest peak heights in Cu(II)-treated samples corresponded to unmodified peptide or metal ion-peptide complexes with 1â3 copper ions. These results suggest that the 3â4 histidine residues that bind to copper with the greatest avidity are the residues most susceptible to DEPC modification in the naked peptide. Presumably a fraction of the metal-peptide complexes formed during the pre-incubation with Cu(II) are stripped of the metal ions during the MALDI-MS procedure, yielding a peak of free peptide. An alternative (but perhaps less likely) explanation is that PrP23â98-copper complexes with multiple metal ions undergo a conformational change such that all DEPC-reactive residues are shielded from or are less reactive with the chemical modification reagent. Again, dissociation of some metal-peptide complexes during the MALDI-MS procedure could yield the observed peak of free PrP23â98 peptide. To determine whether any other cations are involved in histidine-dependent coordination to HuPrP23â98, the peptide was incubated with 10-fold molar excess of other metals including Ca(II), Mg(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II) in NEMO-KCl buffer, pH 7.4, prior to reaction with DEPC. Peaks of 1â9 mono-carbethoxylations were found in samples incubated with Ca(II), Mg(II), and Mn (Fig. 3, DâF). These data are similar to the MALDI-MS spectrum of intact HuPrP23â98 reacted with DEPC (Fig.3B), except that maximum peak heights were observed at 3- and 4-mono-carboxylations, rather than at 4- and 5-mono-carboxylations. Thus, these three metals provide no significant protection of the HuPrP23â98 peptide. For Zn(II) and Ni(II) the largest peak amplitudes corresponded to yet lesser degrees of mono-carboxylation: 2- and 3-mono with Zn (II), or 1- and 2-mono with Ni(II) (Fig. 3, G andC). Signals deriving from intact peptide (7811.9 Da in Fig.3G, 7812.8 in Fig. 3H) can also be observed in these analyses. For HuPrP28â98 incubated with Ni(II) or Zn(II), the maximum number of mono-carbethoxylations was seven or eight, respectively. The results suggest that Zn(II) or Ni(II) might partially protect one or two histidine residues from DEPC modification, with a fraction of the metal-peptide complexes dissociating during the course of the MALDI-MS analysis to yield free peptide. While attempts were also made to extend these studies to Fe(II) ions, a surfeit of background noise in the corresponding MS spectra precluded meaningful analysis (not presented; also see Fig. 2H versusFig. 2, CâG). The measured mass ([M+H]+) of the full-length recombinant MoPrP23â231 in NEMO-KCl buffer, pH 7.4, was 23,106.6 Da (calc. 23106. 4 Da; the error for this instrument in this analytical mode is less than or equal to 0.05%, i.e. Â± 11.55 Da) (Fig. 4A). Since attempts to detect copper adducts by direct MALDI-MS analysis of MoPrP23â231 were not successful, we were prompted to explore the DEPC footprinting technique. In addition to the terminal NH2group, there are 9 histidine, 13 tyrosine, 12 serine, and 11 arginine residues in this protein. After incubation with DEPC the mass of carbethoxylated MoPrP23â231 increased, and the peak of carbethoxylated MoPrP23â231 became wider. The largest peak amplitude was observedm/z of 24,321.6 Da (Fig. 4B) indicating that the most abundant form of the modified MoPrP23â231 had â¼17 mono-carbethoxylations (calc. 24,330.4 Da). The greatest peak amplitude of the carbethoxylated copper-MoPrP23â231 complex corresponded to m/z 23,972.9 Da (Fig.4C) indicating that the most abundant form of the modified copper-MoPrP23â231 complex had â¼12 mono-carbethoxylations (calc. 23,972.1 Da). Based on the difference between DEPC modification in the presence and absence of copper we can infer that â¼5 histidine residues (i.e. 17 minus 12) are protected by copper coordination. This conclusion was supported by analyses from two additional experiments. The averaged mass difference of 344.9 Â± 7.7 Da derived from all three experiments yielded a figure of 4.79 Â± 0.11 sites protected by copper per MoPrP23â231 molecule. This stoichiometry is close to that obtained using the N-terminal PrP23â88 fragment. To extend the above studies, enzymatic digestion of MoPrP23â231 was used to produce peptide fragments and peptide fragment adducts amenable to more accurate sizing. Accordingly, MoPrP23â231 (90 Î¼m) in NEMO-KCl buffer, pH 7.4, was digested with trypsin. In some cases MoPrP23â231 at the aforementioned concentration was pre-incubated with or without 10-fold molar excess CuCl2 then reacted with 5-fold excess DEPC prior to tryptic digestion (a tryptic peptide map of MoPrP23â231 is presented in Fig. 1C). In the resulting analyses, with the exception of tryptic peptide T5, no copper-dependent changes were apparent in mass spectra of the tryptic peptides. By way of example, a peak at m/z 4987.3 Da (Fig.5A) corresponds to tryptic peptides T10 and T14 bridged by the disulfide bond between Cys-178 and Cys-213 (calc. 4987.4 Da) (Fig. 1C). This linked peptide contains one histidine residue at residue 176. A signal atm/z 5058.9 Da (calc. 5059.4 Da) was determined in the tryptic digestion of carbethoxylated MoPrP23â231, indicating 1 mono-carbethoxylation after DEPC treatment (Fig. 5B). Since a similar peak (m/z 5059.7 Da) was detected in the tryptic digestion of carbethoxylated Cu(II)-MoPrP23â231 complex (Fig. 5C), this indicates that Cu(II) does not protect His-176 from DEPC modification. On the other hand, analyses of the N-terminal tryptic peptide T5 revealed a clear protective effect of copper. Peptide T5 (residues 49â105, Fig. 1C) includes five histidine residues: one histidine per each of the four octarepeats of the form PHGG(G/S)WGQ and one within the degenerate octarepeat related sequence GGGTHNG. This peptide was represented by a peak atm/z 5876.3 Da (calc. 5876.2 Da) in the tryptic digestion of intact MoPrP23â231 (Fig. 5A). Eight peaks atm/z 6021.3, 6092.9, 6164.2, 6236.0, 6308.2, 6383.7, 6452.3, and 6525.7 Da (Fig. 5B) were detected for the tryptic digestion of carbethoxylated MoPrP23â231. These correspond to 2 mono- (calc. 6020.2 Da), 3 mono- (calc. 6092.2 Da), 4 mono- (calc. 6164.2 Da), 5 mono- (calc. 6236.2 Da), 6 mono- (calc. 6308.2 Da), 7 mono- (Calc. 6380.2), 8 mono- (calc. 6452.2 Da), and 9 mono-carbethoxylations (calc. 6524.2 Da). Only five peaks were detected in the tryptic digest of carbethoxylated Cu(II)-MoPrP23â231 atm/z 5876.2, 5948.2, 6020.2, 6092.7, and 6166.2 Da (Fig. 5C). These are inferred to correspond to 1â4 mono-carbethoxylations (calculated at. 5948.2, 6020.2, 6092.2, and 6164.2 Da, respectively), as well as intact tryptic peptide T5. It is therefore likely that all five histidine residues (i.e. 9 minus 4) in tryptic peptide T5 of MoPrP23â231 are protected from DEPC modification by Cu(II) coordination. Whereas peaks indicative of intact metal-peptide complexes (and free peptide) were noted in the copper-protection experiment involving PrP23â98 (Fig. 3C), peaks of unmodified metal-peptide complexes were not detected in the analysis of the octarepeat containing peptide T5 derived from copper-protected MoPrP23â231 (Fig.5C). From this observation we infer that additional sequences present in PrP23â98 versus peptide T5 (i.e. residues 23â48), or minor changes within the homologous regions of peptide T5 and PrP23â98 (see Fig. 1,B and C) stabilize copper interactions, such that metal-peptide complexes remain intact for MALDI-MS analyses of HuPrP23â98. In this regard a tendency for copper-binding constants to increase in affinity in parallel with increasing PrP fragment length has been noted previously (21Kramer M.L. Kratzin H.D. Schmidt B. RoÌmer A. Windl O. Liemann S. Hornemann S. Kretzschmar H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16711-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Alternatively, extra residues present at the C terminus of peptide T5 versus PrP23â98 (i.e. WNKPPSKPK; Fig. 1B, lower line) may destabilize copper-peptide interactions or desorption such that intact metal-peptide complexes are not detected in the MALDI-MS analysis of peptide T5. Chymotryptic mapping was also used to refine the positions of copper binding sites. MoPrP23â231 chymotryptic peptides C3 (residues 57â64) and C6 (residues 81â88) have the same amino acid sequences, GQPHGGGW, while peptides C4 (residues 65â72) and C5 (residues 73â80) share the sequence GQPHGGSW (Fig. 1C). Subsequent to chymotrypsin digestion peaks at m/z795.32 Da corresponding to peptides C3 and C6 (calc. 795.35 Da), 825.32 Da corresponding to C4 or C5 (calc. 825.36 Da), and 1041.36 Da corresponding to C7 (calc. 1041.45 Da) were found in the mass spectrum of MoPrP23â231 (Figs. 6A and1C). A peak was also detected at m/z1140.57 Da (calc. 1140.45 Da) corresponding to C1, the chymotryptic peptide containing the free N-terminal amino group (Fig. 6A, see also Fig. 1C). In the DEPC-treated protein peaks at m/z795.32 (C3, C6) and 825.29 Da (C4, C5) disappeared, to be replaced with new peaks at m/z 867.29 Da for 1 mono-carbethoxylation of C3 and C6 (calc. 867.35 Da) and 897.30 Da for 1 mono-carbethoxylation of C4 and C5 (calc. 897.36 Da) (Fig.6B). Notably the peak of 1041.32 corresponding to C7 was still present (Fig. 6B), but at"

Mucin overproduction, a hallmark of both diseases, has been shown to directly cause conductive hearing loss in COME and airway obstruction in COPD. The molecular mechanisms underlying mucin overproduction in NTHi infections still remain unclear. Here, we show that NTHi strongly up-regulatesMUC5AC mucin transcription only after bacterial cell disruption. Maximal up-regulation is induced by heat-stable bacterial cytoplasmic proteins, whereas NTHi surface membrane proteins induce only moderate MUC5AC transcription. These results demonstrate an important role for cytoplasmic molecules from lysed bacteria in the pathogenesis of NTHi infections, and may well explain why many patients still have persistent symptoms such as middle ear effusion in COME after intensive antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, our results indicate that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for NTHi-induced MUC5AC transcription, whereas activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathway leads to down-regulation of NTHi-induced MUC5AC transcription via a negative cross-talk with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

In children, it causes chronic otitis media with effusion (COME), one of the most common childhood infections and the leading cause of conductive hearing loss in the United States (3St. Geme III, J.W. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 1-16Google Scholar), whereas in adults, it exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the fourth leading cause of patient deaths in the United States (4Foxwell A.

Despite the need for prophylactic measures, development of a vaccine for preventing NTHi infections remains a great challenge because of high antigenic variation. Moreover, inappropriate antibiotic treatment contributes to the worldwide emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these diseases based on a full understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of NTHi infections.Although significant progress has been made toward identifying the virulence factors of NTHi, the molecular pathogenesis of NTHi infections is still largely unknown. Interestingly, there is evidence that up-regulation of mucin production induced by bacteria could play an important role. Mucins are high molecular weight glycoproteins that constitute the major component of mucus secretions in the middle ear, trachea, digestive, and reproductive tracts (6Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Google Scholar). They protect and lubricate the epithelial surface and trap particles, including bacteria and viruses, for mucociliary clearance (7Rose M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L413-L429Google Scholar). In COME and COPD, excessive production of mucin occurs, overwhelming the normal mucociliary clearance mechanisms. As mucus levels increase, they contribute significantly to airway obstruction in COPD (8Larivee P. Levine S.J. Rieves R.D. Shelhamer J.H. Shmura S. Takishima T. Airway Secretion: Physiological Bases for the Control of Mucus Hypersecretion. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 469-511Google Scholar, 9Kim W.D. Eur. Respir.

Laryngol. 1998; 97: 272-274Google Scholar). In addition to the obstructive outcome, mucin has been reported to bind to almost all known bacterial pathogens (11Kubiet M. Ramphal R. Weber A. Smith A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3362-3367Google Scholar, 12Namavar F. Sprrius M. Veerman E.C.I. Appelmelk B.J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.J.E. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 444-447Google Scholar, 13Mntle M.

The combination of defective mucociliary clearance and mucin-bacteria interaction could greatly increase the ability of bacteria to persist in a host. To date, 13 mucin genes have been cloned (6Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Google Scholar, 7Rose M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L413-L429Google Scholar, 15Basbaum C.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6812-6820Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that expression level ofMUC5AC mRNA in the middle ear is higher in patients with COME than in normal individuals (19Smirnova M.G. Kiselev S.L. Birchall J.P. Pearson J.P. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2001; 12: 119-125Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that up-regulation of MUC5AC mucin gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NTHi infections.Although little is known about how NTHi up-regulates MUC5ACmucin transcription, previous studies have shown that bacteria can activate transcription of host defense genes via activation of specific signal transduction cascades. Among the commonly known signaling events, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways are thought to be most important in transmitting extracellular signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (20Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Google Scholar). p38, a major MAP kinase superfamily member, has been shown to be involved in NTHi-induced inflammatory responses (23Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T.F. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Google Scholar). In addition to p38 MAP kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) represents another major signaling transducer involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, cytoskeleton reorganization, and membrane trafficking (21Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 233-239Google Scholar), as well as bacterial pathogenesis (22Bierne H. Dramsi S. Gratacap M.P. Randriamampita C. Carpenter G. Payrastre B. Cossart P. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 465-476Google Scholar). However, the role of both p38 MAP kinase and PI-3 kinase in mucin up-regulation has not yet been explored.Because mucin overproduction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of COME and COPD, and NTHi is a major pathogen of these diseases, we hypothesize that NTHi up-regulates MUC5AC mucin transcription via activation of specific signal transduction pathways. Here, we show that previously unrecognized cytoplasmic protein components of NTHi up-regulate MUC5AC mucin gene transcription via a positive p38 MAP kinase pathway and a negative PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway. These studies provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of NTHi infections and may open up novel targets for therapeutic intervention.DISCUSSIONNTHi has now become well established as an important human pathogen in both children and adults. In children, it causes COME, one of the most common childhood infections and the leading cause of conductive hearing loss in children (1Kuklinska D. Killeen M. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 3: 249-252Google Scholar, 2Moxon E. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1986; 18: 17-24Google Scholar, 3St. Geme III, J.W. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 1-16Google Scholar, 4Foxwell A. Kyd J. Cripps A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 294-308Google Scholar). In adults, it causes lower respiratory tract infections in the setting of COPD, the fourth leading cause of patient death in the United States (5Murphy T. Sethi S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 146: 1067-1083Google Scholar). Mucin overproduction, a hallmark of both diseases, has been shown to directly cause conductive hearing loss in COME and airway obstruction in COPD. The molecular mechanisms by which mucin is up-regulated in NTHi infections still remain poorly understood. In the present study, we performed experiments to determine the involvement of NTHi in up-regulation ofMUC5AC mucin gene transcription in human epithelial cells. Here, we show that NTHi cytoplasmic proteins up-regulateMUC5AC transcription via a positive p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway and a negative PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway (Fig.8).A major finding in this study is the experimental evidence for the involvement of bacterial cytoplasmic proteins in MUC5ACinduction. This result, although rather unexpected, may well explain why many patients still have persistent symptoms such as middle ear effusion in COME even after intensive treatment with antibiotics (37Lim D.J. Auris Nasus Larynx. 1985; 12: S8-S10Google Scholar). One of the major characteristics of NTHi is its tendency to autolyze. Its autolysis can be triggered in vitro when the bacteria culture is old, and in vivo under various conditions including antibiotic treatment. Clinical microbiology studies have shown that most effusions from the patients with COME were negative on bacteria culture, whereas bacterial DNA could be detected by PCR in 80% of effusions, often in the absence of viable bacteria on culture (30Kubba H. Pearson J.P. Birchall J.H. Clin. Otolaryngol. 2000; 25: 181-194Google Scholar). In addition, DeMaria et al. (38DeMaria T.F. Prior R.B. Briggs B.R. Lim D.L. Birck H.G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 20: 15-17Google Scholar) reported that endotoxin was present in 67% of middle ear effusions that were negative as determined by culture for any bacterium. Despite some potential underestimation of the prevalence of viable bacteria by conventional culture, these results clearly indicate that bacterial breakdown products or components released from lysed bacteria persist in the middle ear even after bacteria die and thus may act as long lasting stimuli of mucin production and inflammatory responses (37Lim D.J. Auris Nasus Larynx. 1985; 12: S8-S10Google Scholar). Taken together, our present study and the previous findings suggest that the cytoplasmic proteins released from the lysed NTHi bacteria after treatment with antibiotics may contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of otitis media by directly up-regulatingMUC5AC mucin transcription.Another unexpected finding in this study is the negative effect of NTHi LOS on MUC5AC transcription. We previously showed that LPS from other Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. typhimurium up-regulatesMUC2 and MUC5AC transcription (31Li J.D. Dohrman A.F. Gallup M. Miyata S.

Basbaum C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 251-259Google Scholar). Additionally, induction of proinflammatory cytokines by NTHi LOS has also been reported (24Clemans D.L. Bauer R.J. Hanson J.A. Hobbs M.V. St. Geme III, J.W. Marrs C.F. Gilsdorf J.R. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4430-4440Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we initially expected to observe a stimulating effect of LOS on MUC5AC. The negative effect shown in Fig. 2 (B and C) is unexpected, because it was in sharp contrast to the up-regulation of mucin by LPS from S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa. In comparison with LPS, LOS lacks an O-specific polysaccharide (33Philips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss M. Gibson B.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4515-4526Google Scholar). Therefore it seems logical that the lack of O-specific polysaccharide may account for the negative effect onMUC5AC induction. However, this notion is not supported by the fact that LPS molecules purified from a polysaccharide-deficient strain and a wild-type strain of P. aeruginosa were equipotent in induction of MUC2 (31Li J.D. Dohrman A.F. Gallup M. Miyata S. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Nadel J.A. Prince A. Basbaum C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 967-972Google Scholar), suggesting that lipid A and the sugar core region are sufficient for mucin induction. In view of the structure of other regions, LOS also appears to differ from LPS in lipid A (33Philips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss M. Gibson B.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4515-4526Google Scholar). An antigenic analysis of NTHi lipid A by Apicellaet al. (40Apicella M.A. Dudas K.C. Campagnari A. Rice P. Mylotte J.M. Murphy T.F. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 9-14Google Scholar) showed that a monoclonal antibody specific for the lipid A portion of NTHi LOS recognized the lipid A determinant on most NTHi strains but did not recognize the lipid A of 39 stains from 14 non-H. influenzae species. Thus, differences in the lipid A region between NTHi LOS and other bacterial LPS may be responsible for the difference in mucin induction. Although no direct up-regulation on MUC5AC by NTHi LOS was shown in vitro, our data do not preclude the possibility that LOS may indirectly up-regulate MUC5AC in vivo by inducing cytokines such as TNF-Î±, which has been shown to up-regulate mucin (15Basbaum C. Lemjabbar H. Longphre M. Li D. Gensch E. McNamara N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: S44-S48Google Scholar).In the present study, we provided evidence for the first time that activation of p38 MAP kinase is required for up-regulation of MUC5AC by NTHi cytoplasmic protein(s). In addition, we showed that PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway is also activated by NTHi, which, however, leads to down-regulation of p38 MAP kinase activity. Negative cross-talk has been established by previous studies between PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway and MAP kinases including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (41Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Google Scholar). Whether or not there is also negative interaction between PI 3-kinase-Akt and p38 MAP kinase has remained unclear. Recently, a report by Gratton et al. (36Gratton J.P. Morales-Ruiz M. Kureishi Y. Fulton D. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30359-30365Google Scholar) showed that blockade of PI 3-kinase-Akt led to enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor activation of p38 MAP kinase. However, little is known about the involvement of this negative cross-talk in bacterial pathogenesis as well as in mucin gene regulation. In the present study, we revealed that PI 3-kinase-Akt serves as an inhibitory signaling pathway in NTH-induced MUC5AC transcription via a negative cross-talk with p38 MAP kinase. Although we showed that inhibition of PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling by wortmannin enhanced, whereas activation of PI 3-kinase-Akt by overexpression of an activated form of p110 attenuated, NTHi-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase, we can not rule out the possibility that PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway may interact with the upstream kinases of p38 MAP kinases such as MAP kinase kinases 3 and 6. It is also unclear whether a direct physical interaction between PI 3-kinase-Akt and MAP kinase kinases 3 and 6-p38 MAP kinase is involved in this cross-talk. These questions will be addressed in our future studies.In summary, NTHi cytoplasmic proteins up-regulate MUC5ACmucin gene transcription in human epithelial cells. Activation of p38 MAP kinase is required for NTHi-induced MUC5ACtranscription. In addition to p38, NTHi cytoplasmic proteins also induce activation of PI 3-kinase-Akt, which, however, leads to down-regulation of NTHi-induced MUC5AC transcription via a negative cross-talk with p38 MAP kinase pathway. These studies may bring new insights into molecular pathogenesis of NTHi-induced infections and lead to novel therapeutic intervention for COME and COPD. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae(NTHi),1 a Gram-negative bacillus, is an important human pathogen in both children and adults (1Kuklinska D. Killeen M. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 3: 249-252Google Scholar, 2Moxon E. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1986; 18: 17-24Google Scholar). In children, it causes chronic otitis media with effusion (COME), one of the most common childhood infections and the leading cause of conductive hearing loss in the United States (3St. Geme III, J.W. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 1-16Google Scholar), whereas in adults, it exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the fourth leading cause of patient deaths in the United States (4Foxwell A. Kyd J. Cripps A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 294-308Google Scholar, 5Murphy T. Sethi S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 146: 1067-1083Google Scholar). Despite the need for prophylactic measures, development of a vaccine for preventing NTHi infections remains a great challenge because of high antigenic variation. Moreover, inappropriate antibiotic treatment contributes to the worldwide emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these diseases based on a full understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of NTHi infections. Although significant progress has been made toward identifying the virulence factors of NTHi, the molecular pathogenesis of NTHi infections is still largely unknown. Interestingly, there is evidence that up-regulation of mucin production induced by bacteria could play an important role. Mucins are high molecular weight glycoproteins that constitute the major component of mucus secretions in the middle ear, trachea, digestive, and reproductive tracts (6Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Google Scholar). They protect and lubricate the epithelial surface and trap particles, including bacteria and viruses, for mucociliary clearance (7Rose M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L413-L429Google Scholar). In COME and COPD, excessive production of mucin occurs, overwhelming the normal mucociliary clearance mechanisms. As mucus levels increase, they contribute significantly to airway obstruction in COPD (8Larivee P. Levine S.J. Rieves R.D. Shelhamer J.H. Shmura S. Takishima T. Airway Secretion: Physiological Bases for the Control of Mucus Hypersecretion. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 469-511Google Scholar, 9Kim W.D. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 1914-1917Google Scholar) and conductive hearing loss in COME (10Majima Y. Hamaguchi Y. Hirata K. Takeuchi K. Morishita A. Sakakura Y. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 1998; 97: 272-274Google Scholar). In addition to the obstructive outcome, mucin has been reported to bind to almost all known bacterial pathogens (11Kubiet M. Ramphal R. Weber A. Smith A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3362-3367Google Scholar, 12Namavar F. Sprrius M. Veerman E.C.I. Appelmelk B.J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.J.E. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 444-447Google Scholar, 13Mntle M.

The combination of defective mucociliary clearance and mucin-bacteria interaction could greatly increase the ability of bacteria to persist in a host. To date, 13 mucin genes have been cloned (6Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Google Scholar, 7Rose M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L413-L429Google Scholar, 15Basbaum C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18327-18336Google Scholar) and one, MUC5AC, has been shown to be highly expressed in airway and middle ear epithelial cells (18Li D Gallup M. Fan N. Szymkowski D.E. Basbaum C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6812-6820Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that expression level ofMUC5AC mRNA in the middle ear is higher in patients with COME than in normal individuals (19Smirnova M.G. Kiselev S.L. Birchall J.P. Pearson J.P. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2001; 12: 119-125Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that up-regulation of MUC5AC mucin gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NTHi infections. Although little is known about how NTHi up-regulates MUC5ACmucin transcription, previous studies have shown that bacteria can activate transcription of host defense genes via activation of specific signal transduction cascades. Among the commonly known signaling events, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways are thought to be most important in transmitting extracellular signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (20Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Google Scholar). p38, a major MAP kinase superfamily member, has been shown to be involved in NTHi-induced inflammatory responses (23Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T.F. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Google Scholar). In addition to p38 MAP kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) represents another major signaling transducer involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, cytoskeleton reorganization, and membrane trafficking (21Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 233-239Google Scholar), as well as bacterial pathogenesis (22Bierne H. Dramsi S. Gratacap M.P. Randriamampita C. Carpenter G. Payrastre B. Cossart P. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 465-476Google Scholar). However, the role of both p38 MAP kinase and PI-3 kinase in mucin up-regulation has not yet been explored. Because mucin overproduction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of COME and COPD, and NTHi is a major pathogen of these diseases, we hypothesize that NTHi up-regulates MUC5AC mucin transcription via activation of specific signal transduction pathways. Here, we show that previously unrecognized cytoplasmic protein components of NTHi up-regulate MUC5AC mucin gene transcription via a positive p38 MAP kinase pathway and a negative PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway. These studies provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of NTHi infections and may open up novel targets for therapeutic intervention. DISCUSSIONNTHi has now become well established as an important human pathogen in both children and adults. In children, it causes COME, one of the most common childhood infections and the leading cause of conductive hearing loss in children (1Kuklinska D. Killeen M. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 3: 249-252Google Scholar, 2Moxon E. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1986; 18: 17-24Google Scholar, 3St. Geme III, J.W. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 1-16Google Scholar, 4Foxwell A. Kyd J. Cripps A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 294-308Google Scholar). In adults, it causes lower respiratory tract infections in the setting of COPD, the fourth leading cause of patient death in the United States (5Murphy T. Sethi S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 146: 1067-1083Google Scholar). Mucin overproduction, a hallmark of both diseases, has been shown to directly cause conductive hearing loss in COME and airway obstruction in COPD. The molecular mechanisms by which mucin is up-regulated in NTHi infections still remain poorly understood. In the present study, we performed experiments to determine the involvement of NTHi in up-regulation ofMUC5AC mucin gene transcription in human epithelial cells. Here, we show that NTHi cytoplasmic proteins up-regulateMUC5AC transcription via a positive p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway and a negative PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway (Fig.8).A major finding in this study is the experimental evidence for the involvement of bacterial cytoplasmic proteins in MUC5ACinduction. This result, although rather unexpected, may well explain why many patients still have persistent symptoms such as middle ear effusion in COME even after intensive treatment with antibiotics (37Lim D.J. Auris Nasus Larynx. 1985; 12: S8-S10Google Scholar). One of the major characteristics of NTHi is its tendency to autolyze. Its autolysis can be triggered in vitro when the bacteria culture is old, and in vivo under various conditions including antibiotic treatment. Clinical microbiology studies have shown that most effusions from the patients with COME were negative on bacteria culture, whereas bacterial DNA could be detected by PCR in 80% of effusions, often in the absence of viable bacteria on culture (30Kubba H. Pearson J.P. Birchall J.H. Clin. Otolaryngol. 2000; 25: 181-194Google Scholar). In addition, DeMaria et al. (38DeMaria T.F. Prior R.B. Briggs B.R. Lim D.L. Birck H.G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 20: 15-17Google Scholar) reported that endotoxin was present in 67% of middle ear effusions that were negative as determined by culture for any bacterium. Despite some potential underestimation of the prevalence of viable bacteria by conventional culture, these results clearly indicate that bacterial breakdown products or components released from lysed bacteria persist in the middle ear even after bacteria die and thus may act as long lasting stimuli of mucin production and inflammatory responses (37Lim D.J. Auris Nasus Larynx. 1985; 12: S8-S10Google Scholar). Taken together, our present study and the previous findings suggest that the cytoplasmic proteins released from the lysed NTHi bacteria after treatment with antibiotics may contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of otitis media by directly up-regulatingMUC5AC mucin transcription.Another unexpected finding in this study is the negative effect of NTHi LOS on MUC5AC transcription. We previously showed that LPS from other Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. typhimurium up-regulatesMUC2 and MUC5AC transcription (31Li J.D. Dohrman A.F. Gallup M. Miyata S. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Nadel J.A. Prince A. Basbaum C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 967-972Google Scholar, 39Austin D. Miyata S. Gallup M. Li J.-D. Chpelin C. Coste A. Escudier E. Nadel J. Basbaum C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 251-259Google Scholar). Additionally, induction of proinflammatory cytokines by NTHi LOS has also been reported (24Clemans D.L. Bauer R.J. Hanson J.A.

Although we showed that inhibition of PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling by wortmannin enhanced, whereas activation of PI 3-kinase-Akt by overexpression of an activated form of p110 attenuated, NTHi-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase, we can not rule out the possibility that PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway may interact with the upstream kinases of p38 MAP kinases such as MAP kinase kinases 3 and 6. It is also unclear whether a direct physical interaction between PI 3-kinase-Akt and MAP kinase kinases 3 and 6-p38 MAP kinase is involved in this cross-talk. These questions will be addressed in our future studies. In summary, NTHi cytoplasmic proteins up-regulate MUC5ACmucin gene transcription in human epithelial cells. Activation of p38 MAP kinase is required for NTHi-induced MUC5ACtranscription. In addition to p38, NTHi cytoplasmic proteins also induce activation of PI 3-kinase-Akt, which, however, leads to down-regulation of NTHi-induced MUC5AC transcription via a negative cross-talk with p38 MAP kinase pathway. These studies may bring new insights into molecular pathogenesis of NTHi-induced infections and lead to novel therapeutic intervention for COME and COPD.

https://openalex.org/W2052225843,"The heterotrimeric G proteins, G12 and G13, mediate signaling between G protein-coupled receptors and the monomeric GTPase, RhoA. One pathway for this modulation is direct stimulation by GÎ±13 of p115 RhoGEF, an exchange factor for RhoA. The GTPase activity of both GÎ±12 and GÎ±13 is increased by the N terminus of p115 Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). This region has weak homology to the RGS box sequence of the classic regulators of G protein signaling (RGS), which act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) for Gi and Gq. Here, the RGS region of p115 RhoGEF is shown to be distinctly different in that sequences flanking the predicted âRGS boxâ region are required for both stable expression and GAP activity. Deletions in the N terminus of the protein eliminate GAP activity but retain substantial binding to GÎ±13 and activation of RhoA exchange activity by GÎ±13. In contrast, GTRAP48, a homolog of p115 RhoGEF, bound to GÎ±13 but was not stimulated by the Î± subunit and had very poor GAP activity. Besides binding to the N-terminal RGS region, GÎ±13 also bound to a truncated protein consisting only of the Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. However, GÎ±13 did not stimulate the exchange activity of this truncated protein. A chimeric protein, which contained the RGS region of GTRAP48 in place of the endogenous N terminus of p115 RhoGEF, was activated by GÎ±13. These results suggest a mechanism for activation of the nucleotide exchange activity of p115 RhoGEF that involves direct and coordinate interaction of GÎ±13 to both its RGS and DH domains.

Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Google Scholar). Every G protein is composed of a heterotrimer made up of Î±, Î², and Î³ subunits. The four G protein families, Gi, Gq, Gs, and G12, have been categorized by their sequence identity and the functional similarity of their Î± subunits (2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar, 3Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Google Scholar). The G12 family contains two members, Î±12 and Î±13 (4Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Google Scholar), which have been implicated in cellular transformation (5Jiang H. Wu D. Simon M.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 319-322Google Scholar), gastrulation ofDrosophila melanogaster (6Parks S. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1991; 64: 447-458Google Scholar), vascular development in mice (7Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Google Scholar), and actin re-arrangement (8Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Brown J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Google Scholar). Both the heterotrimeric G proteins and monomeric Rho GTPases utilize the same basic cycle of regulation. The inactive proteins contain bound GDP. Activation is facilitated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 that promote dissociation of GDP and subsequent binding of GTP to the G protein. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) return the GTPase to the inactive state by accelerating hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate of the bound GTP (2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar, 3Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Google Scholar, 11Nobes C. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 77-81Google Scholar). Members of the RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) family of proteins can act as GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins (12Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

RGS proteins that have been characterized to date function by increasing the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of GÎ± subunits through allosteric binding (15Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar). This mechanism was first worked out for RGS4, which acts upon GÎ±i and GÎ±q (16Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Google Scholar, 17Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Google Scholar). The smallest region capable of accelerating GTPase activity is called the RGS box. This domain is characterized by strong primary sequence identity and structural similarity among the four RGS family members for which structures are known: RGS4 (18Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Google Scholar), GAIP (19De de Alba E. Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Tjandra N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 927-939Google Scholar), axin/conductin (20Spink K.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Google Scholar), and GTRAP48 (25Jackson M. Song W. Liu M.Y. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lin C.I. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Sternweis P.C. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 89-93Google Scholar) are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho; all share a highly conserved region that interacts specifically with GÎ±12and/or GÎ±13 (22Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Google Scholar, 23Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Google Scholar, 25Jackson M. Song W.

Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Google Scholar). This region invariantly lies N-terminal to the tandem Dbl homology (DH) (27Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar) and Pleckstrin homology (PH) (28Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74Google Scholar) domains found in all four proteins. Even though these N-terminal regions contain only weak sequence identity to a stereotypical RGS box, the structure of this region in p115 RhoGEF (aa 42â252) is similar to the folding pattern of other RGS boxes (29Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 805-809Google Scholar). The high sequence identity among these regions in the four RhoGEFs suggests structural identity, and this clear subfamily of RGS domains is subsequently referred to as the rgRGS (RhoGEFRGS) domain. The best-studied member of this group, p115 RhoGEF, was initially isolated as a protein that tightly bound the nucleotide free form of RhoA and increased the nucleotide exchange rate of RhoA (24Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Google Scholar). The rgRGS domain within the N terminus of p115 RhoGEF was subsequently established as a GAP for GÎ±12 and GÎ±13(26Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Google Scholar). Most interestingly, p115 RhoGEF is also an effector of GÎ±13, which increases the activity of p115 RhoGEF as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoA (1Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Google Scholar). Recently, GTRAP48 was found to be a GEF for RhoA that also binds GÎ±13, but the functional implications of this interaction are not known (25Jackson M. Song W. Liu M.Y. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lin C.I. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Sternweis P.C. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 89-93Google Scholar). In this study, the interaction of p115 RhoGEF and GTRAP48 with the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins is more precisely defined. Deletion analysis of p115 RhoGEF provides evidence that regions outside of the apparent classic RGS box are required for accelerating the GTPase activity of GÎ±13. A mechanism for stimulation of p115 RhoGEF by GÎ±13 is suggested by the determination of a second binding site for GÎ±13 in the tandem DH/PH domains of p115 RhoGEF. Finally, GTRAP48 was found to bind GÎ±13 and act as a weak GAP on the Î± subunit, but its nucleotide exchange activity was not stimulated by GÎ±13. The cDNA encoding full-length p115 RhoGEF (24Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Google Scholar) was used for amplification of fragments of p115 RhoGEF by the polymerase chain reaction. All fragments were amplified with an N-terminal EcoRI site and a C-terminal HindIII site for cloning into pCMV5-myc (provided by Melanie Cobb), pGEX-KG (30Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar), and a modified pTrc D expression vector as described previously (31Wells C.D. Gutowski S. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28897-28905Google Scholar). Briefly, the intervening sequence between the hexa-histidine tag (HIS) and the EcoRI restriction site of pTrc C (Invitrogen) was replaced with the amino acids Met-Gly-Ala. Fragments were transferred viaEcoRI/XbaI sites from pCMV5 into pVL1392-EE (31Wells C.D. Gutowski S. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28897-28905Google Scholar), which contains an N-terminal EE tag (EYMPME) (24Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Google Scholar). Baculoviruses were produced through co-transfection of SF9 cells with pVL1392-EE vectors and BakPak6 that was digested with Bsu36I (CLONTECH). The N-terminal DNA fragments of p115 RhoGEF were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-KG and pTrc D. The different pieces of p115 RhoGEF are named by the primers used for their amplification. All cDNA constructs were sequenced to confirm correct amplification and construction. All GTRAP48 and p115 RhoGEF proteins were expressed via baculovirus in culturedSpodoptera frugiperda (SF9) cells or in the transformed BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. Recombinant EE-tagged proteins were expressed in SF9 cells after infection with baculovirus. The expressed proteins were purified from lysates by affinity chromatography with anti-EE coupled Sepharose (BAbCO) as described elsewhere (32Wells C. Jiang X. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 371-372Google Scholar). N-terminal fragments of p115 RhoGEF and GTRAP48 were produced in E. coli as either HIS-tagged fusion proteins or as chimeras with GST (glutathioneS-transferase). GST-tagged proteins were purified by chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and solution A (25 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl) containing the protease inhibitors (2.5 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin A, 21 Î¼g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 21 Î¼g/mlNÎ±-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 21 Î¼g/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, and 21 Î¼g/mlNÎ±-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester). HIS-tagged proteins were purified by isolation with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) in 25 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, and the protease inhibitors. GÎ±13 was prepared as described by Singer et al(33Singer W.D. Miller R.T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Google Scholar). Prenyl RhoA was co-expressed with GST-tagged guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor via Baculovirus in SF9 cells (32Wells C. Jiang X. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 371-372Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing cell pellets three times in Solution A containing protease inhibitors. After removing particulate material by centrifugation at 100,000 Ã g, the cytosol was passed over a glutathione-Sepharose column and eluted with the same solution containing 1% cholate to separate RhoA from GST-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. Proteins were concentrated, and cholate was removed by dilution of samples with solution A containing protease inhibitors and final concentration via pressure filtration through an Amicon PM10 membrane. Three purified protein pieces of p115 RhoGEF were used to generate polyclonal antisera (31Wells C.D. Gutowski S. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28897-28905Google Scholar). Antisera specific for fragments consisting of aa 1â252, 288â637, and 760â912 are termed U2760, U2762, and U2764, respectively. B860, an antiserum specific for GÎ±13 (33Singer W.D. Miller R.T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Google Scholar) and the antiserum specific for GÎ±12 (34Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Google Scholar) were described previously. A polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the myc tag (catalog number Sc-789) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. GÎ±13 was activated by incubation with solution B (25 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing AMF (30 Î¼m AlCl3, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaF) and protease inhibitors for 10 min. Activated GÎ±13 (5 pmol) was mixed with the indicated concentrations of exchange factor, which had been pre-bound to anti-EE-Sepharose, and the final volume was adjusted to 200 Î¼l with solution B and AMF if indicated. Samples were incubated for 1 h on a rocking platform at 4 Â°C. The beads were then pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 1 min and washed twice with solution B. The p115 RhoGEF proteins and GÎ±13 were eluted for 15 min at room temperature with 50 Î¼l of solution B containing EE peptide (EYMPME) at a final concentration of 100 Î¼g/ml. GÎ±13 in the supernatant was visualized by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblot analysis using the B860 antibody. The purified GST-tagged domains were bound to 20 Î¼l of glutathione-Sepharose (packed beads) and washed in solution B to remove unbound protein. Activated GÎ±13 (5 pmol, activated as described above) was added to the indicated amount of immobilized rgRGS domain in 200 Î¼l of solution B. After incubation on a rocking platform for 1 h at 4 Â°C, the samples were washed three times with solution B. The beads were then boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the eluted GÎ±13 was visualized by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblot analysis using the B860 antibody. COS cells were grown to 80% confluency in 60-mm dishes. The cells were then transfected using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Hoffman-LaRoche) with pCMV5-myc vectors that expressed the different exchange factors. Cells were also co-transfected with pCMV5 plasmids expressing either GÎ±13 or GÎ±12. Transfected cells were incubated at 37 Â°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were then lysed in solution B containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Non-extracted material was removed from the lysates by centrifugation at 13,600 Ã g for 5 min. The cleared lysates were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose in solution B for 30 min at 4 Â°C to remove proteins that bound nonspecifically to the Sepharose resin. After removal of the resin, the samples were added to protein G-Sepharose coupled to a monoclonal antibody directed against the myc tag and further incubated for 1 h at 4 Â°C on a rocking platform. The Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed three times with solution B. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and visualized by immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies against either the myc-tag, GÎ±12, or GÎ±13. GÎ±13 (600 pmol) was loaded with [Î³-32P]GTP for 15 min in 300 Î¼l of 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% polyoxyethylene 10-laurelether, 5 Î¼m GTP, and 50 cpm /fmol [Î³-32P]GTP. Samples were then rapidly gel-filtered by centrifugation at 4 Â°C through 2 ml of Sephadex G50 resin that was previously equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm NaHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% polyoxyethylene 10-laurelether) to remove free [Î³-32P]GTP and [32P]Pi. Hydrolysis of GTP was initiated by adding 60 pmol of the treated GÎ±13 (about 2 pmol of loaded GÎ±13) to buffer C containing 8 mmMgSO4, 1 mm GTP, and the proteins to be tested for GAP activity. After incubation for the indicated times at 4 Â°C, aliquots (50 Î¼l) were quenched with 750 Î¼l of 5% (w/v) NoritA in 50 mm NaH2PO4. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and 500 Î¼l of supernatant containing [32P]Pi was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Binding of GTPÎ³S to 2 Î¼m RhoA was assayed at 30 Â°C in 20 Î¼l of solution containing 20 Î¼m GTPÎ³S, [35S]GTPÎ³S (200,000 cpm ), 50 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2. GÎ±13 was added to a final concentration of 100 nm after being activated for 10 min in binding buffer containing AMF. After mixing, assays were stopped at various times by the addition of 2 ml of filtration buffer (20 mm TrisCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl), and the proteins were immediately collected by filtration through BA-85 filters (Intermountain Scientific). The amount of [35S]GTPÎ³S bound to RhoA on each dried filter was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The apparent rates of guanine nucleotide exchange for RhoA were examined at three to four concentrations to determine the average turnover rate for each p115 RhoGEF piece. Mutants of p115 RhoGEF and GTRAP48 were used to identify the domains responsible for binding to GÎ±13, stimulation of RhoA exchange activity by GÎ±13, and acceleration of GTPase activity of GÎ±12 and GÎ±13. Schematic representations of these mutants are shown in Figs.1A and 4A. Purified proteins derived from these constructs after expression via baculovirus infection of Sf9 cells or expression in E. coli are shown in Figs. 1B and 4B.Figure 4Constructs and expression of GTRAP48 and p115 RhoGEF.A, constructs derived from GTRAP48 and p115 RhoGEF are shown. The amino acids encoded in each construct are also listed. Nomenclature in parentheses is based on the oligomers used in their construction. B, representative preparations of purified proteins that were derived from GTRAP48 and p115 RhoGEF (see âMaterials and Methodsâ) and used in this study were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 dye.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Stable expression of the N terminus of p115 RhoGEF (aa 1â248) as a fusion protein with GST has been shown previously, and aa 45â161 were predicted to form an RGS box (26Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Google Scholar). However, subsequent deletion mutants of this N terminus identified two areas outside of the predicted RGS box that were necessary for stable expression of protein. Because p115 RhoGEF was successively deleted from the N terminus by 7 or 13 amino acids, the level of expression remained stable. Further deletion up to aa 17 or 21 resulted in fragments that did not express intact protein. This N-terminal region, which apparently interferes with protein stability, ends at or before amino acid 25, because a fragment of p115 RhoGEF encoded by aa 25â252 can be expressed at 100â200 Î¼g/gram ofE. coli (wet weight). The deletion of the first 41 amino acids resulted in a domain, p115 RhoGEF (aa 42â252), which was expressed at levels comparable to domains with intact N termini. Disruption of the region lying C-terminal to the predicted RGS box that lies between amino acids 161 and 252 also affected expression of protein. Protein fragments starting with aa 1 and ending at aa 248 or 252 express extremely well in E. coli (3â4 mg/g of packed wet cells). However, p115 RhoGEF (aa 1â215) could only be expressed poorly at 30â40 Î¼g/g (wet weight), and this was only possible in SF9 cells. Fragments of p115 RhoGEF with shorter C termini, which encoded either aa 25â190 or aa 42â170, showed little to no detectable expression in either bacteria or SF9 cells (data not shown). The p115 rgRGS fragments consisting of aa 1â252, 25â252, and 42â252 were expressed and purified as fusion proteins with an N-terminal GST domain (Fig. 1A). All three bound preferentially to the activated form of GÎ±13 (Fig.2A). The relative binding affinity of p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252) and (aa 42â252) for GÎ±13 was then assessed by competitive binding (Fig.2B). HIS-tagged p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252) and (aa 42â252) proteins were added at increasing concentrations to compete with a fixed amount of the immobilized GST-tagged constructs for binding of GÎ±13. 60 pmol of HIS-tagged p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252) effectively reduced binding of 20 pmol of immobilized GST-tagged p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252) to GÎ±13. In contrast, 60 pmol of p115 rgRGS (aa 42â252) had little effect, and higher concentrations (180 and 540 pmol) were needed to substantially reduce binding of the GÎ±13 to 20 pmol of immobilized GST-tagged p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252). Similarly, HIS-tagged p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252) was a much more effective inhibitor of binding of GÎ±13 to immobilized GST-tagged p115 rgRGS (aa 42â252) than the HIS-tagged p115 rgRGS (aa 42â252). Both comparisons demonstrate that p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252) bound to GÎ±13 with 5- to 10-fold greater avidity than the truncated rgRGS of p115 RhoGEF (aa 42â252). Thus, the N-terminal residues of p115 rgRGS are not necessary for binding to GÎ±13 but do contribute significantly to the affinity of this interaction. Several N-terminal fragments of p115 RhoGEF, which included aa 1â252, 6â252, 13â252, 25â252, 42â252, and 1â215 (described in Figs. 1A and3A), were tested for their ability to stimulate the GTPase activity of GÎ±13. Single-turnover assays were utilized, which measure the release of [32P]Pi upon hydrolysis of [Î³-32P]GTP that had been pre-bound to GÎ±13. Assays were performed as described by Singeret al (33Singer W.D. Miller R.T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Google Scholar), with the modifications outlined under âMaterials and Methods.â As shown previously for a GST fusion protein containing the first 246 amino acids of p115 RhoGEF (26Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Google Scholar), the p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252) stimulated the GTPase activity of GÎ±13 as well as the full-length exchange factor (Fig.3B). However, a protein with further truncation at its C terminus, p115 rgRGS (aa 1â215), was a less effective stimulator of the GTPase activity of GÎ±13. Removal of additional C-terminal residues resulted in unstable proteins that had no detectable stimulation of the GTPase activity of GÎ±13 (data not shown). The effects of N-terminal deletion are shown in Fig. 3(CâF). Removal of the first 5 or 12 N-terminal amino acids, p115 rgRGS (aa 6â252) or p115 rgRGS (aa 13â252), respectively, did not alter GAP activities toward GÎ±13 (Fig.3C). Removal of the first 17 or 21 N-terminal amino acids did not allow expression of protein domains as discussed previously. P115 rgRGS (aa 25â252) was expressed modestly as a viable domain. Although an active GAP, the potency of this construct was only about 0.1% that of the full-length rgRGS domain encoded within aa 1â252 (Fig. 3, DâF). Finally, deletion of the N terminus up to the predicted RGS box, p115 RhoGEF (aa 42â252), produced a fragment that expressed well (see above). Despite binding strongly to GÎ±13 (about 10â20% as well as p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252), see Fig. 2B), this fragment had essentially no GAP activity toward GÎ±13 (Fig. 3, CâE). The hint of activity observed at 10 Î¼m (Fig. 3E) is similar to nonspecific effects of adding other control proteins and is not increased at higher concentrations of p115 rgRGS (aa 42â252). GTRAP48 has been shown to bind to GÎ±13 (25Jackson M. Song W. Liu M.Y. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lin C.I. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Sternweis P.C. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 89-93Google Scholar), but the functional consequences and potential interaction with GÎ±12 are unknown. The domain arrangements of GTRAP48 and p115 RhoGEF are compared in Fig.4A, and schematic descriptions of various constructs are shown. In a chimeric protein, N48C115, the N-terminal rgRGS region of p115 RhoGEF is replaced with the homologous region from GTRAP48. Examples of purified proteins that were expressed via these constructs with EE or GST tags are shown in Fig.4B. The ability of GTRAP48 to bind to GÎ±12 as well as GÎ±13 was assessed by immunoprecipitation after transient expression in COS cells. COS cells were transfected with either myc-tagged GTRAP48 or myc-tagged p115 RhoGEF and either constitutively active GÎ±13 (Q226L) or constitutively active GÎ±12 (Q229L). Both p115 RhoGEF and GTRAP48 bound to GÎ±13 in the presence of AlF 4â. Although p115 RhoGEF also bound well to GÎ±12, the interaction of this Î± subunit with GTRAP48 is apparently weaker and was hard to detect (Fig.5A, see âDiscussionâ). The dependence of association of these GTPase-deficient forms of GÎ±12 and GÎ±13 on AlF 4â may seem surprising. However, this reflects both the multiple states of the Î± subunits upon lysis of cells in GDP and slow conversion of GÎ±Â·GTP to GÎ±Â·GDP through slow hydrolysis or nucleotide exchange over the extensive timeframe required for the immunoprecipitation. To define the regions in GTRAP48 responsible for binding GÎ±13, two segments, which included sequences homologous to the rgRGS domain of p115 RhoGEF, were expressed and examined. The first segment encodes aa 1â539, which includes the PDZ-and proline-rich domains that precede the rgRGS domain (Fig. 4). The second construct encodes aa 285â495, which contains amino acids homologous to the N-terminal region of p115 RhoGEF (Fig. 4). Both constructs of GTRAP48 were found to preferentially bind the activated form of GÎ±13 (Fig. 5B). The relative affinities of GTRAP48, a fragment of GTRAP48 (aa 289â539), and p115 RhoGEF for GÎ±13 were assessed by competitive binding with immobilized GST-tagged p115 rgRGS aa (1) (Fig. 5C). Purified full-length p115 RhoGEF and HIS-tagged p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252) effectively attenuated binding of activated GÎ±13 to the immobilized p115 rgRGS at stoichiometries of 5- to 10-fold over the immobilized domain. In contrast, EE-tagged GTRAP48 or its HIS-tagged rgRGS domain, GTRAP48 (aa 289â539), at concentrations of 5- to 10-fold over the GST-tagged p115 rgRGS (aa 1â252) showed little competition for binding to GÎ±13. Thus, although the GTRAP48 rgRGS domain bound GÎ±13, it did so with a definitively lower affinity than the p115 rgRGS domain. The ability of GTRAP48 to stimulate the GTPase activity of GÎ±13 in a single-turnover assay is shown in Fig.6A. Both GTRAP48 and N48C115 (a chimera derived from GTRAP48 and p115 RhoGEF; Fig. 4A) displayed low but significant stimulation of the GTPase activity of GÎ±13. However, their activities were substantially less than the stimulation obtained with an equivalent amount of p115 RhoGEF. The N-terminal fragments of GTRAP48, which contain its rgRGS domain, failed to stimulate the GTPase activity of GÎ±13 at the concentrations tested (Fig. 6B). Thus, by this in vitro measure, the rgRGS domain is only a poor GAP for GÎ±13 at best. This contrasts with the robust GAP activity of p115 rgRGS. The N-terminal 248 amino acids in p115 RhoG"

The importance of this enzyme complex is illustrated by hemophilia, a disease in which a deficiency of either factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B) leads to life-threatening bleeding. Factor IXa gains more than 100,000-fold greater efficiency in activating factor X by assembling with factor VIIIa on a PS-containing membrane than when free in solution (6van Dieijen G. Tans G.

The proteins share a repeating domain structure of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 in which the A domains are homologous with ceruloplasmin, the B domain is unique to each protein, and the C domains are homologous with discoidin I, a phospholipid-binding lectin (14Bartles J.

Stoddard B.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) has provided the basis for a model membrane-binding mechanism. Both C2 domains display two hydrophobic spikes at the tips of protruding Î²-hairpin turns. These hydrophobic spikes are hypothesized to penetrate the hydrophobic core of a phospholipid bilayer. Hydrophilic residues above the hydrophobic spikes are hypothesized to form specific hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that recognize the phospho-l-serine motif of PS. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of factor V have confirmed that the first hydrophobic spike, composed of Trp2063/Trp2064, has a lower affinity for phospholipid and a corresponding decrease in function in the prothrombinase complex when the residues are replaced by Ala/Ala (24Kim S.W. Quinn-Allen M.A. Camp J.T. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we have tested the parallel model of factor VIII binding to phospholipid membranes by performing functional studies on factor VIII in which many of the proposed membrane-binding residues have been altered by site-directed mutagenesis. In plasma, factor VIII differs from factor V in that it circulates in a noncovalent complex with von Willebrand factor (vWf) (25Lollar P. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1991; 66: 524-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). vWf competitively inhibits factor VIII from binding to PS-containing membranes (26Andersson L. Brown J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17815-17820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic activation by thrombin removes an acidic amino acid-rich region from the amino terminus of the light chain, thereby reducing the affinity for vWf (29Foster P. Fulcher C. Houghten R. Zimmerman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5230-5234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pittman D. Kaufman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the two proteins dissociate to allow factor VIII to bind to activated platelets (28Nesheim M. Pittman D. Giles A.

Clouse S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15861-15868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several monoclonal antibodies to the C2 domain of factor VIII inhibit both binding of factor VIII to vWf and binding to phospholipid membranes. These data suggest that there is substantial overlap between the phospholipid-binding and the vWf-binding motifs of the factor VIII C2 domain. Thus, it is logical to test any factor VIII C2 mutants with decreased phospholipid affinity to determine whether the vWf binding affinity is also decreased. Bovine brain PS, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from egg yolk, phosphatidylcholine (PC) from egg yolk, and 1-oleoyl, 2-(12-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)dodcanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Recombinant human factor VIII and anti-heavy chain factor VIII monoclonal antibody (F-8) and F-8 conjugated to CL-4B-Sepharose were gifts from D. Pittman of the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Recombinant ÎPro vWf was a gift from Dr. Robert Wise. Human factor IXa and factor X were from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). vWf was from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT).

Activated partial thromboplastin (automated activated partial thromboplastin time reagent) and CaCl2 were purchased from General Diagnostics Organon Teknika Corp. (Durham, NC). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. COAMATICÂ® was purchased from DiaPharma Group, Inc. (West Chester, OH).

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The vector plasmid containing the wild type factor VIII cDNA sequence was designated FVIII WT. The plasmid containing a B-domain-deleted (BDD) FVIII was designated BDD-VIII. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to create anApaI-XbaI polymerase chain reaction fragment in which the codon targeted for substitution was mutated to either GCA or GCG, predicting an amino acid substitution of alanine. The mutagenized and ApaI-XbaI-digested fragments were then ligated into ApaI-XbaI-digested BDD-VIII. The resulting mutant plasmids were designated according to the position of their alanine substitution by single letter amino acid abbreviation (e.g. R2220A). A SwaI-XbaI-digested fragment from the mutant plasmids was ligated intoSwaI-XbaI-digested FVIII WT to generate the mutant forms within full-length factor VIII (designated by WT superscript). The four-alanine mutant M2199A/F2200A/L2251/L2252A was created in the same fashion by substituting L2251A/L2252A as the template within the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotides for alanine mutagenesis at positions 2199/2200. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to create anXbaI-SalI polymerase chain reaction fragment (where SalI is located within the polylinker cloning site of vector pMT2) in which the codon targeted for substitution was mutated to either GCA or GCG, predicting an amino acid substitution of alanine. The mutagenized andXbaI-SalI-digested fragments were then ligated into XbaI-SalI-digested FVIII WT. All plasmids were purified by Qiagen Plasmid Purification according to the manufacturer's instructions and characterized by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran method as previously described (32Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J.

Factor VIII activity was measured by an activated partial thromboplastin time clotting assay on an MLA Electra 750 fibrinometer by reconstitution of human factor VIII-deficient plasma. Factor VIII antigen was quantified by an anti-factor VIII light chain sandwich ELISA method using the AsserachromÂ® VIIIC:Ag commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Diagnostica Stago, Inc., Parsippany, NJ). Phospholipid vesicles were synthesized by sonication in a bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Co., Hicksville, NY) under argon until the suspension was visually clear. Phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphorous assay (35Chen P. Toribara T. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar). Vesicles were used fresh, or 1-ml aliquots were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at â80 Â°C, and thawed at 37 Â°C. Preliminary experiments were performed with normal human factor VIII to identify conditions under which the rate at which factor X was cleaved by the factor Xase complex was linearly related to the concentration of phospholipid vesicles with 4% PS. At the concentration selected, 0.15 Î¼m phospholipid, the rate of factor Xa cleavage was â¼20% of the maximum rate with saturating phospholipid (data not shown). Factor Xase activity was measured with a two-step amidolytic substrate assay. Phospholipid was mixed with 4 nm factor IXa and 130 nm factor X in 0.15m NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8. Phospholipid vesicles had compositions (PS/PE/PC) of 15:20:65 and 4:20:76 and were added at phospholipid concentrations of 2 and 0.15 Î¼m for the phospholipid-saturating and phospholipid-limiting assays, respectively. The reaction was started by adding Ca2+, factor VIII, and thrombin at final concentrations of 1.5 mm, 1 unit/ml, and 0.1 unit/ml. After 5 min at 25 Â°C, the reaction was stopped by diluting the mixture 1:0.8 with 16 mm EDTA, and factor Xa activity was determined immediately in a thermostatted kinetic microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) at 25 Â°C using 0.1 mm S-2765 (DiaPharma Group, Inc., West Chester, OH). Factor VIII and mutants in tissue culture supernatant were concentrated 10â20-fold using Centriplus 100 microconcentrators (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). CaCl2 was added to a 0.35m concentration (to separate factor VIII and vWf), and particulate matter was removed by sedimentation at 100,000 Ãg for 1 h at room temperature. The clarified factor VIII solution was loaded over a microcolumn of F-8 coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Superose beads. The total volume of Superose for each column was 10 Î¼l, and the column was prepared by injecting the medium into 0.02-inch internal diameter tubing where the column formed above a 10-Î¼m frit (Alltech). Factor VIII was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 20â50 Î¼l/min, delivered by a syringe pump. The immobilized factor VIII was washed with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.01% Tween 80, and the medium was removed by reversing the flow through the frit. Alternatively, factor VIII and mutants were immobilized on Superose beads by incubating the beads with concentrated medium and removing the bound factor VIII on the beads by sedimentation. Aliquots containing â¼8000 F-8-Superose microspheres with bound factor VIII were incubated with various concentrations of NBD-labeled phospholipid vesicles in 100 Î¼l of Tris-buffered saline, 1.5 mm Ca2+, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The composition of the vesicles (PS/PE/PC/NBD-PC) was 4:20:75:1. After 30 min, the samples were diluted to 500 Î¼l in the same buffer within 30 s of reading the fluorescence/microsphere by flow cytometry with a Becton Dickinson FacScan within 30 s of dilution. Data were acquired with all channels in log mode, and binding data were analyzed as the geometric mean fluorescence/microsphere. Microspheres were detected and distinguished from background noise based upon the characteristic forward and side light scatter characteristics. Binding data were analyzed using the equation, F=F0+Fmax(PL/(KD+PL))+PLÃkf(1)Equation 1 where F is the measured fluorescence/Superose bead, F 0 is the fluorescence for Superose bead in the absence of NBD-labeled vesicles, F max is the maximum fluorescence with saturating concentrations of NBD-labeled vesicles, and K D is the dissociation constant for phospholipid (PL) binding to factor VIII. The termk f is the measured fluorescence per concentration unit of free phospholipid vesicles due to unbound phospholipid and any nonspecific binding of phospholipid vesicles to control Superose beads lacking factor VIII. We assumed that the fraction of bound phospholipid could be neglected (the nominal concentration of immobilized factor VIII was 0.2â0.4 nm). The variable K D was determined using nonlinear least squares analysis with the software Graphpad Prism 3.0. F max was determined by nonlinear least squares analysis for wild type factor VIII, for which saturable binding was clearly evident (Fig. 4).F max for each of the mutants was assigned based upon the quantity of ÎPro vWf binding sites detected/Superose microsphere relative to wild type factor VIII (see below). ÎPro vWf was labeled with fluorescein maleimide as previously described for factor VIII (36Gilbert G.E. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17261-17268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots containing â¼8000 F-8-Superose microspheres with bound factor VIII were incubated with various concentrations of fluorescein-labeled ÎPro vWf in 100 Î¼l of Tris-buffered saline with 1.5 mm Ca2+. After 60 min, samples were diluted to 500 Î¼l less than 30 s prior to evaluation of fluorescence/microsphere determined by flow cytometry. Data were analyzed according to Equation 1 except that ÎPro vWf was substituted for PL, K D referred to the dissociation constant for binding to ÎPro vWf, and k f referred to the fluorescence related to free ÎPro vWf plus nonspecific binding of ÎPro vWf to F-8-Superose microspheres lacking factor VIII. The quantity of immobilized factor VIII was estimated by incubation with fluorescein-labeled ESH8, a mAb that binds to the C2 domain of factor VIII but does not interfere with binding to vWf or to phospholipid vesicles (37Saenko E.L. Shima M. Gilbert G.E. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27424-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Antibody binding curves were generated as described for ÎPro vWf, above. The apparent affinity of ESH8 for wild type factor VIII and the mutants were equivalent, as predicted. The maximum fluorescence, with an ESH8 concentration of 80 nm, was used as the denominator to normalize binding curves for ÎPro vWf to the quantity of immobilized factor VIII bound. The affinity of factor VIII for plasma vWf was measured in a competition ELISA. Factor VIII, M/F 2199/2200, or L/L 2251/2252 at 1 unit/ml or mutant 4-Ala at 3 units/ml were incubated with various concentrations of vWf for 1 h at room temperature. One hour is sufficient for the factor VIII-vWf interaction to come to equilibrium (38Vlot A.J. Koppelman S.J. Meijers J.C.M. Damas C. van den Berg H.M. Bouma B.N. Sixma J.J. Willems G.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these factor VIII concentrations (<1 nm) are substantially lower than the K D for ESH4 binding (â¼20 nm; data not shown). Subsequently, the mixtures of factor VIII with vWf were placed in microtiter wells coated with antibody ESH4. vWf competes for the ESH4 epitope so that only free factor VIII was available to bind to immobilized ESH4. These conditions were chosen so that the assay results would report the equilibrium affinity of mutants and wild type factor VIII for vWf. After 1 h of incubation, the wells were washed thoroughly, and bound factor VIII was detected with antibody ESH8, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. The wells were developed with p-nitophenyl phosphate reagent (Sigma). The competition binding data were interpreted as binding data by assuming that all factor VIII that was not bound to ESH4 was bound to vWf and that binding to vWf was an equilibrium binding process. The ELISA data were subtracted from a constant value equivalent to the maximum colorimetric intensity to generate upright binding curves. The data from two experiments were combined, and the combined curves were fitted by nonlinear, least squares analysis using Graphpad Prism 3.0 software on a Macintosh computer. We altered amino acids of the C2 domain of factor VIII based upon their hypothetical function in membrane binding (22Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L.

The proposed functions that we considered are membrane-penetrating hydrophobic spikes (Met2199/Phe2200 and Leu2151/Leu2152), phospho-l-serine binding motifs (Phe2196/Thr2197, Gln2213, Asn2217, Arg2220, and Arg2320), hydrophobic membrane contact (Val2223and Trp2313) ionic membrane contact (Arg2215, Arg2220, Lys2227, and Lys2249), and provision of positive net charge (Arg2209 and Lys2227). In addition, three residues implicated in maintenance of overall C2 domain stability were mutated (Glu2327/Gln2329/Asp2330) (40Kuwabara I. Maruyama H. Kamisue S. Shima M. Yoshioka A. Maruyama I.N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 224: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These residues were changed to alanine singly or in groups, as indicated.

Thr phosphorylation is more transient than Ser phosphorylation. The Thr phosphorylation may regulate the adhesive state of the integrin, because mutation of three consecutive threonines in the integrin chain (Thr-758, Thr-759, and Thr-760) reduce integrin binding to ICAM-1 (29Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and cytoskeletal association (16Peter K. Toole T.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) of the integrin molecules. Additionally, phosphorylated integrin molecules preferentially partition with the actin cytoskeleton (33Valmu L. Fagerholm S. Suila H. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2107-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), indicating that phosphorylation of integrins could regulate integrin-cytoskeleton interactions. In addition to their adhesive properties, the integrins are also involved in activating intracellular signaling pathways and can thus mediate bi-directional signaling across the plasma membrane. In fibroblasts they form focal adhesion complexes with cytoskeletal elements and a wide range of signaling molecules (34Schoenwaelder S. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar).

In this study, we present evidence that PKC isoforms are the major protein kinases that phosphorylate the C terminus of the integrin CD18 chain in leukocytes. Ser-745 is identified as a novel phosphorylation site in the integrin cytoplasmic domain. Additionally, we show that a Thr-758-phosphorylated integrin peptide can interact with 14-3-3 proteins in leukocyte lysates and thus potentially initiate signaling complex formation âdownstreamâ of the phosphorylated integrin molecules.

The complex was injected into sheep at the Scottish Antibody Production Unit (Carluke, Scotland). The antiserum was passed through agarose to which the relevant phosphorylated peptide had been coupled covalently, and the phosphospecific antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.4, immediately adjusted to pH 8.0 with Tris-HCl, and stored at 4 Â°C. This was carried out by Dr. J. Leitch and C. Clark in our laboratory. The CD18 integrin antibodies R7E4 and R2E7B have been described previously (14Patarroyo M. Beatty P.G. Fabre J.W. Gahmberg C.G.

The monoclonal antibody OKT3, which reacts with CD3, was used in the form of ascites fluid produced by hybridoma cells (clone CRL 8001, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). PKC isozyme-specific antibodies were from Transduction laboratories (Lexington, KY). The broadly reactive 14-3-3Î² (K-19) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein kinases were assayed using a peptide corresponding to the integrin CD18 C terminus (RRFEK EKLKS QWNND NPLFK SATTT VMNPK FAES). Recombinant PKC isoforms and activity eluting from column fractions were measured at 30 Â°C in an assay containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 Î¼g/ml peptide, 2.5 Î¼m PKI, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 0.1 mm [Î³-32P]ATP (106 cpm/nmol). One unit of activity was that amount that catalyzed the incorporation of 1 nmol of phosphate into the synthetic peptide in 1 min. Human leukocytes were isolated from buffy coat pools by centrifuging for 20 min at 1500 Ã g. The leukocyte layer was then subjected to Ficoll gradient centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27m sucrose, 2 Î¼m microcystin, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in aliquots at â80 Â°C. The lysates (12 g of protein) were fractionated from 10 to 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG). After stirring for 3 h at 4 Â°C, the 20% PEG suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 7000 Ã g, the supernatant discarded, and the pellet redissolved in 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) Brij 35). The solution was applied to a 5-ml Hitrap Q column equilibrated in buffer A. After washing with equilibration buffer, the column was developed with a linear salt gradient to 0.7 m NaCl in the same buffer. One major peak of activity was detected eluting at 0.3â0.4 m NaCl, which was pooled, diluted 5-fold in buffer B (50 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.03% (w/v) Brij 35), and applied to a 1-ml Hitrap heparin column equilibrated in buffer B. After washing until no protein could be detected in the eluate, the column was developed with a linear salt gradient to 1 m NaCl. One major peak of activity was detected, eluting at 0.2 m NaCl. This was pooled, diluted in buffer B, and applied to a 1-ml MonoQ column, which was developed with a linear salt gradient to 0.7 m NaCl. The most active fractions, eluting at 0.3 m NaCl were pooled, diluted with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) Brij 35), and applied to a 1-ml MonoQ column, which was developed with a linear salt gradient to 1 m NaCl. The most active fractions, eluting at 0.3 m NaCl were pooled, concentrated to 25 Î¼l with Vivaspin columns, and subjected to gel filtration on Superdex 200 (30 Ã 0.32 cm) equilibrated in buffer A plus 0.15 m NaCl. Fractions of 50 Î¼l were collected. The flow-through from the Hitrap-heparin column was chromatographed successively on 1-ml MonoQ columns equilibrated in buffer B and buffer C, respectively, as described above. A single major activity peak was detected eluting at 0.3 m NaCl in buffer B and 0.35m in buffer C. The activity was then chromatographed on a 2-ml protamine-agarose column equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A plus 200 mm NaCl and then with buffer A plus 1 m NaCl. Four fractions, each of 6 ml, were collected. Proteins of interest were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, digested with trypsin, and identified using a Perspective Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Elite STR matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight-mass spectrometer as described previously (46Woods L.Y. Rena G. Morrice N. Barthel A. Becker W. Guo S. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis of integrin CD18 C terminus was also performed as described (47Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins were affinity-purified from human leukocytes using R7E4 columns as described previously (48Kantor C. Suomalainen-Nevanlinna H. Patarroyo M. Osterlund K. Bergman T. Jornvall H. Schroder J. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and were at least 90% pure as monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Fractionation of cells into soluble and cytoskeletal fractions was done after lysis in the presence of Triton X-100 as described (27Fagerholm S. Prescott A. Cohen P. Gahmberg C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the peptides CNPLFKpSATTTV and CLFKSApTTTVMN corresponding to the sequences surrounding phosphorylated Ser-756 and Thr-758, respectively (where pS and pT indicate phosphoserine and phosphothreonine), were coupled to vinylsulfone-activated agarose via the N-terminal cysteine residue. The cytosol and solubilized cytoskeletal fractions (0.5â1 mg of protein) were then subjected to affinity chromatography on each peptide-agarose column as described (33Valmu L. Fagerholm S. Suila H. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2107-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For detection of the CD11/CD18 integrin with phospho-specific antibodies, the integrin was first immunoprecipitated from 2.0 to 2.5 mg of lysate protein with 20 Î¼g of R7E4 coupled noncovalently to protein G-Sepharose. Bound proteins were eluted with 1% SDS, then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the phosphorylated integrin was immunoblotted and detected using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The phosphospecific antibody that recognizes CD18 phosphorylated at Ser-745 was used at 2 Î¼g/ml in the presence of 5 Î¼g/ml unphosphorylated peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The Ser-756 phosphospecific antibody was used at the same concentration but in the presence of 25 Î¼g/ml unphosphorylated peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Incubation with both antibodies was carried out overnight in 4 Â°C. The antibody R2E7B which recognizes phosphorylated and unphosphorylated CD18 equally well was used at 1:5000 dilution. The antibody against the PKCÎ± catalytic domain, which also reacts with PKCÎ² isoforms, was used as a dilution of 1:1000. An antibody that recognizes all 14-3-3 isoforms was used at 1 Î¼g/ml. To identify the major CD18 kinases, human leukocyte lysates were initially fractionated on MonoQ. All the activity was retained by the column and eluted as one major peak (Fig.1A), which was pooled and chromatographed on heparin-Sepharose. At this step, 80% of the activity was not retained by the column, whereas 20% was bound. The activity present in both fractions was then further purified as described under âExperimental Procedures.â A flow chart of the overall purification protocol is shown in Fig.2.Figure 2Protocol for the purification of the major CD18 kinase activities in leukocyte lysates. The specific activity and overall yield from Hitrap Q pH 7.5 is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activity that was retained by heparin-Sepharose eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa at the final gel filtration step (Fig. 3A). SDS-PAGE revealed two major proteins, whose elution position correlated with activity (Fig. 3B). When the fractions were incubated with Mg[Î³-32P]ATP, both proteins became phosphorylated (Fig. 3C), suggesting that they might be protein kinases capable of autophosphorylation. The bands were excised and subjected to tryptic mass fingerprinting, which revealed that they both corresponded to the Î´-isoform of PKC. All the peptides detected were located in the catalytic domain of PKCÎ´ (Table I). This observation and the apparent molecular mass of the purified protein (which is much smaller than full-length PKCÎ´) indicated that it represented an active proteolytic fragment. Such fragments are known to be active in the absence of phospholipids and diacylglycerol, which are required for the activity of full-length PKCÎ´. This explains why these active fragments were detected, because the assays did not contain the cofactors essential for the activation of PKC isoforms.Table IIdentification of the 42-kDa band in Fig. 3, B and D, as the catalytic domain of PKCÎ´Mass measuredTheoreticalResidue no.Peptide sequence727.3920727.3779395â399(R)FELYR(A)771.4979771.4980313â319(K)VLLGELK(G)788.4502788.4459549â554(K)IHPFFK(T)801.4859801.4834541â548(R)LGVTGNIK(I)806.4185806.4048287â293(K)IWEGSSK(C)827.4313827.4303322â328(R)GEYFAIK(A)940.5089940.5005393â399(K)GRFELYR(A)951.4622951.4536447â454(K)ENIFGESR(A)984.4967984.4903512â519(R)VDTPHYPR(W)1019.55201019.5526532â539(K)LFEREPTK(R)1040.55771040.5529320â328(K)GRGEYFAIK(A)1117.62791117.6257555â563(K)TINWTLLEK(R)1139.66081139.6465322â331(R)GEYFAIKALK(K)1139.66081139.6689565â573(R)RLEPPFRPK(V)1175.65491175.6537532â540(K)LFEREPTKR(L)1273.72721273.7268555â564(K)TINWTLLEKR(R)1306.62921306.6367294â303(K)CNINNFIFHK(V)1313.72941313.7429423â433(R)DLKLDNVLLDR(D)1507.81371507.8233426â438(K)LDNVLLDRDGHIK(I)1648.72551648.7131579â591(R)DYSNFDQEFLNEK(A)1863.97961864.0292423â438(R)DLKLDNVLLDRDGHIK(I)1873.78811873.8238269â286(K)KTGVAGEDMQDNSGTYGK(I)1-aMethionine sulfone derivative is indicated.1873.78811873.8577439â454(K)IADFGMCKENIFGESR(A)1879.84831879.8669333â348(K)DVVLIDDVECTMVEK(R)2035.96582035.9680333â349(K)DVVLIDDVECTMVEKR(V)2086.98362087.0094400â417(R)ATFYAAEIMCGLQFLHSK(G)2103.03812103.0043400â417(R)ATFYAAEIMCGLQFLHSK(G)1-aMethionine sulfone derivative is indicated.1-bPeptides only were detected in the protamine-agarose eluate.2417.24602417.2903350â370(R)VLTLAAENPFLTHLICTFQTK(D)983.5844983.5678566â573(R)LEPPFRPK(V)1-bPeptides only were detected in the protamine-agarose eluate.Tryptic peptides from the 42-kDa autophosphorylating bands in Fig. 3, B and D, were analyzed on a Perspective Biosystems Elite STR matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometer as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The tryptic ions were scanned against the Swiss-Prot and Genpep databases using the SF-FIT program of Protein Prospector.

https://openalex.org/W2168721627,"The ability of copper,zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) to catalyze autoxidation of cysteine and other thiols was investigated by measuring thiol loss and oxygen consumption. The reaction occurred equally well with the bovine and human enzymes and produced hydrogen peroxide and the corresponding disulfide. It did not occur with manganese SOD and is not, therefore, due to the dismutase activity of the enzyme. Cysteine and cysteamine were highly reactive: the Km for cysteine was 1.4 mm andVmax (with 40 Î¼g/ml SOD) 35 Î¼m/min; the equivalent values for cysteamine (with 20 Î¼g/ml SOD) were 1.4 mm and 36 Î¼m/min. With 1 mm thiol and 40 Î¼g/ml SOD, rates of oxidation of other thiols (Î¼m/min) were as follows: GSH, 1.0; dithiothreitol, 2.1; dihydrolipoic acid, 1.7; homocysteine, 1.6; cys-gly, 1.4; penicillamine, 0.6; and N-acetylcysteine, 0.1. SOD-mediated oxidation of cysteine, in the absence of chelating agents, proceeded only after a variable lag phase. The lag was decreased but not eliminated with Chelex-treated reagents and is attributed to interference by submicromolar concentrations of iron and possibly other transition metal ions. SOD-catalyzed oxidation of the other thiols was variably affected by adventitious metal ions and chelating agents. Reactions were all performed in the presence of desferrioxamine to obviate these effects. SOD-catalyzed oxidation of GSH and homocysteine was enhanced by cysteine through a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism. This study characterizes a novel pro-oxidant thiol oxidase activity of Cu,Zn-SOD.

Thiols are generally viewed as antioxidants. GSH is present intracellularly in millimolar concentrations and acts with glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase to remove peroxides. GSH and other thiols can also scavenge radicals and in combination with SOD constitute an efficient radical removal system (8Munday R. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 4349-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 10Winterbourn C.C.

However, thiols can act as pro-oxidants by undergoing autoxidation to produce hydrogen peroxide (13Misra H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2151-2155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Biaglow J.E. Varnes M.E. Radiat. Res. 1983; 95: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Kachur A.V. Koch C.J.

The reaction is metal-catalyzed, with copper being a particularly effective catalyst. Autoxidation is considered to be important in the well established cytotoxicity of low molecular weight thiols (18Munday R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 237-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Held K.D. Sylvester F.C. Hopcia K.L. Biaglow J.E. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cu,Zn-SOD, if it were a catalyst of this reaction, could be a promoter of thiol toxicity. We have investigated the ability of Cu,Zn-SOD to catalyze autoxidation of cysteine, GSH, and a range of physiological relevant thiols. In previous studies of superoxide-mediated thiol oxidation, we noted that addition of SOD to some thiols alone appeared to promote oxidation (10Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Others have made similar observations with cysteine (20Biaglow J.E. Issels R.W. Gerweck L.E. Varnes M.E. Jacobson B. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Radiat. Res. 1984; 100: 298-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Saez G. Thornalley P.J. Hill H.A. Hems R. Bannister J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The explanation given, that superoxide somehow protects cysteine against oxidation (13Misra H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2151-2155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Saez G. Thornalley P.J. Hill H.A. Hems R. Bannister J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), is not consistent with current knowledge of how superoxide interacts with thiols (11Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12Zhang N. Schuchmann H.-P. von Sonntag C. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 95: 4718-4722Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After further investigation, we report here that the enzyme does not act in these systems simply by dismutating superoxide. Instead, we demonstrate a novel activity of Cu,Zn-SOD, namely the catalysis of thiol oxidation by oxygen. This thiol oxidase activity is high for cysteine and cysteamine but much lower with GSH and a range of other biological thiols. Unless stated otherwise, all biochemicals, including thiol compounds, were purchased from Sigma. Catalase, bovine erythrocyte, and liver Cu,Zn-SOD, human Cu,Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD were used without further purification. Human erythrocyte Cu,Zn-SOD was isolated in our laboratory from red cell lysate by successive chromatography on DEAE-Sepaharose and phenyl-Sepharose and ran as single band on SDS-PAGE in the same position as Sigma human Cu,Zn-SOD. SOD concentrations were determined by weight or using the Bio-Rad (Lowry-based) DC protein assay standardized with bovine serum albumin. Micromolar concentrations of the bovine enzyme were determined spectrophotometrically, using Îµ258 = 10.3 Ã 103mâ1 cmâ1 (22Rotilio G. Calabrese L. Bossa F. Barra D. Finazzi-Agro A. Mondovi B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2182-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and on this basis, 40 Î¼g/ml corresponded to 1.2 Î¼m. Where the term SOD is used in the text, it refers to the bovine erythrocyte Cu,Zn enzyme. The apoenzyme was prepared by initial dialysis against 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 3.8, + 10 mm EDTA followed by exhaustive dialysis with 0.1m NaCl to remove the bound chelator (23Valentine J.S. Pantoliano M.W. McDonnell P.J. Burger A.R. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Dismutase activities were measured by a microtiter plate assay using WST-1 (water-soluble tetrazolium salt; Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan)) and a xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine superoxide generating system (24Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2000; 293: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The amount of protein required per well (200 Î¼l volume) to give 50% inhibition of WST-1 reduction was 2.5 Â± 0.4, 3.3 Â± 0.4, and 2.4 Â± 0.9 ng for the bovine erythrocyte, bovine liver, and human erythrocyte enzymes, respectively. Except where indicated otherwise, buffers and thiol solutions were treated with washed Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) for at least 2 h and then separated by careful decantation. Solutions were stored in plastic containers, and contact with glass was avoided. Thiols, at concentrations indicated in the appropriate figure legends, were incubated with SOD in air at 37 Â°C in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 25 mmphosphate buffer, at pH 7.4, and with catalase (10 Î¼g/ml) present unless indicated otherwise. Samples were removed at intervals and mixed with a 5,5â²-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid solution to measure free thiol concentration. Absorbances were measured on a Cary1E Spectrophotometer and thiol concentrations calculated using Îµ412 = 14,100 (25Jocelyn P.C. Jakoby W.B. Griffith O.W. Sulfur and Sulfur Amino Acids. Academic Press, New York1995: 44-67Google Scholar). With GSH, disulfide formation was detected by a glutathione reductase/NADPH system (26Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism: A Manual of Biochemical Methods. Grune and Stratton, Orlando1984: 134Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments Co., Yellow Springs, OH). To establish whether thiol oxidase activity was due to loosely bound metal ions, bovine Cu,Zn-SOD (2 mg/ml) was mixed with DTPA (200 Î¼m) in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, then after 10 min, 75 Î¼l was passed through a spin column equilibrated in the same buffer without DTPA. Cysteine oxidation was then measured with 40 Î¼g/ml SOD and 1 mm cysteine in the presence and absence of DTPA and related to dismutase activity and total protein concentration. Thiol oxidation studies were performed at pH 7.4 in the presence of catalase and, for reasons described below, 1 Î¼m desferrioxamine. Under these conditions, cysteine alone underwent no detectable oxidation, but in the presence of bovine erythrocyte Cu,Zn-SOD there was rapid thiol loss (Fig. 1). Human erythrocyte Cu,Zn-SOD and bovine liver Cu,Zn-SOD also caused cysteine oxidation at a comparable rate to those with the bovine erythrocyte enzyme. The reaction was specific to Cu,Zn-SOD, as incubation with Mn-SOD caused no loss of cysteine. This establishes that the promotion of thiol oxidation by Cu,Zn-SOD is not simply a consequence of its ability to catalyze superoxide dismutation. Copper (and/or zinc) was required to promote cysteine oxidation, as the metal-depleted apoenzyme was inactive (data not shown). SOD has a characteristic Cu(II) absorbance peak with a maximum at 680 nm (27Lyons T.J. Liu H. Goto J.J. Nersissian A. Roe J.A. Graden J.A. Cafe C. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12240-12244Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). On addition of cysteine, there was a rapid decrease inA680 (Fig. 2), indicating that cysteine reduces the active site copper. GSH, which reacted only slowly with SOD (see below), gave no obvious absorbance loss at 680 nm. As Cu2+ is an excellent catalyst of thiol oxidation, it was important to exclude the possibility that cysteine oxidation was simply due to adventitious or loosely bound copper in the enzyme preparation. With free Cu2+, we observed oxidation of cysteine (1 mm) at a rate of 50 Î¼m/min/Î¼mCu2+, i.e. about 10 times faster on a molar basis than with SOD. Others have analyzed Sigma bovine Cu,Zn-SOD preparations and found less than 3% of the copper to be loosely bound (28Jewett S.L. Cushing S. Gillespie F. Smith D. Sparks S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Analyses that we performed, by the method of Crow et al. (5Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), gave results consistent with this figure. To test directly if cysteine oxidation could have been caused by adventitious copper, we pretreated the SOD with a 5-fold molar excess of DTPA, then removed the DTPA on a spin column. Dismutase activities and protein concentrations were measured before and after passage through the column to account for losses. When related to either measure, rates of thiol oxidation by the treated and untreated enzyme were identical, even with three successive DTPA treatments and passages through the column. Extensive dialysis of the SOD against Chelexed phosphate buffer, either with or without pretreatment with DTPA, also did not diminish its ability to promote cysteine oxidation. Thus, it is unlikely that this activity was caused by bound copper. Cysteine loss in the presence of Cu,Zn-SOD was accompanied by oxygen consumption. The mole ratio of thiol loss to oxygen consumed, measured over 20 min in the same solution, was 3.8 Â± 0.3 (n = 4). The oxygen consumption rate was decreased, to about 73%, by the addition of catalase, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide was produced in the reaction. Any hydrogen peroxide formed would be expected to cause additional cysteine oxidation (10Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 29Ehrenberg L. Harms-Ringdahl M. Fedorcsak I. Granath F. Acta Chem. Scand. 1989; 43: 177-188Crossref Google Scholar). We routinely added catalase when measuring thiol oxidation to avoid complications due to this reaction. In the absence of catalase (with 1 mm cysteine and 40 Î¼g/ml SOD), cysteine oxidation was 1.38 Â± 0.12 times faster (n = 5) than with catalase present. The effect of catalase was the same at 4â20 Î¼g/ml and independent of whether the enzyme was Chelex-treated. These results are consistent with hydrogen peroxide being produced in Reaction 2 and oxidizing further cysteine as in Reaction 3.O2+2RSHâSODââH2O2+RSSRREACTION2H2O2+2RSHâ2H2O+RSSRREACTION3As described below, SOD also promoted GSH autoxidation but at a very much lower rate. GSSG formation was measured in this reaction and accounted for at least 80% of the GSH loss. This is also consistent with Reaction 2. Although the hydrogen peroxide formed could potentially inactivate the SOD (2Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar), pre-exposure of the SOD to cysteine (in the absence of catalase), then dialysis, caused no loss of dismutase activity or ability to promote further cysteine oxidation (data not shown). The reactivities of various physiologically relevant thiol compounds with bovine Cu,Zn-SOD were determined (Table I). Cysteamine reacted almost twice as rapidly as cysteine. With all the other thiols, addition of SOD caused a significant increase in oxidation rate, but they were at least 5-fold less reactive that cysteine. It is noteworthy that the major intracellular thiol, GSH, was oxidized very slowly. High activity was not simply a property of aminothiols or associated with low thiol group pK, as penicillamine was poorly oxidized. DTT, dihydrolipoic acid, homocysteine, and Cys-Gly showed 1.5â2 times the reactivity of GSH, but N-acetylcysteine was almost inactive.Table IThiol oxidase activity of bovine Cu,Zn-SODThiolThiol oxidationÎ¼m/minCysteamine19.2 Â± 3.1 (8)1-ap < 0.001.Cysteine11.7 Â± 1.2 (8)1-ap < 0.001.Dithiothreitol2.1 Â± 0.2 (4)1-ap < 0.001.Dihydrolipoic acid1.7 Â± 0.2 (4)1-ap < 0.001.Homocysteine1.6 Â± 0.4 (4)1-ap < 0.001.Cysteine-glycine1.4 Â± 0.2 (4)1-bp = 0.02.Reduced glutathione1.0 Â± 0.3 (4)1-bp = 0.02.Penicillamine0.6 Â± 0.3 (4)1-ap < 0.001.N -Acetylcysteine0.1 Â± 0.0 (4)1-ap < 0.001.Thiols, at 1 mM thiol group concentration, were incubated with SOD (40 Î¼g/ml) at 37 Â°C in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing desferrioxamine (1 Î¼m) and catalase (4 Î¼g/ml). The buffer was Chelex-treated, and all reagents were stored in new plastic containers. Under the same conditions, rates of thiol autoxidation in the absence of SOD were less than 0.3 Î¼m/min. The exceptions were dihydrolipoic acid and dithiothreitol, which had rates less than 0.7 Î¼m/min. Thiols with oxidation rates less than cysteine were incubated for up to 9 h to establish that there was no increase in oxidation rate with time. The number of experiments is given in parentheses. In all cases there was a statistically significant difference between thiol oxidation in the presence and absence of Cu,Zn-SOD.1-a p < 0.001.1-b p = 0.02. Open table in a new tab Thiols, at 1 mM thiol group concentration, were incubated with SOD (40 Î¼g/ml) at 37 Â°C in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing desferrioxamine (1 Î¼m) and catalase (4 Î¼g/ml). The buffer was Chelex-treated, and all reagents were stored in new plastic containers. Under the same conditions, rates of thiol autoxidation in the absence of SOD were less than 0.3 Î¼m/min. The exceptions were dihydrolipoic acid and dithiothreitol, which had rates less than 0.7 Î¼m/min. Thiols with oxidation rates less than cysteine were incubated for up to 9 h to establish that there was no increase in oxidation rate with time. The number of experiments is given in parentheses. In all cases there was a statistically significant difference between thiol oxidation in the presence and absence of Cu,Zn-SOD. Although SOD showed very little oxidase activity with GSH and homocysteine, addition of cysteine promoted the oxidation of both thiols, as demonstrated by thiol loss in excess of the cysteine added (Fig. 3). DTT is frequently added at high concentration to cell extracts containing SOD. Therefore, we measured cysteine oxidation rates at higher DTT concentrations. Rates of oxidation were linear over 2 h and increased linearly with DTT concentration to approximately 0.4 mm/h with 4 mm DTT (8 mm thiol; not shown). The rates of loss of cysteine and cysteamine increased with increasing thiol concentration (Fig.4A). In each case there was evidence of saturation. With 40 Î¼g/ml (1.2 Î¼m) SOD, cysteine showed a Km of 1.4 mm andVmax of 35 Î¼m/min. Cysteamine (with 20 Î¼g/ml enzyme) also showed a Km of 1.4 mm and Vmax of 36 Î¼m/min. The rate of cysteine oxidation was linearly dependent on SOD concentration, but with cysteamine, the curve flattened above 20 Î¼g/ml enzyme (Fig. 4B). Thus at maximum efficiency, the turnover numbers for cysteine and cysteamine were â¼30 and 60/min, respectively. The rate of cysteine oxidation increased more than 10-fold when the SOD was inactivated by heating at 105 Â°C for 40 min. This is not surprising as boiling the enzyme would release the active site copper. Adding a 2- or 4-fold excess of Mn-SOD over Cu,Zn-SOD (per catalytic site) did not affect the rate of cysteine oxidation (rate with Mn-SOD = 99 Â± 10% of that without Mn-SOD,n = 4). For cysteine, under the same conditions as for Fig. 1, initial rates of oxidation at pH 7.0, 7.4, and 8.0 were 9.3 Â± 0.4, 8.9 Â± 0.1, and 9.2 Â± 0.4 Î¼m/min, respectively, indicating no pH dependence in this range. With desferrioxamine present, initial rates of SOD-mediated thiol oxidation were linear (as shown for cysteine in Fig. 1). In the absence of chelating agents, the kinetics were very different. For cysteine (Fig.5) there was a lag phase, and the overall oxidation rate was decreased. Oxidation rates varied unpredictably depending on the buffer preparation and were substantially increased, with less lag, if the reagents were treated with Chelex resin. Adding the product of the reaction, cystine, at the start did not overcome the lag (not shown). DTPA almost eliminated the lag but gave a slower overall rate than with desferrioxamine (Fig. 5). The rate of cysteine oxidation was the same in the presence of 1 or 10 Î¼mdesferrioxamine, either with 1.2 Î¼m SOD (Fig. 5) or with 6 Î¼m SOD (not shown). This indicates that it was not necessary to have as much chelator as active site copper. Rates in the presence of desferrioxamine were the same in Chelexed and unChelexed buffer (not shown). One possible explanation for the results shown in Fig. 5 is that the chelators acted by removing and activating loosely bound copper from the enzyme and that in the absence of chelator, cysteine alone slowly displaced the metal, accounting for the lag. This can be discounted on the basis that DTPA pretreatment did not decrease the activity of the enzyme (see above). Furthermore, the lag phase was still evident with SOD that had been pretreated with DTPA, and it disappeared when further DTPA was added. This suggests that the chelator was interacting with a constituent of the reaction mixture and not with the enzyme. This complex set of observations could be explained by the reagents containing trace amounts of adventitious transition metal ion(s) that affect the rate of cysteine oxidation by SOD and give rise to a lag phase. The results with desferrioxamine point to iron being involved. Ehrenberg et al. (29Ehrenberg L. Harms-Ringdahl M. Fedorcsak I. Granath F. Acta Chem. Scand. 1989; 43: 177-188Crossref Google Scholar) have noted that iron can inhibit the autoxidation of cysteine catalyzed by free copper ions. We have found this inhibition to be extremely potent, such that with 0.4 Î¼m Cu2+, ferrous sulfate has an IC50 of about 50 nm. 2R. Munday and C. Winterbourn, unpublished data. Adding submicromolar concentrations of Fe2+ ions to SOD and cysteine caused a progressive decrease in the rate of cysteine oxidation. As shown for 0.5 Î¼m iron in Fig.6, the effect of the metal was entirely abrogated by desferrioxamine. These results provide strong support for the conclusion that traces of iron (and perhaps other transition metals) in the reagents interfere with SOD-mediated cysteine oxidation and that to study the system without this complication it is necessary to add desferrioxamine. EDTA and DTPA were not as effective as desferrioxamine at eliminating the effects of adventitious metals, and in the presence or absence of either of these chelators, rates of cysteine oxidation varied in the pH 7â8 range (data not shown). SOD-mediated oxidation of the other thiols was also influenced by adventitious metals, but not necessarily in the same way as with cysteine. This complex interaction with metal ions shows similar features to their effect on thiol oxidation by free copper ions.2 A mechanistic study of the effects of trace metals and chelators on the thiol reactivity of copper and SOD will be published elsewhere. We have shown that Cu,Zn-SOD promotes the autoxidation of low molecular weight thiols. The reaction involves reduction of the active site copper, consumes oxygen, and produces hydrogen peroxide and disulfide. It is not a consequence of the dismutase activity of the enzyme, as no thiol oxidation was seen with Mn-SOD. Rather, it is a characteristic of the Cu,Zn enzyme, and as demonstrated with cysteine, the human and bovine enzymes exhibit comparable reactivity. The oxidase activity was particularly high with the aminothiols, cysteine, and cysteamine. Other thiols, including GSH, were much less reactive. It is well known that copper ions are efficient catalysts of thiol autoxidation and that aminothiols are more susceptible than DTT or GSH to copper-catalyzed oxidation (16Kachur A.V. Koch C.J. Biaglow J.E. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 28: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Kachur A.V. Held K.D. Koch C.J. Biaglow J.E. Radiat.

On a molar equivalent basis, the cysteine oxidase activity we observed with SOD was about a tenth that of free Cu2+. This activity was not due to adventitious or loosely bound copper that could be removed by pretreatment of the enzyme with chelator. Bovine SOD from erythrocytes and liver, and human erythrocyte SOD prepared by two different methods, all had comparable reactivity. It is unlikely, therefore, that it was due to a contaminant or partially denatured enzyme, as these would vary between preparations. We conclude that the active site copper was involved and that Cu,Zn-SOD has thiol oxidase activity. Although less active than free copper, from a physiological perspective this activity of Cu,Zn-SOD is potentially significant. At a typical cell concentration (â¼100 Î¼g/ml), SOD acting at its maximum efficiency could consume about 0.1 mm cysteine/min, with concomitant hydrogen peroxide production. Even with GSH, which reacted more than 10 times more slowly, this reaction could be a significant source of hydrogen peroxide in the cell. Regarding the mechanism of thiol oxidation, our observation of saturating effects with cysteine and cysteamine suggests that an intermediate complex with the enzyme is involved. The lack of inhibition by excess Mn-SOD indicates that superoxide is not required to oxidize the reduced SOD. It also suggests a two-electron transfer directly from oxygen to the complex to regenerate the Cu(II) form of the enzyme and a sulfenic acid equivalent, rather than release of thiyl radicals and subsequent superoxide generation. One possibility is the scheme proposed in Reactions 4âR6, in which the sulfenic acid would react with more thiol to give the disulfide and the SOD would be available to complex more cysteine. This is similar to the inner sphere mechanism proposed for free Cu2+, although there is equivocal evidence for at least some superoxide production (13Misra H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2151-2155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kachur A.V. Koch C.J. Biaglow J.E. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Kachur A.V.

With SOD, where there is a narrow (4 â«) hydrophobic channel (32Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nature. 1983; 306: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), it is more likely that only one cysteine could access the active site copper or that there is long range electron transfer.SODâCu2++RSHâ[SODâCu2+âRSââSODâCu+âRSâ]+H+REACTION4[SODâCu+âRSâ]+O2+H++H2OâSODâCu2++RSOH+H2O2REACTION5RSH+RSOHâRSSR+H2OREACTION6By generating hydrogen peroxide, the reaction between Cu,Zn-SOD and thiols is a potential source of reactive oxidants in biological systems. The toxicity of thiols to cells is well documented, with the aminothiols, cysteine and cysteamine, being most potent (18Munday R. Adv.

In a number of these studies, hydrogen peroxide formed by autoxidation has been implicated in the toxicity and a copper-mediated mechanism proposed. Our results suggest that physiologically, Cu,Zn-SOD is a likely catalyst of this reaction. There are other instances where Cu,Zn-SOD has been seen to enhance the toxicity of cysteine (39Carlsson J. Granberg G.P. Nyberg G.K. Edlund M.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 37: 383-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Nyberg G.K. Granberg G.P. Carlsson J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 38: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect was attributed to copper released from the enzyme damaged by oxidative modification, but our findings suggest that SOD itself may have been responsible. GSH was much less reactive than cysteine and was minimally oxidized in our experimental system. This low reactivity should allow millimolar concentrations of GSH to coexist with Cu,Zn-SOD in the cell without generating large amounts of peroxide. This would not be true for cysteine. Maintenance of low cyst(e)ine concentrations and evolution of GSH as the major cytosolic thiol have largely alleviated the pro-oxidant threat of SOD and readily oxidized thiols. Radical scavenging by GSH generates superoxide, so that for effective radical removal, the concerted action of GSH and SOD is required (8Munday R. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 4349-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The low reactivity between the two should not compromise this antioxidant function. Intracellular GSH could, however, contribute to the toxicity of reactive thiols such as cysteine. We observed that small amounts of cysteine promoted autoxidation of GSH, presumably via SOD-catalyzed oxidation of cysteine and a disulfide exchange mechanism to recycle the cystine formed. An elevation in intracellular cyst(e)ine, therefore, has the potential to expose all the GSH to oxidation. With enzymatic recycling of the GSSG, this could generate large amounts of hydrogen peroxide. Promotion of homocysteine oxidation by cysteine and SOD was also observed. Elevated homocysteine is a recognized risk factor in cardiovascular disease (41Stamler J.S. Slivka A. Nutr. Rev. 1996; 54: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide from homocysteine autoxidation could be a contributing factor to the disease (42Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Autoxidation of homocysteine is slow, even in the presence of copper ions, but it can be accelerated by small amounts of cyst(e)ine (43Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol Med. 1999; 27: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our finding that the same occurs with Cu,Zn-SOD suggests that it may be more relevant than copper as a physiologically catalyst. Of the other thiols we examined, Cys-Gly and dihydrolipoic acid showed comparable reactivity to GSH with Cu,Zn-SOD, whereas penicillamine andN-acetylcysteine were less reactive. Especially at the concentrations likely to be encountered physiologically, we would predict they would cause little oxidative stress. DTT is frequently added to cell extracts or biological samples in high millimolar concentrations. Therefore, its reaction with Cu,Zn-SOD has practical implications. Even though relatively slow, this reaction would be expected to give a steady rate of hydrogen peroxide production and may result in oxidative inactivation of extract constituents. We observed that Cu,Zn-SOD-mediated thiol oxidation was influenced by adventitious metal ions. Whether this is relevant in a physiological context is unclear, but it has practical implications. Initially we observed highly variable and unpredictable kinetics of cysteine oxidation, which we now attribute to interference by traces of iron and possibly other metal ions that we were unable to remove from the reagents. Oxidation of other thiols was also affected, in ways that we shall describe in more detail elsewhere. Interference was eliminated by adding micromolar desferrioxamine. DTPA also affected the oxidation rate, but its effect was not identical to that of desferrioxamine, and it is likely that iron complexed to DTPA still influences the reaction. Thus, experimenters should be aware that Cu,Zn-SOD-mediated thiol oxidation is open to interference by adventitious metal ions and that this will vary depending on the purity of reagents, pH, and whether a chelator is present. Desferrioxamine can be added to overcome this complication. We have no simple explanation for how metal ions inhibit cysteine oxidation by Cu,Zn-SOD. Substoichiometric amounts relative to the active site copper were effective, suggesting that the mechanism involves interference with electron transfer between the cysteine-copper complex and oxygen rather than forming a more oxygen-resistant complex. We and others (29Ehrenberg L. Harms-Ringdahl M. Fedorcsak I. Granath F. Acta Chem. Scand. 1989; 43: 177-188Crossref Google Scholar) have shown that low iron concentrations inhibit cysteine oxidation by free copper, and it is likely that a similar mechanism is involved with SOD. Although SOD has generally been considered strictly as an enzyme that breaks down superoxide, there is interest in other possible activities, particularly in the context of its association with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (1Lyons T.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1999; 36: 125-177PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxidase activity that proceeds via the oxidation of bicarbonate to a radical cation has been documented for Cu,Zn-SOD (2Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I.

Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Cu,Zn-SOD has been reported to cause breakdown of nitrosothiols to generate NO (44Jourd'heuil D. Laroux F.S. Miles A.M. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although others propose that this involves hydrogen peroxide-mediated release of copper (45Singh R.J. Hogg N. Goss S.P. Antholine W.E. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This activity appears to be 2â3-fold higher with mutants associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (46Johnson M.A. Macdonald T.L. Mannick J.B. Conaway M.R. Gaston B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39872-39878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Liochev and Fridovich have addressed the question of whether the superoxide oxidase and reductase activities of SOD can be dissociated (6Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38482-38485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and proposed a superoxide reductase activity of Cu,Zn-SOD in the catalysis of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxidation (7Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). With thiols, we suggest that the enzyme does not classify as a superoxide reductase but rather acts as a thiol oxidase. This novel pro-oxidant function of Cu,Zn-SOD has the potential to generate substantial amounts of hydrogen peroxide and may contribute to the toxicity of thiols such as cysteine and cysteamine and the disruption of cellular thiol equilibrium. We are grateful to Dr. Rex Munday for sharing information on copper-catalyzed thiol oxidation and to both him and Dr. Tony Kettle for helpful discussion."

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1011-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 2Mizuuchi K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These ubiquitous residents of the genomes of all organisms generate insertional mutations and mediate various types of other genome rearrangements, thereby creating an important source of genetic variation (3Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989Google Scholar, 4Sherrat D.J. Mobile Genetic Elements. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 5Saedler H. Gierl A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 204Google Scholar). DNA transposition also has a role in the life cycles of certain bacteriophages, such as Mu (6Chaconas G. Lavoie B.D. Watson M.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, retroviruses and certain retrotransposons integrate into the host chromosome using a chemically similar reaction (7Craig N.L. Science. 1995; 270: 253-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Haren L. Ton-Hoang B. Chandler M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 245-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Transposition chemistry is also utilized for V(D)J recombination, suggesting an ancestral transpositional origin for this important DNA rearrangement reaction (9Hiom K. Melek M. Gellert M. Cell. 1998; 94: 463-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10Agrawal A. Eastman Q.M. Schatz D.G. Nature. 1998; 394: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar).Transposons utilize a common reaction mechanism (Fig. 1) for the DNA breakage reaction and for the joining of the transposon (donor DNA) ends to the target DNA (1Mizuuchi K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1011-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 6Chaconas G. Lavoie B.D. Watson M.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Craig N.L. Science. 1995; 270: 253-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These two critical reaction steps, donor cleavage and strand transfer, are catalyzed by transposase proteins that initially bind sequence-specifically to the transposon ends and then synapse the ends in a protein-DNA complex called a transpososome, within which the chemical reactions then proceed. The chemistry of DNA transposition reactions is relatively well characterized (2Mizuuchi K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Kennedy A.K. Haniford D.B. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 2000; 101: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), mostly because of reconstituted in vitro systems and to conserved reaction mechanisms. However, less is known about the details regarding how transposons find, select, capture, and interact with their target DNA (12Craig N.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 437-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The choice of the integration site can have significant consequences not only for the host organism but also for the transposon itself. Therefore, uncovering the principles of target site selection will reveal important details about the behavior of mobile elements in general. In addition, the current utilization of transposons as molecular tools in vitro is expected to benefit substantially from such information.Transposons select target sites at various, and often intertwined levels, ranging from the broader âregional levelâ to the more fundamental sequence level, which includes a spectrum from sequence-specific to nearly random sites. In addition to the transposase, other transposon-specific or host proteins may also influence target site selection. Therefore, distinguishing between different causing agents and/or combinations can be difficult, especially when analyzed in vivo. For example, the bacterial transposon Tn7 encodes multiple transposase genes(tnsABCDE), which enable it to show an elaborate target site selection arsenal (13Craig N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Craig N.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 204: 27-48PubMed Google Scholar). TnsABC+ TnsD proteins promote high frequency insertion into a specific attTn7 site in theEscherichia coli genome (13Craig N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Craig N.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 204: 27-48PubMed Google Scholar). TnsD binds to theattTn7 site sequence-specifically, and induces DNA distortion that can be recognized by TnsC, which in turn activates the TnsAB machinery (15Kuduvalli P.N. Rao J.E. Craig N.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Rao J.E. Miller P.S. Craig N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). If the attTn7 site is not available, TnsABC +TnsE proteins mediate low frequency insertion into unrelated sites (17Kubo K.M. Craig N.L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Peters J.E. Craig N.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 573-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Regional target preferences can guide transposons to certain regions of their host genome, such as transcriptionally silenced regions with altered chromatin structure or regions upstream of RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes (yeast Ty-elements; Ref. 19Boeke J.D. Devine S.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1087-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Some transposons, such as Mu, Tn7, and the Tn3 family, avoid insertion into themselves and show âtarget immunityâ (12Craig N.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 437-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which can be regarded as a form of regional selection.Most commonly, transposons insert into non-random positions with variable levels of sequence preference detectable within the duplicated target sequence (12Craig N.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 437-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For example, the bacterial transposon Tn10/IS10 prefers the sequence 5â²-NGCTNAGCN-3â² (20Halling S.M. Kleckner N. Cell. 1982; 28: 155-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Bender J. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7996-8000Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), while the Tc1/mariner family elements always insert into a TA (22Van Luenen H.G.A.M. Colloms S.D. Plasterk H.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 293-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,23Van Luenen H.G.A.M. Plasterk H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In some cases, preferences can also be detected in the region surrounding the duplicated sequence. For example, Tc1 prefers the TA embedded in CAYA-TA-TRTG (24Ketting R.F. Fisher S.E.J. Plasterk R.H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4041-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Tn5/IS50 prefers A-GNTYWRANC-T within a cluster of similar sequences (25Goryshin I.Y. Miller J.A. Kil Y.V. Lanzov V.A. Reznikoff W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10716-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Certain target DNA structures can also be preferred. For example, IS231A recognizes a consensus within an apparent S-shaped DNA structure (26Hallet B. RezsoÌhazy R. Mahillon J. Delcour J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly, DNA bent around nucleosomes and cruciform DNA are favored as retroviral integration target sites in vitro (27Muller H-P. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4704-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 28Katz R.A. Gravuer K. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24190-24195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence-related structure has been proposed for Tn10 target site flanking sequences (21Bender J. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7996-8000Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Pribil P.A. Haniford D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and P element insertion sites (30Liao G-C. Rehm E.J. Rubin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3347-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).The bacteriophage Mu DNA transposition reaction mechanism is one of the most extensively studied. In vivo and in certain conditions with plasmid substrates in vitro, the Mu transposition reaction is complex (1Mizuuchi K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1011-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 6Chaconas G. Lavoie B.D. Watson M.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It involves: (i) the catalytic MuA transposase assembled into a tetramer, (ii) the two ends of the genome containing the MuA binding sites, (iii) a number of accessory proteins, and (iv) DNA cofactors. The accessory proteins include a host-encoded DNA bending protein, HU and a phage-encoded activator protein, MuB (31Baker T.A. Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1991; 65: 1003-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The MuB protein stimulates intermolecular strand transfer in the presence of ATP (32Maxwell A. Craigie R. Mizuuchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by binding to targets without Mu end sequences; thereby Mu avoids self-insertion (33Adzuma K. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1988; 53: 257-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, in certain in vitro conditions the Mu transposition reaction can be performed with only MuA, short Mu right-end donor DNA, and target DNA as minimal macromolecular components (Ref. 34Savilahti H. Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Fig.1).Early experiments suggested that bacteriophage Mu transposes essentially randomly into a number of target sites in the host genome (35Bukhari A.I. Zipser D. Nature New Biol. 1972; 236: 240-243Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36Daniell E. Roberts R. Abelson J. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 69: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 37Couturier M. Cell. 1976; 7: 155-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, a closer examination in vivo revealed some degree of non-randomness in targeting (38Raibaud O. Roa M. Braun-Breton C. Schwartz M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 179: 241-248Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Silhavy T.J. Brickman E. Bassford P.J. Casabadan M.J. Shuman H.A. Schwartz M. Beckwith J.R. Mol. Gen.

J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and later, a preference was observed e.g. toward the control region oflacZ when it is not being transcribed (42Wang X. Higgins P.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Phage genome-host DNA junction sequence determination revealed some preference (43Kamp D. Kahman R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1980; 45: 329-336Crossref Google Scholar) at the 5-bp target site duplication (44Allet B. Cell. 1979; 16: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 45Kahman R. Kamp D. Nature. 1979; 280: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An analysis of junction sequences of mini-Mu insertion sites further revealed a similar consensus sequence of duplication (5â²-NY(G/C)RN-3â²) from in vivo and in vitro transposition (46Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An identical consensus was obtained from in vitro reactions containing MuA and HU, either with or without MuB. In addition, a regional target site preference was associated with DNA stretches exhibiting high affinity for the MuB protein (46Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Sequence-level target site selection is difficult to study in vivo because multiple selection factors can act together. The minimal Mu in vitro transposition assay enables the analysis of target site selection under controlled reaction conditions. Therefore, we set up a direct nucleotide level in vitroassay, in which the target choice is influenced by MuA transposase alone. Quantified data were analyzed for the most favored and disfavored target sequences, not only as base pairs, but also as base pair steps that dictate the local DNA structure. Our studies reveal a new perspective on target site selection and a novel means to predict pentamer preference, which was verified by the successful design of preferred target sites within non-preferred sequences. The impact of the surrounding sequences on target site selection was examined, and symmetrical patterns spanning a â¼23â24-bp region around the target pentamer were detected in several DNA structural parameters, suggesting a large DNA binding area for the transpososome and potential hinge regions in the target DNA.DISCUSSIONThe protein-DNA complexes, transpososomes, form the machinery by which a mobile element finds and ultimately selects its destination target site. While regional target selection can be modulated by contacts between transpososomes and accessory factors bound to, or included within, the DNA structure, the final DNA-protein interactions between the target site and the transpososome nevertheless govern fundamental sequence-level selection. To circumvent complications associated with multiple level selection schemes, we studied Mu target site preference with a minimal component in vitro system that only includes features for basic level protein-DNA recognition. A quantitative assay was developed by which populations of transposition reaction products can be analyzed in a single reaction and the differential usage of phosphodiester bonds can be quantified directly from the intensity of the autoradiographic bands. No amplification step is needed to enhance signals and therefore artifactual biases in quantification are avoided. A similar assay has been used to analyze sequence-dependent bending parameters of DNA trinucleotides by DNaseI binding (56Brukner I. Sanchez R. Suck D. Pongor S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).Nucleotide and Dinucleotide Consensus Describe the Preferred Target SitesThe nucleotide consensus (C-Py-(G/C)-Pu-G) described here is generally in accordance with previously published in vivoand in vitro data (46Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except for additional statistically significant preferences at positions 1 and 5 in our data. Some preference for these two positions, based on in vivo data, has also been proposed by Kamp and Kahmann (43Kamp D. Kahman R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1980; 45: 329-336Crossref Google Scholar). The reasons for differences at these positions can be complex, including different reaction conditions in vivo compared with in vitro with additional protein factors (MuB, HU), the low number of insertions examined, and interpretation difficulties in using sequencing with termination chemistry. Previously, the consensus for the disfavored target sites has been either ignored, or deduced to be opposite to the sites that were inserted, picked for sequencing, and thus designated as preferred sites (57Davies C.J. Hutchison III, C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). From our data set we could actually analyze also the least preferred sites and compile a consensus that is based on the observations made.Because target site selection of phage Mu transposition is relatively flexible, recognition may be based on DNA structure in addition to, or instead of, the actual sequence. Generally, purine-pyrimidine steps stack more stably than purine-purine or pyrimidine-pyrimidine steps. Pyrimidine-purine steps are the least stably stacked and are known to generate protein-induced kinks (58Lilley D.M.J. DNA-Protein: Structural Interactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar). Some dinucleotides are especially flexible (CA/TG, TA), bistable (GG/CC, CG, AG/CT, TA) or rigid (AA/TT, AT, GA/TC) (58Lilley D.M.J. DNA-Protein: Structural Interactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar). Flexible or bistable dinucleotides are preferred at central positions, and either bistable or rigid base steps are favored at the edges of the 5-bp target site core (Fig. 5,AâC).Apparent Symmetry in Target Site SelectionThe nucleotide consensus of preferred target sites (Fig. 4, A andB) demonstrates clear 2-fold inverted symmetry (palindromy). Symmetry is also detected at the dinucleotide level (Fig. 5,A and B), where it reflects the Watson-Crick base pairing rules of the double-stranded DNA (AC/GT, AT, GC, AG/CT, GG/CC, AA/TT, GA/TC, TA, CA/TG, CG). Biochemical data on Mu transposition complexes indicate that the active sites of two of the four MuA protomers promote cleavage and strand transfer reactions at the two ends of the element (59Williams T.L. Jackson E.L. Caritte A. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2725-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The apparent symmetry arises from this functional 2-fold symmetry of the transposition reaction: MuA monomers and the right-end donor fragments are functionally symmetrical in our assay. Because the transposition complex is most probably symmetrical also relative to target DNA, recognition is possible in both orientations without affecting specific contacts. Therefore, it is impossible to deduce the orientation in which each sequence should be aligned and the consensus inevitably appears somewhat palindromic, even if individual targets are asymmetric. Within the 10% of the most preferred pentamers (n = 77), palindromy is not more prevalent than within a random set (data not shown). Taken together, the above reasoning suggests caution in the interpretation of the consensus sequence data in general. A consensus does not represent the best individual target site, but an average. Apparent palindromy or symmetry has been noticed in several earlier studies on target site selection of transposition (Tn10, Ref. 21Bender J. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7996-8000Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; Tn3, Ref. 57Davies C.J. Hutchison III, C.A.

Analysis of â¼80% of all possible pentamers was adequate for the statistical prediction of expected preference of pentamers (Fig. 6A). Based on dinucleotide data, new target molecules can be designed for various purposes, e.g. to contain only one major target site (Fig.6B). This kind of target is essential for protein-DNA cross-linking experiments to further probe the contacts between the transpososome and target site. Predicting potential insertion sites is also valuable for experiments where Mu transposition is utilized as a tool for sequencing or generating insertion mutant pools. It may also be feasible to make computational predictions that would take into account structural preferences in addition to pentamer sequence.The Effect of Surrounding SequencesThe pentamer sequence explained 62% of the observed variances, and the flanking sequences contributed significantly to the attractiveness of target pentamers. If the flanking sequences contribute, either there must be protein contacts with a wider area around the duplicated pentamer, or the sequence context affects the conformation of the target pentamer (e.g. widening or tightening B-DNA grooves). But how large is this effective area? Although this question can ultimately be answered by protein-DNA cross-linking experiments or with structural information obtained from target-capture complexes, some leads can be found in our data. The first lead was seen when the structural parameters were analyzed (Fig. 7A) and symmetrical patterns were seen extending well beyond the pentamer target site, some 9â10 nucleotides to the flanking areas. The second parallel clue comes from an experiment in which we examined how close to the DNA edge Mu transposes. We found that when a preferred pentamer is positioned 10-bp from the DNA end, it can be used as an effective target (data not shown), whereas the same pentamer positioned 5-bp from the end remains without insertions. Taken together, these results suggest that the Mu transpososome probably makes contacts with (or is influenced by) a target covering a region up to 23â25 bp. A broad zone of contacts (â¼24-bp) has been detected with contact-probing experiments between the transpososome and target DNA in the target-capture complex of Tn10 (29Pribil P.A. Haniford D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For IS903 a preferred target has been found to consist of a 21-bp palindromic sequence pattern, with preferred 5-bp sequences in the flanks around a 9-bp target duplication area (60Hu W-Y. Thompson W. Lawrence C.E. Derbyshire K.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, a broad zone of contacts may be a more general feature in transpososome-target recognition.What Kinds of Protein-DNA Contacts Could Be Made?Protein-DNA contacts can be generated through direct readout of specific bases or indirect readout through DNA backbone contacts with phosphate groups and/or sugar residues. Clear base preferences were noted in the 5-bp target core, while outside this target core limited preference was only seen in position 3 (data not shown). Symmetrical alterations in the GC preference were noted in the target area extending to flanks on either side of the pentamer (Fig. 7, upper panel). Because no clear sequence preference was observed in the surrounding sequences, contacts conceivably could be made through indirect readout. Sequence-related structural parameters spatially position the hydrogen bonding donor and acceptor sites and the phosphate backbone in a way that can be recognized with sufficient specificity. Pyrimidine-purine dimers are especially easy to deform in protein-DNA complexes and they act as flexible hinges, fitting the DNA onto the protein surface (52Olson W.K. Gorin A.A. Lu X-J. Hock L.M. Zhurkin V.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). In our analysis three peaks are observed for the protein-induced deformability. The periodicity of these peaks (9â10 nt) is close to the B-DNA helical pitch (10.5 bp) and thus can be indicative of anisotropic bending.Target recognition can be defined as fitting the target DNA to the protein active site via optimization of contacts made. This can be an additive process, as suggested for IHF binding by Rice et al. (61Rice P.A. Yang S-W. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and for Tn10 transposase target recognition by Pribil and Haniford (29Pribil P.A. Haniford D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transpososome binding to the consensus base pairs may facilitate a kink formation, which in turn would permit additional contacts with flanking DNA. In Mu target site recognition, the three protein-induced deformability areas may act as hinges (as suggested above) in a similar additive, sequential process. If the duplicated pentamer is surrounded by a poor sequence, i.e. unable to form suitable hinges, then potential contacts to the flanks are partly omitted and the transpososome is more prone to dissociate and locate another target site.A Combination of Regional and Sequence-level Target Site SelectionProtein-protein interactions were suggested to explain results of DNase I footprinting experiments, where regionally preferred sites were observed clustered next to, but not within, the MuB footprint area (46Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One possibility to explain these results was that MuB binds some regions of target DNA preferentially, delivers transpososomes to the region, activates the complex for strand transfer, and allows the complex to diffuse along target DNA before strand transfer (46Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MuA can then select the exact sequence-level target site, which explains the similar consensus sequence results obtained from experiments either with or without MuB (Ref. 46Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar; this study). Transposons are mobile genetic elements that are able to translocate from site to site within and between the genomes of their host organisms by a special form of DNA recombination called DNA transposition (1Mizuuchi K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1011-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 2Mizuuchi K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These ubiquitous residents of the genomes of all organisms generate insertional mutations and mediate various types of other genome rearrangements, thereby creating an important source of genetic variation (3Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989Google Scholar, 4Sherrat D.J. Mobile Genetic Elements. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar, 5Saedler H. Gierl A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 204Google Scholar). DNA transposition also has a role in the life cycles of certain bacteriophages, such as Mu (6Chaconas G. Lavoie B.D. Watson M.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, retroviruses and certain retrotransposons integrate into the host chromosome using a chemically similar reaction (7Craig N.L.

Transposition chemistry is also utilized for V(D)J recombination, suggesting an ancestral transpositional origin for this important DNA rearrangement reaction (9Hiom K. Melek M. Gellert M.

Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 187: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The unique immunochemical properties of this antigen correlate with its solution conformation and show a sharp contrast with the paradigm first reported by Kabat (6Kabat E.A. Fed. Proc. 1962; 21: 694-701Google Scholar, 7Kabat E.A. J. Immunol. 1966; 97: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar) some 40 years ago that applies to the majority of oligosaccharide-antibody interactions. C. albicans, the most common etiologic agent in candidiasis (8Casadevall A. Cassone A. Bistoni F. Cutler J.E. Magliani W. Murphy J.W. Polonelli L. Romani L. Med. Mycol. 1998; 36: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar), commonly affects immunocompromised patients and those undergoing long term antibiotic treatment (9Beck-SagueÌ C.M. Jarvis W.R. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 1247-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). The number of cases of systemic candidiasis has become a major medical problem in hospitals, whereC. albicans is now responsible for up to 25% of nosocomial infections (9Beck-SagueÌ C.M. Jarvis W.R. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 1247-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Treatment of these infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to increased drug resistance against known antifungal compounds (10Odds F.C. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 1996; 6: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Humoral and cell-mediated immunity may both play a major role in host defenses against C. albicans. Whereas most patients with serious mucosal infections have defects in their cellular immunity (11Levitz S.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), patients with deep tissue invasion seem to lack antibodies against the (1â2)-Î²-mannan oligomer found in the yeast cell wall (12Jouault T. Delaunoy C. Sendid B. Ajana F. Poulain D. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1997; 4: 328-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies raised against C. albicans cell wall extracts in mice were protective against disseminated candidiasis and vaginal candidiasis (1Han Y. Cutler J.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2714-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Han Y. Cutler J.E. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Han Y. Riesselman M.H. Cutler J.E.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 1550-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Further studies on these protective monoclonal antibodies indicated the active antigen to be a (1â2)-Î²-mannan polymer that is present as a component of the cell wall phosphomannan (14Han Y. Kanbe T. Cherniak R. Cutler J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and separately as a phospholipomannan (15Trinel P.-A. Plancke Y. Gerold P. Jouault T. Delplace F. Shwarz R.T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30520-30526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In both forms the (1â2)-Î²-mannan antigen is relatively small consisting of between 2 and 14 residues (16Trinel P.A. Lepage G. Joulault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The immunochemistry and solution properties of this antigen are of great interest because (1â2)-Î²-mannan oligomers have potential as the key epitope of conjugate vaccines (17Han Y. Melinda A. Cutler J.E. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Computational studies predicted that homopolysaccharides with this linkage pattern would be of rare occurrence and should exhibit a crumpled conformation to alleviate steric contacts between remote residues (18Rees D.A. Scott W.E. J. Chem. Soc. 1971; : 469-479Google Scholar). To investigate their solution structure and immunochemical properties, a series of short oligomers ranging from di- to hexasaccharides have been synthesized as glycosides and glycoconjugates (Fig. 1) (19Nitz M. Bundle D.R. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 8411-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Nitz M. Bundle D.R. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2939-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here the simple glycosides are used to develop a conformational model of the oligosaccharides and to probe the immunochemistry of Î²-mannan-specific monoclonal antibodies that protect mice against C. albicans. Oligosaccharides 1â6 (Fig. 1) and their corresponding conjugates with bovine serum albumin were synthesized as reported elsewhere (19Nitz M. Bundle D.R. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 8411-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Nitz M. Bundle D.R. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2939-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

Immun. 1993; 61: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained by 2-mercaptoethanol extraction of whole cells without subsequent affinity fractionation was dissolved in PBS (10 Î¼g/ml), and the solution was used to coat 96-well ELISA plates (100 Î¼l, 18 h at 4 Â°C). The plate was washed five times with PBST (PBS containing Tween 20, 0.05% v/v) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature (2% bovine serum albumin/PBS, 100 Î¼l). The monoclonal antibodies were mixed with inhibitor dissolved in PBST at concentrations between 0.1 Î¼m and 1 mm, and the resulting solutions were added to the coated microtiter plate in triplicate and incubated at room temperature for 18 h. The plate was washed with PBST (5 times), and goat anti-mouse (IgG or IgM) antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:2000, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) in PBST (100 Î¼l) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed with PBST (5 times); 3,3â²,5,5â²-tetramethylbenzidine (100 Î¼l, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was added, and after 2 min the color reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m phosphoric acid (100 Î¼l). Absorbance was read at 450 nm, and percent inhibition was calculated relative to wells containing antibody without inhibitor. Experiments were carried out on Varian Inova 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers using indirect detection, 5-mm triple resonance, z-gradient probes. Experimental conditions were kept as similar as possible between the two spectrometers, except for inherent field-related differences, and are described here for the 800-MHz data. The sample temperature was 25 Â°C for compounds1â3 and 30 Â°C for compounds 4 and5. The higher temperature moved the HOD peak upfield from the anomeric signals. For data acquisition and processing VNMR 6.1B software was used. Proton chemical shifts were measured relative to external 0.1% acetone at 2.225 ppm. GCOSY and GTOCSY experiments were record as described earlier (23Hurd R.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 422-428Google Scholar, 24Otter A. Hindsgaul O. Bundle D.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 275: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the latter with a mixing time of 130 ms at a spin-lock field strength of 6.6 kHz. One scan for each of the 512 t1 incrementations was recorded with a sweep width of 3700 Hz (4.6 ppm), digitized over 4300 data points. Transmitter-based solvent presaturation was used during a 1.5-s relaxation delay, and the acquisition time was 0.6 s. Acquisition parameters for T-ROESY experiments (25Hwang T.-L. Shanka A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3157-3159Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar) were essentially the same as the ones described for the GTOCSY, except that 24 transients were recorded with a total relaxation time of 2.1 s and a mixing time of 400 ms at a spin-lock field of 4.2 kHz. The first two data points in F2 were back-predicted by linear prediction, and no further base-line corrections were applied (26Babcook D.M. Sahasrabudhe P.V. Gmeiner W.H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1996; 34: 851-857Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Correlations of interest were checked carefully for undesired TOCSY contributions and integrated on both sides of the diagonal. To obtain a suitable internal reference, the H1âH5 NOEs of each mannopyranose ring were integrated on each side of the diagonal and averaged, and the resulting value was set to 2.39 â« based on the distance found in relevant crystal structures (27Jeffrey G.A. McMullan R.K. Takagi S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1977; 33: 728-737Crossref Google Scholar). Unknown inter-proton distances were then calculated based on the usual râ6 NOE-distance relationship. Some overlapping volumes could only be determined based on the known relative intensities of multiplets that were partially overlapped (an example is shown in Fig.2D). Computer models were developed using the Insight II molecular modeling package (version 2.9.5 from Molecular Simulations Inc.) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo II computer. All energy calculations were carried out in vacuo with a dielectric constant of 80.0 using the AMBER-plus force field with exo-anomeric potentials (28Homans S.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9110-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To locate a consensus minimum energy conformation, an unrestrained simulated annealing protocol was used (29Rutherford T.J. Spackman D.G. Simpson P.J. Homans S.W. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In brief, a high temperature-simulated annealing run generated 10 random energy structures. The ring geometries were enforced by scaling the ring torsional energy terms by 7. These structures were then separately cooled in 50 K steps, and at each step a 1-ps molecular dynamics was performed from 500 to 300 K and then to 10 K in 10 K per 1-ps steps and finally to 5 K. Each annealed structure was then minimized using a steepest descent algorithm. The lowest energy structure was used for a 5-ns molecular dynamics run at 300 K. Theoretical time-averaged 1Hâ1H (<râ6>) distances were then calculated using MDPROCESS software. 2T. J. Rutherford, unpublished software. Tri- to pentasaccharides 2â4 and the thio-linked tetrasaccharide 6 were modeled as outlined above. Details for modeling the pentasaccharide 4 are provided below, whereas further details related to the other structures 1â3and 6 are available in the Supplemental Material. Unambiguous 1H and13C chemical shifts for oligosaccharides 1â6were established by a combination of GCOSY, GTOCSY, and HMQC experiments. The most remarkable observation considering the homo-polymeric nature of oligosaccharides 1â5 was the discrete signal dispersion in their 1H NMR spectra (Fig.2A). The excellent dispersion of 1H signals permits the spin system of each hexose residue of the homo-oligomers to be assigned (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the resonances of protons H-1 to H-4 for each pyranose ring showed excellent dispersion (Table I), the H-5 and H-6 resonances exhibited severe overlap (not shown).Table I1H NMR chemical shifts (in ppm) for oligosaccharide glycosides2â6.Oligosaccharide/hexose residue1-aResidues are labeled alphabetically from reducing terminus as defined in Fig. 3.H-1H-2H-3H-42 A4.724.233.673.48 B4.914.373.643.59 C4.954.153.613.573 A4.734.243.673.48 B4.894.403.683.50 C5.044.353.643.60 D4.944.163.623.574 A4.724.233.683.48 B4.894.343.673.49 C5.004.383.663.58 D5.034.383.633.51 E4.954.153.623.565 A4.774.243.683.48 B4.904.343.683.50 C5.024.403.673.51 D5.024.373.673.50 E5.064.403.653.59 F4.964.163.633.576 A4.734.243.673.47 B4.884.393.673.45 C5.173.803.913.25 D5.004.103.623.561-a Residues are labeled alphabetically from reducing terminus as defined in Fig. 3. Open table in a new tab A comparison of the NMR data of the synthetic structures with data for oligomers (30Shibata N. Hisamichi K. Kobayashi H. Suzuki S. Arch. Biochem.

Res. 1992; 236: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) isolated from the yeast cell wall by acid hydrolysis shows similar 1H and 13C chemical shifts (Supplemental Material Tables I and II). Hemiacetals present in the isolated oligomers cause chemical shift differences and considerable spectral complexity, because both Î± and Î² forms of the terminal residue exist and propagate chemical shift changes well beyond the terminal reducing hexose residue (30Shibata N. Hisamichi K. Kobayashi H. Suzuki S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Faille C. Wieruszeski J.-M. Michalski J.-C. Poulain D. Strecker G. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 236: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligomers by comparison are free of this complicating factor, because the terminal mannose residue is protected as a Î²-propyl glycoside. NOE correlations between protons on either side of each glycosidic linkage established the residue identity of the spin systems of adjacent pyranose rings and confirmed their sequence within each linear oligomer. NOEs were measured from T-ROESY spectra of the oligomers (1â5) and revealed numerous contacts between non-contiguous residues, as illustrated for pentasaccharide 4 (Fig.3). The presence of contacts betweenn + 2 and n + 3 residues is clearly evident in Fig. 2D. All of the anticipated strong NOEs due to inter-glycosidic contacts between H-1 and H-2 of adjacent residues were present and easily quantified due to the signal dispersion of the H-1 and H-2 protons. The T-ROESY cross-peak volumes were quantified for the tri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharide (2â4) and for the thio-linked tetrasaccharide 6. These data were used to derive conformationally averaged inter-proton distances (TableII). Hexasaccharide 5exhibited spectral overlap of several important resonances, and the ROE contacts from this structure were not quantified. Similar distances observed across the glycosidic linkages of the oligomers1â4 and 6 are indicative of compact, repetitive solution structures. The distances also suggest the inferred structure is not just a result of steric interactions between distant, non-contiguous residues but represent a population of low energy conformations with similar torsional angles about the glycosidic linkages. If steric interactions between non-contiguous residues were limiting the conformations of the oligomers, the shorter oligomers would be expected to have distances that differ from those of the higher molecular weight counterparts.Table IINOE contacts for (1â2)-Î²-mannopyranosyl tri-, tetra-, pentasaccharides 2â4, and thio-linked tetrasaccharide6NOE contacts observed2-aResidues are labeled alphabetically from reducing terminus as defined in Fig. 3.Inter-proton distances derived from NOEs in â«2346n + 1 contacts H1B-H2A2.32.32.22.2 H1C-H2B2.32.22.22.2 H1D-H2C2.3NQ2-bNQ, not quantified due to spectral overlap.2.4 H1E-H2D2.2n + 2 contacts H1C-H4A3.33.13.23.2 H2C-H4A2.92.82.72.7 H1D-H4B3.13.1NQ H2D-H4B2.72.72.9 H1E-H4C3.2 H2E-H4C2.8n + 3 contacts H1D-H4A4.13.7NQ H1E-H4B4.22-a Residues are labeled alphabetically from reducing terminus as defined in Fig. 3.2-b NQ, not quantified due to spectral overlap. Open table in a new tab Unrestrained molecular dynamics were carried out for oligomers 2â4 and for the thio-analogue6, and the resulting model for the pentasaccharide4 is discussed below (data for the other oligomers are available in the Supplemental Material, Table III and Figs. 1â4). Comparison of the 10 structures of the pentasaccharide obtained from the simulated annealing protocol showed a single family of low energy conformations (Fig. 4A). A static model of the pentasaccharide in one of these conformations shows the helical nature of this polysaccharide (Fig. 4B). The three-dimensional repeating unit approximates three mannose residues. This is illustrated by a CPK model of a tricolor repeat that displays the residue repeating nature of the helix type structure (Fig.4C). Theoretical inter-proton distances were calculated from the 5-ns molecular dynamics run performed at 300 K. The data compared well with distances determined from experimental NOEs (Table III) (29Rutherford T.J. Spackman D.G. Simpson P.J. Homans S.W. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). During the dynamics run, the oligosaccharide stayed within the range of glycosidic torsional angles represented by the family of conformations generated by simulated annealing.Table IIIComparison of theoretical and experimental inter-proton distances for pentasaccharide 4NOE contactsaResidues are labeled alphabetically from reducing terminus as defined in Fig. 3.Pentasaccharide distancesObservedCalculatedDifferenceâ«Contacts across glycosidic linkage H1B-H2A2.22.40.2 H1C-H2B2.22.40.2 H1D-H2CNQbNQ, not quantified due to spectral overlap.2.4 H1E-H2D2.32.50.2Contacts separated by one residue ( n + 2) H1C-H4A3.22.90.3 H2C-H4A2.72.70.0 H1D-H4B3.12.90.2 H2D-H4B2.72.80.1 H1E-H4C3.12.80.3 H2E-H4C2.83.10.3Contacts separated by two residues ( n + 3) H1D-H4A3.73.40.3 H1E-H4B4.23.70.5a Residues are labeled alphabetically from reducing terminus as defined in Fig. 3.b NQ, not quantified due to spectral overlap. Open table in a new tab A comparison of the conformations and molecular dynamics of the tri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharides shows similar low energy conformations for each of the oligosaccharides 2â4. The thio-linked oligosaccharide 6 showed two minimum energy structures about the terminal thioglycosidic linkage. Two conformations are explored at Ï angles centered about the two gauche conformations 60Â° and â60Â°. The first of these would be favored by theexo-anomeric effect, but the force field was not parameterized for the magnitude of this effect in the case of sulfur.

The inhibitory power of the propyl 1-thio-Î²-d-mannopyranosyl-Î²-d-mannopyranotrioside6 fell between that of the tri- and tetrasaccharide (TableIV). The same panel of oligomannosides 1â6 with IgG (C3.1) antibody showed a trend in affinities similar to those observed with mAb B6.1. Again di- and trisaccharides had the highest affinities but were 5- and 2-fold higher than for B6.1 (Table IV). The other (1â2)-Î²-oligomannosides had similar affinities (Fig. 5). The chemical synthesis (19Nitz M. Bundle D.R. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 8411-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Nitz M. Bundle D.R. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2939-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) of oligomers of the (1â2)-Î²-mannan has provided a series of compounds locked in the anomeric configuration of the native antigen, thereby facilitating a thorough analysis of the solution structure and immunochemical properties of this important C. albicans antigen. The excellent signal dispersion observed for the proton resonances of the (1â2)-Î²-mannopyranan oligomers 1â5 suggests they are conformationally distinct, in contrast to other homo-oligomers such as (1â2)-Î±-mannopyranotetrose (38Ogawa T. Yamamoto H. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 104: 271-283Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or maltoheptose ((1â4)-Î±-glucopyranoheptose) (39Sugiyama H. Toyohiko N. Horii M. Motohashi K. Sakai J. Usui T. Hisamichi K. Ishiyama J. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 325: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), where the conformationally sensitive H-1 resonances have similar chemical shifts. Most homopolysaccharides exhibit this degeneracy in chemical shift (40Caroff M. Bundle D.R. Perry M.B. Cherwonogrodzky J.W. Duncan J.R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 384-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kihlberg J. Bundle D.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 216: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), because internal residues sample virtually identical chemical environments. The distinct 1H chemical shifts observed for the H-1 and H-2 resonances of each mannose residue of tetrasaccharide3 suggest that oligomeric (1â2)-Î²-mannopyranans are conformationally distinct in contrast to many homo-oligomers. Similar exceptions occur for both the Î±- and Î²-1,2-linked oligomers of glucose (42Ogawa T. Takanashi Y. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 123: C16-C18Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 43Pozsgay V. Robbins J.B. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 277: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These two examples and the (1â2)-Î²-mannopyranan were identified by modeling studies as belonging to a class of homopolymers that would be expected to form relatively stiff and crumpled conformations (18Rees D.A. Scott W.E. J. Chem. Soc. 1971; : 469-479Google Scholar). Chemical shift characteristics of oligomers isolated from C. albicans cell walls have been noted and tentatively interpreted in terms of a collapsed conformation (44Shibata N. Hisamichi K. Kikuchi T. Kobayashi H. Okawa Y. Suzuki S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5680-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The use of NOEs to define solution conformations of oligosaccharides is most effective when there are numerous NOEs between hexose residues. This occurs for well defined oligosaccharide conformations that most often result from branching through vicinal substitution, as is the case with the blood group A and B antigens. In this and other such structures (45Otter A. Lemieux R.U. Ball R.G. Venot A.P. Hindsgaul O. Bundle D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 46Lemieux R.U.

Lindberg A.A. Svenson S.B. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 130: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), NOE contacts between non-contiguous residues (for example n and n + 2) often occur spanning the branched pyranose ring. A linear homopolysaccharide can achieve the equivalent of vicinal substitution only if the hydroxyl group adjacent to the anomeric center is the site for chain extension. For aldohexoses this occurs for 1,2-linkages. However, many 1,2-linked homo-oligomers such as those of the Brucella abortus A antigen yield few if any NOE contacts between non-contiguous residues (48Peters T. Brisson J.-R. Bundle D.R. Can. J. Chem. 1990; 68: 979-988Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The observation of multiple NOE contacts between non-contiguous residues in the (1â2)-Î²-mannopyranans studied here is exceptional in oligosaccharide conformational analysis. The presence of NOE interactions between residues residues A and D (n ton + 3 contacts) is to our knowledge unprecedented and indicative of a compact structure. Unrestrained molecular dynamics of the mannopyranans generated a discrete model of these unique oligosaccharides, which agreed well with the NOE measurements. A comparison of the conformational space sampled by the oligosaccharides indicates that the tri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharides explore very similar torsional angles across all their linkages. The family of conformations sampled is consistent with a model that imparts helical character to this glycan chain (Fig. 4). The repeating unit is approximately 3 residues long, but due to the inherent flexibility about glycosidic torsional angles, the overlap of residues n and n + 3 is only approximate (Supplemental Material Fig. 5). In this family of conformations, hydroxyls are oriented into solution, and a hydrophobic core is made up of the Î±-faces of the mannose rings. It is of interest to note that after this work was completed a different chemical synthesis of the (1â2)-Î²-mannopyranan oligosaccharides was reported, together with a crystal structure of a tetrasaccharide with attached organic protecting groups (49Crich D.

Pax proteins are required for pattern formation and cell differentiation in a broad spectrum of developing tissues. Consistent with its expression in the intermediate mesoderm, the optic cup and stalk, and the otic vesicle,Pax2, a member of the Pax2/5/8 subfamily, is essential for the development of the renal epithelia, the optic cup, and the inner ear. In addition to a DNA binding domain, the Pax2 protein contains a carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain rich in serine, threonine, and tyrosine. In this report, we demonstrate that the Pax2 transactivation domain is phosphorylated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not the ERK1/2 or p38 MAP kinases and that phosphorylation is coincident with increased transactivation of a Pax2-dependent reporter gene.

In vertebrates, Pax genes can be subdivided into classes based on similar features and embryonic expression patterns (1Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Google Scholar). The Pax2/5/8 subfamily is characterized by an amino-terminal-paired domain, a conserved octapeptide sequence with similarity to the engrailed homology domain (EH-1), and a partial-paired type homeobox. Pax2/5/8 proteins are transcription regulators that bind DNA via the amino-terminal-paired domain, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region is required for transactivation of target genes (2Dorfler P. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1971-1982Google Scholar, 3Lechner M.S. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21088-21093Google Scholar). In mouse and man, the Pax2 gene is essential for the development of the kidneys (4Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 4057-4065Google Scholar), optic cup, and inner ear (5Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Gruss P. Development. 1996; 122: 3381-3391Google Scholar).Pax2 encodes at least two alternatively spliced messages that produce proteins of 392 and 415 amino acids, differing only by a 23 amino acid insertion (6Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1992; 89: 1179-1183Google Scholar). Genes known to be up-regulated by Pax2 include WT1 (7Dehbi M. Ghahremani M. Lechner M. Dressler G. Pelletier J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 447-453Google Scholar) and gdnf (8Brophy P.D. Ostrom L. Lang K.M. Dressler G.R.

Development. 1996; 122: 627-635Google Scholar) in the developing hindbrain. In transfected cells, transcription activation requires the Pax2 carboxyl-terminal domain that is rich in serine and threonine residues, which may be potential sites for phosphorylation. In the zebrafish Pax6 protein, the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain is phosphorylated at multiple serine residues by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)1 p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 to increase the transactivation potential (10Mikkola I. Bruun J.A. Bjorkoy G. Holm T. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15115-15126Google Scholar). Of the Pax2/5/8 subfamily, only Pax8 has been studied with respect to phosphorylation, though it is not clear which kinases are involved (11Poleev A. Okladnova O. Musti A.M. Schneider S. Royer-Pokora B. Plachov D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 860-869Google Scholar). MAP kinase cascades are involved in transmitting signals generated at the cell surface into the cytosol and nucleus and consist of three sequentially acting enzymes: a MAP kinase, an upstream MAP kinase kinase (MEK), and a MEK kinase (MEKK) (12Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Google Scholar, 13Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK), or the p38MAP kinases, can translocate to the nucleus and subsequentely phosphorylate a variety of transcription factors. MEKK1 phosphorylates MKK4/MKK7 to activate JNK but can also activate ERK and p38 MAPK in transfected cells. This report addresses the phosphorylation state of the Pax2 protein and its ability to activate transcription. We show that the carboxyl-terminal activation domain is phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues and that Pax2 phosphorylation is coincident with the enhanced ability to transactivate a reporter gene. Pax2 is a substrate for the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but, unlike Pax6, is not phosphorylated by ERK or p38 MAPK. Activation of JNK by either the upstream kinases MEKK1 or DLK or by expression of Wnt signaling proteins increases Pax2 phosphorylation and enhances the Pax2 transactivation potential. The data point to an important role for JNK in modifying the Pax2 transactivation domain and stimulating Pax2-dependent gene expression. The CMV-Pax-2bHA and carboxyl-terminal deletions and the PRS4-CAT reported plasmid, containing five tandem copies of the pax2 binding site PRS4 cloned upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, were as described (3Lechner M.S. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21088-21093Google Scholar). The CMV-MEKK1 wild-type, CMV-MEKK1 K432M, HA-DLK, Myc-Erk, FLAG-JNK, Myc-p38 MAPK, were provided by L. Holzman. The Myc-JIP1 was a gift of B. Margolis. The Wnt4 (gift of A. McMahon), Wnt11, and Wnt7a (IMAGE Consortium) coding sequences were cloned into CMV-CB6 and sequenced for verification. The Pax2-GST fusion protein contained amino acids 197â415 and was purified by affinity to glutathione-agarose. GST-Elk (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 9184S) and GST-ATF-2 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 9224S) were obtained commercially. GST-c-Jun (1) was as described (14Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3459Google Scholar). Constitutively active, recombinant JNK was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The antibodies used in this paper were: Pax-2 (6Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S.

Subconfluent cells were transfected using 2â3 Î¼g of plasmid DNA and 6 Î¼l of FuGene 6 as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested 48-h post-transfection. Western blots were performed with equal amounts of protein obtained by lysis of transiently transfected cells in PK lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, cat no. 1836170). The lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies indicated in the legends. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect antigen-antibody complexes by ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were lysed in PK lysis buffer after 40 h of transient transfection. After incubation with antibodies against the epitope of the protein, the immunocomplex was adsorbed to protein-G-Sepharose and washed with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 12.5 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 0.5 mm NaF). The complexes were incubated for 30 min at 30 Â°C in 50 Î¼l of kinase buffer containing 20 Î¼m ATP, 5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), 2 Î¼g of GST-Pax2-(197â415), and 2 Î¼g of either GST-Elk-1 (ERK assay, Cell Signaling), GST-c-Jun (JNK assay) or GST-ATF-2 (p38 MAPK assay, Cell Signaling). The reactions were terminated by the addition of 12 Î¼l of 6Ã SDS loading buffer, 10 mm EGTA and were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and autoradiography. The amount of kinase that was immunoprecipitated was assessed by re-immunoblotting of the nitrocellulose. For thein vitro kinase assay, 50 milliunits of recombinant JNK were used to phosphorylate equal amounts (2 Î¼g) of GST-Pax2 or GST-c-Jun in kinase buffer under the same conditions as above or in the presence of excess cold ATP for Western blotting. 293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids as indicated in the legends. The cells were cultured in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h after 40 h of transient transfection, and then labeled with 250 Î¼Ci of [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysates were prepared using lysis buffer and then incubated with anti-HA antibodies at 4 Â°C for 2 h. The immunocomplexes were adsorbed to protein G-Sepharose and were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose and autoradiography. The amount of Pax2 that was immunoprecipitated was assessed by re-immunoblotting of the nitrocellulose. For amino acid analysis, immunoprecipitated Pax2 was blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, excised, soaked in methanol, and subsequently hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 2 h at 110 Â°C. Samples were dried, washed repeatedly with water, and spotted onto thin layer chromatography cellulose plates with fluorescent markers for Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P). The plates were electrophoresed for 1 h at 1000 V, air-dried, sprayed with acetone to visualize markers, and exposed to film. 293 cells were transfected with the expression plasmids as indicated in the legends. After 40 h, lysates were prepared in IP buffer (20 mmTris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were incubated with anti-Myc M5 monoclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4 Â°C. Antibodies were captured with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h and washed three times with IP-wash (same as IP buffer except 0.1% Triton X-100). Proteins were eluted from protein G-Sepharose by boiling in 2Ã SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For 5 Ã 105 of 293 cells, 0.5 Î¼g of CAT reporter plasmid was cotransfected with various doses of effector plasmid and 0.25 Î¼g of p-CH110, a Î²-galactosidase reporter plasmid used to monitor transfection efficiency. 40 h after transfection, cells were harvested and extracts were prepared and normalized for transfection efficiency. CAT analysis was performed essentially as described (15Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar). Percent acetylation was determined by scintillation counting, and a value of 1.0 was arbitrarily assigned to control parental plasmids. Each experiment was repeated three times and the results presented as averages Â± 1 S.D. from the mean. The activation domain of Pax2 contains multiple serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues that could serve as potential phosphorylation sites. To determine the status of Pax2 phosphorylation, cells were transfected with epitope-tagged Pax2 and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitation of Pax2 revealed one major form of phosphorylated protein (Fig.1A) and at least one minor form of slightly higher molecular mass. The phospho-Pax2 was excised from the gel and subjected to acid hydrolysis (Fig. 1B). Amino acids were separated by thin layer chromatography using phosphotyrosine, -serine, and -threonine markers and subjected to autoradiography. The immunoprecipitated Pax2 protein was phosphorylated at both serine and threonine residues, but not at tyrosine residues. Given the serine/threonine phosphorylation pattern and previously published reports on Pax6 phosphorylation, we examined the ability of the three major MAP kinases to phosphorylate Pax2 (Fig.2). Cells were transfected with epitope-tagged forms of ERK1, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases and the upstream activator MEKK1. The kinases were immunoprecipitated and used for immunocomplex kinase assays with GST-Pax2 and control substrates. Transfected MEKK1 can activate all three pathways in 293 cells, as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 in total cell lysates (Fig. 2A). However of the immunoprecipitated kinases, only JNK was able to efficiently phosphorylate GST-Pax2 (Fig.2B). The ability of activated JNK to phosphorylate Pax2 was confirmed using a recombinant, constitutively active form of JNK1 (Fig.2C). The in vitro kinase assay using recombinant JNK and the GST fusion proteins as substrates indicated that GST-Pax2 was as efficient a substrate as GST-c-Jun (Fig. 2C).In vitro phosphorylation of GST-Pax2 was also done with an excess of cold ATP, and the proteins were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2D). Using anti-Pax2 antibodies, a slower migrating form of the GST-Pax2 fusion protein is observed upon phosphorylation with recombinant JNK. Thus, the antibodies can distinguish between the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of the GST-Pax2 fusion protein.Figure 2Pax2 is a substrate for JNK. 293 cells were transfected with either 0.5 Î¼g of Myc-ERK, FLAG-JNK, or Myc-p38 MAPK expression plasmids, with (+) or without (â) 0.1 Î¼g of MEKK1.A, fraction of the total lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for activation of MAPK by antibodies against P-ERK1/2, P-JNK, and P-p38 as indicated. Equal loading of lysates was assessed by anti-Î²-tubulin. Note activation of all three transfected MAPK in the presence of MEKK1. B, the remaining lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies for in vitro kinase assays. The kinase reactions contained a mixture of two substrates. GST-Pax2 was included in all reactions, whereas the controls contained either GST-Elk, GST-c-Jun, and GST-ATF2 for the ERK, JNK, and p38 assays respectively. Note that GST-Pax2 is phosphorylated by JNK only. C, in vitro kinase reaction using recombinant active JNK and equal amounts of GST-Pax2 or GST-c-Jun as substrates. D, in vitro kinase reactions using GST alone or GST-Pax2 fusion proteins and recombinant JNK. The reactions were done with excess cold ATP and immunoblotted with anti-Pax2 antibodies. Note the slower migrating GST-Pax2 species in the JNK-treated reaction (arrow). Because the original antigen was a Pax2-GST fusion protein, anti-Pax2 antibodies also recognized GST. The blots shown are from different gels as GST and GST-Pax2 migrate at â¼26 kDa and 48 kDa, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The phosphorylation of Pax2 was also examined directly in cells co-transfected with MEKK1. To map the domain of phosphorylation more precisely, carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs of Pax2b were utilized (Fig. 3). Specific antibodies recognize the 392-amino acid Pax2b protein, which migrates at â¼48 kDa. Upon co-transfection with MEKK1, a slower migrating Pax2b species was observed at â¼50 kDa in SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3B). Preincubation of the lysates with either calf intestinal phosphatase or potato acid phosphatase eliminates this slower migrating Pax2b form, indicating that the shift in mobility is due to phosphorylation, similar to what was observed in the in vitro assay (Fig.2D). The MEKK1-dependent, phosphorylated Pax2b form is seen with carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs 1â373, 1â333, but not with deletions that contain only amino acids 1â279. Thus, Pax2b phosphorylation is primarily within the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain spanning amino acids 279â415. However, phosphorylation at additional sites between amino acids 1â279 that might not affect the mobility of Pax2 in SDS-PAGE gels cannot be ruled out. Strikingly, this region contains 19 serine and 11 threonine residues, making definitive assignment of the phosphorylation sites difficult. During kidney and neural development, Wnt signaling is known to mediate inductive interactions. While the canonical Wnt signaling pathway activates the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors by inhibition of the GSK3 kinase and translocation of Î²-catenin to the nucleus, alternate Wnt signaling pathways can work through the activation of JNK (16Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Google Scholar, 17Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Google Scholar). Particularly during the specification of planar cell polarity (18Mlodzik M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6873-6879Google Scholar), activation of JNK is known to require Disheveled and is uncoupled from the TCF/LEF pathway (19Boutros M. Mlodzik M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 27-37Google Scholar, 20Moriguchi T. Kawachi K. Kamakura S. Masuyama N. Yamanaka H. Matsumoto K. Kikuchi A. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30957-30962Google Scholar, 21Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Caruso A.M. McMahon A. Sussman D.J. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 129-134Google Scholar). Given the relationship between Wnt signaling, kidney development, and JNK activation, we examined the ability of Wnt proteins to activate JNK and stimulate Pax2 phosphorylation. Cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for Wnt4, Wnt11, and Wnt7a and examined for JNK activation and Pax2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Analysis of total lysates from 293 cells co-transfected with Wnt expression vectors and Pax2b indicated co-incident phosphorylation of Pax2, as evidenced by the slower migrating Pax2b isoform (Fig.4A). Activation of the Wnt pathway results in the slower migration of the disheveled protein, through phosphorylation at multiple sites, as reported previously (22Rothbacher U. Laurent M.N. Deardorff M.A. Klein P.S. Cho K.W. Fraser S.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1010-1022Google Scholar, 23Lee J.S. Ishimoto A. Yanagawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21464-21470Google Scholar). Cells transfected with each of the three Wnt constructs also exhibited co-incident activation of JNK (Fig. 4A). The phosphorylation of Pax2 was confirmed by in vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate (Fig. 4B). MEKK1 co-transfected cells showed high levels of phospho-Pax2, whereas Wnt11 co-transfected cells showed less phospho-Pax2 but significantly more than cells expressing Pax2 alone. The data indicate that activation of JNK by either Wnt proteins or MEKK1 results in increased phosphorylation of Pax2. Activation of the JNK pathway can also occur with via the mixed lineage kinases (MLK or DLK) in association with the scaffolding proteins of the JIP family (14Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3459Google Scholar, 24Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Google Scholar, 25Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Google Scholar). To determine whether Pax2 interacts directly with this JNK signaling module, cells were co-transfected with Pax2, JIP1, DLK, and JNK (Fig. 5). Expression of DLK alone slightly increased the amount of phospho-Pax2 present in total lysates. At low doses of DLK, Pax2 phosphorylation was further enhanced by co-expression with JIP1 or JNK. Immunoprecipitation of JIP1 also pulled down Pax2 and JNK, indicating that at least some Pax2 was associated with the JNK signaling module. Strikingly, Pax2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with JIP1 in the absence of DLK, but the amount of JIP1-associated Pax2 increased significantly upon activation of the JNK module with DLK. More phosphorylated Pax2 was observed by expression of DLK, together with exogenous JNK, and this resulted in even more JIP1-associated Pax2. In the absence of exogenous JIP1, co-transfection of DLK and JNK produced even more phosphorylated Pax2. At first this may seem counterintuitive, but transfection of exogenous JIP1 provides more scaffolding such that individual proteins may not all assemble on the same scaffold and thus effectively titrate out some of the activities (14Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3459Google Scholar). The data suggest that DLK-dependent phosphorylation of Pax2 by JNK is mediated by a direct association with the JNK signaling module, perhaps through interactions with JIP1. To assess the effects of Pax2 phosphorylation on the transactivation potential, we utilized a reporter plasmid containing five copies of the PRS4 Pax2b binding sequence upstream of a minimal promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Using a fixed amount of Pax2b plasmid (125 ng) and increasing amounts of MEKK1, Pax2-dependent reporter activation increased dramatically with as little as 50 ng of MEKK1 expression plasmid (Fig.6A). Pax2 transfection can stimulate the reporter plasmid activity by 8â10-fold. This increased to more than 50-fold by co-transfection of 200 ng of MEKK1 expression plasmid. In the absence of Pax2, MEKK1 had no effect on the expression of the reporter. Furthermore, a kinase-deficient MEKK1 construct showed only a slight increase at the highest doses. Pax2-dependent transactivation was also enhanced in the presence of Wnt expression plasmids (Fig. 6B). Expression of Wnt4, Wnt11, and Wnt7a all generated a 2â3-fold increase in Pax2-dependent activation of the reporter gene. Whereas Wnt gene expression alone had no effect on CAT activity in the absence of Pax2 (data not shown). As reported previously (3Lechner M.S. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21088-21093Google Scholar), deletion of the transactivation domain reduced Pax2-dependent activation (Fig. 6C). A carboxyl-terminal deletion of amino acids 373â415 still showed a robust response to MEKK1 although the basal level of Pax2-dependent activation was down about 2-fold. However, a carboxyl-terminal deletion of amino acids 333â415 exhibited a further reduction in basal activation and a loss of responsiveness to MEKK1. Western blotting indicated that there was some degree of Pax2-(1â333) phosphorylation in response to MEKK1 (Fig. 3B). However, it is unlikely that these remaining phosphorylation sites are necessary for the increased activation potential in response to MEKK1. These data suggest that the critical phosphorylated residues in Pax2 that mediate the MEKK1-induced transcriptional activation are located between amino acids 333 and 415. Similarly, activation of JNK via DLK and JIP increased the transactivation potential of Pax2 (Fig. 6D). DLK and Pax2 alone increased reporter activity only slightly. However, co-transfection of DLK with JIP1 increased the Pax2-dependent transactivation potential by 3â4-fold. Thus in all cases examined, the factors that increase JNK activity and result in increased amounts of Pax2 phosphorylation also significantly enhance the Pax2 dependent transactivation potential of the PRS4 reporter vector. In this report, we demonstrate that Pax2, a member of the Pax family of transcription regulators, is phosphorylated by JNK. Also known as SAPK, JNK phosphorylates a variety of nuclear transcription factors, including c-Jun, Elk1, and ATF2. In particular, phosphorylation of Ser-63 and Ser-73 of c-Jun results in increased activity of the AP-1 transcription factor, which consists of a c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer (13Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). Indeed, the sequence around Ser-63 of c-Jun (LLTSP) is very similar to a conserved serine at position 393 of the Pax2 protein (LLSSP). However, phosphorylation of Pax2 may occur at multiple sites. Deletion of the serine/threonine-rich, carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain significantly reduces phosphorylation such that a shift in Pax2b mobility, upon JNK activation, is no longer observed. The phosphorylated residues that mediate the JNK-dependent increase in transactivation reside between amino acids 333 and 415 of the activation domain. Within this region there are 11 serine and 7 threonine residues, of which 6 and 1 respectively are absolutely conserved within the Pax2/5/8 family. We have begun making point mutations of these conserved residues. However, preliminary data indicate that multiple serine substitution must be made before the MEKK1-dependent increase in transactivation is abrogated (data not shown). By definition, the transactivation domain is required for maximal activation potential of the Pax2 reporter gene, PRS4-CAT, as defined previously in the absence of exogenous JNK activators. A basal level of phospho-Pax2 is present that most probably accounts for the 8â10-fold transactivation potential observed without JNK activation. This basal levels accounts for the metabolically labeled phospho-Pax2 observed without JNK activation and the small amount of high molecular weight Pax2b form observed upon long exposures of Western blots. Basal levels of activated JNK and phospho-c-Jun are inevitably observed in proliferating cells stimulated with serum. Because there are presently no practical JNK inhibtors, we were unable to test whether JNK activation was absolutely required for Pax2-mediated transactivation. However, several lines of evidence indicate that JNK is the kinase responsible for Pax2 phosphorylation, which correlates with increased transactivation. Of the major MAP kinases, only JNK is able to phosphorylate Pax2 in the immunolinked kinase assay. Furthermore, recombinant constitutively active JNK phosphorylates Pax2 in vitro as efficiently as it phosphorylates c-Jun. Increased JNK activity leads to increased Pax2 phosphorylation and increased Pax2-dependent transactivation, regardless of whether JNK is activated by MEKK1, Wnt signaling, or DLK. Pax2 can associate with the JNK signaling module as demonstrated by the co-immunoprecipitation of Pax2 with JIP1. Strikingly, activation of the signaling module by the DLK results in increased JIP1-associated Pax2. A specific inhibitor of MEK1 (PD98059), which suppresses phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 MAPK, does not significantly reduce Pax2 phosphorylation nor does it reduce Pax2-dependent transactivation (data not shown). While JNK is likely to be the kinase that mediates phosphorylation of Pax2, the effect on Pax2 activity is less clear. It remains to be determined whether Pax2 phosphorylation by JNK is merely co-incident with enhanced activation, whether it is a prerequisite for further modification by other kinases, or whether there is indeed a causative link to enhanced Pax2 activation potential. In the developing kidney and central nervous system, Wnt signaling and Pax genes play critical roles in establishing patterns and specifying cell types. During kidney development, Pax2 is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme prior to induction by the ureteric bud epithelium (8Brophy P.D. Ostrom L. Lang K.M. Dressler G.R. Development. 2001; 128: 4747-4756Google Scholar). Upon induction, Pax2-expressing cells proliferate, aggregate around the tips of the ureteric bud, and undergo conversion to an epithelial phenotype (6Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1992; 89: 1179-1183Google Scholar, 26Ryan G. Steele-Perkins V. Morris J. Rauscher III., F.J. Dressler G.R. Development. 1995; 121: 867-875Google Scholar). This response to inductive signals is Pax2-dependent (4Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 4057-4065Google Scholar, 27Rothenpieler U.W. Dressler G.R. Development. 1993; 119: 711-720Google Scholar) and also requires Wnt4 signaling (28Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Google Scholar). That Wnt4 can activate JNK and stimulate Pax2-dependent gene activation suggests that phosphorylation of Pax2 is an essential component of the induction response. Thus, Pax2 may be an immediate downstream target for inductive signals that can translate these signals by initiating the epithelial-specific genetic program. Pax2 and the related genes Pax5 andPax8 are also active during neural development, particularly in the mid-brain/hindbrain junction of the central nervous system (29Pfeffer P.L. Bouchard M. Busslinger M. Development. 2000; 127: 1017-1028Google Scholar, 30Schwarz M. Alvarez-Bolado G. Dressler G. Urbanek P. Busslinger M. Gruss P. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 29-39Google Scholar, 31Bouchard M. Pfeffer P. Busslinger M. Development. 2000; 127: 3703-3713Google Scholar). Mice carrying targeted mutations for both JNK1 and JNK2 show regional defects in the developing hindbrain, including decreased apoptosis prior to neural tube closure in and around the Pax2/5/8 expression domain (32Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of Pax activity by JNK may also be required for the regulation of neuronal cell number through selective activation of apoptosis. In any event, more direct studies in normal and mutant mice are warranted to more precisely determine the phosphorylation state of Pax proteins during specific stages of development. We thank A.

Salmonella-containing vacuole natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 lipopolysaccharide phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate green fluorescent protein mannose 6-phosphate receptor Salmonella species cause systemic diseases including typhoid fever and gastroenteritis in humans and other animals (1Pang T. Bhutta Z.A. Finlay B.B. Altwegg M. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These bacteria are intracellular pathogens, capable of invading the host cells where they reside in spacious vacuoles. Five pathogenicity islands have been identified to encode the factors required forSalmonella invasion and replication. SPI-1 (forSalmonella pathogenicity island-1) encodes a complex bacterial type III secretion system, which mediates bacterial uptake (invasion) into host cells (2Collazo C.M. Zierler M.K. Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SPI-2 encodes a second type III secretion system that becomes active only after the bacteria reach the intracellular vacuole. SPI-2 generates factors required for intracellular survival and replication of Salmonella and is critical for virulence (3Ochman H. Soncini F.C. Solomon F. Groisman E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, three small pathogenicity islands, SPI-3, SPI-4, and SPI-5, encode additional effectors and themgtC operon, which allows Salmonella typhimuriumto survive in low Mg2+ conditions (7Blanc-Potard A.B. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5376-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 8Hong K.H. Miller V.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hardt W.D. Chen L.M.

Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infectious organisms are generally eliminated from the host, at least in part, by the innate immune system. Phagocytes ingest the microorganisms into a membrane-bound compartment or phagosome, which matures by sequential fusion with a series of endomembrane compartments (11Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The resulting changes in the composition and luminal pH confer to the phagosome its characteristic microbicidal properties. To survive intracellularly, Salmonella evades the hostile environment of the phagosome by subverting the maturation process. Instead of undergoing the customary fusion with the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, yielding a phagolysosome, Salmonella generates a unique compartment denominated the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV)1 that ultimately segregates itself from the endocytic pathway (12Garcia del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Survival of bacteria within the SCV has been attributed to the incomplete fusion of the latter with the pre-lysosomal and lysosomal compartments (12Garcia del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar,13Rathman M. Barker L.P. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is accompanied by delayed and/or reduced luminal acidification (14Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Swanson J.A. Loomis W.P. Miller S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Not all individuals are equally susceptible to Salmonellainfection. This is attributed in some instances to the expression of host gene products that confer natural resistance to the bacteria (15Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 16Vidal S.M. Tremblay M.L. Govoni G. Gauthier S. Sebastiani G. Malo D. Skamene E. Olivier M. Jothy S. Gros P. J. Exp.

One such resistance factor is natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1), an integral membrane protein expressed in lysosomal compartments of macrophages (18Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Searle S. Bright N.A. Roach T.I.A. Atkinson P.G.P. Barton C.H. Meloen R.H. Blackwell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby Nramp1 confers to the host resistance to infection is incompletely understood. Following phagocytosis, Nramp1 reaches the phagosome membrane (18Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), where it has been suggested to prevent the replication of bacteria by limiting the availability of luminal divalent cations (20Govoni G. Gros P. Inflamm. Res. 1998; 47: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Jabado N. Jankowski A. Dougaparsad S. Picard V. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1237-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether and how these putative alterations in divalent cation content modify the ability of the bacteria to evade phagosomal maturation and segregate into a characteristic SCV. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of Nramp1 alters the intracellular fate of Salmonella in cultured and in primary murine macrophages. Maturation of the SCV was monitored using markers of the compartments of the endocytic pathway and measuring intravacuolar pH by digital imaging. Our results suggest that macrophages expressing the Nramp1 protein counteract the ability of Salmonella to become secluded in a compartment that limits access of bactericidal agents. We propose thatNramp1 facilitates bacterial killing by altering the pattern of vacuolar fusion with endomembranes.

Resident peritoneal macrophages were obtained from 6â8-week-old wild-type (+/+) and knockout (â/â) mice by peritoneal lavage with 10 ml of sterile PBS, as described previously (21Jabado N. Jankowski A. Dougaparsad S. Picard V. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1237-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The harvested cell suspension contained â¼30% mature macrophages as determined by Wright staining. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended at 106/ml in medium RPMI 1640 containing 10% serum and 5 mmglutamine before plating on glass coverslips. Two hours later, nonadherent cells were removed by washing with fresh medium and macrophages were used 24 h later for Salmonellainvasion and immunofluorescence assays. Two Salmonella strains were used for invasion studies. The SL1344 strain was used for pH measurements, and the 14028s strain expressing the pFPV1, a modified pBR322 plasmid encoding the green fluorescent protein (23Valdivia R.H. Hromocky A.E. Monack D. Ramakrishnan L. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), for fluorescence detection assays. InvAâ cells, which lack InvA, an essential component of the Salmonella SPI-1 type III secretion apparatus needed for bacterial invasion, were used as noninvasive controls. All bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani liquid medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. To label SL1344 cells with FITC, 300 Î¼l of a bacterial suspension in exponential phase were sedimented, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 0.5 mg/ml FITC dissolved in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.8. This suspension was incubated at room temperature for 25 min in the dark, shaking. The bacteria were then washed in PBS and used immediately for invasion. To optimize invasion of RAW cells,Salmonella was grown as described by Francis et al. (24Francis C.L. Starnbach M.N. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3077-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani with overnight shaking in Luria-Bertani at 37 Â°C. Salmonellawere then subcultured at 1:25 for 3 h more at 37 Â°C to late log phase. After harvesting by centrifugation, the bacteria were washed with PBS, resuspended in Earle's buffered saline solution (1.4 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 160 mm NaCl, 5.5 mmglucose, 2 mm NaHCO3, 1 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.7) and added (multiplicity of infection 1â100) to RAW cells grown to near confluence on glass coverslips. Invasion was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 Â°C and the coverslips were then washed four times to eliminate uninternalized bacteria. After invasion by FITC-labeledSalmonella, RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells were transferred to buffer A (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C. The coverslip was placed in a Leiden chamber that was mounted on a Leica DMIRB inverted microscope equipped for digital ratio imaging (25Demaurex N. Romanek R. Rotstein O. Grinstein S. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook.2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 380-386Google Scholar). Bacteria within the cells were identified by epifluorescence and could often be seen by differential interference contrast microscopy to be located within large vacuoles, particularly at early times. Intravacuolar pH was estimated from the ratio of fluorescence using 490 nm and 440 nm excitation, as described (25Demaurex N. Romanek R. Rotstein O. Grinstein S. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook.2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 380-386Google Scholar). Calibration was performedin situ by incubating the cells with nigericin and monensin (each at 5 Î¼g/ml) in media of defined pH buffered in the 7.5 to 4.5 range. Immediately after invasion, cells infected with GFP-expressing Salmonella were incubated in RPMI buffer at 37 Â°C, to allow for SCV maturation. After 30â90 min, maturation was terminated by addition of ice-cold blocking buffer (1% albumin, 2% donkey serum in PBS). To detect extracellular bacteria, the cells were incubated in the cold with anti-SalmonellaLPS antibodies (1:200 dilution) for 15 min, washed and exposed to secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 350 (1:200) for an additional 15 min. After washing, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, then permeabilized and blocked overnight in 1% donkey serum, 2% albumin plus 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. To label late endosomes-lysosomes, cells were incubated with anti-LAMP1 (1:4) or anti-M6PR (1:800) in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 min. Monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies were used to localize the epitope-taggedNramp1 in transfected cells. In primary cells, Nramp1 was detected by incubation with the affinity-purified anti-Nramp1 antiserum (1:150) for 4 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1500). After mounting, the cells were visualized by conventional epifluorescence microscopy or by confocal microscopy to quantify the percentage of SVC expressing specific markers. Coincidence with organellar markers was determined for internalized bacteria (those not labeled with Alexa Fluor 350). One hundred internalized bacteria were counted for each condition. Two types of experiments were performed in cells labeled with a fluorescent fluid-phase marker. In one case, the lysosomes of RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells were preloaded by incubation with tetramethylrhodamine dextran (1 mg/ml) for 1 h, followed by a 0.5-h chase without the fluid phase tracer. The cells were then subjected to invasion by Salmonella. After 10 min, the cells were washed, incubated for 60 or 90 min at 37 Â°C and then cooled and treated as above to label extracellular bacteria. The cells were analyzed immediately by fluorescence microscopy to determine the percentage of dextran-positive SCV. In a second type of experiment, access to preformed SCV by endocytic material was also studied using fluid-phase markers. Cells were initially subjected to invasion by Salmonella and incubated for 90 min in RPMI buffer to allow maturation of the SCV. Next, the cells were pulsed with tetramethylrhodamine dextran (1 mg/ml) for 30 or 60 min. The cells were cooled and treated as above to label extracellular Salmonella and immediately analyzed to quantify the fraction of dextran-containing SCV. Two experimental systems were used to define the effect of Nramp1 on the maturation of the SCV: wild-type and Nramp1-transfected RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages isolated from 129sv mice expressing a wild-type allele at the Nramp1 locus (Nramp1G169/G169; Nramp1+/+), or from mice bearing a null mutation at the Nramp1 locus (Nramp1â/â), produced by homologous recombination as described previously (16Vidal S.M. Tremblay M.L. Govoni G. Gauthier S. Sebastiani G. Malo D. Skamene E. Olivier M. Jothy S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The expression of Nramp1 in these cells is illustrated in Fig. 1. Briefly, neither the wild-type RAW cells nor the macrophages from knockout mice have detectable levels of Nramp1, as anticipated. In contrast, Nramp1 was readily detectable in the wild-type peritoneal macrophages, and very similar levels were found to be expressed in the RAW cells stably transfected with Nramp1. To measure intravacuolar pH, Salmonella were labeled with FITC. Because of the covalent nature of the reaction, it was important to ensure that the invasive properties of the bacteria remained unaltered. Although high concentrations of FITC were found to depress the invasiveness ofSalmonella, we empirically found conditions that yielded sufficiently bright fluorescent signals (Fig.2D) with no discernible effect on invasion. This was determined microscopically, differentiating intracellular from adherent extracellular bacteria using anti-LPS antibodies before and after permeabilization of the RAW/Nramp1â macrophages, as described by others (26Coppolino M.G Kong C.

Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2, under the conditions used, FITC-labeled and unlabeled bacteria entered macrophages at comparable rates. That invasion, rather than phagocytosis, mediated the entry of the bacteria into macrophages is shown in Fig. 3. Although the invasive strain SL1344 gained access to the cell's interior, the noninvasive invAâ mutant remained extracellular and was removed almost entirely by our routine washing procedure.Figure 3Measurement of the pH of SCV in RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells.A, calibration of fluorescence ratio versus pH.

The fluorescence ratio was used to minimize the artifactual effects of photobleaching and of changes in the focal plain. As predicted, a sigmoidal relationship between fluorescence ratio and pH was obtained, with a midpoint in the 6.0â6.5 range. This is consistent with the reported pK of fluorescein derivatives and renders the probe suitable for measurements of pH in the acidic environment expected to prevail in the SCV (14Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Swanson J.A. Loomis W.P. Miller S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 28Rathman M. Sjaastad M. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2765-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When exposed for 10 min to FITC-labeled SL1344 Salmonella, RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells were invaded to a comparable extent (an average of 10 versus 11 bacteria/cell). The results of four determinations of intravacuolar pH in the two cell types are summarized in Fig. 3B. In both instances, the intravacuolar pH approached the extracellular pH shortly after invasion, but a gradual acidification developed over the next 60 min, reaching a pH between 6.0 and 6.3. Loss of the fluorescent dye by photobleaching and/or metabolic events occurring within the vacuole precluded accurate measurements of pH beyond 60 min. Importantly, within the period monitored, there was no significant difference in pH between the SCVs of RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained using two separate clones of Nramp1-transfected RAW cells. We concluded that Nramp1 does not alter the pattern of SCV acidification, at least during the first hour following invasion. In view of the similarity of the pH recorded in the SCVs of RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells, it was important to ascertain that the Nramp1 protein was in fact reaching the Salmonella vacuole. As reported previously (18Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we found an extensive co-localization of Nramp1 with LAMP1 (Fig. 4, Aand B), a marker or late endosomes and lysosomes (29Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Because LAMP1-containing compartments are well documented to merge with the SCV, we anticipated that Nramp1 would similarly reach the vacuole. This prediction was verified in Fig. 4 (C and D), where intracellular Salmonella can be seen to be encapsulated in Nramp1-expressing vacuoles. Between 60 and 90 min after invasion, up to 90% of intracellular Salmonella were found to colocalize with LAMP1 in RAW/Nramp1+ cells. Therefore, the similarity of the vacuolar pH in RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells cannot be attributed to the failure of Nramp1 to reach the SCV under the conditions used. The survival of intracellular pathogens, includingSalmonella, has been associated with their ability to avoid the microbicidal environment of lysosomes. The enhanced capacity of RAW/Nramp1+ cells to control infection could therefore result from alterations in the maturation pattern of the microbial vacuole. This notion was tested by comparing the rate and extent of acquisition of several organellar markers by SCVs in RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells. To facilitate detection of the bacteria, we used Salmonellathat stably express enhanced GFP. Fig. 5(AâD) shows that LAMP1 is readily detectable on the membrane lining the SCVs in both RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells. Extensive quantitative analysis (counting 100 internalized bacteria/experiment, four experiments of each type) indicated that virtually all the SCVs contained LAMP1 at both 60 and 90 min after infection (Fig. 5E). There were no obvious differences in the staining intensity of RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells. Because it is found both in late endosomes and in lysosomes (30Green S.A. Zimmer K.P. Griffiths G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Braun M. Waheed A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the precise source of the LAMP1 that reaches the SCVs is unclear. To more specifically analyze the ability of the vacuole to fuse with lysosomes, these organelles were selectively labeled by a pulse-chase protocol using the fluid phase marker tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Under the conditions used, the dextran colocalizes extensively, but not entirely, with the LAMP1 compartment (Fig. 6, A and B). As also shown in Fig. 6, the marker gained access to the SCVs after 60 min. Of note, fusion of SCVs with lysosomes was observed in both RAW/Nramp1â and RAW/Nramp1+ cells and the extent of fusion was only modestly higher in the RAW/Nramp1+ cells (89.5 Â± 0.5% and 89 Â± 4.5% of positive vacuoles at 60 and 90 min, respectively; n= 3 experiments, each with 100 bacteria counted) than in RAW/Nramp1â cells (79.5 Â± 0.5% and 78.6 Â± 5.8%) (Fig. 6D). Although small, the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The M6PR traffics between the trans-Golgi network and the pre-lysosomal compartment of the endocytic pathway, yet is not present in mature lysosomes (32Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 33Griffiths G. Matteoni R. Back R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 441-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rabinowitz S. Hortsmann H. Gordon S. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although LAMP1 is found in the SCVs, the M6PR was reported to be largely excluded from vacuoles containing liveSalmonella (12Garcia del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Rathman M. Barker L.P. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Steele-Mortimer O. Meresse S. Gorvel J.P. Toh B.H. Finlay B.B. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of Nramp1 on the distribution of M6PR. As reported for nonmyeloid cells, M6PR is rarely found in SCVs within cells devoid of Nramp1 (Fig.7, A and B). After 60 min, only 7% of the vacuoles contained M6PR and this number increased only marginally after 90 min, to 13% (Fig. 7E). Care was taken to count only intracellular bacteria and not those adherent to the cell exterior. The location of the bacteria was routinely ascertained using antibodies before and after permeabilization, as above. In contrast to Nramp1-deficient cells, a much larger fraction of SCVs were M6PR positive in Nramp1-expressing cells at both 60 and 90 min (Fig. 7, C and E). This is unlikely to result from clonal variation, because similar results were obtained using two independently isolated clones (c-Myc/Nramp1-transfected RAW264.7 clones 13 and 15; Ref. 22Govoni G. Cannone-Hergaux F. Pfeifer F. Marcus S.L. Mills S.D. Hackman D.J. Grinstein S. Malo D. Finlay B.B. Gros P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2225-2232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7E). These observations suggest that Nramp1 can modulate the processes that control SCV maturation. At least in HeLa cells, some time after formation, the SCVs appear to segregate themselves from the endocytic pathway of the host cell. Once generated, the SCV cannot be readily accessed by fluid-phase markers added subsequently, suggesting a limited interaction with endocytic structures formed de novo (12Garcia del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of Nramp1 on this segregation process.Salmonella were allowed to invade RAW/Nramp1âand RAW/Nramp1+ cells, and 90 min were allowed for maturation of the vacuole. At th"

To address this issue, we developed an in situ disulfide cross-linking strategy using the rat M3 muscarinic receptor, a prototypical Gq-coupled receptor, as a model system. It is known that a tyrosine residue (Tyr254) located at the C terminus of transmembrane domain (TM) V and several primarily hydrophobic amino acids present within the cytoplasmic portion of TM VI play key roles in determining the G protein coupling selectivity of the M3receptor subtype. To examine whether M3 receptor activation involves changes in the relative orientations of these functionally critical residues, pairs of cysteine residues were substituted into a modified version of the M3 receptor that contained a factor Xa cleavage site within the third intracellular loop and lacked most endogenous cysteine residues. All analyzed mutant receptors contained a Y254C point mutation and a second cysteine substitution within the segment Lys484âSer493 at the intracellular end of TM VI. Following their transient expression in COS-7 cells, mutant receptors present in their native membrane environment (in situ) were subjected to mild oxidizing conditions, either in the absence or in the presence of the muscarinic agonist, carbachol. The successful formation of disulfide cross-links was monitored by studying changes in the electrophoretic mobility of oxidized, factor Xa-treated receptors on SDS gels. The observed cross-linking patterns indicated that M3 receptor activation leads to structural changes that allow the cytoplasmic ends of TM V and TM VI to move closer to each other and that also appear to involve a major change in secondary structure at the cytoplasmic end of TM VI.

All GPCRs are predicted to share a conserved molecular architecture consisting of a bundle of seven Î±-helically arranged transmembrane domains (TM IâVII) linked by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops (Fig. 1). Despite the remarkable structural diversity of the ligands that exert their physiological functions via interaction with specific classes of GPCRs, all GPCRs are thought to share a conserved mechanism of activation. Several lines of evidence indicate that the binding of ligands to the extracellular side of the receptor leads to changes in the arrangement of distinct TM helices, which are then propagated to the intracellular surface of the receptor, thus enabling the receptor to recognize and activate specific classes of heterotrimeric G proteins (4Bourne H.R.

However, despite these recent findings, our knowledge of the molecular nature of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation is still very incomplete.During the past decade, we have used the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypical member of the superfamily of class I GPCRs (rhodopsin family), as a model system to delineate the structural elements involved in determining the selectivity of receptor/G protein coupling selectivity (reviewed in Ref. 12Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Like the M1 and M5 muscarinic receptors, the M3 receptor subtype is preferentially coupled to G proteins of the Gq family, activation of which leads to the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids (12Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor indicated that a limited number of amino acids located within the second (i2) and third intracellular (i3) loops and the adjacent cytoplasmic ends of TM III, V, and VI largely determine the Gq coupling preference of this receptor subtype (13BluÌml K.

These findings are in agreement with a large number of studies using other classes of GPCRs (17Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev.

Both loss- and gain-of-function mutagenesis studies revealed that a series of primarily hydrophobic amino acids located at the TM V/i3 loop and TM VI/i3 loop junctions are of particular importance for proper recognition of Gq proteins by the M3 muscarinic receptor. These residues include an aromatic residue located at the C terminus of TM V (Tyr254) and several mostly hydrophobic residues present at the cytoplasmic end of TM VI (Ala488, Ala489, Leu492, and Ser493) (Fig.1; Refs. 13BluÌml K.

To address this issue, we decided to employ Cys substitution mutagenesis followed by disulfide cross-linking of Cys residues that are adjacent to each other in the three-dimensional structure of the receptor. This approach has been used successfully in the past to monitor dynamic changes in a number of different membrane proteins including various bacterial chemoreceptors (21Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12893-12898Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).To examine the potential proximity of the cytoplasmic ends of TM III and TM VI, we recently described a cross-linking protocol involving the use of a series of Cys-substituted mutant M3 muscarinic receptors (30Zeng F.-Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The observed disulfide cross-linking patterns suggested that the cytoplasmic surface of the M3 receptor protein is highly dynamic. In this previous study (30Zeng F.-Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), mutant M3receptors were oxidized following solubilization and factor Xa digestion (a factor Xa site was present in the central portion of the i3 loop of all analyzed mutant receptors). Thus, the possibility cannot be completely excluded that the observed disulfide cross-linking âpromiscuityâ may have been caused, at least partially, by an increase in conformational flexibility of the mutant receptor proteins resulting from the solubilization and protease digestion steps.Thus, to facilitate the proper interpretation of disulfide cross-linking data, another major goal of the present study also was to establish a disulfide cross-linking protocol that would allow the formation of disulfide bonds using Cys-substituted mutant M3 receptors present in their native membrane environment (in situ). Specifically, we generated a series of 10 mutant M3 muscarinic receptors, all of which contained a Y254C point mutation at the bottom of TM V and a second Cys substitution within the C-terminal segment of TM VI (Lys484 to Ser493) (Fig. 1). All Cys substitutions were introduced into a mutant version of the M3 muscarinic receptor, referred to as M3â²(3C)-Xa (30Zeng F.-Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in which the central portion of the i3 loop was replaced with a factor Xa cleavage site and which, among other modifications, lacked most endogenous Cys residues (see Fig. 1 for details).Following the transient expression of the 10 double Cys mutant M3 receptors in COS-7 cells, we used a novel in situ cross-linking protocol to induce the formation of disulfide bonds between adjacent Cys residues, using Cu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (hereafter Cu (II)-phenanthroline) as a mild oxidizing agent. Cross-linking studies were carried out in the absence or in the presence of the muscarinic agonist, carbachol. The successful formation of disulfide cross-links was monitored by studying changes in the electrophoretic mobility of oxidized, factor Xa-treated receptors on SDS gels.Using this strategy, we identified several double Cys mutant receptors that displayed agonist-dependent disulfide cross-linking. The observed pattern of disulfide bonds indicates that agonist-induced M3 receptor activation involves a structural change that allows the cytoplasmic ends of TM V and VI to move closer to each other. Moreover, our data suggest that the cytoplasmic end of TM VI undergoes an activity-dependent increase in conformational flexibility, perhaps due to changes in local secondary structure. Thein situ disulfide cross-linking strategy described here should be highly useful to probe the structural mechanisms involved in GPCR activation in a systematic fashion.RESULTSA modified version of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor (M3â²(3C)-Xa) that lacked all potential N-terminalN-glycosylation sites and most native Cys residues and contained a factor Xa cleavage site within the i3 loop was used as a background for Cys-scanning mutagenesis studies (Fig.1; Ref. 30Zeng F.-Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the M3â²(3C)-Xa construct is expressed at significantly lower levels than the wild-type M3 receptor, it retains the ability to bind muscarinic ligands with high affinity and to interact with G proteins efficiently, in a fashion similar to the wild-type receptor (30Zeng F.-Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).To investigate activity-dependent changes in the relative positions of residues located at the cytoplasmic ends of TM V and VI in the M3 muscarinic receptor, we reintroduced pairs of Cys residues into the M3â²(3C)-Xa construct, thus generating 10 double Cys mutant receptors. All mutant receptors contained a Y254C point mutation at the bottom of TM V, N-terminal of the factor Xa cleavage site, and a second Cys substitution within the segment Lys484-Ser493 at the cytoplasmic end of TM VI, C-terminal of the factor Xa cleavage site (Fig. 1).Transient Expression of Mutant M3 Muscarinic Receptors in COS-7 Cells(Atropine âRescueâ)All mutant receptor constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and initially examined for their ability to bind the muscarinic radioligand, [3H]NMS. Incubation of membranes prepared from transfected COS-7 cells with a saturating concentration of [3H]NMS (3 nm) indicated that all double Cys mutant receptors, similar to the M3â²(3C)-Xa receptor from which they were derived (30Zeng F.-Y. Hopp A. Soldner A. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), were expressed at relatively low levels (â¤0.5 pmol/mg protein). To facilitate the development of a sensitive in situ disulfide cross-linking protocol, we considered it advantageous to devise a strategy that would lead to increased mutant receptor expression levels. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that treatment of transfected cells with antagonist ligands can lead to significant increases in the expression levels of certain mutant GPCRs (41Lu Z.-L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 42Morello J.-P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.-F. Lonergan M.

To examine the potential usefulness of this approach to boost the expression levels of the mutant M3 muscarinic receptors analyzed in this study, we incubated transfected COS-7 cells with the muscarinic antagonist, atropine (1 Î¼m), for the last 24 h of culture. During the harvesting of cells, special care was taken to wash out atropine bound to cell membranes (for details, see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Strikingly, atropine treatment of transfected cells led to pronounced increases (â¥10-fold) in the expression levels of all analyzed mutant muscarinic receptors, as determined in [3H]NMS saturation binding studies (shown for the M3â²(3C)-Xa construct and a representative Cys double mutant, Y254C/A489C, in Fig. 2A). As indicated in Table I, this strategy allowed all mutant receptors to be expressed at rather high levels, ranging from about 3â6 pmol/mg protein. Incubation of transfected cells with atropine (1 Î¼m) for 48 instead of 24 h (i.e. atropine was added to the cells on the day of transfection) did not lead to a further increase in receptor expression levels (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of atropine incubation of transfected COS-7 cells on the number of radioligand binding sites and protein expression pattern of mutant M3 muscarinic receptors.Results obtained with the M3â²(3C)-Xa âbase mutantâ and a representative double Cys mutant receptor (Y254C/A489C) are shown (the remaining nine double Cys mutant receptors gave similar results).A, radioligand binding studies. In an attempt to increase mutant M3 receptor expression levels, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with 1 Î¼m atropine for the last 24 h of culture.

Data are presented as means Â± S.E. of three independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate. B and C, Western blotting studies. COS-7 cells transiently expressing the indicated mutant M3 muscarinic receptors were grown in the absence or presence of atropine (1 Î¼m) for the last 24 h of culture, as indicated. Intact cells were then left either untreated or incubated with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin to biotinylate cell surface proteins, as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Subsequently, membrane extracts were prepared and processed in two different ways. B, membrane extracts were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (reducing conditions), using the anti-M3 antibody. Note that atropine treatment resulted in a pronounced increase in the intensity of the 38-kDa receptor species, independent of whether or not cells were incubated with the biotinylation reagent.C, membrane extracts were first incubated with immobilized streptavidin to capture biotinylated cell surface proteins, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (reducing conditions), using the anti-M3 antibody. Note that the 38-kDa immunoreactive species represents the major biotinylated (cell surface) M3 receptor species when transfected cells were grown in the presence of atropine (1 Î¼m).

Open table in a new tab Ligand Binding and G Protein-coupling Properties of Double Cys Mutant M3 Muscarinic ReceptorsSaturation binding studies showed that all mutant receptors were able to bind the [3H]NMS radioligand with high affinity (KD â¼0.2â0.6 nm; Table I). Similarly, [3H]NMS competition binding assays demonstrated that all double Cys mutant receptors could bind the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, with affinities that were at least as high as that determined for the M3â²(3C)-Xa construct (Kappâ¼5â50 Î¼m; Table I).To investigate whether the 10 double Cys mutant receptors were able to couple to G proteins, we next studied their ability to mediate carbachol-dependent increases in inositol phosphate production (PI hydrolysis). Like all other experiments described below, the PI assays were carried out with cells that had been grown in the presence of atropine (1 Î¼m) in order to boost receptor expression levels. As indicated in Table I, all mutant receptors retained the ability to stimulate the breakdown of PI lipids in an agonist-dependent fashion. The Y254C/E485C and Y254C/Q490C receptors showed carbachol EC50 values that were not significantly different from the corresponding value obtained with the M3â²(3C)-Xa construct (â¼70 nm). On the other hand, the remaining seven double Cys mutant receptors displayed significantly reduced carbachol EC50 values (Table I). The most pronounced reduction in agonist potency (â¼350-fold, as compared with the M3â²(3C)-Xa construct) was observed with the Y254C/K487C mutant receptor (Table I). Most of the analyzed mutant receptors also showed a significant reduction in basal inositol phosphate levels, as compared with the M3â²(3C)-Xa receptor (set at 100% in Table I). In general, the extent of reduction in basal activity correlated well with the degree of reduction in carbachol potency displayed by the individual double Cys mutant receptors. It is likely that the reduced functional activity of most mutant receptors is due to the mutational modification of residues predicted to be critical for efficient G protein coupling (13BluÌml K.

However, as shown in Table I, all double Cys mutant receptors were able to stimulate the breakdown of PI lipids with high efficacy (Emax, expressed as -fold increase in inositol monophosphate production above basal levels). The apparent increase in Emax values displayed by many of the double Cys mutant receptors correlated very well with their reduced degree of basal activity (Table I), suggesting that the observed increases in Emax values probably do not reflect a âtrueâ gain in G protein coupling efficacy.Western Blot Analysis of Double Cys Mutant M3Muscarinic ReceptorsWe next examined the expression of the M3â²(3C)-Xa construct and the 10 double Cys mutants receptors via Western blotting (reducing conditions) using a polyclonal antibody (anti-M3; Fig. 1) directed against the C terminus of the M3receptor protein (40Zeng F.-Y. Soldner A. SchoÌneberg T. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2404-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B for the M3â²(3C)-Xa construct and a representative double Cys mutant receptor (Y254C/A489C), the anti-M3 antibody detected multiple immunoreactive bands, ranging in size from about 30 to 60 kDa. Interestingly, atropine (1 Î¼m) treatment of transfected cells for the last 24 h of culture resulted in the appearance of a pronounced band at â¼38 kDa, which was barely visible in samples prepared from cells grown in the absence of atropine (Fig. 2B). Since the increase in the intensity of this band correlated well with the atropine-induced increase in the number of detectable [3H]NMS binding sites (Fig. 2A), we speculated that the â¼38-kDa receptor species might correspond to properly folded cell surface receptors. It is likely that the additional immunoreactive species observed in Fig. 2B resulted from partial receptor degradation or complex formation with other proteins. Fig.2B also shows that incubation of transfected COS-7 cells with the biotinylation reagent, Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (2.5 Î¼m), had no effect on the observed protein expression patterns (see below).Western Blot Analysis of Biotinylated Cell Surface Mutant M3 Muscarinic ReceptorsTo confirm that the 38-kDa immunoreactive species corresponds to functional M3receptors, we next carried out a series of cell surface biotinylation studies.

Increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression contributes to the migratory response of smooth muscle cells by releasing them from their surrounding extracellular matrix. MMPs may also participate in the remodeling of extracellular matrix in vascular lesions that could lead to plaque weakening and subsequent rupture. Neurotrophins and their receptors, the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, are expressed in neointimal lesions, where they induce smooth muscle cell migration. We now report that nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced activation of the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase induces MMP-9 expression in both primary cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells and in a smooth muscle cell line genetically manipulated to express TrkA. The response to NGF was specific for MMP-9 expression, as the expression of MMP-2, MMP-3, or the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 was not changed. Activation of the Shc/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway mediates the induction of MMP-9 in response to NGF, as this response is abrogated in cells expressing a mutant TrkA receptor that does not bind Shc and by pretreatment of cells with the MEK-1 inhibitor, U0126. Thus, these results indicate that the neurotrophin/Trk receptor system, by virtue of its potent chemotactic activity for smooth muscle cells and its ability to induce MMP-9 expression, is a critical mediator in the remodeling that occurs in the vascular wall in response to injury.

These activities are mediated, for the most part, by the binding of neurotrophins to the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases. This receptor family includes TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, which bind selectively to distinct neurotrophins, with NGF binding TrkA, brain-derived growth factor binding TrkB, and NT-3 binding TrkC. Recent studies demonstrate that, in addition to their differentiation and survival activities in the nervous system, neurotrophins and Trk receptors are also expressed in the cardiovascular system, where they mediate cardiac (4Donovan M.J.

Moreover, NGF is a potent chemotactic agent for smooth muscle cells expressing Trk receptors, eliciting a response comparable with PDGF-BB (6Donovan M.J. Miranda R.C. Kraemer R. Mccaffrey T.A.

The high level of expression of neurotrophins and their receptors in advanced neointimal lesions, however, suggest that in addition to their chemotactic activity on smooth muscle cells, there may be other mechanisms by which NGF and neurotrophins can contribute to lesion development. One potential mechanism is the regulation of proteolytic activity in developing neointimal lesions. Increased proteolytic activity in the vessel wall mediates the degradation of the extracellular matrix surrounding smooth muscle cells in response to injury (8Newby A.C. Zaltsman A.B. J.

Of the proteolytic enzymes expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a large family of neutral proteases, are thought to be one of the principal regulators of matrix degradation in response to vascular injury. First, although MMPs are expressed at low levels by smooth muscle cells in noninjured vessels, their expression is induced in the rat aorta following balloon de-endothelialization (9Bendeck M.P.

Second, treatment with MMP inhibitors reduces smooth muscle cell accumulation in the intima and reduces lesion formation following balloon injury of the rat thoracic aorta (9Bendeck M.P. Zempo N.

Crow M.T. Stetler-Stevenson W. Capogrossi M.C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2195-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Finally, MMPs are expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions, particularly at sites of plaque instability, where their expression may predispose the plaque to rupture (13Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of MMPs appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neointimal lesions. One class of MMPs that has been implicated as mediators of lesion development in response to vascular injury are the gelatinases, MMP-2 (72 kDa) and MMP-9 (92 kDa). Both are expressed in the balloon-injured rat thoracic aorta (9Bendeck M.P. Zempo N. Clowes A.W. Galardy R.E. Reidy M.A. Circ.

MMP-2 is constitutively expressed by several cell types, including smooth muscle cells, and its expression is not induced by cytokines or growth factors (18Galis Z.S. Muszynski M. Sukhova G.K.

In contrast, the basal levels of MMP-9 are usually low, and its expression can be induced by treatment of cells with tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-1, but not platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; Refs. 18Galis Z.S.

Moreover, in the balloon-injured rat thoracic aorta, MMP-9 expression, both protein and mRNA, is induced early after injury (9Bendeck M.P. Zempo N. Clowes A.W. Galardy R.E. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 10Webb K.E. Henney A.M. Anglin S. Humphries S.E. Mcewan J.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Clowes A.W. Galardy R.E. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 10Webb K.E. Henney A.M. Anglin S. Humphries S.E. Mcewan J.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

These data demonstrate that the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2 may be differentially regulated in response to vascular injury. Studies examining the signal transduction pathways that regulate MMP-9 expression have demonstrated that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, Erk-1 and Erk-2, is critical for the increased expression of MMP-9 in response to different agonists (20Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4492-4498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Cho A. Graves J. Reidy M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2527-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that NGF is a potent activator of Erk-1 and Erk-2 in vascular smooth muscle cells expressing TrkA receptors (7Kraemer R. Ngyuen H. March K.L. Hempstead B.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This suggests that, in addition to its potent chemotactic activity, NGF could also potentially regulate MMP-9 expression in smooth muscle cells. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether NGF regulates MMP expression by vascular smooth muscle cells. In studies reported here, we demonstrate that NGF treatment of smooth muscle cells expressing TrkA induces MMP-9 expression. Moreover, NGF-induced MMP-9 expression is dependent on the activation of the MAP kinases, Erk-1 and Erk-2. These studies further support a role for the neurotrophins in vascular remodeling and lesion development following vascular injury. Temperature-sensitive mouse smooth muscle cells (TsTmSMC), grown from aortic explants of a transgenic mouse line expressing a temperature sensitive SV40-T antigen under the control of the promoter for smooth muscle cell Î±-actin (22March K.L. Fan L. Sindermann J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and a previously established clone of TsTmSMC stably expressing TrkA (TrkA-TsTmSMC; previously referred to as mTrkA48) were cultured as described (7Kraemer R.

Kaplan, McGill University, Montreal, Canada). After selection in G418 (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen), colonies were subcloned, expanded and tested for stable expression of full-length Trk receptors by Western blot analysis, using a polyclonal antiserum directed against the carboxyl tail of Trk (rabbit polyclonal, C-14; 200 ng/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In some experiments, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antisera directed against the carboxyl tail of TrkA as described previously (Î±203; 1:250 dilution; Refs. 7Kraemer R.

Res. 1995; 40: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were precipitated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose and separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed using the anti-Trk antibody described above. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000 dilution; Chemicon, El Segundo, CA). Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture plates at 37 Â°C in media containing 10% FCS. Native TsTmSMC and TsTmSMC expressing either wild type or mutant TrkA receptors were plated in 100-mm dishes in medium containing 10% FCS at 39.5 Â°C for 2 days. The cells were then cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium in the absence (control) or presence of murine NGF (Harlan Bioproducts for Science, 10â100 ng/ml), recombinant murine TNF (10â50 ng/ml; R&D, Minneapolis, MN), or recombinant human PDGF-BB (10â30 ng/ml; R&D). The conditioned media were collected at 18, 24, 36, and 48 h and clarified by centrifugation. In some experiments, where indicated, conditioned media were concentrated 3-fold by centrifugation through a Centricon Filter (10,000 molecular weight cutoff, Millipore, Beverly, MA). MMP activity in cellular conditioned media was analyzed by zymography, as described previously (26Khan K.M.F. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8270-8275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium was mixed with SDS sample buffer without Î²-mercaptoethanol and heated for 30 min at 37 Â°C. The volume of conditioned medium to be loaded on the zymography gel was normalized to cellular protein as assessed by a Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin equivalent as a standard. Samples and molecular weight markers were electrophoresed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin. Recombinant human latent (92 kDa) and active (83 kDa) MMP-9 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) were loaded as positive controls. The gel was washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h in 200 mm NaCl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The presence of gelatinolytic activity was identified as clear bands on a uniform blue background following destaining. In experiments in which specific enzyme inhibitors were used, TrkA-TsTmSMC were cultured as above and then preincubated with either the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm to 1 Î¼m; Sigma) or the MEK inhibitor U0126 (Refs. 27DeSilva D.R.

After 24 h, conditioned media were collected and zymography was performed as above. RNA was isolated from growth factor- or cytokine-treated TrkA-TsTmSMC by phenol chloroform extraction (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar, 30Puissant C. Houdebine L.-M. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 148-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis for detection of mRNA for MMP-3, 20 Î¼g of total RNA was electrophoresed in 1% denaturing agarose gels containing formaldehyde and ethidium bromide and transferred to Zetaprobe followed by cross-linking using a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For Northern blot analysis for MMP-9, poly(A) mRNA was first purified from total RNA, using the poly(A)tract isolation kit from Promega. After purification, mRNA was electrophoresed and transferred to a Zetaprobe filter as above. The filters were hybridized with a32P-radiolabeled MMP-3 cDNA (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) or MMP-9 cDNA, (kindly provided by Ghislain Opdenakker, Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Belgium; Refs. 31Masure S.

The filter was then washed under high stringency conditions and exposed to Fuji x-ray film with intensifying screens at â70 Â°C. The amounts of mRNA for MMP-3 and MMP-9 was quantified by NIH image software and normalized by comparison with the mRNA levels for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (American Type Culture Collection) or Î²-actin. The Î²-actin probe was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR of RNA from the murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and was a gift from Dr. Jihong Han (Weill Medical College, New York, NY). TsTmSMC expressing wild type TrkA (WT-TrkA), KD-TrkA, or 490 mutant TrkA receptors (Y490F-TrkA) were cultured on collagen-coated 100-mm tissue culture plates for 2 days at 39.5 Â°C in 10% FCS medium, followed by 18 h in 0.5% FCS. The cells were then treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 5 min and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (1 Î¼g/ml), leupeptin (10 Î¼g/ml), and sodium vanadate (1 mmol/liter). Proteins in whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis using an antibody-directed against phosphorylated Erk-1/Erk-2 (monoclonal, clone E4, 40 ng/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or phosphorylated Akt (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA; 1:1000 dilution) followed by incubation with either antimouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution; Chemicon). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence as described above. Cells were plated and treated with growth factors and cytokines as above. After 24 h, conditioned media were collected and volumes of conditioned media normalized to cell protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis was performed using either monoclonal anti-TIMP-1 IgG (Ab-2; 1 Î¼g/ml; Calbiochem) or monoclonal anti-TIMP-2 IgG (Ab-2; 5 Î¼g/ml; Calbiochem) using recombinant TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 (Calbiochem) as positive controls. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence as above. The effect of NGF on MMP expression was first examined in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that these cells express TrkA receptors at low passage (6Donovan M.J. Miranda R.C. Kraemer R. Mccaffrey T.A. Tessarollo L. Mahadeo D. Sharif S. Kaplan D.R. Tsoulfas P. Parada L. Toran-Allerand D. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 309-324PubMed Google Scholar). Rat smooth muscle cells were cultured in serum-free media in the absence (control) or presence of NGF (50 and 100 ng/ml), TNF (10 ng/ml), or PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml). After 24 h, conditioned media were collected and concentrated and MMP activity determined by zymography (Fig. 1). Media from control smooth muscle cells did not demonstrate proteolytic activity at 92 kDa, corresponding to MMP-9. In contrast, treatment with 100 ng/ml NGF induced the expression of a band of proteolytic activity that co-migrated with recombinant human latent MMP-9. These data indicate that NGF induces the synthesis of MMP-9. Media from control smooth muscle cells did contain two bands of proteolytic activity at 72 and 66 kDa (results not shown), corresponding to the latent and active forms of MMP-2, respectively. Importantly, the expression of MMP-2 was not changed by treatment of the cells with NGF. These data suggest that the effect of NGF on vascular smooth muscle cells is specific for MMP-9. The observed response of smooth muscle cells to NGF was similar to that observed after treatment with TNF, which had been shown previously to induce MMP-9 expression in human, rabbit, and rat cultured smooth muscle cells (18Galis Z.S.

To further characterize NGF-induced MMP-9 expression in smooth muscle cells, we utilized an established, conditionally immortalized temperature-sensitive mouse smooth muscle cell line (TsTmSMC) in which we could express various Trk receptor isoforms. The cells were derived as aortic explants from a transgenic mouse line expressing a temperature-sensitive T-antigen (22March K.L. Fan L. Sindermann J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Culturing of cells expressing the temperature-sensitive T-antigen at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5 Â°C reduces the expression of T-antigen and induces a nontransformed phenotype (7Kraemer R. Ngyuen H. March K.L. Hempstead B.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Jat P.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1672-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that TsTmSMC express PDGF-Î² receptors and demonstrate both chemotactic and proliferative responses to PDGF-BB (7Kraemer R. Ngyuen H. March K.L. Hempstead B.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). TsTmSMC, however, do not express full-length Trk receptors, but clones stably expressing TrkA have been established by using gene transfection techniques (7Kraemer R. Ngyuen H. March K.L. Hempstead B.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using a previously established clone of TsTmSMC stably expressing TrkA receptors (TrkA-TsTmSMC; Ref. 7Kraemer R. Ngyuen H. March K.L. Hempstead B.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the effect of NGF binding to TrkA on MMP-9 expression was assessed. TrkA-TsTmSMC cultured for 3 days at 39.5 Â°C were treated with NGF (10â100 ng/ml), TNF (100 ng/ml), or PDGF-BB (10â50 ng/ml) in serum-free media. Conditioned media collected after 24 h were concentrated and MMP activity determined utilizing zymography. Media derived from TrkA-TsTmSMC contained both active and latent MMP-2, as indicated by the proteolytic activity at 66 and 72 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2, panel A). Cells also expressed proteolytic activity at a slightly higher molecular weight than the recombinant human latent 92-kDa MMP-9 (see Fig. 7). This band corresponds to the murine latent MMP-9, which has a molecular mass of 105â110 kDa (31Masure S. Nys G. Fiten P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). NGF induces a dose-dependent increase in MMP-9 activity, where the induction of MMP-9 by 100 ng/ml NGF was comparable with that induced by TNF. In addition to latent MMP-9, a proteolytic band which corresponds to active murine MMP-9 (Fig. 2, panel A) was observed in zymographs utilizing concentrated media derived from cells incubated with NGF. These data indicate that, in murine smooth muscle cells expressing TrkA, NGF induces both the synthesis and activation of MMP-9. The increase in MMP-9 activity is detectable within 18 h after NGF treatment and remains increased for up to 48 h after the addition of NGF (Fig. 2, panel B, nonconcentrated media). In contrast to its effect on TrkA-TsTmSMC, NGF did not induce MMP-9 expression in native TsTmSMC (Fig. 2, panel C, nonconcentrated media), confirming that the response to NGF is mediated through its binding to TrkA. As was observed in rat smooth muscle cells, NGF did not increase the expression of MMP-2 in TsTmSMC (Fig. 2,panels A and B). PDGF-BB treatment did not effect expression of either MMP-2 or MMP-9 (Fig. 2, panels AâC).Figure 7Zymographic analysis of conditioned media from TsTmSMC expressing either WT-TrkA (panels A and B), KD-TrkA (panel A), or Y490F-TrkA (panel B).

https://openalex.org/W2023458662,"The interaction of the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX receptor complex with the membrane skeleton of platelets is dependent on a specific interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of GPIbÎ± and filamin-1. This interaction has been proposed to regulate key aspects of platelet function, including the ligand binding of GPIb-V-IX and the ability of the cells to sustain adhesion to von Willebrand factor (vWf) under high shear. In this study we have examined sequences in the GPIbÎ± intracellular domain necessary for interaction of the receptor with filamin-1. We have identified two adjacent sequences involving amino acids 557â568 and 569â579 of the GPIbÎ± cytoplasmic domain that are critical for normal association between the receptor complex and filamin-1. Under flow conditions, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing these two mutant receptors exhibited an increase in translocation velocity that was associated with increased cell detachment from the vWf matrix at high shear. The shear-dependent acceleration in velocity of mutant Î557â568 and Î569â579 CHO cells was associated with a critical defect in receptor anchorage, evident from significant extraction of GPIb-IX from the CHO cell membrane at high shear.

Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is an inherited mechano-bullous disorder caused by mutations in the type VII collagen gene and perturbations in anchoring fibrils. In this study, we produced recombinant human type VII collagen in stably transfected human 293 cell clones and purified large quantities of the recombinant protein from culture media. The recombinant type VII collagen was secreted as a correctly folded, disulfide-bonded, helical trimer resistant to protease degradation. Purified type VII collagen bound to fibronectin, laminin-5, type I collagen, and type IV collagen and also supported human dermal fibroblast adhesion. In an attempt to establish genotype-phenotype relationships, we generated two individual substitution mutations that have been associated with recessive DEB, R2008G and G2749R, and purified the recombinant mutant proteins. The G2749R mutation resulted in mutant type VII collagen with increased sensitivity to protease degradation and decreased ability to form trimers. The R2008G mutation caused the intracellular accumulation of type VII collagen. We conclude that structural and functional studies of in vitro generated type VII collagen mutant proteins will aid in correlating genetic mutations with the clinical phenotypes of DEB patients.

Within the extracellular space, type VII collagen molecules form antiparallel, tail-to-tail dimers stabilized by disulfide bonding through a small carboxyl-terminal NC2 overlap between two type VII collagen molecules. A portion of the NC2 domain is then proteolytically removed (16Morris N.P. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bentz H. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The antiparallel dimers then aggregate laterally to form anchoring fibrils with large globular NC1 domains at both ends of the structure. NC1 domains have been suggested to interact at one end with BMZ components and at the other end with type IV collagen in âanchoring plaquesâ (2Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our recent study using recombinant NC1 demonstrated that NC1 interacts with various extracellular matrix (ECM) components including fibronectin, laminin 5, type I collagen, and type IV collagen (18Chen M.

Therefore, structural alterations in type VII collagen may result in functional disruption of its interactions with ECM components, leading to the epidermal-dermal separation as seen in DEB. Further, we showed recently that the NC2 domain of type VII collagen and its adjacent triple-helical domain initiate the triple-helical assembly of type VII collagen and catalyze the antiparallel dimer formation of the procollagen (19Chen M.

Over 100 distinct mutations in COL7A1 have been identified in DEB patients (20Uitto J. Christiano A.M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 287: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These mutations have occurred within NC1, NC2, and the helical domain (21Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Curr. Opin. Dermatol. 1996; 3: 225-232Google Scholar,22Uitto J. Hovnanian A. Christiano A.M. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1995; 107: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar). In the most severe clinical subtype of recessive DEB, the COL7A1 mutations involve the creation of premature termination codons (PTCs), which predict the synthesis of a very truncated type VII collagen (23Christiano A.M. Anhalt G. Gibbons S. Bauer E.A. Uitto J. Genomics. 1994; 21: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The main effect of any PTC, however, is to create an unstable mRNA transcript; consequently, little if any functional protein is generated from the mutant allele. Other types of gene defects identified in some recessive DEB patients were either homozygous for a missense mutation or were compound heterozygous for a PTC and a missense mutation (24Hovnanian A. Rochat A. Bodemer C. Petit E. Rivers C.A. Prost C. Fraitag S. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Lathrop M. Barrandon Y. Prost Y. Am. J. Hum.

These mutations have been suggested to result in the synthesis of a type VII collagen polypeptide with decreased stability and/or altered function. Despite a growing number of known collagen mutations, however, the biological consequences of specific COL7A1 mutations and the molecular mechanisms leading to DEB clinical phenotypes are unknown.Type VII collagen represents less than 0.001% of the total collagen extracted from human skin (26Bruckner-Tuderman L. Schnyder U.W. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This has impeded purification of sufficient amounts of native type VII collagen for functional studies. Furthermore, a major problem in studying the biological functions of type VII collagen has been the necessity of using denaturing or proteolytic conditions to release type VII collagen from supramolecular complexes with other extracellular macromolecules during purification procedures. In the current study, we used an efficient eukaryotic recombinant approach to engineer and generate type VII collagen molecules in sufficient amounts for biological characterization and further functional analysis. Further, we introduced two individual substitution mutations, R2008G and G2749R, into the type VII collagen expression vector using site-directed mutagenesis. These two mutations have been reported to be associated with severe, mutilating Hallopeau-Siemens type of recessive DEB (24Hovnanian A. Rochat A. Bodemer C. Petit E. Rivers C.A. Prost C. Fraitag S. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Lathrop M. Barrandon Y. Prost Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Christiano A.M. McGrath J.A. Tan K.C. Uitto J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 671-681PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that these mutations affect the type VII collagen homotrimer formation, secretion, folding, and stability. Our structural and functional studies of the mutated molecules may yield novel insights into the molecular pathomechanisms underlying DEB disease.DISCUSSIONThe efficient production and secretion of human type VII collagen was achieved by using an eukaryotic expression vector in a human cell line that has no endogenous type VII collagen. The recombinant collagen was secreted in large quantities into the culture medium (2â5 mg/liter), which allowed purification of the protein in milligram quantities for structural and functional studies.Our data indicate that recombinant type VII collagen is a better adhesive ligand than NC1 for human fibroblast attachment. We demonstrated that a truncated type VII minicollagen, containing the intact noncollagenous NC1 and NC2 and half of the central helical collagenous domain, supported fibroblast attachment at levels similar to those of NC1 alone. These results indicate that the deleted 678 amino acids (residues 1920â2603) within the central collagenous domain contain the additional fibroblast binding site (s).In a study by Christiano and colleagues (24Hovnanian A. Rochat A. Bodemer C. Petit E. Rivers C.A. Prost C. Fraitag S. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Lathrop M. Barrandon Y. Prost Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), a family with members who had recessive DEB was described in which a gene defect in type VII collagen was identified as a single amino acid substitution from arginine to glycine at residue 2008 within the triple-helical domain. Specifically, this substitution was in exon 73, in close vicinity with the noncollagenous hinge region in the center of the long triple helix. Because of this report and the resultant reduced anchoring fibrils detected in the skin of affected patients, we attempted to duplicate this gene defect in vitro using site-directed mutagenesis. We introduced the same mutation in our type VII collagen expression construct. Our data show that this mutation leads to reduced secretion and intracellular accumulation of the mutant protein. It is interesting to note that three other type VII collagen mutations, G2006D, G2034R, and G2015E, within exon 73 close to the hinge region have also been shown to interfere with protein folding in a dominant negative manner and cause intracellular accumulation of the mutant molecules (38Hammami-Hauasli N. Schumann H. Raghunath M. Kilgus O. Luthi U. Luger T. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19228-19234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is possible that exon 73 may contain amino acid residues critical for the efficient secretion of type VII collagen. Protein suicide can be regarded as a protective mechanism because incorporation of abnormally folded molecules into fibrillar polymers destabilizes the suprastructures and renders them ultrastructurally abnormal and functionally inadequate. Our current data, taken together with others' previously published work with other mutant proteins (G2006D, G2034R, and G2015E), are consistent with this hypothesis. Such a mechanism could lead to a paucity of anchoring fibrils at the DEJ and explain the ultrastructural observation of reduced and abnormal anchoring fibrils in DEB patients' skin (24Hovnanian A. Rochat A. Bodemer C. Petit E. Rivers C.A. Prost C. Fraitag S. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Lathrop M. Barrandon Y. Prost Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because a small amount of R2008G mutant protein (10â15%) was still able to be secreted into the extracellular matrix, it is possible that the R2008G mutation may impair some other important functions of type VII collagen. In this regard, we could not detect effects of the R2008G mutation on type VII collagen stability, trimer formation, or fibronectin binding (data not shown). However, recent studies have identified four unrelated DEB patients with attenuated or negative staining for GDA-J/F3, a new component of human skin BMZ (39Bruckner-Tuderman L. Hopfner B. Hammami-Hauasli N. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Gayraud B. Hopfner B. Jassim A. Aumailley M. Tuderman-Bruckner L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9531-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All of these four DEB patients had distinct amino acid substitutions within the RGD motif of residue Arg-2008. This suggests that this residue is important for the affinity between type VII collagen and the GDA-J/F3 protein (39Bruckner-Tuderman L. Hopfner B. Hammami-Hauasli N. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Gayraud B. Hopfner B. Jassim A. Aumailley M. Tuderman-Bruckner L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9531-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This interaction may play a role in dermal epidermal adherence.The homozygous glycine substitution mutation (G2749R) in an affected individual was associated with severe recessive DEB phenotype. In general, the tight packing of collagen triple helices makes them relatively resistant to the effects of proteases. Glycine substitutions within the collagen tripeptide repeat can alter this conformation, and, as a consequence, its function and/or stability. A local disruption in the triple-helical structure can often be monitored by measuring the susceptibility of the collagen to proteolytic cleavage in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrated that the G2749R mutant protein revealed an increased sensitivity to protease and a decreased ability to form trimers. It is interesting to note that the G2749R mutation occurs right before a small interrupted collagenous segment. The substitution of a glycine residue in this short, nonhelical collagenous segment may lead to destabilization and local unraveling of the triple helix. This destabilization is manifested as an increased sensitivity to protease digestion in vitro. Because of this local structural alteration, it is likely that peptide bonds in proximity to the G2749R mutation are more susceptible to proteolysis by extracellular proteinases present at the epidermal BMZ. Our finding that the G2749R mutation leads to increased sensitivity to proteolysis and a corresponding decreased steady-state level of type VII collagen in vivo may contribute to the abnormal and the markedly reduced numbers of anchoring fibrils characteristic of recessive DEB. Alternatively, the mutation-associated structural alteration could well have a direct negative impact on type VII collagen function. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the G2749R mutation occurs within the domain that contains a fibronectin binding site. However, purified mutant G2749R protein binds to fibronectin with the same potency as wild type type VII collagen (data not shown).The G2749R mutant protein had reduced ability to form trimers. The reasons why a single glycine substitution can exert such an effect are unclear. However, this mutation occurs within the domain which initiates the triple-helical assembly of type VII collagen and directs antiparallel dimer formation (19Chen M. Keene D.R. Costa F.K. Tahk S.H. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21649-21655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that these amino acids are located within motifs required for triple-helical assembly of type VII collagen.The expression system used here allows for the production of native, post-translationally modified type VII collagen in quantities sufficient for comprehensive functional and structural studies. Furthermore, the recombinant expression system should be useful in elucidating the effects of human mutations on the structure and function of type VII collagen by site-directed mutagenesis. Studies of this nature may facilitate the interpretation of the naturally occurring molecular defects within type VII collagen associated with DEB. These studies may also provide an understanding of the correlation between genetic mutations in type VII collagen and the resultant DEB clinical phenotypes. Type VII collagen resides within the basement membrane zone (BMZ)1 beneath stratified squamous epithelium (1Uitto J. Chung-Honet L.C. Christiano A.M. Exp.

Therefore, structural alterations in type VII collagen may result in functional disruption of its interactions with ECM components, leading to the epidermal-dermal separation as seen in DEB.

These mutations have been suggested to result in the synthesis of a type VII collagen polypeptide with decreased stability and/or altered function. Despite a growing number of known collagen mutations, however, the biological consequences of specific COL7A1 mutations and the molecular mechanisms leading to DEB clinical phenotypes are unknown. Type VII collagen represents less than 0.001% of the total collagen extracted from human skin (26Bruckner-Tuderman L. Schnyder U.W. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This has impeded purification of sufficient amounts of native type VII collagen for functional studies. Furthermore, a major problem in studying the biological functions of type VII collagen has been the necessity of using denaturing or proteolytic conditions to release type VII collagen from supramolecular complexes with other extracellular macromolecules during purification procedures. In the current study, we used an efficient eukaryotic recombinant approach to engineer and generate type VII collagen molecules in sufficient amounts for biological characterization and further functional analysis. Further, we introduced two individual substitution mutations, R2008G and G2749R, into the type VII collagen expression vector using site-directed mutagenesis. These two mutations have been reported to be associated with severe, mutilating Hallopeau-Siemens type of recessive DEB (24Hovnanian A. Rochat A. Bodemer C. Petit E. Rivers C.A. Prost C. Fraitag S. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Lathrop M. Barrandon Y. Prost Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Christiano A.M. McGrath J.A. Tan K.C. Uitto J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 671-681PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that these mutations affect the type VII collagen homotrimer formation, secretion, folding, and stability. Our structural and functional studies of the mutated molecules may yield novel insights into the molecular pathomechanisms underlying DEB disease. DISCUSSIONThe efficient production and secretion of human type VII collagen was achieved by using an eukaryotic expression vector in a human cell line that has no endogenous type VII collagen. The recombinant collagen was secreted in large quantities into the culture medium (2â5 mg/liter), which allowed purification of the protein in milligram quantities for structural and functional studies.Our data indicate that recombinant type VII collagen is a better adhesive ligand than NC1 for human fibroblast attachment. We demonstrated that a truncated type VII minicollagen, containing the intact noncollagenous NC1 and NC2 and half of the central helical collagenous domain, supported fibroblast attachment at levels similar to those of NC1 alone. These results indicate that the deleted 678 amino acids (residues 1920â2603) within the central collagenous domain contain the additional fibroblast binding site (s).In a study by Christiano and colleagues (24Hovnanian A. Rochat A. Bodemer C. Petit E. Rivers C.A. Prost C. Fraitag S. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Lathrop M. Barrandon Y. Prost Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), a family with members who had recessive DEB was described in which a gene defect in type VII collagen was identified as a single amino acid substitution from arginine to glycine at residue 2008 within the triple-helical domain. Specifically, this substitution was in exon 73, in close vicinity with the noncollagenous hinge region in the center of the long triple helix. Because of this report and the resultant reduced anchoring fibrils detected in the skin of affected patients, we attempted to duplicate this gene defect in vitro using site-directed mutagenesis. We introduced the same mutation in our type VII collagen expression construct. Our data show that this mutation leads to reduced secretion and intracellular accumulation of the mutant protein. It is interesting to note that three other type VII collagen mutations, G2006D, G2034R, and G2015E, within exon 73 close to the hinge region have also been shown to interfere with protein folding in a dominant negative manner and cause intracellular accumulation of the mutant molecules (38Hammami-Hauasli N.

It is possible that exon 73 may contain amino acid residues critical for the efficient secretion of type VII collagen. Protein suicide can be regarded as a protective mechanism because incorporation of abnormally folded molecules into fibrillar polymers destabilizes the suprastructures and renders them ultrastructurally abnormal and functionally inadequate. Our current data, taken together with others' previously published work with other mutant proteins (G2006D, G2034R, and G2015E), are consistent with this hypothesis. Such a mechanism could lead to a paucity of anchoring fibrils at the DEJ and explain the ultrastructural observation of reduced and abnormal anchoring fibrils in DEB patients' skin (24Hovnanian A. Rochat A. Bodemer C. Petit E. Rivers C.A. Prost C. Fraitag S. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Lathrop M. Barrandon Y. Prost Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because a small amount of R2008G mutant protein (10â15%) was still able to be secreted into the extracellular matrix, it is possible that the R2008G mutation may impair some other important functions of type VII collagen. In this regard, we could not detect effects of the R2008G mutation on type VII collagen stability, trimer formation, or fibronectin binding (data not shown). However, recent studies have identified four unrelated DEB patients with attenuated or negative staining for GDA-J/F3, a new component of human skin BMZ (39Bruckner-Tuderman L. Hopfner B. Hammami-Hauasli N. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Gayraud B. Hopfner B. Jassim A. Aumailley M. Tuderman-Bruckner L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9531-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All of these four DEB patients had distinct amino acid substitutions within the RGD motif of residue Arg-2008. This suggests that this residue is important for the affinity between type VII collagen and the GDA-J/F3 protein (39Bruckner-Tuderman L. Hopfner B. Hammami-Hauasli N. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Gayraud B. Hopfner B. Jassim A. Aumailley M. Tuderman-Bruckner L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9531-9538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This interaction may play a role in dermal epidermal adherence.The homozygous glycine substitution mutation (G2749R) in an affected individual was associated with severe recessive DEB phenotype. In general, the tight packing of collagen triple helices makes them relatively resistant to the effects of proteases. Glycine substitutions within the collagen tripeptide repeat can alter this conformation, and, as a consequence, its function and/or stability. A local disruption in the triple-helical structure can often be monitored by measuring the susceptibility of the collagen to proteolytic cleavage in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrated that the G2749R mutant protein revealed an increased sensitivity to protease and a decreased ability to form trimers. It is interesting to note that the G2749R mutation occurs right before a small interrupted collagenous segment. The substitution of a glycine residue in this short, nonhelical collagenous segment may lead to destabilization and local unraveling of the triple helix. This destabilization is manifested as an increased sensitivity to protease digestion in vitro. Because of this local structural alteration, it is likely that peptide bonds in proximity to the G2749R mutation are more susceptible to proteolysis by extracellular proteinases present at the epidermal BMZ. Our finding that the G2749R mutation leads to increased sensitivity to proteolysis and a corresponding decreased steady-state level of type VII collagen in vivo may contribute to the abnormal and the markedly reduced numbers of anchoring fibrils characteristic of recessive DEB. Alternatively, the mutation-associated structural alteration could well have a direct negative impact on type VII collagen function. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the G2749R mutation occurs within the domain that contains a fibronectin binding site. However, purified mutant G2749R protein binds to fibronectin with the same potency as wild type type VII collagen (data not shown).The G2749R mutant protein had reduced ability to form trimers. The reasons why a single glycine substitution can exert such an effect are unclear. However, this mutation occurs within the domain which initiates the triple-helical assembly of type VII collagen and directs antiparallel dimer formation (19Chen M. Keene D.R. Costa F.K. Tahk S.H. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21649-21655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that these amino acids are located within motifs required for triple-helical assembly of type VII collagen.The expression system used here allows for the production of native, post-translationally modified type VII collagen in quantities sufficient for comprehensive functional and structural studies. Furthermore, the recombinant expression system should be useful in elucidating the effects of human mutations on the structure and function of type VII collagen by site-directed mutagenesis. Studies of this nature may facilitate the interpretation of the naturally occurring molecular defects within type VII collagen associated with DEB.

In an attempt, first, to distinguish between two proposed structural models of this di-iron protein, and, second, to examine the roles of two highly conserved tyrosine residues, we have expressed an array of site-specific mutants inSchizosaccharomyces pombe. Mitochondrial respiratory analysis reveals that S. pombe cells expressing AOX proteins in which Glu-217 or Glu-270 were mutated, no longer exhibit antimycin-resistant oxygen uptake, indicating that these residues are essential for AOX activity. Although such data corroborate a model that describes the AOX as an interfacial membrane protein, they are not in full agreement with the most recently proposed ligation sphere of its di-iron center. We furthermore show that upon mutation of Tyr-253 and Tyr-275 to phenylalanines, AOX activity is fully maintained or abolished, respectively. These data are discussed in reference to the importance of both residues in the catalytic cycle of the AOX.

McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Google Scholar, 2Wagner A.M. Moore A.L. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 319-333Google Scholar, 3Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 432-439Google Scholar, 4Affourtit C. Krab K. Moore A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 58-69Google Scholar). This terminal oxidase branches from the cytochrome pathway at the level of the ubiquinone pool and is non-protonmotive. The AOX is resistant to inhibitors of the cytochrome pathway such as cyanide and antimycin A but inhibited by a number of compounds including hydroxamic acids (e.g.salicylhydroxamic acid) and n-alkyl-gallates.Two structural models of the AOX currently exist. The first model proposed by Siedow et al. (5Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Google Scholar, 6Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Google Scholar) was based on relatively few AOX sequences and classified the AOX as a member of the di-iron family of proteins that also includes the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase. Based on hydropathy analysis, the AOX was predicted to contain two transmembrane helices that are connected by a helix located in the intermembrane space (6Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Since this model was proposed, further AOX sequences were identified, resulting in the proposal by Andersson and Nordlund (7Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Google Scholar) of an alternative structural model (Fig. 1B). Although this second model also classifies the AOX as a di-iron protein, it differs in the precise ligation sphere of the di-iron center (7Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Google Scholar). For instance, one of the C-terminal Glu-X-X-His motifs identified by Siedow et al. (5Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Google Scholar, 6Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Google Scholar), containing Glu-270, appeared not to be fully conserved in the newly identified sequences and consequently seemed unlikely to play a role in ligating iron. Instead, Andersson and Nordlund used a third Glu-X-X-His motif (that contains Glu-217, which is located in the intermembrane space according to the Siedow et al. model) to coordinate the iron atoms. Since such a choice implies that the transmembrane helices can no longer be retained, Andersson and Nordlund (7Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Google Scholar) proposed that the AOX is an interfacial rather than a transmembrane protein.Recently, the IMMUTANS (Im) gene fromArabidopsis thaliana has been sequenced and, interestingly, was found to encode a plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) that appears to be distantly related to the AOX (8Wu D. Wright D.A. Wetzel C. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 43-55Google Scholar, 9Carol P. Stevenson D. Bisanz C. Breitenbach J. Sandmann G. Mache R. Coupland G. Kuntz M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 57-68Google Scholar). The limited but significant homology of the Im gene to the AOX includes several glutamate and histidine residues located in positions that could contribute to iron binding. In the Im sequence, all but one (Glu-269) of the amino acid residues that were proposed by Andersson and Nordlund (7Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Google Scholar) to coordinate the di-iron centers are also present, which these authors considered strong support for their model (10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar). Importantly, however, the model was subtly adapted in so much that Glu-269 was replaced by Glu-268, a residue that indeed is fully conserved throughout all AOX and PTOX sequences.To probe structure-function relationships, we have previously developed a heterologous expression system in which the Sauromatum guttatum AOX is expressed in the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe. In this system, the AOX is functionally targeted to the mitochondria and as such confers antimycin-resistant mitochondrial respiration upon S. pombecells (11Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Google Scholar). Using the system, we have previously shown that mutating Glu-270 to alanine abolishes this antimycin-resistant respiratory activity, suggesting that this residue is important for AOX activity (12Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, mutation of a corresponding glutamate residue in the Trypanosoma brucei sequence that was expressed in Escherichia coli also resulted in an inactive AOX protein (13Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Google Scholar).In addition to a catalytic site for the reduction of oxygen, the AOX must also contain a binding site for its reducing substrate, ubiquinol. Recognition of several structural features generally considered important for quinone binding (14Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Google Scholar, 15Allen J.P. Feher G. Yeates T.O. Komiya H. Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8487-8491Google Scholar) led Moore et al. (6Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Google Scholar) to the suggestion that several residues situated at the matrix end of the two membrane-spanning helices, including Tyr-253, could potentially be involved in binding quinone.In this study, we have used our S. pombe expression system to investigate the role of Glu-217, a residue that may distinguish between the two existing models, and to study the potential role of Tyr-253 in quinone binding. In addition, we have examined another tyrosine residue, Tyr-275 (equivalent to Tyr-280 in Berthold's nomenclature; see Ref. 10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar), which is also highly conserved and which has been suggested to function in electron transport or to play a role in quinone binding (10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar). Respiratory analysis reveals that mutation of Tyr-253 to phenylalanine does not affect the activity of the AOX but, importantly, that the oxidase is inactive upon mutation of Tyr-275 to phenylalanine. Of particular significance is the finding that mutation of Glu-217 to alanine results in an inactive AOX, demonstrating that this residue plays an important role in the catalytic activity of the AOX. Although our results suggest that the AOX is interfacial (as proposed in Ref. 7Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Google Scholar) rather than a transmembranous membrane protein, they are not in full agreement with the precise ligation sphere as outlined by Berthold et al. (10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar).RESULTSFig. 2 shows typical respiratory traces and a Western blot analysis of Percoll-purified S. pombe mitochondria containing the wild-type (Fig. 2A), E270N (Fig. 2B), or E217A (Fig. 2C) AOX. It can be seen that mitochondria from the three types of cells readily oxidize NADH in a manner that can be stimulated between 1.7- and 2-fold by the addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, demonstrating that electron transfer in these mitochondria is well coupled to the generation of a protonmotive force. Fig. 2Areveals that the respiratory activity exhibited by mitochondria containing the wild-type AOX is partially resistant to antimycin A (â¼18% of the NADH-dependent rate). This antimycin-resistant respiratory rate is inhibited by the addition of octyl-gallate, demonstrating that it is due to AOX activity, confirming earlier observations made in nonpurified mitochondria (11Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Google Scholar, 12Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Google Scholar). Fig. 2also shows that mitochondria isolated from cells containing the mutant oxidases exhibit relatively little (E270N; Fig. 2B) and almost no (E217A; Fig. 2C) antimycin-resistant respiratory activity (â¼6 and 2% of the respective NADH-dependent rates). Western blot analysis indicates that the AOX protein is expressed in all three types of cells (Fig. 2D). The intensity of the immunoreactive bands indicates that wild-type, E270N, and E217A forms of the AOX are expressed in amounts that are not significantly different and therefore that lack of AOX activity observed with the mutants is not due to lack of protein expression. These results demonstrate that the mutation of either Glu-217 or Glu-270 results in the loss of AOX activity, suggesting that both residues are equally essential for AOX activity.Figure 2Respiratory and Western analyses of Percoll-purified S. pombe mitochondria.Mitochondria were prepared from cells containing the wild-type AOX (A), the E270N mutant (B), or the E217A mutant (C).

From these results, it would seem that both the coupled and uncoupled NADH-dependent activities of the E217A mutant are slightly lower than those of the wild type and indeed of all the mutants studied. Although close scrutiny of the data would suggest that this observation is statistically not significant, a possible reason for the potential variations is, at present, unclear.Table IRespiratory activity of Percoll-purified S. pombe mitochondria containing a wild-type or mutated AOX proteinNADHCCCPAARateS.D.RateS.D.RateS.D.nmol O2/min/mg proteinWild type22381 (28, 6)373137 (15, 6)4115 (13, 3)E270N16227 (5, 2)33277 (5, 2)6.71.4 (5, 2)E217A12831 (5, 2)21645 (5, 2)1.71.5 (5, 2)C172A17915 (3, 1)39925 (3, 1)339 (2, 1)Y253F17041 (21, 6)35299 (7, 6)4913 (14, 3)Y275F18269 (9, 3)29119 (9, 3)2.41.7 (10, 3)Activity was determined upon the subsequent addition of 1.8 mm NADH, 2 Î¼m carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and 3.5 Î¼mantimycin A (AA).

Open table in a new tab In an attempt to determine if mutagenesis per se results in an inactive enzyme, which would invalidate the data shown in Fig. 2 and Table I, Cys-172, a highly conserved residue located in the N-terminal region of the protein, was mutated to alanine. Previous mutation of the corresponding cysteine in plant AOX sequences has been shown not to have any deleterious effect on AOX activity (24Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Yip J.Y.H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1551-1560Google Scholar, 25Rhoads D.M. Umbach A.L. Sweet C.R. Lennon A.M. Rauch G.S. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30750-30756Google Scholar), and we considered this a suitable residue to act as a control. It is clear from Table Ithat upon mutation of Cys-172, the AOX is indeed still fully active as reflected by a mitochondrial antimycin-resistant respiratory activity of 33 nmol of O2/min/mg of protein, which is not significantly different from wild-type activity. Such an observation confirms that site-directed mutagenesis per se does not result in an inactive enzyme, and we therefore consider the data presented in Table I a valid indication of the importance of the studied residues for the structure and mechanism of the AOX.In the Moore et al. (6Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Google Scholar) model, a conserved tyrosine residue, Tyr-253, that is situated at the base of one of the transmembrane helices was proposed to be involved in quinone binding. In this respect, an additional tyrosine residue, Tyr-275, has also been identified as of potential importance by Berthold et al.(10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar). Table I shows that cells expressing the AOX protein in which Tyr-253 was mutated to phenylalanine exhibit a mitochondrial antimycin-resistant respiratory activity that is comparable with that of the wild type. However, in cells expressing a protein in which Tyr-275 was mutated to phenylalanine, such activity is barely detectable (Table I). Western blot analysis indicates that the Y253F and Y275F AOX proteins are expressed in equal amounts (data not shown).DISCUSSIONDespite significant advances in our understanding of the AOX, the enzyme has proved difficult to purify to homogeneity and is elusive to spectroscopic analyses. However, progress in the characterization of the AOX has included isolation of cDNA sequences from a number of species, which has led to the development of two hypothetical models of the AOX (5Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Google Scholar, 6Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Google Scholar, 7Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Google Scholar). Although both models classify the AOX as a member of the di-iron carboxylate family of proteins, the major difference between them concerns the topology of the enzyme within the inner mitochondrial membrane. In this paper, we have presented data obtained from studies in which an array of site-directed AOX mutants was expressed in S. pombe, a functional expression system that is highly suited to study AOX activity in situ (11Albury M.S. Dudley P. Watts F.Z. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17062-17066Google Scholar, 12Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Google Scholar, 26Affourtit C. Albury M.S. Krab K. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6212-6218Google Scholar). Importantly, our results provide the first experimental information to distinguish between the two structural models and, furthermore, provide insights into the possible roles of two highly conserved tyrosine residues.From Fig. 2C it is evident that mutation of Glu-217 to alanine produces an inactive AOX, strongly suggesting that Glu-217 is essential for activity. This result has major implications as to the plausibility of the two structural models. Siedow et al. (5Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Google Scholar,6Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Google Scholar) implicitly suggested that Glu-217 would be located at the cytoplasmic side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Since both reduction of oxygen and oxidation of ubiquinol were proposed to occur toward the matrix side of the membrane, it is hard to envisage how Glu-217 would play a functional role in such a model. In contrast, Glu-217 plays a key role in the coordination of the di-iron center in the Andersson and Nordlund model (7Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Google Scholar) (it bridges the iron atoms). Our result, therefore, supports the latter model, which would imply that the AOX is indeed an interfacial membrane protein associated with the matrix side of the membrane. Analysis of AOX sequences, using the membrane protein topology prediction method that was recently reported by Krogh et al. (27Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Google Scholar), corroborates this notion. Although two relatively hydrophobic regions were identified in the primary structure of the AOX, these were considered, based on the algorithm's stringent criteria (27Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Google Scholar), not to be membrane-spanning (data not shown).Following the identification of the Im gene, 19 amino acid residues appeared totally conserved between the AOX and PTOX sequences (10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar). Berthold et al. (10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar) focused upon these totally conserved residues as additional evidence in support of the Andersson and Nordlund model. However, certain regions of significant homology in AOX sequences are absent in the PTOX sequences. For example, three glutamate residues (Glu-268, Glu-269, and Glu-270) are completely conserved in all AOX sequences examined to date, but only one glutamate (Glu-268) is present in the PTOX. In the Andersson and Nordlund model, Glu-270 plays no essential role, since it was suggested not to be part of the ligation sphere. In contrast, the results presented in this paper, in addition to our previous publication (12Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Google Scholar) and along with the mutation of the Trypanosome AOX (13Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Google Scholar), would suggest that Glu-270 is an important residue. If it is the case that Glu-270 does not ligate iron, then the only likely way that mutation of Glu-270 could affect AOX activity is by disrupting the structural stability of the active site because of its proximity to the di-iron center. However, we have previously shown that, like the wild-type AOX, the E270N mutant is correctly targeted and integrated within the inner mitochondrial membrane (12Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Google Scholar). As argued previously (12Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Google Scholar), it is highly unlikely that an incorrectly folded protein would be targeted and integrated in such a successful manner. Based on Fig. 2, it can therefore be concluded that Glu-217 is required for activity of the AOX, supporting the proposal by Andersson and Nordlund that the protein is interfacial. However, the lack of activity of the E270N mutant AOX would suggest that the detailed ligation sphere proposed by these authors is not necessarily the correct one for all species.With the identification of the Im gene and its homology to the AOX, it may be tempting to focus totally on the conserved residues between these two distantly related proteins. Equally, focusing on theIm gene may have the effect of grouping all AOX and PTOX proteins into a single category, which may not be advisable. Umbach and Siedow (28Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 234-245Google Scholar) suggest that there appear to be two general types of AOX sequences in plants and fungi. From sequence comparisons, they have demonstrated that Im contains neither a domain present in plants, surrounding the regulatory cysteine, nor a fungus-specific sequence (28Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 234-245Google Scholar). Hence, there may be subtle differences between AOX sequences from different species with roles not yet identified, and it is therefore interesting to speculate that there could be two or more classes of AOX and that possibly Im belongs to a third group. We feel that one should be cautious in the classification of all of the AOX proteins (plants, algae, protist, and fungi) together with the PTOX as one group. Whereas the overall structure of the enzyme, including its active site, might be conserved, subtle species-specific differences as to the exact ligation sphere of the di-iron center may exist.The structure of several enzymes that interact with quinone/quinol have been determined to atomic resolution (14Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Google Scholar, 15Allen J.P. Feher G. Yeates T.O. Komiya H. Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8487-8491Google Scholar, 29Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Google Scholar). However, this has not yet led to the elucidation of a universal structure of a quinone-binding site. Several features that might generally be important in quinone binding have nevertheless been suggested. For example, mapping of the quinone-binding site in complex III has resulted in a model analogous to quinone sites in photosynthetic reaction centers in which the quinone-binding pocket is formed by the ends of two transmembrane helices (30Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Google Scholar). Aromatic residues have also been identified near quinone-binding regions where the aromatic ring may interact with the quinone head group in a parallel manner (15Allen J.P. Feher G. Yeates T.O. Komiya H. Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8487-8491Google Scholar, 31Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Rees D.C. Soltis S.M. Abresch E. Feher G. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Google Scholar). Tyr-253, originally identified in the model proposed by Moore et al. (6Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Google Scholar) as situated at the base of the transmembrane helices, has been proposed to be involved in quinone binding. In the Andersson and Nordlund model, Tyr-253 is located in a hydrophobic crevice that could potentially form a quinone-binding site (7Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Google Scholar, 10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar). However, it is important to recognize that this residue could have other functions. Reactive tyrosines are important in a number of enzyme activities including photosystem II (32Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Science. 1997; 277: 1953-1956Google Scholar) and cytochrome oxidase (33Proshlyakov D.A. Pressler M.A. DeMaso C. Leykam J.F. DeWitt D.L. Babcock G.T. Science. 2000; 290: 1588-1591Google Scholar, 34Ostermeier C. Harrenga A. Ermler U. Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10547-10553Google Scholar). Modification of bacterial reaction centers to mimic photosystem II indicates that, after mutation to tyrosines, these substituted residues could participate in radical formation (35Kalman L. LoBrutto R. Allen J.P. Williams J.C. Nature. 1999; 402: 696-699Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that, in addition to a role in quinone binding, Tyr-253 could provide a tyrosyl radical involved in electron transport or, alternatively, may play a structural role (10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar). Our results appear to rule out one of the possible roles for Tyr-253, namely a role in electron transport, since its mutation to phenylalanine does not result in any loss of catalytic activity. However, based on the data in this report, it is not possible yet to say whether Tyr-253 has a role in quinone binding or some structural role. Preliminary results from our laboratory suggest that both the wild-type and the Y253F mutated AOX exhibit similar sensitivities to the phenolic inhibitors salicylhydroxamic acid and octyl-gallate. 2P. G. Crichton, C. Affourtit, M. S. Albury, and A. L. Moore, unpublished observations. This may indicate that Tyr-253 is not involved in quinone binding. It should be emphasized, however, that our steady-state oxygen consumption measurements lack the time resolution to conclusively exclude a role for Tyr-253 in the binding and/or oxidation of ubiquinol.The proposal that Tyr-253 could play a role in quinone binding was originally based on a limited amount of sequence data (6Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Google Scholar). However, examination of the currently available sequences reveals that this residue is totally conserved among all AOX and even the PTOX sequences. Recently, a computer search of respiratory and photosynthetic complexes that react with quinones has resulted in the identification of a putative quinone-binding motif, consisting of a triad element and a His-Arg pair, which may be present, although weakly conserved, in the AOX (36Fisher N. Rich P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1153-1162Google Scholar). The proposed quinone-binding role of Tyr-253 is all the more intriguing, since this residue is situated close to the His-Arg pair. Furthermore, Tyr-253 is in close proximity to residues that have been identified through inhibitor (salicylhydroxamic acid) resistance screens, as of importance in quinone binding (37Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Google Scholar).As discussed previously, tyrosine residues could fulfill a number of roles, and, interestingly, several conserved tyrosine residues are present in the AOX. These include Tyr-266, Tyr-275, and Tyr-299, all of which are highly conserved, although Tyr-266 and Tyr-299 not fully across all species. Tyr-266 has been replaced by a phenylalanine inChlamydomonas reinhardtii and by a cysteine in all of the PTOX sequences. Tyr-299 is conserved in the PTOX and in all AOX sequences except the Trypanosome sequence. Apart from Tyr-253, Tyr-275 is the only tyrosine residue that is present in all available AOX and PTOX sequences. Interestingly, the Andersson and Nordlund model places Tyr-275 in close spacial proximity to the di-iron center (10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar). The results presented in Table I show that mutation of Tyr-275 results in an inactive AOX, suggesting that Tyr-275, unlike Tyr-253, is essential for AOX activity and is potentially involved in electron transport.Based on the proposed reaction mechanisms of MMOH (the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase) and the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (cf. Ref. 38Wallar B.J. Lipscomb J.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2625-2657Google Scholar), two mechanisms have been put forward for the catalytic cycle of the AOX (10Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Google Scholar, 39Affourtit C. Albury M.S. Whitehouse D.G. Moore A.L. Pest Manag. Sci. 2000; 56: 31-38Google Scholar), neither of which predicts involvement of a reactive tyrosine residue. Our results are the first to suggest such a role, which is not without precedence in oxidase activity (40Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12971-12973Goo"

A 32-kDa PKC-binding protein was purified to homogeneity from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction obtained from hepatocytes homogenates. The protein was identified by NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing as the previously described mature form of p32 (gC1qR). Recombinant p32 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, affinity-purified, and tested for an in vitro interaction with PKC using an overlay assay approach. All PKC isoforms expressed in rat hepatocytes interacted in vitro with p32, but the binding dependence on PKC activators was different for each one. Whereas PKCÎ´ only binds to p32 in the presence of PKC activators, PKCÎ¶ and PKCÎ± increase their binding when they are in the activated form. Other PKC isoforms such as Î², Îµ, and Î¸ bind equally well to p32 regardless of the presence of PKC activators, and PKCÎ¼ binds even better in their absence. It was also found that p32 is not a substrate for any of the PKC isoforms tested, but interestingly, its presence had a stimulatory effect (2-fold for PKCÎ´) on PKC activity. We also observed in vivo interaction between PKC and p32 by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. A time course of phorbol ester treatment of cultured rat hepatocytes (C9 cells) showed that PKCÎ¸ and p32 are constitutively associated in vivo, whereas PKCÎ´ activation is required for its association with p32. Our data also showed that phorbol ester treatment induces a transient translocation of p32 from the cytoplasm to the cell nucleus.

Based on structural characteristics that determine differences in their lipid and calcium binding properties, PKC are divided into three groups: conventional, novel, and atypical PKC (2Toker A.

These differences do not, however, adequately account for the isozyme specificity observed in vivo, because overlapping specificity of these kinases is commonly observed in vitro. On the other hand, the study of PKC function is complicated by the existence of many isoforms within the same cellular type that redistribute from soluble to membrane-bound intracellular compartments as a result of their activation (3Parker P.J.

Given the dynamic nature of protein phosphorylation reactions, coordinated control of both kinases and phosphatases is often required. Cells seem to have solved this problem by utilizing anchoring proteins that bind to subcellular structures and localize their complement of enzymes/adaptor proteins close to their sites of action. Indeed, genetic, biochemical, and cell-based screens have revealed a heterogeneous group of PKC-binding proteins that can influence its subcellular localization, substrate availability, exposure to allosteric activators, and activation-dependent relocation within cells.

Originally, p32 was characterized as a component of the AS/SF2 splicing activity purified from HeLa cells (20Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that the molecule interacts with several cellular and viral proteins that participate in mitochondrial function (21Matthews D.A. Russell W.C. J. Gen.

Virology. 2000; 275: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since the original study, it has become apparent that p32 is an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic protein. Homologous genes have been identified in a number of eukaryotic species ranging from fungi to mammals. Recently, the interaction of p32 with PKCÎ¼ has been reported (25Storz P. Hausser A. Link G. Dedio J. Ghebrehiwet B. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24601-24607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the B cell line SKW 6.4, p32 appears to function as a compartment-specific negative regulator of the kinase activity of PKCÎ¼. Here we present evidence that p32 interacts in vitro with all PKC isoforms expressed in rat hepatocytes and stimulates PKC activity. We also show that PKCÎ¸ and p32 are constitutively associated in vivoand that treatment of intact cells with phorbol ester promotes p32-PKCÎ´ in vivo interaction and a transient redistribution of p32 to the cell nucleus. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, histone H1-IIIS, phosphatidylserine, Triton X-100, and 1,2-diolein were from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose and Ro 31â8220 were from Calbiochem, and DEAE-cellulose (DE-52) was from Whatman. [Î³-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. To obtain polyclonal antisera against p32, New Zealand rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 100 Î¼g of recombinant GST-p32 fusion protein in 500 Î¼l of PBS plus 1 volume of complete (or incomplete for boosts) Freund's adjuvant. Three further immunizations were done before the rabbits were bled. Isozyme-specific polyclonal antibodies against the COOH terminus of PKC isozymes were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Monoclonal antibodies against PKCÎ¸ and PKCÎ´ were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Becton Dickinson). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was from Bio-Rad. FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Hepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats (200â250 g) by the method of Berry and Friend (26Berry M.N. Friend D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence studies, C9 cells (a rat hepatocyte line obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in F12K medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% veal serum (with iron), 1% insulin (Humulin*R, from Lilly) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (10000 units/Î¼g/ml, from Invitro) and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air at 37 Â°C. p32 was purified to homogeneity from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of rat hepatocytes homogenates as described previously (27Robles-Flores M. RendÃ³n-Huerta E. GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡inz J.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal sequence analysis was carried out on purified protein electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with a model LF3000 protein sequencer (Beckman) using chemicals and software supplied by the manufacturer. The digoxigenin glycan detection kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The principle of this technique is that adjacent hydroxyl groups in sugars of glycoconjugates are oxidized to aldehyde groups by mild periodate treatment. The spacer-linked steroid hapten digoxigenin is then covalently attached to these aldehydes via a hydrazide group. Digoxigenin-labeled glycoconjugates are subsequently detected in an enzyme immunoassay using a digoxigenin-specific antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. A clone encoding p32(gC1q-R), derived from a mouse embryo cDNA library, was found by searching the EST (expressed sequence tag) data base (IMAGE clone 478889, GenBankTM accession number AA048814). This plasmid was purchased from Research Genetics Inc., and the nucleotide sequence of its insert was determined by the chain termination method (28Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roc B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). For the construction of the GST-p32 fusion protein, the 618-bp fragment resulting from EcoRI (SI nuclease trimmed) andDraI digestion of the p32 cDNA was subcloned at theSmaI site of the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The proper orientation of the subcloned insert was verified by restriction digests, and the correct in-frame insertion was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Expression of the GST-p32 fusion protein was done in the protease-deficient BL21 strain of Escherichia coli (Novagen, Madison, WI), and its affinity purification was performed as described by Smith and Corcoran (29Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 16.7.1-16.7.8Google Scholar). PKC was purified as described previously (30Robles-Flores M. AlcÃ¡ntara-HernÃ¡ndez R. GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡inz J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, hepatocytes were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor), incubated at 4 Â°C for 30 min, and centrifuged. Portions of the supernatant were applied to DEAE-cellulose columns that had been equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 4 Â°C. After a washing with column buffer, total PKC was eluted with column buffer containing 0.25m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor. The eluate was concentrated with an Amicon device (YM-30 membrane) and used for overlay assays. PKC binding was determined as described previously (16Robles-Flores M. GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡inz J.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, sample protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA. Partially purified and concentrated PKC (100â200 units; 1 unit is defined as 1 pmol of 32P transferred from [Î³-32P]ATP to histone/min/mg of protein; final protein concentration, 0.5 mg/ml) was incubated for 1 h at 30 Â°C with the nitrocellulose strips in blotting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% polyethylene glycol, and 0.2m NaCl) in the presence of cofactors (20 Î¼g/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.8 Î¼g/ml 1,2-diolein, and 1 mmCaCl2). The PKC/blotting buffer mixture was removed, and the membranes were washed three times with blotting buffer. Bound PKC was detected using isozyme-specific anti-PKC antibodies and secondary goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Quantification of binding was performed by densitometric analysis using an Image Densitometer (BioRad GS-670). This assay was performed as described elsewhere (18RendÃ³n-Huerta E. Mendoza-HernÃ¡ndez G. Robles-Flores M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of 1 ml of partially purified and concentrated PKC (1 mg/ml) in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 11 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.2 mg/ml phosphoserine) and in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol were incubated at 4 Â°C with 1 Î¼g/ml isozyme-specific PKC antibody for 1 h with gentle shaking. Then, 20 Î¼l of protein A-Sepharose (30%, Calbiochem) were added, and incubation was continued for 1 h. Immune complexes were then washed three times with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.6m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.3) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol). Kinase activity was initiated by resuspending the immunoprecipitates in 50 Î¼l of assay mixture (kinase buffer plus 20 Î¼g/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.8 Î¼g/ml 1,2-diolein, 10 Î¼m [Î³-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), and 200 Î¼g/ml of protein substrate (histone H1-IIIS or recombinant GST-p32)). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 Â°C, terminated by the addition of 50 Î¼l of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Data were quantified by densitometric analysis performed both in Coomassie-stained gels and the corresponding autoradiographies. The ratio of32P-labeled protein/dyed protein represents the total specific phosphorylation. C9 monolayers grown on glass coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with methanol at â20 Â°C for 10 min, and permeabilized for 3 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were washed 5 times with PBS and then blocked for 30 min with 1% IgG-free BSA (Research Organics). The monolayers were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with a polyclonal antiserum against p32 and with monoclonal antibody against PKCÎ´ or PKCÎ¸. After washing 5 times with PBS, the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies (FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and TRITC-conjugated goat anti mouse). The monolayers on the glass coverslips were mounted with the antifade reagent Vectashield (Vector laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). The fluorescence of the monolayers was examined using a confocal microscope (MRC-600, Bio-Rad) with a krypton argon laser. We have previously reported the existence of at least seven proteins that bind PKC in rat hepatocytes (16Robles-Flores M. GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡inz J.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, we developed a rapid and simple purification method for these proteins taking advantage of their ability to precipitate with Triton X-100 (27Robles-Flores M. RendÃ³n-Huerta E. GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡inz J.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have employed this protocol to isolate a protein from the Triton-insoluble fraction of rat hepatocyte homogenates (Fig.1 A, lane 1) by DEAE-cellulose chromatography followed by a second precipitation step with Triton X-100 and by electroelution (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The aim of the present study was to identify the isolated PKC-binding protein by NH2-terminal sequencing and to characterize its interaction with PKC. As shown in Fig. 1 A, we purified to homogeneity a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa. The purified protein was electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis. The sequence LHTEGDKAFVEFLTDEIKEE was obtained and was subsequently aligned with nonredundant SwissProt data base sequences. As shown on Fig. 1 B, we found an almost perfect match with the NH2 terminus of the mature chain of human pre-mRNA splicing factor SF2 p32 subunit originally characterized by Kraineret al. (20Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). As can be seen, 17 of 20 amino acids in the query were identical to this protein (85%), and the remaining three were conservative changes (100% positive). Subsequent reports have shown that p32 is dispensable for general splicing activity (31Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) and have instead described it as a receptor of complement component C1q (19Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.-L. Peerschke E.I.B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and as a multiligand protein (21Matthews D.A. Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Muta T. Kang D. Kitajima S. Fujiwara T. Hamasaki N. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24601-24607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, alignment of our found sequence with the conceptual rat cDNA translated sequence reported by Lynch et al. (33Lynch N.J. Reid K.B.M. Van den Berg R.H. Daha M.R. Leigh L.A.F. Ghebrehiwet B. Lim W.B.L. Schwaeble J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 11-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) gave a perfect match with the gC1qBP, which represents the rat homologue protein of human SF2 p32 subunit (see Fig. 1 B). p32/gC1q-BP is a single-chain, highly acidic protein (pI 4.15) with a calculated mass of 23.8 kDa that differs substantially from the apparent size of 32 kDa. This is, however, not unprecedented, because discrepancies between real sizes and those determined by gel electrophoresis are often described for highly charged proteins and may be caused by the reduced binding of SDS to such proteins (32HonorÃ© B. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J. Gene. 1993; 134: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the presence of carbohydrates on proteins also contributes to the production of an abnormal relative electrophoresis mobilization. Because the primary sequence of p32 predicts three putativeN-linked glycosylation sites, we proceeded to search for their presence in p32. The purified protein was subjected to carbohydrate analysis with the digoxigenin detection kit as described under âExperimental Procedures.â As observed in Fig. 1 C(lane 2), p32 gave and even better carbohydrate signal than the positive control ovalbumin (lane 3), indicating therefore that p32 is a glycosylated protein. p32 cDNA was obtained from a clone derived from a mouse embryonic cDNA library (Research Genetics Inc). As Fig.2 A shows, the nucleotide sequence of this cDNA contains a complete reading frame encoding a 279-residue protein that shows minor discrepancies with the one reported by Lynch et al. (33Lynch N.J. Reid K.B.M. Van den Berg R.H. Daha M.R. Leigh L.A.F. Ghebrehiwet B. Lim W.B.L. Schwaeble J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 11-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Differences occur at residue 11 (Ala instead of Ser) and at residue 160 (Leu instead of Arg). Additionally, our sequence has three alanines (residues 14â16), instead of only two as reported by Lynch et al. (33Lynch N.J. Reid K.B.M. Van den Berg R.H. Daha M.R. Leigh L.A.F. Ghebrehiwet B. Lim W.B.L. Schwaeble J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 11-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) at the same position. The âmatureâ form of the protein corresponding to residues 74â279 presumably is generated by site-specific cleavage and removal of the highly basic 73-residue-long NH2-terminal segment during post-translational processing. The 618-bp fragment resulting from the EcoRI (SI nuclease trimmed) and DraI digestion of the plasmid containing p32 cDNA was subcloned in the pGEX2T vector. The resulting GST-fusion protein includes from Leu 84 up to the end of the open reading frame. Fig. 2 B (lane 2) shows the affinity purified GST-p32 fusion protein from BL21 E. coli extracts in which expression had been induced with 0.4 mm IPTG for 2.5 h (lane 1). As observed, GST-p32 fusion protein co-migrates with the 49.3-kDa marker in SDS-PAGE in accordance with the expected mass calculated from the GST moiety (27.5 kDa) and the encoded cDNA (22.3 kDa). The purified GST-p32 fusion protein was then used to produce a polyclonal antibody as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Fig. 2 C shows the Western blots performed with pre-immune and immune sera. The antibody specifically recognized both recombinant GST-p32 fusion protein (lane 2) and p32 present in the Triton-insoluble fraction derived from rat hepatocyte homogenates (lane 3) but barely recognized the GST moiety of the fusion protein (lane 1). With pre-immune serum the fusion protein remained undetectable. Rat hepatocytes express seven PKC isoenzymes (18RendÃ³n-Huerta E. Mendoza-HernÃ¡ndez G. Robles-Flores M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are co-eluted by DEAE-cellulose chromatography: two conventional isoforms (Î± and Î²II), four novel isoforms (Î´, Îµ, Î¸, and Î¼), and one atypical isoform (Î¶). To explore which PKC isozyme binds to p32, we made use of this partly purified PKC extract as a probe in an overlay assay. Fig.3 A shows the Western blot analysis of the PKC preparation used, indicating that similar relative amounts of each PKC isoform were present in the overlay assay. Moreover, Fig. 3 B (upper and lower) clearly indicate that all of the PKC isozymes tested bind to purified recombinant GST-p32. The binding is not due to secondary antibody interactions, and it is specific for p32 because no PKC became associated to other proteins such as BSA or GST alone under the conditions employed (see upper portion of Fig.3 B). The typical PKC substrate, histone H1, which associates with all PKC isoforms, served as the positive control (Fig.3 B, top). The data also indicate that p32 does not interact with all PKC isoforms in the same way, because dependence of the binding on PKC cofactors (phosphatidylserine, 1,2-diolein, and calcium) differs for each PKC isoform. Quantification of binding data, presented in Fig. 3 C, demonstrates that whereas PKCÎ´ is capable of binding p32 only in its activated conformation, other isozymes like PKC Î± and Î¶, although interacting better with p32 in a cofactor-dependent manner, can also bind to p32 in their absence. On the other hand, the association between p32 and PKC Î², Îµ, and Î¸ is equally efficient regardless of the presence of PKC activators, but it seems that PKCÎ¼ can bind p32 with great affinity in their absence. In summary, independence of binding to p32 on PKC activators ranges as follows: PKCÎ¼ >>> Î²,Îµ,Î¸ > Î± > Î¶ â« Î´. To explore whether p32 is an in vitrosubstrate for several PKC isoforms, we used PKC isozyme-specific immune complexes to measure their phosphorylation activity toward GST-p32 in comparison with a typical PKC substrate, histone H1 III-S. Fig.4 A shows a representative autoradiography with its corresponding dried and Coomassie Blue-stained gel. As can be observed, whereas histone H1 was efficiently phosphorylated (only that phosphorylated by PKCÎ¸ is shown, but identical results were obtained with the other immunoprecipitated PKC isozymes), p32 was not phosphorylated by any PKC isoform tested, because the band corresponding to GST-p32 present in the Coomassie Blue-stained gel is absent at the same position in the autoradiography. It can also be seen that other proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with PKC were also phosphorylated. We analyzed the immunoprecipitates with anti-PKC antibodies (results not shown) and observed that the two more prominent bands observed in the autoradiography at 55 kDa corresponded to the catalytic fragment of PKC. The identity of the other faint bands is unknown. In addition, because it has been recently reported that p32 inhibits PKCÎ¼ aldolase phosphorylation in vitro (25Storz P. Hausser A. Link G. Dedio J. Ghebrehiwet B. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24601-24607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we performed the assay in the absence or presence of p32 and in the absence or presence of the selective and potent PKC inhibitor Ro 31â8220. The upper portion of Fig.4 B shows a representative example of the results obtained with PKCÎ¸ and the lower portion those with PKCÎ´. We selected these isoforms on the basis of the strong in vitrointeraction observed with p32 in a cofactor-dependent or -independent manner, respectively, but similar results were obtained with the other five PKC isozymes expressed in rat hepatocytes (not shown). In Fig. 4 C are presented the quantitative data of several experiments. As can be observed, whereas PKCÎ¸ showed 1.5-fold activation in the presence of p32, PKCÎ´ was activated 2-fold (indicated with a black arrow in Fig. 4 B), because histone H1 phosphorylation increased in the presence of p32 in comparison with the obtained in its absence (see empty arr"
https://openalex.org/W2156532107,"Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4, previously named protein phosphatase X (PPX)), a PP2A-related serine/threonine phosphatase, has been shown to be involved in essential cellular processes, such as microtubule growth and nuclear factor ÎºB activation. We provide evidence that PP4 is involved in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± signaling in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. Treatment of HEK293T cells with TNF-Î± resulted in time-dependent activation of endogenous PP4, peaking at 10 min, as well as increased serine and threonine phosphorylation of PP4. We also found that PP4 is involved in relaying the TNF-Î± signal to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as indicated by the ability of PP4-RL, a dominant-negative PP4 mutant, to block TNF-Î±-induced JNK activation. Moreover, the response of JNK to TNF-Î± was inhibited in HEK293 cells stably expressing PP4-RL in comparison to parental HEK293 cells. The involvement of PP4 in JNK signaling was further demonstrated by the specific activation of JNK, but not p38 and ERK2, by PP4 in transient transfection assays. However, no direct PP4-JNK interaction was detected, suggesting that PP4 exerts its positive regulatory effect on JNK in an indirect manner. Taken together, these data indicate that PP4 is a signaling component of the JNK cascade and involved in relaying the TNF-Î± signal to the JNK pathway.

A major mechanism by which cells regulate protein function is to add or remove phosphate groups on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The steady-state level of phosphorylation and, thus, the strength and duration of the signal transmitted are balanced by the opposing actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases (1Hunter T.

MAPK activation involves sequential protein kinase reactions within a three-kinase module (MAP3K-MAP2K-MAPK), whereby a MAP3K phosphorylates and activates a MAP2K, a dual-specificity kinase, that then phosphorylates and activates a MAPK (7Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 8Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In vivo MAPK phosphorylation is a reversible process, indicating that protein phosphatases provide an additional level of regulation of MAPKs. In fact, the magnitude and duration of MAPK activation are tightly controlled by the coordinate actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. A large number of mammalian MAPK phosphatases have been identified, including dual-specificity phosphatases and tyrosine-specific phosphatases (11Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 12Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). There is evidence that serine/threonine-specific phosphatases also regulate MAPKs (13Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MAPK phosphatases inactivate MAPKs by directly dephosphorylating both threonine and tyrosine residues of MAPKs (12Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The coordinate regulation by protein kinases and phosphatases also occurs at many other points within the three-kinase module. For example, MKP-1, a dual-specificity phosphatase, inhibits ERK, but positively regulates Raf-1 and MKK in an ERK-independent manner (15Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1788-1793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PP2A also acts on multiple components of the ERK pathway (12Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin.

Cohen P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PP4 is highly conserved during evolution, with human and Drosophila PP4 sharing 91% amino acid identity (16Brewis N.D. Cohen P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PP4 is localized at the centrosomes in mammalian cells and Drosophila embryos, and that PP4 is involved in the regulation of microtubule growth/organization at centrosomes (17Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Hastie C.J. Carnegie G.K. Morrice N. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that PP4 interacts with members of the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) family (such as c-Rel, p50, and RelA), stimulates the DNA binding activity of c-Rel, and activates NF-ÎºB-mediated transcription (19Hu M.C.-T. Tang-Oxley Q. Qiu W.R. Wang Y.-P. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. Afshar R. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33561-33565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of PP4 suggests that PP4 may be involved in many more essential cellular processes and is tightly controlled in vivo. It has been shown that PP4 is carboxymethylated (20Kloeker S. Bryant J.C. Strack S. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three potential regulatory subunits have been identified for PP4: Î±4 (21Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In an effort to further investigate the cellular function of PP4, we found that PP4 acts as a specific positive regulator for the JNK pathway and that PP4 is required to relay the TNF-Î± signal to the JNK pathway.

Human HeLa cells, human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) and 293 (HEK293) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml streptomycin/penicillin at 37 Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK293T cells were plated at a density of either 1.5 Ã 105 cells/35-mm plate well or 1.0 Ã 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected the next day using the modified calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (Specialty Media, Inc., Lavallette, NJ). Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Î²-galactosidase (0.15 Î¼g) in combination with an empty vector or various amounts of plasmids encoding phosphatases, phosphatase mutants, kinases, or kinase mutants as indicated in the figure legends. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunocomplex kinase assays were performed as described previously (28Wang W. Zhou G., Hu, M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

Western blot analysis was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). HEK293T cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 Î¼m p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin. Endogenous PP4 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PP4 (Ab104) antibody. Overexpressed Flag-PP4 and HA-PP4-RL were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag (M2) and anti-HA (12CA5) antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 500 mm NaCl. Phosphatase assays were performed using Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit 1, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 4 Î¼m KTpIRR peptide in 40 Î¼l of assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMnCl2) at 30 Â°C for 30 min (unless otherwise indicated in the figure legend). Buffer plus peptide was used as a negative control. The immunoprecipitates were then pelleted, and the assay buffer was transferred to a 96-well, half-volume plate. The assay was terminated by the addition of 100 Î¼l of Malachite Green solution (one volume of 4.2% (w/v) ammonium molybdate in 4 m HCl, three volumes of 0.045% (w/v) Malachite Green in water, and 1 Î¼l/ml 10% Tween 20 added fresh). After 15 min at room temperature, the assay was read at 650 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Bioassay Reader (HTS 7000 Plus). GST and GST-SAPK fusion protein were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads equilibrated in incubation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates (600 Î¼g) from HEK293 cells stably transfected with Flag-PP4 or HEK293T cells transiently transfected with Myc-M3/6 were incubated with GST-JNK fusion protein or GST-4T-Sepharose beads in incubation buffer containing 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 Â°C for 2 h. The beads were washed five times with the incubation buffer, boiled in a SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5 min, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then subjected to Western blotting with an anti-Flag (M2) or an anti-Myc antibody. The membrane was then stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) and reprobed with an anti-GST antibody. Centrosomes were purified from HeLa cells by a standard protocol (32Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J.

Briefly, 6 Ã 107 HeLa cells were incubated with 0.2 Î¼mnocodazole and 1 Î¼g/ml cytochalasin D at 37 Â°C for 60 min. After trypsinization, the cells were pelleted and washed one time with 1Ã TBS (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl) and one time with 0.1Ã TBS + 8% sucrose. The cells were then resuspended in 2 ml of 0.1Ã TBS + 8% sucrose and lysed by adding 8 ml of fractionation lysis buffer (1 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Î²-mercaptoethanol, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 1 mm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.5 mm NaF). The lysate was spun at 2,500 Ã g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and spun again at 2,500 Ã g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube through a 70-Î¼m nylon filter (Falcon 2350). The resulting supernatant was incubated with 10 mm HEPES and 1 Î¼g/ml DNase on ice for 30 min, transferred to a 15-ml ultracentrifuge tube, underlaid with 1 ml of 60% sucrose in sucrose dilution buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 7.2), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% Î²-mercaptoethanol), and spun at 10,000 Ãg for 1.5 h. The bottom 3 ml was transferred to a new tube containing a discontinuous 40/50/70% sucrose gradient in sucrose dilution buffer. After spinning at 120,000 Ã g for 1.5 h, 0.5-ml fractions from the top were taken and diluted to 1 ml with 0.5 ml of PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2). After mixing, the solution was spun at 15,000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PEM buffer and spun at 15,000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge for 30 min. The final pellet containing centrosomes was washed twice with PEM buffer and then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with 5% Î²-mercaptoethanol. As recently described in detail (34Van Hooser A. Brinkley W.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), cells were grown on coverslips and the coverslips were washed in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 min and fixed in cold 4% ultrapure formaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc.) in PEM buffer (80 mm K-PIPES (pH 7.0), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2) for 10â20 min. For the immunofluorescence of Î²-tubulin, 4% polyethylene glycol was added to PEM buffer during the permeabilization and fixation steps. After they were fixed, the coverslips were washed with PEM buffer and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer for 30 min. Then, the coverslips were washed with PEM buffer and blocked in 2.5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight. The next day, the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C with primary antibodies diluted in TBST, washed in TBST, and incubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C with secondary antibodies diluted in 1:200 in TBST. After washing in TBST, coverslips were counterstained with 0.4 Î¼g/ml 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in TBST and mounted with VectashieldÂ® antifade medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or ProLong antifade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The figures are composite images obtained with a Deltavision, deconvolution-based optical work station (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Z-series stacks of multiple focal planes were used to render three-dimensional volumes. HEK293 cells were grown in complete DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 12.5 mmHEPES, 50 Î¼g/ml gentamycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). We transfected the HEK293 cells with Flag-PP4 by the Fugene 6 method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transfected cells were selected by Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen) at a concentration of 750 Î¼g/ml or 1 mg/ml. The cells were replated at a 1:15 dilution whenever they reached 80% confluence. After 10â14 days, the T-75 flasks were trypsinized, and the drug-resistant cells were replated at a limiting dilution to obtain independent clones. Each clone was tested for Flag-PP4 expression by Western blotting. A similar approach was used to establish an HEK293 cell line stably expressing HA-PP4-RL. HEK293T cells (1 Ã 106 cells in 100-mm dishes) were transfected with 5 Î¼g of Flag-PP4. After 40 h, the cells were maintained in phosphate-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed serum for 1 h at 37 Â°C. The cells were then labeled in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed serum and 100 Î¼Ci/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h at 37 Â°C. After TNF-Î± treatment, the cells were washed with PBS twice to remove free [32P]orthophosphate. Flag-PP4 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) and separated by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF, and autoradiography was performed. The membrane was then subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-Flag (M2) antibody. The corresponding PP4 bands were cut out and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (35Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31130-31137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36Yao Z. Zhou G. Wang X.S. Brown A. Diener K. Gan H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In an effort to investigate which signaling pathway(s) PP4 may be involved in, we examined the effect of TNF-Î± on PP4 phosphatase activity. We first generated an anti-PP4 antibody, Ab104, which recognizes the C-terminal region of PP4. Western blot analysis indicated that Ab104 specifically recognized PP4, but not the most highly homologous phosphatases PP2A and PP6 (Fig.1 A). Previously, PP4 had been shown to localize to the centrosomes via immunofluorescence staining (17Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Hastie C.J. Carnegie G.K. Morrice N. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of Ab104, we isolated centrosomes from HeLa cells and performed Western blotting with antibodies to PP4 (Ab104), as well as markers for various subcellular compartments. PP4 localized to centrosome fractions, and these fractions were shown to be free of contamination from other subcellular compartments (Fig.1 B). We noticed that PP4 did not peak with Î³-tubulin. Considering that Î³-tubulin is a component of the centrioles of the centrosomes and that PP4 has been previously reported to be a component of the pericentriolar matrix of the centrosomes (17Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the slight difference in the Western blot detection may be the result of slight differences in the densities of the two centrosomal structures. The association of PP4 with the centrosome was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining using a peptide purified anti-PP4 antibody (Ab104). As shown in Fig. 1 C, PP4 co-localized with proteins of the pericentriolar matrix (PCM). Taken together, these data show that PP4 is a component of the centrosome. We then measured the phosphatase activity of PP4 before and after TNF-Î± treatment. PP4 phosphatase assays were established by using a synthetic peptide substrate, KTpIRR. We first wanted to ensure that the PP4 phosphatase assay is able to measure PP4 phosphatase activity. Thus, we tested the assay to determine the linear range of the assay and to show that increasing amounts of PP4 correlate with increasing PP4 activity. PP4 showed a time-dependent increase in its phosphatase activity in a time period of 1â50 min of incubation of PP4 with the peptide substrate (Fig.2 A, upper panel). Within this time frame, PP4 activity increased with increased amounts of PP4 (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). HEK293T cells were treated with TNF-Î± (10 ng/ml), and endogenous PP4 was immunoprecipitated from the cells with the PP4-specific antibody, Ab104. The PP4 phosphatase activity was measured by incubating the immunoprecipitated PP4 with the peptide substrate, KTpIRR, for 30 min. PP4 phosphatase activity was increased following TNF-Î± stimulation in a time-dependent fashion, peaking at 10 min (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). PP4 activity was decreased after 10 min, indicating that TNF-Î±-induced PP4 activation was a transient event. The increased phosphatase activity was not caused by variation in levels of PP4 because the amounts of PP4 immunoprecipitated were comparable (Fig.2 B, lower panel). Therefore, PP4 was activated in response to TNF-Î± in HEK293T cells. It is known that TNF-Î± is a potent activator of the JNK pathway. To establish a possible link between PP4 and the JNK pathway in response to TNF-Î±, endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated with an anti-JNK1 antibody (Ab101) from HEK293T cells, and its kinase activity was determined by an immunocomplex kinase assay using GST-c-Jun-(1â79) as substrate. As shown in Fig. 2 C, JNK was activated by TNF-Î± with kinetics similar to that of PP4 in HEK293T cells. Thus, PP4 was activated concomitant with JNK activation in response to TNF-Î± in HEK293T cells. To further confirm the involvement of PP4 in TNF-Î± signaling, we examined the effect of TNF-Î± on the phosphorylation state of PP4, because PP2A, the phosphatase most homologous to PP4, is regulated by phosphorylation. HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-PP4, labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate, and treated with TNF-Î± (10 ng/ml). Flag-PP4 was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody (M2). We found that TNF-Î± treatment induced phosphorylation of PP4 in a time-dependent manner, peaking at 5 min (Fig.3 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that TNF-Î±-induced phosphorylation of PP4 occurred on serine and threonine residues (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that PP4 is inducibly phosphorylated in response to TNF-Î± in HEK293T cells. To investigate the functional involvement of PP4 in the TNF-Î± signaling, we examined the contribution of PP4 to TNF-Î±-induced JNK activat"
https://openalex.org/W2090808838,"We previously reported that the Î²1-adrenergic receptor (Î²1AR) associates with PSD-95 through a PDZ domain-mediated interaction, by which PSD-95 modulates Î²1AR function and facilitates the physical association of Î²1AR with other synaptic proteins such as N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Here we demonstrate that Î²1AR association with PSD-95 is regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5). When Î²1AR and PSD-95 were coexpressed with either GRK2 or GRK5 in COS-7 cells, GRK5 alone dramatically decreased the association of Î²1AR with PSD-95, although GRK2 and GRK5 both could be co-immunoprecipitated with Î²1AR and both could enhance receptor phosphorylation in vivo. Increasing expression of GRK5 in the cells led to further decreased Î²1AR association with PSD-95. Stimulation with the Î²1AR agonist isoproterenol further decreased PSD-95 binding to Î²1AR. In addition, GRK5 protein kinase activity was required for this regulatory effect since a kinase-inactive GRK5 mutant had no effect on PSD-95 binding to Î²1AR. Moreover, the regulatory effect of GRK5 on Î²1AR association with PSD-95 was observed only when GRK5 was expressed together with the receptor, but not when GRK5 was coexpressed with PSD-95. Thus, we propose that GRK5 regulates Î²1AR association with PSD-95 through phosphorylation of Î²1AR. Regulation of protein association through receptor phosphorylation may be a general mechanism used by G protein-coupled receptors that associate via PDZ domain-mediated protein/protein interactions. We previously reported that the Î²1-adrenergic receptor (Î²1AR) associates with PSD-95 through a PDZ domain-mediated interaction, by which PSD-95 modulates Î²1AR function and facilitates the physical association of Î²1AR with other synaptic proteins such as N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors.

Regulation of protein association through receptor phosphorylation may be a general mechanism used by G protein-coupled receptors that associate via PDZ domain-mediated protein/protein interactions. G protein-coupled receptors Î²1-adrenergic receptor Î²2-adrenergic receptor Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor protein kinase C G protein-coupled receptor kinase glutathione S-transferase Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole propionate PDZ domains, named after the first three proteins in which they were discovered (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1), bind to small specific primary sequences in their target proteins, typically a carboxyl-terminal peptide (1Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Google Scholar). PDZ domain-mediated protein/protein interactions have been identified that target many receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and other structural molecules (2Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Google Scholar,3Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Google Scholar). PDZ domain-containing scaffolding proteins have been shown to play very important roles in organizing signaling cascades in a specific spatial order, anchoring proteins in specific subcellular compartments, and regulating ion channel activity (2Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Google Scholar, 3Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin.

A variety of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 (including the Î²1-adrenergic receptor (Î²1AR), Î²2AR, vasoactive intestinal peptide, V2 vasopressin, metabotropic glutamate, serotonin, and somatostatin receptors) contain typical class I PDZ domain-interacting motifs of the form (S/T)X(V/I/L) at their carboxyl termini (7Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Google Scholar). Î²2AR was the first GPCR reported to interact with a PDZ domain-containing protein (8Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Google Scholar). Agonist-stimulated binding of the first PDZ domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) to the extreme C terminus of Î²2AR provides a mechanism by which Î²2AR controls Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 function in the kidney (8Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Google Scholar). Furthermore, interaction with NHERF has been reported to regulate the recycling of internalized Î²2AR (9Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Google Scholar). Recently, additional PDZ domain-containing proteins interacting with several distinct GPCRs have been identified. MUPP1, amulti-PDZ domain-containingprotein, has been demonstrated to interact with three subtypes of serotonin receptors through its PDZ10 domain (10Becamel C. Figge A. Poliak S. Dumuis A. Peles E. Bockaert J. Lubbert H. Ullmer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12974-12982Google Scholar). SSTRIP has been identified as a novel binding partner for somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (11Zitzer H. Honck H.H. Bachner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32997-33001Google Scholar, 12Kreienkamp H.J. Zitzer H. Richter D. J. Physiol. (Paris). 2000; 94: 193-198Google Scholar). Cortactin-binding protein 1 also has been reported to interact with somatostatin receptor subtype 2 in an agonist-dependent manner (13Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Google Scholar). Another PDZ domain-containing protein, PICK1 (proteininteracting with Ckinase), has been reported to interact with protein kinase C (PKC) and to regulate its phosphorylation of G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 7a (14Dev K.K. Nakajima Y. Kitano J. Braithwaite S.P. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7252-7257Google Scholar). Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we recently identified PSD-95, apostsynaptic density-enriched protein, as a novel binding partner of Î²1AR (15Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Google Scholar). PSD-95 belongs to the large family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase domain proteins that contain multiple PDZ domains. PSD-95 is known to interact with several proteins, includingN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (16Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Google Scholar), K+ channels (1Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Google Scholar), the receptor-tyrosine kinase ErbB4 (17Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Google Scholar), and nitric-oxide synthase (18Christopherson K.S. Hillier B.J. Lim W.A. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27467-27473Google Scholar, 19Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Google Scholar), through its three PDZ domains. PSD-95 is thought to play critical roles in assembling these and other molecules into signaling complexes and regulating their signal transduction (20Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Google Scholar). Association with PSD-95 decreases agonist-induced Î²1AR internalization, but has no effect on receptor desensitization or receptor-induced cAMP accumulation (15Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Google Scholar). This association provides a physical linkage between Î²1ARs and other synaptic proteins, such asN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which are known to be regulated by Î²1AR stimulation (21Raman I.M. Tong G. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 415-421Google Scholar). Association with PSD-95 may also provide a molecular mechanism by which Î²1AR may be localized to synapses and regulate synaptic plasticity. If PDZ domain-containing proteins that interact with the carboxyl terminus of a GPCR via a PDZ domain do indeed serve as multivalent scaffolding proteins to selectively assemble and target receptor-containing signaling complexes to specific cellular areas (10Becamel C. Figge A. Poliak S. Dumuis A. Peles E. Bockaert J. Lubbert H. Ullmer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12974-12982Google Scholar,12Kreienkamp H.J. Zitzer H. Richter D. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Google Scholar), this assembly is likely to be highly regulated. The assembly of receptor signaling complexes on the cell surface is a dynamic process, and the complexes must be able to disassemble under certain physiological conditions. Despite the fact that several protein/protein interactions between GPCRs and PDZ domain-containing proteins have been well documented, little is known about how such PDZ domain-mediated interactions might be regulated. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) constitute a family of seven serine/threonine-protein kinases that phosphorylate agonist-bound, activated GPCRs. GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation rapidly initiates receptor desensitization and internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis by targeting the receptors for binding by arrestin proteins (22Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Google Scholar, 23Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). It has been reported that in Î²2AR, the serine/threonine-rich cytoplasmic tail is the target region phosphorylated by GRKs (24Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Google Scholar). In vitroexperiments have indicated that GRK2 and GRK5 preferentially phosphorylate some of these sites (24Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Google Scholar). Both Î²1AR and Î²2AR have carboxyl-terminal PDZ target motifs that have been reported to bind to PDZ domain-containing proteins (8Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Google Scholar, 15Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Google Scholar). NHERF binds to the DSLL-COOH motif of Î²2AR, and PSD-95 binds to the ESKV-COOH motif of Î²1AR. In both cases, mutation of the serine at position â2 eliminates PDZ domain-containing protein binding. Interestingly, this Ser residue at position â2 in Î²2AR has been mapped as a phosphorylation site for GRK5, but not for GRK2 (24Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Google Scholar). Even though nothing is known about the GRK phosphorylation sites in Î²1AR, it has been reported that Î²1AR can be phosphorylated and desensitized by both GRK2 and GRK5 in a manner similar to that for Î²2AR (25Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar). Considering that the protein sequences in Î²1AR and Î²2AR are highly conserved in the carboxyl-terminal tail, it is reasonable to believe that the Ser residue in the ESKV-COOH motif of Î²1AR may also be a phosphorylation site for GRKs, and phosphorylation of this site may affect receptor interaction with its binding partner. Therefore, we investigated whether GRKs might regulate Î²1AR interaction with PSD-95. Mammalian expression plasmids pcDNA3/FLAG-Î²1AR and pcDNA3/FLAG-Î²2AR (26Tang Y. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Ringstad N.

Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Morgan Sheng (Harvard Medical School). Polyclonal anti-His6 antibody and polyclonal (A14) and monoclonal (9E10) anti-Myc antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG M2 and anti-FLAG BioM2 antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel were from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-GRK2 and anti-GRK5 antibodies were developed in this laboratory as described previously (29Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. All tissue culture media and related reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in a 37 Â°C incubator under 5% CO2. Cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with LipofectAMINE (at a 4:1 ratio with DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293 cells were maintained under the same conditions as COS-7 cells, except that minimal essential medium was used. HEK293 cells were transfected with FuGene 6 (at a 2.5:1 ratio with DNA; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, cells were grown for 36â48 h before agonist stimulation. Prior to stimulation, appropriately transfected cells were incubated in serum-free media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for COS-7 cells) or minimal essential medium (for HEK293 cells) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 60 min at 37 Â°C. Agonist stimulation was performed at 37 Â°C in these serum-free media for the times indicated in the figure legends. For most immunoprecipitation experiments, COS-7 cells in 100-mm plates were scrapped into 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 5 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 20 Î¼g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cells were lysed by incubation on ice for 30 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 Ã g for 12 min at 4 Â°C. The clarified supernatants were used in cellular co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 50 Î¼l of each supernatant were diluted into an equal amount of 3Ã SDS-PAGE sample buffer and served as a whole cell extract control. For protein cross-linking experiments, transfected COS-7 cells in 100-mm plates were incubated in serum-free medium for 60 min and then exposed to 10 Î¼m isoproterenol for 10 min. The cells were rinsed with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with 1 ml of cross-linking buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and a 2.5 mm concentration of the cell-permeable cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce)) (30Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar). For the stimulated cells, 10 Î¼m isoproterenol was present in the cross-linking buffer. The cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with continuous slow rocking. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by quickly removing the cross-linking buffer and replacing it with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). The cell lysates were clarified as described above, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation experiments. Clarified cell extract (1 ml) was then incubated with 25 Î¼l of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel slurry at 4 Â°C with gentle rotation for 4 h. Beads were washed four to five times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 50 Î¼l of 3Ã SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of sample in 3Ã SDS-PAGE sample buffer were resolved on pre-cast 4â20% polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by semidry blotting. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. PSD-95 was detected with rabbit anti-Myc antibody (1:1000 dilution); Î²-arrestin-1 and Î²-arrestin-2 were detected with rabbit anti-His6 antibody; GRK2 was detected with GRK2/3-specific monoclonal antibody C5/7; and GRK5 was detected with GRK4/5/6-specific monoclonal antibody A16/17. FLAG-tagged receptor proteins in the immunoprecipitation were blotted with BioM2 IgG. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (for BioM2). Protein bands were visualized via SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Quantitation of band density was performed with a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. COS-7 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with FLAG-Î²1AR alone or with either GRK2 or GRK5. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with [32P]orthophosphate to label the intracellular ATP pool as described previously (31Cong M. Perry S.J. Lin F.T. Fraser I.D. Hu L.A. Chen W. Pitcher J.A. Scott J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15192-15199Google Scholar). Cells were then stimulated with 10 Î¼m isoproterenol for 5 min and washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer A, and receptors were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. Immune complexes were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Receptor phosphorylation was quantitatively analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager as described previously (25Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar). GRK2 and GRK5 were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells as previously described (28Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar, 32Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins (GST, GST-Î²1CT (where Î²1CT is the carboxyl terminus of Î²1AR), and GST-Î²2CT) were purified from bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (15Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Google Scholar). To phosphorylate GST fusion proteins immobilized on the beads, 10 Î¼l of beads with bound fusion protein were washed three times with GRK kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) and incubated with 0.5 Î¼g of purified GRK2 or GRK5 and [Î³-32P]ATP (60 Î¼m final concentration, 400 cpm/pmol) in total of 40 Î¼l at 30 Â°C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with 2Ã SDS sample buffer, and phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and processed for autoradiography as described above. For receptor internalization assays, HEK293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/FLAG-Î²1AR or pcDNA3/FLAG-Î²2AR in the absence and presence of GW1/Myc-PSD-95. One day after transfection, cells were split into polylysine-coated six-well plates (Biocoat) and grown overnight at 37 Â°C. Cells were serum-starved for 1 h before stimulation with 10 Î¼m isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 Â°C. Cells were placed on ice, and cell-surface FLAG-tagged receptors were detected with anti-FLAG M2 antibody, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as described previously (26Tang Y. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Ringstad N. Hall R.A. Pitcher J.A. DeCamilli P. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12559-12564Google Scholar). Receptor internalization is defined as the percentage loss of surface receptors caused by agonist stimulation, as measured by cell flow cytometry. To test the effect of GRKs on the association of Î²1AR with PSD-95, we transfected COS-7 cells with FLAG-Î²1AR and Myc-PSD-95 in the absence or presence of either GRK2 or GRK5. As reported previously (15Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Google Scholar), in the absence of exogenous GRKs, immunoprecipitation of Î²1AR followed by Western blotting revealed robust co-immunoprecipitation of a PSD-95Â·Î²1AR complex (Fig.1A). Treatment with the Î²-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol had no significant effect on this association in the absence of GRKs. However, expression of GRK5 dramatically decreased the association of PSD-95 with Î²1AR, whereas the association of Î²1AR with PSD-95 was not altered by coexpression of GRK2 (Fig. 1A). With an increased expression level, GRK5 further decreased the amount of PSD-95 binding to the receptor (Fig. 1B), whereas an increased expression level of GRK2 was ineffective (Fig.1C). Furthermore, the negative effect of GRK5 on PSD-95/Î²1AR binding was potentiated by agonist stimulation of Î²1AR (Figs. 1A and 2). In the cells lacking GRK5, 10 min of stimulation with isoproterenol did not change the association of Î²1AR with PSD-95. However, expression of even a small amount of GRK5 dramatically decreased the association of PSD-95 with Î²1AR (Figs. 1B and 2). In the presence of GRK5, isoproterenol stimulation further decreased the amount of PSD-95 associated with the receptor (Figs. 1A and2). With extended stimulation by agonist, the amount of PSD-95 bound to Î²1AR was further decreased (Fig. 2). This agonist effect could result from 1) agonist stimulation activating the receptor and changing its conformation, thus presenting a better substrate for GRK5, or 2) activated GPCR enhancing GRK5 kinase activity (23Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). In both cases, agonist stimulation led to enhanced receptor phosphorylation by GRK5. These results suggest that receptor phosphorylation might be responsible for the GRK5 effect on PSD-95/Î²1AR binding. The reason why no agonist effect was observed in the cells in the absence of GRK5 may be because there is not a sufficient amount of endogenous GRK5 (compared with GRK2) in the COS-7 cells. In fact, Western blotting of COS-7 cell lysate suggested that there is a significantly higher level of GRK2 than of GRK5 in these cells (data not shown). It has been well documented that many GPCRs are substrates for both GRK2 and GRK5, as they can be phosphorylated by GRK2 or GRK5 both in vivo and in vitro (23Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). Furthermore, GRK2 and GRK5 have been demonstrated to associate with GPCRs in an agonist-dependent manner (30Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar,31Cong M. Perry S.J. Lin F.T. Fraser I.D. Hu L.A. Chen W. Pitcher J.A. Scott J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15192-15199Google Scholar). Here we tested the effect of GRK2 and GRK5 on Î²1AR phosphorylation and their association with Î²1AR in COS-7 cells. As has been previously shown (25Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar), both GRK2 and GRK5 can enhance the phosphorylation of Î²1AR. In the cells expressing Î²1AR alone, agonist stimulation caused little increase in receptor phosphorylation. However, we observed a dramatic increase in agonist-stimulated receptor phosphorylation when Î²1AR was coexpressed with either GRK2 or GRK5 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3A). The interaction between GRKs and their substrate receptors is so weak (or transient) that co-immunoprecipitation of GRK5/Î²1AR is undetectable under standard immunoprecipitation conditions (data not shown). However, GRK5/Î²1AR association is detectable following treatment of the stimulated cells with the membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). As shown in Fig. 3B, when GRK2 or GRK5 was coexpressed with Î²1AR in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitation of the receptor revealed robust association of GRK2 and GRK5 with the receptor (Fig.3B). Since both GRK2 and GRK5 are co-immunoprecipitated with Î²1AR, it is possible that the GRK5 inhibition of PSD-95/Î²1AR association could be due to competition between PSD-95 and GRK5 for binding to the receptor. To address this question, we used a GRK5 mutant, K215R (GRK5(DN)), which has no kinase activity. When Î²1AR and PSD-95 were coexpressed with differing amounts of GRK5(DN), the association of PSD-95 with Î²1AR was not significantly decreased (Fig.4), even though GRK5(DN) still retains the same ability to co-immunoprecipitate with the receptor as wild-type GRK5 (data not shown). These data indicate that the ability GRK5 to reduce receptor association with PSD-95 is not due to competition between GRK5 and PSD-95 for receptor binding, but requires the protein kinase activity of GRK5. This conclusion is also supported by the preceding results that agonist stimulation potentiated the ability of GRK5 to dissociate PSD-95 from Î²1AR (Fig. 2). To quantitatively determine the effect of GRKs on PSD-95/Î²1AR association, we analyzed the PSD-95 immunoreactive protein bands using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. We set the amount of PSD-95 associated with Î²1AR in the absence of exogenous GRKs and without agonist stimulation as the basal level (100%), and all other results are expressed as a percentage of this basal level. As shown in Fig. 5, when Î²1AR and PSD-95 were coexpressed with either GRK2 or the GRK5(K215R) mutant (GRK5(DN)), the association of Î²1AR with PSD-95 was not significantly changed. Agonist stimulation of these cells also had no effect on PSD-95/Î²1AR association. However, coexpression of GRK5 dramatically decreased the binding of Î²1AR with PSD-95, down to 24% of the control level. Agonist stimulation further decreased the amount of PSD-95 bound to the receptor to 5% of the basal level (Fig. 5). GRK5 could phosphorylate either Î²1AR or PSD-95 to regulate the association of PSD-95 with Î²1AR. To ascertain the phosphorylation target of GRK5, we expressed Î²1AR, PSD-95, Î²1AR with GRK5, or PSD-95 with GRK5 in COS-7 cells. Lysate from cells expressing Î²1AR was then mixed with that from cells expressing PSD-95, followed by immunoprecipitation of Î²1AR. As shown in Fig. 6, when GRK5 was coexpressed with PSD-95, it was unable to inhibit PSD-95 binding to Î²1AR. However, when GRK5 was coexpressed with Î²1AR, the association of PSD-95 with Î²1AR was decreased. Since the lysate contains no additional ATP, GRK5 should be catalytically inactive once the cells are lysed, suggesting that GRK5 regulates Î²1AR association with PSD-95 by phosphorylation of Î²1AR, not PSD-95. Following phosphorylation of the agonist-activated receptor by GRKs, Î²-arrestins bind to the receptor and promote receptor internalization (22Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Google Scholar). Thus, Î²-arrestin binding to the receptor might prevent PSD-95/Î²1AR association. To investigate whether Î²-arrestin binding is required for regulating PSD-95/Î²1AR association, we tested the effect of Î²-arrestins on PSD-95/Î²1AR association in the presence of GRK5. COS-7 cells were transfected with either Î²-arrestin-1 or Î²-arrestin-2 with Î²1AR, PSD-95, and GRK5. As shown in Fig. 7, the amount of PSD-95 associated with Î²1AR was decreased by expression of GRK5. However, the association of PSD-95 with Î²1AR was not significantly further changed with overexpression of either Î²-arrestin-1 or Î²-arrestin-2 in the presence of GRK5. We also noted that overexpression of Î²-arrestins did not facilitate GRK2 regulation of PSD-95/Î²1AR association (data not shown). These findings support the idea that Î²-arrestin binding to the GRK-phosphorylated receptor is not required to regulate PSD-95/Î²1AR association. To investigate the functional difference between GRK2 and GRK5 that is responsible for their differential regulatory effects on Î²1AR, we compared the ability of GRK2 and GRK5 to phosphorylate the GST-Î²1AR carboxyl terminus (GST-Î²1CT) fusion protein or GST-Î²2CT (Fig. 8). Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins (including GST alone, GST-Î²1CT, and GST-Î²2CT) and kinase were used in each reaction. GRK5 and GRK2 equally phosphorylated GST-Î²2CT. However, under the same conditions, GRK5-mediated GST-Î²1CT phosphorylation was substantially better than that mediated by GRK2 (Fig. 8). These results suggest that, at least in vitro, Î²1AR-CT is a better substrate for GRK5 than for GRK2. Phosphorylation of GPCRs by GRKs is a major mechanism responsible for termination of cellular signaling by these receptors or desensitization (33Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Google Scholar). Among the somatic GRKs, GRK2, GRK3, and GRK5 have been reported to enhance the phosphorylation of Î²1AR in HEK293 cells (25Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar). Based on sequence and functional similarities, GRK2 and GRK3 belong to one GRK subfamily, whereas GRK5 belongs to a distinct subfamily that includes GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6 (23Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). Here we studied the ability of GRKs to regulate a PDZ domain-mediated interaction with Î²1AR by using GRK2 and GRK5, two enzymes from different subfamilies. We have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Î²1AR by GRK5, but not by GRK2, appears to regulate its binding to one intracellular protein-binding partner, PSD-95. Several recent reports suggest that phosphorylation can regulate PDZ domain-mediated protein/protein interactions. Phosphorylation of Ser880 in the glutamate receptor 2 subunit by PKC reduces its binding affinity for glutamate receptor-interacting protein (34Matsuda S. Mikawa S. Hirai H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1765-1768Google Scholar). Furthermore, serine phosphorylation also has been implicated in the differential regulation of the Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins (35Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of the inward rectifier K+ channel (Kir2.3) by protein kinase A inhibits its association with PSD-95 and SAP97 (36Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W. Wingerd K. Clegg D. Vandenberg C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 987-998Google Scholar, 37Cohen N.A. Brenman J.E. Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Google Scholar). In fact, for all class I PDZ domain-interacting motifs, there is a phosphorylatable serine or threonine at position â2 that is critical for PDZ domain-containing protein binding. Phosphorylation of the serine or threonine at this site may provide an efficient way to regulate PDZ domain-mediated protein interactions. Î²2AR interacts with the PDZ domain-containing protein NHERF through the PDZ1 domain (8Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Google Scholar, 38Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Google Scholar). This PDZ domain-mediated interaction of Î²2AR with NHERF family proteins has been shown to control the choice between degradation and recycling of internalized Î²2AR (9Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Google Scholar). Very interestingly, the recycling of Î²2AR was dependent on the intact PDZ domain-binding motif (DSLL-COOH) in the carboxyl terminus of Î²2AR (Fig.9), and receptor recycling is modulated by overexpression of GRK5, but not of GRK2 (9Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Google Scholar). The Ser residue in this motif has been shown to be a phosphorylation site for GRK5, but not for GRK2, in vitro (Fig. 9) (24Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Google Scholar). It is likely that phosphorylation of this Ser residue by GRK5 can decrease the binding of NHERF or other proteins to Î²2AR and thereby regulate the recycling of the internalized receptors. Interestingly, one splice variant of GRK6 (GRK6A) can phosphorylate NHERF at Ser289as well, also suggesting that GRKs may regulate PDZ domain-mediated interactions (39Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24328-24334Google Scholar). Here we have shown that phosphorylation of Î²1AR by GRK5 decreases the association of Î²1AR with PSD-95. It has been reported that Î²1AR can be phosphorylated by GRKs in a manner analogous to that of Î²2AR (25Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar). The ESKV-COOH motif in the carboxyl terminus of Î²1AR appears to be responsible for the interaction with PSD-95 (15Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Google Scholar). The Ser residue at position â2 (Ser475) is the only putative GRK phosphorylation site in this motif (Fig. 9). One explanation for our observation is that this Ser residue is phosphorylated by GRK5, but not by GRK2, and that phosphorylation of this Ser residue decreases the affinity of PSD-95 binding. We have shown that the Î²1AR carboxyl-terminal tail is a better substrate for GRK5 than for GRK2, but further studies will be required to assess whether phosphorylation of Ser475 indeed results from the action of GRK5 in vivo and whether this particular phosphorylation underlies all of the GRK5 regulatory effect on PSD-95 association. Thus, for both Î²1AR and Î²2AR, association with PDZ domain-containing partners is specifically regulated by GRK5, not GRK2. In view of the fact that many GPCRs have the similar serine/threonine-based PDZ domain-binding motifs in their carboxyl termini and that they are also putative substrates for GRKs, it is reasonable to suspect that phosphorylation of PDZ domain-binding motifs of receptors by GRK5 or other GRKs may represent a common mechanism for regulation of PDZ domain-mediated interaction in other GPCRs as well. More generally, it is also possible that other protein kinases (such as protein kinase A or PKC) may play similar roles. The PDZ domain-mediated assembly and turnover of receptor signaling complexes is a dynamic process that is likely to be highly regulated. The regulatory mechanism involving phosphorylation of receptor might be important for receptor functions such as receptor internalization. Agonist-induced receptor internalization, a process in which activated receptors move from the cell surface into intracellular vesicles, is a common feature of GPCRs and is important for receptor regulation (33Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Google Scholar). Since many known PDZ domain-mediated protein/protein interactions are involved in the anchoring and targeting of proteins in specific membrane areas (such as synapses), it is likely that PDZ domain interaction with GPCRs will inhibit receptor internalization. PDZ domain-mediated PSD-95/Î²1AR interaction might be involved in anchoring the receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Indeed, PSD-95 interaction with Î²1AR decreased agonist-induced receptor internalization, possibly due to the time required for the dissociation of the PSD-95Â·Î²1AR complex. When activated by agonist stimulation, GRK5 can phosphorylate agonist-bound receptors (28Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Google Scholar). This phosphorylation of the receptor by GRK5 decreases the binding affinity of PSD-95, releasing the receptor from the PSD-95 complex and facilitating internalization. Release of receptor from PSD-95 may also make it available for distinct protein interactions and signaling events. A similar regulatory mechanism may also be applicable to other proteins, such as AMPA receptors, in which phosphorylation of the glutamate receptor 2 subunit by PKC is very important in regulation of AMPA receptor internalization during synaptic plasticity (35Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Google Scholar). Even though the evidence here strongly supports the idea that phosphorylation of Î²1AR decreases its association with PDZ domain-containing proteins, we cannot rule out the possibility that receptor phosphorylation might also be critical for recruiting proteins important for receptor signal transduction. In this case, phosphorylation of the receptor may serve as an initial signal to assemble receptor signaling complexes. For example, it has been reported that PKC activation can increase the phosphorylation of the glutamate receptor 2 subunit and recruit PICK1 to the excitatory synapses (35Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Google Scholar). Furthermore, cerebellar long-term depression also requires PKC-regulated interactions between the glutamate receptor 2/3 subunit and PDZ domain-containing proteins (40Xia J. Chung H.J. Wihler C. Huganir R.L. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2002; 28: 499-510Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides derived from the tumor suppressor MMAC/PTEN PDZ-binding domain to coprecipitate proteins from human cell lysates, Adey et al. (41Adey N.B. Huang L. Ormonde P.A. Baumgard M.L. Pero R. Byreddy D.V. Tavtigian S.V. Bartel P.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 35-37Google Scholar) reported that threonine phosphorylation of this PDZ-binding domain both inhibits and stimulates PDZ binding. In summary, we have provided strong evidence that GRK5, but not GRK2, can regulate the association of PSD-95 with Î²1AR by phosphorylation of the receptor. GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation may provide a common regulatory mechanism for the association of other GPCRs with PDZ domain-containing proteins. This regulation may be involved in many important processes such as receptor internalization, receptor localization to specific domains (e.g. synapses), and receptor signaling events. We thank Drs. Randy A. Hall and Fannie Lin for helpful discussions and Donna Addison, Mary Holben, and Julie Turnbough for assistance with the preparation of this manuscript."

In mammals, it comprises a catalytic (GCLC) and modifier (GCLM) subunit. The existence of a modifier subunit in invertebrates has not been described to date.

A putative DmGCLM was obtained as an expressed sequence tag with 27% identity to human GCLM at the amino acid level.

DmGCLC co-immunoprecipitated with DmGCLM from S2 cell extracts, suggesting that they also associate in vivo. Enzyme kinetic analyses showed that DmGCLC has a Km for glutamate of 2.88 mm, but when complexed with DmGCLM, theKm for glutamate is 0.45 mm. Inhibition of DmGCLC activity by glutathione was found to be competitive with respect to glutamate (Ki = 0.03 mm), whereas inhibition of the GCL complex was mixed (Ki= 0.67 mm), suggesting allosteric effects. In accordance with this, DmGCLC and DmGCLM have the ability to form reversible intermolecular disulfide bridges.

Despite the critical importance of glutathione for virtually all aerobically respiring cells, relatively little is known about how cells regulate glutathione homeostasis. It is apparent, however, that a key player in the control of glutathione synthesis is glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL,1 EC 6.3.2.2, Î³-glutamylcysteine synthetase), which catalyzes the first reaction in the two-step pathway for de novo synthesis. The ultimate enzyme in the pathway, glutathione synthetase, does not appear to play such an important part in the fine-tuning of cellular redox status. GCL activity seems to be regulated by cellular thiol antioxidant balance, and in mammals, this control mechanism is principally mediated by a non-catalytic polypeptide (GCLM) that dimerizes with the catalytic subunit of GCL (GCLC) (1Huang C.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Google Scholar, 2Huang C.-S. Chang L.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Google Scholar). Native and recombinant GCLs from rat and human have been extensively characterized (1Huang C.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Google Scholar, 2Huang C.-S. Chang L.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Google Scholar, 3Misra I. Griffith O.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 268-276Google Scholar, 4Tu Z.H. Anders M.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 247-254Google Scholar). It has been shown that GCL from these species comprises an â¼73-kDa catalytic subunit and an â¼31-kDa regulatory subunit. GCLC has all of the catalytic activity, butin vitro experiments with rat kidney GCL suggested that, unless complexed with GCLM, it has exquisite sensitivity to feedback inhibition by glutathione and a high Km (â¼18 mm) for glutamate (2Huang C.-S. Chang L.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Google Scholar). Combination with GCLM caused theKi for glutathione to be substantially increased and the Km for glutamate to be reduced by 13-fold. The presence of reducing agents caused the Km for glutamate to increase by â¼2-fold and increased the extent of inhibition by the glutathione analog ophthalmic acid, suggesting that GCLM may regulate GCLC activity in response to the immediate redox environment. Based on the in vitro data, it has been proposed that rat GCLC would not be functional in vivowithout the presence of GCLM (1Huang C.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Google Scholar). Although GCLM seems to have an important role in regulating glutathione synthesis, to date, only GCL from vertebrates has been shown to have a functional regulatory subunit. GCL from Escherichia coli is distinct from the eukaryotic forms described so far and is a monomer with a subunit molecular mass of 58 kDa (5Watanabe K. Yamano Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4393-4400Google Scholar). Interestingly, theE. coli GCL amino acid sequence has a greater level of identity to GCLM than to GCLC (1Huang C.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Google Scholar). Catalytic subunits of GCL fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans have been identified (6Ohtake Y. Yabuuchi S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 953-961Google Scholar, 7Wilson, R., Ainscough, R., Anderson, K., Baynes, C., Berks, M., Burton, J., Connell, M., Bonfield, J., Copsey, T., Cooper, J., Coulson, A., Craxton, M., Dear, S., Du, Z., Durbin, R., Favello, A., Fraser, A., Fulton, L., Gardner, A., Green, P., Hawkins, T., Hillier, L., Jier, M., Johnston, L., Jones, M., Kershaw, J., Kirsten, J., Laisster, N., Latreille, P., Lloyd, C., Mortimore, B., Ocallaghan, M., Parsons, J., Percy, C., Rifken, L., Roopra, A., Saunders, D., Shownkeen, R., Sims, M., Smaldon, N., Smith, A., Smith, M., Sonnhammer, E., Staden, R., Sulston, J., Thierrymieg, J., Thomas, K., Vaudin, M., Vaughan, K., Waterston, R., Watson, A., Weinstock, L., Wilkinsonsproat, J., and Wohldman, P.Google Scholar), and although they are structurally related to human GCLC (32 and 54% identities at the amino acid level, respectively), there are no convincing candidate genes in the data base with comparable levels of sequence identity to GCLM. GCL from Trypanosoma brucei has been cloned and its enzyme activity rigorously characterized (8Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17485-17490Google Scholar, 9Brekken D.L. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26317-26322Google Scholar). Although T. bruceiGCL shares 45% sequence identity at the amino acid level with mammalian GCLC, the kinetic data are highly suggestive that T. brucei GCL would be fully functional in vivo without the necessity for a regulatory subunit. Recently, GCL from Drosophila melanogaster was cloned by functional complementation of an S. cerevisiae gsh1 mutant (10Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 337-340Google Scholar). This was previously called D. melanogasterÎ³-glutamylcysteine synthetase, but in the present study, the nomenclature has been changed to DmGCL in accordance with the recommendations of IUBMB. 2www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC6/3/2/2.html. 2www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC6/3/2/2.html.DmGCL was found to have 57% amino acid sequence identity to human GCLC, and its expression in the S. cerevisiae gsh1 mutant partially restored the glutathione deficiency in this strain. The levels of glutathione in the complemented yeast strain were, however, only 8% of those in the parental strain. GCL activity of the expressed protein was not characterized in that study, but based on the high level of amino acid sequence identity to human GCLC and the fact that complementation of the gsh1 mutant resulted in such a modest restoration of glutathione levels, it seemed to us highly plausible that DmGCL may require a regulatory subunit for efficient activityin vivo. The genetic tractability of Drosophila makes it a highly attractive organism to study the regulation of GCL activity in vivo. Identification of common regulatory mechanisms for glutathione synthesis in Drosophila and man would make this an important model to aid our understanding of the functions of glutathione and the factors that regulate its homeostasis. In this study, we have identified a candidate GCL regulatory subunit inDrosophila and demonstrate that it regulates DmGCL activity in a manner similar, but not identical, to that of human or rat GCLM. The open reading frame (ORF) of the gcl gene was amplified from pDmGCS4.3.3 (10Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 337-340Google Scholar) by PCR using upstream (5â²-GGGAATTCATATGGGTCTACTGAGCGAGGGC-3â²) and downstream (5â²-GCCTTAACTCGAGTCATTTCTCCTCGCAGCAGCC-3â²) oligonucleotides designed to insert EcoRI and NdeI sites at the 5â²-end and an XhoI site at the 3â²-end of the ORF. The amplified fragment was cloned into the EcoRI andXhoI sites of pBluescript SKâ (Stratagene), whereupon a 1880-bp AccIII/XhoI fragment was replaced with the corresponding fragment from pDmGCS4.3.3 to minimize the introduction of PCR errors. Plasmid DNA was isolated, and the insert was sequenced to confirm that it was identical to the predicted ORF of pDmGCS4.3.3. The DmGCLC ORF was subcloned into theNdeI and XhoI sites of pET15b (Novagen) to generate plasmid pETDmGCLC. The DmGCLM cDNA was obtained as an expressed sequence tag (GH01757) from ResGen Genomics Resources (a subsidiary of Invitrogen), and upstream (5â²-GGGAATTCCATATGATACCGACCATAACG-3â²) and downstream (5â²-GGAATTCCTCGAGCTAAACGCTCGACCTCG-3â²) primers were used to amplify the ORF by PCR. The oligonucleotides were designed to insertEcoRI and NdeI sites at the 5â²-end and anXhoI site at the 3â²-end of the ORF. The amplified fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pBluescript SKâ and sequenced before subcloning into theNdeI and XhoI sites of pET15b to generate plasmid pETDmGCLM. pETDmGCLC and pETDmGCLM were expressed separately inE. coli strain BL21(DE3). Transformed cells were grown at 37 Â°C with shaking in Terrific Broth (Sigma) containing ampicillin (100 Î¼g/ml) to an A600 nm of 0.5, and protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm). The temperature was lowered to 30 Â°C, and growth was allowed to continue for â¼4 h before harvesting the cells. Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 0.1% (v/v) Igepal, and recombinant proteins were purified using nickel-agarose chromatography (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant protein samples were dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of Buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm l-glutamate, and 5 mm MgCl2) containing 10 mm glutathione. Protein was precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 90% saturation and pelleted by centrifugation. Precipitated protein was solubilized in 0.5 ml of Buffer A containing 10 mm glutathione and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 16/60 Hi-prep gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. Gel filtration was carried out by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The eluate was monitored by continuous absorption at 280 nm, and protein concentrations in the eluted fractions were determined by the method of Bradford (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The column was calibrated using protein molecular mass standards (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GCL activity was determined at 25 Â°C by a modification of the method of Seelig et al. (12Seelig G.F. Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Google Scholar) using cysteine as substrate instead ofl-Î±-aminobutyrate and adapted for use on a Cobas Fara centrifugal analyzer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom). Reaction mixtures (0.21 ml) contained 10 mm l-glutamate, 10 mm l-cysteine, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.4 mm NADH, 1 unit of lactate dehydrogenase, and 1 unit of pyruvate kinase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 5 mm. Km andVmax values were determined by measuring initial reaction rates at glutamate and cysteine concentrations of between 0 and 60 mm. Hyperbolic regression analysis software (43Easterby J.S. Hyper, Version 1.1s. University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom1996Google Scholar) was used to fit the Michaelis-Menten parameters using the Hanes plot. For inhibition studies withl-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO), GCL samples were incubated at 25 Â°C with 1.5 Î¼m BSO in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP for 10 min prior to kinetic analyses. GCL inhibition studies with cystamine (2,2â²-dithiobis(ethylamine)) were performed by incubating GCL samples with 1.5 Î¼m cystamine in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) for 10 min at 25 Â°C prior to kinetic analyses. For inhibition studies with glutathione, reduced glutathione was included in the standard reaction mixture using concentrations of between 0.1 and 10 mm. Inhibition constants were estimated using different concentrations of glutathione (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mm) with glutamate as the variable substrate. Nonlinear regression analysis of data was performed using Hyper software (13Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Google Scholar), and Ki values were estimated using Enzpack (Biosoft). Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to assess the mechanisms of inhibition. Drosophila S2 cells were a generous gift from Dr. W. Whitfield (School of Biological Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK) and were maintained in serum-free medium (Invitrogen) routinely supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at room temperature. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to treatment at a density of 1 Ã 106 cells/ml and were treated withtert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) for 18 h. tBHQ was prepared as a 100 mm stock in Me2SO and was diluted to the appropriate concentration in the medium. Control cells were treated with the equivalent concentration of Me2SO. After treatment, cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Igepal). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fractions were retained for analysis. Antisera against purified recombinant DmGCLC or DmGCLM were raised in sheep using standard procedures (Scottish Diagnostics, Carluke, UK). Western blotting was performed by the method of Towbin et al. (14Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar), and the even transfer of samples was ensured by staining with Ponceau S as described previously (15Galloway D.C. Blake D.G. McLellan L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 47-56Google Scholar). As an additional control for even protein loading and transfer, blots were also probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against Drosophila Î±-tubulin (a gift from Dr. W. Whitfield). The antisera raised against the DmGCL subunits were each used at a dilution of 1:1000. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cleared S2 cell lysates (250 Î¼l, 0.5 mg/ml protein) were incubated with 50 Î¼l of a protein G-agarose bead slurry (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and 1.5 Î¼l of anti-DmGCLM antiserum for 1 h at 4 Â°C with gentle agitation. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with Buffer B, followed by a single wash with phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's paired t test. The amino acid sequence of DmGCLC is 57% identical to human GCLC. Phylogenetic alignment of DmGCLC with other GCL sequences shows that DmGCL has greater identity to mammalian GCL than to any other GCL subunit so far identified (10Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 337-340Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that DmGCL may be functionally similar to mammalian GCL, which requires a modifier subunit for regulatable and maximal activity. To test this hypothesis, we searched the Drosophila genome data base (16Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Google Scholar) for a GCLM candidate gene using the human GCLM cDNA sequence as a probe. The BLAST search identified a single gene within a bacterial artificial chromosome clone (BACF23F10, GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number AC009846). The cDNA predicted from the genomic sequence encodes a 285-amino acid polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 31.5 kDa. The genomic sequence was used to search the Drosophila expressed sequence tag data base (17Rubin G.M. Hong L. Brokstein P. Evans-Holm M. Frise E. Stapleton M. Harvey D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 2222-2224Google Scholar), and an expressed sequence tag (GH01757, accession number AI062531) with a nucleotide sequence identical to the genomic sequence was identified. The gene does not appear to have any introns over this area of the cDNA. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence from the putative DmGCLM cDNA with human GCLM revealed that the proteins share 27% identity and 42% similarity. The greatest level of identity is within the C-terminal region (Fig.1). The expressed sequence tag (GH01757) was used as a template to amplify the ORF of the putative DmGCLM cDNA by PCR. A single PCR product of 850 bp was obtained and subcloned into pBluescript SKâ. The sequence was verified before the insert was subcloned into pET15b, and the resulting plasmid was used to express recombinant His-tagged DmGCLM inE. coli as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Recombinant DmGCLM was purified from bacterial cell lysates using nickel-agarose affinity chromatography. Approximately 40 mg of recombinant protein was obtained from a 400-ml culture. Analysis of purified recombinant DmGCLM by SDS-PAGE showed that it comprises a single polypeptide with an approximate molecular mass of 31 kDa (data not shown). This is in agreement with the molecular mass calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence. The cDNA encoding DmGCLC was isolated recently by functional complementation of an S. cerevisiae GCL mutant (10Saunders R.D.C. McLellan L.I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 337-340Google Scholar). In the present study, the 2160-bp ORF was cloned into pET15b and used to express DmGCLC as a recombinant His-tagged protein. This was purified from soluble E. coli extracts using nickel-agarose affinity chromatography, and â¼20 mg of DmGCLC was obtained from an 800-ml culture. Analysis of purified recombinant DmGCLC by SDS-PAGE showed that it comprises a single polypeptide with an approximate molecular mass of 80 kDa (data not shown). This is in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 81 kDa from its amino acid sequence (719 amino acids). Human GCLM associates with GCLC to form a holoenzyme with an estimated size of 114 kDa (4Tu Z.H. Anders M.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 247-254Google Scholar). To determine whether the putative DmGCLM subunit identified here associates with DmGCLC to form a complex, purified DmGCLM (10 mg of protein) was mixed with DmGCLC (10 mg of protein) and subjected to gel filtration. The existence of an enzyme complex should be evident by an increase in the molecular mass of the eluted protein, relative to DmGCLC or DmGCLM alone. Analysis of DmGCLC (10 mg of protein) alone by gel filtration (Fig.2) revealed that it eluted as a single peak with an estimated molecular mass of â¼80 kDa. DmGCLM alone eluted as a single peak with an estimated molecular mass of â¼30 kDa (Fig.2). Resolution of the DmGCLC/DmGCLM mixture by gel filtration showed that there was one major protein peak with an estimated molecular mass of â¼140 kDa and a minor protein peak with an estimated molecular mass of 30 kDa corresponding to uncomplexed DmGCLM. From these findings, we concluded that a new protein complex of a higher molecular mass is generated when DmGCLC and DmGCLM are mixed, inferring that they are interacting with each other in vitro. Enzyme activity was determined with the fractions collected from gel filtration of DmGCLC, DmGCLM, or the mixture of DmGCLC and DmGCLM. Fig. 2B shows that the peaks corresponding to DmGCLC and the putative DmGCLCÂ·DmGCLM complex both have GCL activity. To determine the composition of the 140-kDa protein, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and compared with purified DmGCLC and DmGCLM. Fig. 3 shows that polypeptides with molecular masses of 80 kDa (corresponding to DmGCLC) and 30 kDa (corresponding to DmGCLM) are present in the 140-kDa protein peak. Reversible disulfide bridges can form between GCLC and GCLM in the mammalian holoenzyme (12Seelig G.F. Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Google Scholar). To determine whether disulfide bonds can form between DmGCLM and DmGCLC, we dialyzed the peak fractions from the 140-kDa complex to remove dithiothreitol and subjected the protein to SDS-PAGE analysis under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3). This showed that a higher molecular mass complex formed under nonreducing conditions with an approximate molecular mass of 140 kDa. The 140-kDa band occurred only when DmGCLC and DmGCLM were together and was absent when identically treated DmGCLM or DmGCLC samples were analyzed separately in the same way (Fig. 3). The 140-kDa band was notably absent in the corresponding samples analyzed under reducing conditions. These data are therefore highly suggestive that reversible disulfide linkages are involved in the association of DmGCLC with the putative DmGCLM subunit. It is interesting to note that, like the complex eluted from the gel filtration column, the estimated molecular mass of the DmGCLCÂ·DmGCLM disulfide complex is higher than the expected 110-kDa size of a homodimer. The estimated molecular mass of the DmGCL complex is more in keeping with a heterotrimeric structure. Molecular mass estimations by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE can, however, be subject to confounding factors, and further work will be required to determine the subunit stoichiometry of DmGCL. To confirm that DmGCL exists as a complex containing DmGCLC and DmGCLM in vivo and that our data did not result from an artifact of in vitro mixing, we determined whether the two subunits would co-immunoprecipitate from Drosophila S2 cell extracts. Soluble extracts from S2 cells were incubated with anti-DmGCLM antiserum and protein G-agarose beads, and the precipitate was analyzed by Western blotting using antiserum raised against DmGCLC. As shown in Fig. 4, a unique band was identified with an approximate molecular mass of 80 kDa when the immunoprecipitate was probed with antiserum raised against DmGCLC. This band was absent when the immunoprecipitation experiment was performed with the preimmune serum. The ability of endogenous DmGCLM to coprecipitate with endogenous DmGCLC from S2 cell extracts implies that DmGCLM and DmGCLC form a complex in vivo as well as in vitro. Evidence suggests that mammalian GCLM can enhance the catalytic efficiency of GCLC by increasing its affinity for its substrate l-glutamate (1Huang C.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Google Scholar,2Huang C.-S. Chang L.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Google Scholar). To determine whether DmGCLM has a similar effect on DmGCLC activity, we compared the activities of DmGCLC and the 140-kDa DmGCL holoenzyme after purification by gel filtration. DmGCLC and the DmGCL holoenzyme were found to have specific activities of 244 and 569 nmol/min/mg, respectively (calculated with respect to the amount of DmGCLC in the assay mixture) when measured using standard assay conditions with 10 mm l-glutamate. Activity was not detected in the absence of l-glutamate orl-cysteine. When l-Î±-aminobutyrate was used as substrate in place of cysteine, activity was comparatively low, even when high concentrations were used. Km andVmax values were determined forl-Î±-aminobutyrate, and the Km was found to be between 4- and 12-fold higher (TableI) than that reported for human GCL (3Misra I. Griffith O.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 268-276Google Scholar,4Tu Z.H. Anders M.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 247-254Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency of DmGCL (kcat/Km) withl-Î±-aminobutyrate as substrate is 0.53 minâ1mmâ1, implying thatl-Î±-aminobutyrate is a poor substrate for DmGCL.Table IKinetic constants for Drosophila GCLEnzymeKmkcat/KmKifor glutathionel-Glul-CysABl-Glul-CysABmmminâ1mmâ1mmDmGCLC2.88 Â± 0.085.53 Â± 0.7212.35 Â± 4.135.62 Â± 0.293.07 Â± 0.220.26 Â± 0.070.03 Â± 0.01DmGCL0.45 Â± 0.021-aSignificant differences (p < 0.05).6.55 Â± 0.4113.03 Â± 2.94100.08 Â± 2.381-aSignificant differences (p < 0.05).9.94 Â± 0.241-aSignificant differences (p < 0.05).0.53 Â± 0.10.67 Â± 0.331-aSignificant differences (p < 0.05).Kinetic constants for DmGCL are compared with those for DmGCLC and were analyzed using Student's paired t test.

AB,l-Î±-aminobutyrate. Km and Vmax values forl-glutamate and l-cysteine were determined. The apparent Km of the DmGCL holoenzyme forl-glutamate is 0.45 mm, considerably lower than that determined for DmGCLC, which is 2.88 mm (Table I).Km values for cysteine were found to be 6.55 and 5.53 mm for the DmGCL holoenzyme and DmGCLC, respectively. These values are substantially higher than the corresponding values for human GCL, for which values of between 0.1 and 0.8 mm have been reported (3Misra I. Griffith O.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 268-276Google Scholar, 4Tu Z.H. Anders M.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 247-254Google Scholar). We also examined the possibility that other amino acids could substitute for cysteine in the enzyme assay and tested a range of amino acid substrates, including methionine, alanine, serine, glycine, leucine, and lysine, in place of cysteine. We were unable to detect any GCL activity over background levels (data not shown), suggesting that these amino acids cannot be utilized instead of cysteine by DmGCL. The kcat/Km values of the holoenzyme for l-cysteine and l-glutamate are significantly higher than those of DmGCLC alone (Table I). These findings indicate that the holoenzyme is catalytically more efficient than DmGCLC and show that DmGCL is catalytically similar to mammalian GCL in that GCLM influences GCLC enzyme activity. Mammalian GCL activity can be inhibited by glutathione (2Huang C.-S. Chang L.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Google Scholar). The nature and extent of inhibition are modulated by the presence of the regulatory subunit. To determine whether a similar mechanism of regulation of GCL activity exists for DmGCL, we first examined the effect of increasing concentrations of glutathione on GCL activity under standard assay conditions (Fig. 5). DmGCLC activity was reduced by 60% in the presence of 1 mmglutathione and by 93% in the presence of 2 mmglutathione. By contrast, the holoenzyme was less susceptible to inhibition by glutathione, with 1 and 2 mm glutathione lowering activity by 32 and 58%, respectively. Higher concentrations of glutathione (10 mm) almost completely abolished the activities of both DmGCLC and the DmGCL holoenzyme. The kinetics of glutathione inhibition were studied by measuring DmGCL reaction velocities with increasing concentrations of glutamate in the presence of fixed glutathione concentrations (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mm). DmGCLC was inhibited competitively by glutathione when glutamate was the variable substrate. By contrast, the holoenzyme was subjected to mixed inhibition by glutathione. The apparent inhibition constant (Ki) values for glutathione were 0.03 mm for DmGCLC and 0.67 mm for the DmGCL holoenzyme (Table I). These findings show that DmGCLM significantly reduces the sensitivity of the catalytic subunit to inhibition by glutathione, possibly by generating a conformational change preventing access of glutathione to the active site in a manner similar to the model proposed by Meister and co-workers (2Huang C.-S. Chang L.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Google Scholar). BSO is an inhibitor of GCL and is phosphorylated by the enzyme to form an intermediate that is tightly and irreversibly bound at the active site (18Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560"
https://openalex.org/W2081892116,"Repression of transcription initiation from the two gal promoters, P1 and P2, requires binding of GalR protein to two flanking operators,OE and OI, binding of HU to a site, hbs, located between the two operators, and supercoiled DNA template. Previous experiments suggested that repression involves the interaction of two DNA-bound GalR proteins, which generates a 113-bp DNA loop encompassing the promoter region. Interaction between two DNA-bound proteins would be allowed if the binding sites on DNA are properly aligned. To test the idea that the observed repression of gal transcription in vitro is mediated by DNA looping, we investigated the effect of changing the relative angular orientation of OEand OI in the DNA helix. We found that repression is a periodic function of the distance between the two operator sites. Since repression recurred commensurate with DNA helical repeat, we conclude that the observed in vitro repression is mediated by DNA looping and the in vitro conditions reflect the in vivo situation.

DNA looping appears to be a general phenomenon in DNA transaction reactions e.g. replication, transcription regulation, site-specific recombination, DNA condensation, etc. In gene regulation, DNA looping is frequently involved in both transcription repression and activation. Looping occurs when two identical or different proteins bound to spatially separated specific sites on DNA interact directly or through a mediator or when a bidentate protein simultaneously binds to distal DNA sites. Depending on the strength of the above interactions, DNA looping may or may not require the aid of a DNA bending protein (frequently referred to as an architectural protein), which facilitates loop formation by binding to a locus between the two distal DNA sites. In the loop, the two binding sites on DNA may be oriented in parallel or in antiparallel orientation (1Adhya S. Majumdar A. Polymeropoulos M. Orosz L. Irani M. Calendar R. Gold L. Sequence Specificity in Transcription and Translation. 1985: 245-254Google Scholar, 2Friedman A. Fischmann T.O. Steitz T.

The feasibility and stability of such a DNA-multiprotein complex has been studied in several systems, including the gal,lac, and ara operons and bacteriophage Î» ofEscherichia coli. The complex formation depends on a variety of conditions: the proper angular orientation of the protein binding sites on DNA (4Lee D.-H. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because shorter DNA resists torsional change (13Shore D. Baldwin O.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), the proper angular orientation of the two binding sites is more important with relatively shorter loop size than with longer loop size. It has been suggested that a loop size of less than 150 bp strictly depends upon proper phasing of the protein binding sites, less so for 200 bp, and not at all for 400 bp and up. The precise size of the helix repeat also depends to a certain extent on the DNA sequence of the loop (9MuÌller J. Oehler S. MuÌller-Hill B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Here we report the results of the effect of changing the relative angular orientation of the binding sites, which were separated by less than 150 bp in DNA, on transcription repression in the galoperon of E. coli (14Irani M.H. Orosz L. Adhya S. Cell. 1983; 32: 783-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Previous results suggested that repression involves the formation of a DNA loop by the interaction of two GalR repressor molecules bound to specific operator sites (OE and OI), which are separated by 113 bp (Fig. 1). The GalR-GalR interaction is facilitated by the binding of a histone-like protein HU to a DNA site (hbs) between the two operators (15Aki T. Adhya S. EMBO J. 1997; 12: 3666-3674Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Lewis D.E.A. Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the two operators are located at an optimal angular orientation with respect to each other. Changing the distance even by one bp decreased repression efficiency. Repression efficiency changed with an increasing number of base pair additions or deletions in a periodic fashion commensurate with DNA helical repeat.

Plasmid pSA850 was generated by digesting pSA508 withEcoRI and PstI in the multiple cloning site region and inserting a PCR fragment, which contained the wild typegal regulatory region from â75 to +91 digested with the same enzymes. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli-competent cells (DH5Î±) obtained from Invitrogen. The plasmid DNA was purified from DH5Î± cells by following the protocol outlined in the Qiagen Midi Purification Kit. The DNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 and 280 nm. The relative ratio of supercoiled to relaxed DNA was 99:1 as determined by analyzing DNAs on a 1% agarose gel in 1Ã TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH7.8)) and quantitating the bands on Eagle Eyeâ¢ II (Stratagene). The superhelical density of pSA850 preparation was â0.062 (data not shown). When pSA850 used in vitro as a template for transcription,P1 and P2 result in the synthesis of 125- and 130-nt long RNA, respectively. 1D. E. A. Lewis and S. Adhya, manuscript in preparation.PCR-generated DNA fragments with either base pair insertions or deletions were cloned into pSA850 by replacement of the wild typegal sequence as shown in Fig.2. The relevant DNA sequence of the derivatized plasmids was determined by using ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. E. coli RNA polymerase was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The fraction of Ï-containing RNA polymerase was determined as described (20Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 21Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase (gift from Dr. Ding Jin), which was known to be 100% saturation with Ï was used as a control to determine the Ï content in the RNA polymerase preparations used in this study. RNA polymerase samples were analyzed on a 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The amount of Ï to that of Î± in RNA polymerase was determined by scanning the gel and quantitating the bands on Eagle Eyeâ¢ II. The saturation level of Ï was 84%. Since the RNA polymerase (20 nm) used in the in vitrotranscription assays was in excess of the DNA (2 nm), the saturation level of Ï would not affect the results. GalR was purified as described previously (22Majumdar A. Rudikoff S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2326-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A binding constant of 0.4 nmwas determined by a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay on a 6% nondenatured polyacrylamide gel by titrating increasing amount of GalR on a DNA fragment of 238 bp containing a single operatorOE located near the center (data not shown). The DNA fragment was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [Î³-32P]ATP. The DNA binding activity was determined to be about 30%. HU purification followed the procedures of Aki et al. (23Aki A. Choy H.E. Adhya S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription reactions were performed as follows: DNA templates (2 nm) were preincubated at 37 Â°C for 5 min in transcription buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium glutamate) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.8 units of rRNasin and 20 nm RNA polymerase in a total reaction volume of 50 Î¼l. When required, 80 nm GalR, and 80 nm HU were added. To start the transcription reactions, nucleotides were added to a final concentration of 0.1 mmGTP, 0.1 mm CTP, 0.01 mm UTP, and 5 Î¼Ci [Î±-32P]UTP. The reactions were incubated for an additional 10 min before they were terminated by the addition of an equal volume (50 Î¼l) of loading dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated to 90 Â°C for 2â3 min, chilled on ice, then loaded on an 8% sequencing gel and electrophoresed at constant power of 60 W in 1Ã TBE (89 mm Tris borate/2 mm EDTA (pH 8.3)). The gels were scanned on a PhosophoImager: 425, and the amount of transcripts were determined by using the âNext Valleyâ method of ImagequantNT. The RNAI transcripts (108 nt) were used as an internal control to quantify the relative amount of galtranscripts (24Tomizawa J. Itoh T. Selzer G. Som T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We have developed an in vitro system to study transcriptional regulation of the gal promoters by GalR and HU (18Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this system, simultaneous repression of the galpromoters by GalR is dependent upon the same conditions requiredin vivo (16Lewis D.E.A. Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar): binding of GalR to bothOE and OI, the presence of HU, and supercoiled DNA template (15Aki T. Adhya S. EMBO J. 1997; 12: 3666-3674Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Such conditions have been proposed to generate a DNA loop, which is essential for repression. Binding of GalR to OE, in the absence of HU, controls transcription initiation from the two gal promoters in the opposite directions; the regulator inhibits transcription initiation from P1, but enhances the same from P2 (18Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Goodrich J. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). OE-bound GalR makes differential contacts with RNA polymerase at P1 and P2 to bring about the dual control (26Roy S. Garges S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14059-14072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). But in the presence of HU, GalR binding to both operators represses transcription from both promoters engendering, as proposed, a DNA loop (15Aki T. Adhya S. EMBO J. 1997; 12: 3666-3674Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Aki A. Choy H.E. Adhya S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the repression ofP2 is totally dependent on the proposed DNA loop formation. We studied the spatial relationship of the two operators for the purpose of looping in our purified system by following the degree ofP2 repression as an indicator of the efficiency of DNA looping in the gal system. To systematically study the relationship of the DNA spacing between the two operators and the efficiency of DNA looping, engineered DNA templates for in vitro transcription repression were generated, which either contained 1â21 additional base pairs or were deleted for 2â12 base pairs between OE and OIat positions indicated in Fig. 2. The DNA sequence of the insertions and their immediate vicinity are shown in Fig. 2A. Note that the inserted base pairs were between the promoters andOI at position +32 relative to the transcription start site of P1 (+1); such alterations keep intact the dual regulatory relationship between OE and the promoters in the absence of DNA looping (27Choy H.E. Hanger R.R. Aki T. Mahoney M. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The results ofgal transcription on the DNA templates with insertions in the presence and absence of GalR and HU are shown in Fig.3. The transcription from P1 and P2 promoters resulted in the synthesis of two RNA species differing in size by 5 nt in each template as expected (18Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The base pair insertions between the promoters andOI, as expected, did not affect either the intrinsic transcription of P1 and P2 (Fig. 3,AâC, lane 1 and every third lane thereafter) or the opposite regulation of the promoters by GalR (Fig. 3,AâC, lane 2 and every third lane thereafter). Transcription from P1 was uniformly repressed in the presence of GalR alone in all of the templates because of the binding of the repressor to OE. However, an enhancement of transcription of the P2 promoter in the reactions was not apparent as expected; the amount of RNA synthesis from P2 seemed to be repressed in some of the cases, for example, in the DNA template that carried a 5-bp insertion (Fig. 3A, lane 17). The observed reduction in the amount of full-lengthP2 RNA in specific templates in the absence of HU was because of frequent transcriptional âroad blockâ by GalR bound to OI, resulting in the synthesis of shorter P2 RNA molecules as indicated in Fig.3.1 When both full-length RNA and RNA generated by the road block were taken into account, GalR bound toOE enhanced transcription from P2 in all of the templates tested except the one with 17 bp insertion (quantitative data not shown). The reason for the anomalous behavior of the template with 17 bp insertion is not known.Figure 3The results of gel electrophoresis of thegal RNA made in vitro from DNA templates with base pair insertions (details under âExperimental Proceduresâ) in the presence and absence of GalR and HU at the concentrations indicated. The numbers at the top show the number of base pairs inserted between OE andOI (see Fig. 2A). Thearrows, marked P1 and P2, are RNA made from the two gal promoters; the arrow, marked RNA1, show the two RNA species made from a control promoter (rep) also present in the plasmids; the bracket, marked RB of P2, shows the RNA molecules made fromP2 but prematurely terminated by GalR bound toOI.

(C) DNA templates with 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21 bp insertions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of transcription repression of P2 in the presence of HU on mutant DNA templates that contained additional base pairs between the two operators are shown in Fig. 3, AâC,lane 3 and every third lane thereafter. The amount ofP2 transcription (both full-length and road-block) in the presence of HU relative to that in the absence of HU, reflecting the extent of looping in these templates, are shown graphically in Fig. 5. In the wild type template, P2 was repressed as expected. AsOI was rotated around the DNA helix with respect to OE by inserting 1â5 bp, P2 repression became progressively weaker with maximum derepression being observed in the case of the 5 bp insertion, indicating that the relative angular orientation of the two operators are critical for repression of P2. Moreover, the repression of P2 gradually restored when the distance between OEand OI was further increased by 6â10 bp, restoration of repression being maximal with 10 bp addition. The periodic pattern of derepression and repression was repeated when the spatial separation between OE andOI was further increased in the same stepwise manner to 21 bp. In other words, repression recurred in a periodic fashion with maxima when OE andOI were separated by 113 bp or 123 bp, and with minima when the operators were 119 bp or 130 bp apart (see Fig. 5). The DNA sequence of the templates with stepwise deletions are shown in Fig. 2B. It is important to point out that base pairs were deleted betweenOE and the promoters, thus changing the response of transcription from P1 and P2 to GalR bound toOE (27Choy H.E. Hanger R.R. Aki T. Mahoney M. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast to the results with base pair additions between the promoters and OI, the pattern of intrinsic transcription from P1 and P2 in the absence of GalR and HU in the templates with base pair deletions were somewhat different (Fig. 4,lane 1 and every third lane thereafter). Whereas transcription from P2 was only slightly lowered or enhanced, transcription from P1 was significantly lowered with most of the templates with base pairs deleted upstream for an unknown reason, although P1 is located further downstream than P2 relative to the deleted segments. We also note that because the angular orientations of the two promoters relative to OEin these templates changed in a periodic fashion, the opposite regulatory effect of GalR bound to OE upon transcription also changed in parallel (Fig. 4, lane 2 and every third lane thereafter) (27Choy H.E. Hanger R.R. Aki T. Mahoney M. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As expected, the transcription from P2 was alternately enhanced and inhibited and that from P1 inhibited and enhanced, by gradually changing the relative angular orientation between P2 and OE. Because of these periodic variations, the potential for DNA looping was quantified by measuring the total amount of transcription from P1 andP2 in the presence of both GalR and HU (Fig. 4, lane 3 and every third thereafter) relative to that in the presence of GalR alone for each DNA template (Fig.5). The results showed that, as in the case of base pair additions, progressive deletions of 2â12 bp between the two operators affected repression in a periodic fashion; for example, repression was lifted by deletion of 5 bp and reoccurred by removal of 10 bp (Fig. 5). A structure-based genetic study of the interaction of the two operator-bound GalR dimers defined the GalR dimer interface (3Geanacopoulos M. Vasmatzis G. Zhurkin V.B. Adhya S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The interfacial interaction results in a stacked V-shaped, tetramer. Stereochemical model building of the proposed loop in galDNA and the evaluation of the DNA elastic energies strongly supported a DNA loop in which the two operator-bound GalR dimers, stacked in the V-shape, adopts an antiparallel orientation. The results presented here show a periodic dependence of repression of gal operon transcription with incremental (both increasing and decreasing) changes in the length of the DNA between the two GalR binding sites. The observed periodicity (Fig. 5) is identical to the helical repeat of B-DNA, showing that our in vitro regulatory system engenders transcription repression, as proposed, by DNA looping in the presence of GalR and HU. The role of HU in assembling the loop in galis architectural and involves a protein-protein contact between HU and GalR (3Geanacopoulos M. Vasmatzis G. Zhurkin V.B. Adhya S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Kar S. Adhya S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition to HU, DNA looping by GalR also needs supercoiled DNA template both in vivo and in vitro (16Lewis D.E.A. Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Aki A. Choy H.E. Adhya S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that such requirements provide architectural help because the two operators in the wild type DNA are not spaced apart favorable for efficient looping. However, none of the DNA templates, engineered to have incrementally increased or decreased distance between the two operators, became independent of HU (as described here) or the requirement of supercoiled DNA (data not shown). Thus, the distance of 113 bp between OE andOI in wild type is not a suboptimal situation requiring architectural help from HU and/or DNA supercoiling. DNA looping as a periodic function of the DNA length between the two GalR binding sites also allowed estimation of the size of a DNA helical turn under in vitro conditions to be â¼10 bp. A helix repeat of 10.5 bp has also been found in DNA looping by bacteriophage Î»cI and E. coli LacI repressors in vitro (6KraÌmer H. NiemoÌller M. Amouyal M. Revet B. von Wicken-Bergmann G. MuÌller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,7Hochschild A. Ptashne M. Cell. 1986; 44: 681-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Dependence of loop formation on the relative angular orientation of the two protein binding sites in a periodic fashion and thereby estimation of the size of the helix repeat has also been studied in several systems in vivo including an artificial construct in which a heterologous promoter was spanned by gal operators,OE and OI (4Lee D.-H. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Law S.M. Bellomy G.R. Schlax P.J. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol.

The size of a DNA helical turn by in vivo estimation was shown to be within 11.0â11.3 bp. The in vitro results of DNA helix size, based upon protein-mediated DNA looping, are consistent with the estimation of the helix size of about 10.5 bp by different in vitro assay systems in other cases using both circular and linear DNA (31Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 32Tullius T.D.

Thus, there is a discrepancy of about one base pair in helix size of DNA structure in vitro andin vivo. The reason for the difference needs further investigation.

We set out to identify residues involved in pHi sensing to gain insight into the general mechanisms of signaling employed by the chemoreceptors. Characterization of various chimeras of Tsr and Tar localized the pHi-sensing region to Arg259âHis267 of Tar and Gly261âAsp269 of Tsr. This region of Tar contains three charged residues (Arg259âSer261, Asp263, and His267) that have counterparts of opposite charge in Tsr (Gly261âGlu262, Arg265, and Asp269). The replacement of all of the three charged residues in Tar or Arg259âSer260 alone by the corresponding residues of Tsr reversed the polarity of pHiresponse, whereas the replacement of Asp263 or His267 did not change the polarity but altered the time course of pHi response.

Therefore, cells have to sense and adapt to changes in extracellular and intracellular pH. Despite the accumulated knowledge about pH-dependent regulation in a wide variety of organisms, the molecular mechanisms of pH sensing are still poorly understood. Behavioral responses of Escherichia coli andSalmonella typhimurium to changes in pH provide a convenient system for studying the pH-sensing mechanism. These bacteria show repellent responses to weak acids and attractant responses to weak bases (1Repaske D.R. Adler J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1196-1208Google Scholar, 2Kihara M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1209-1221Google Scholar). These responses are generated by decreases and increases of cytoplasmic pH (pHi).1 The changes in pHi were documented by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (3Slonczewski J.L. Rosen B.P. Alger J.R. Macnab R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6271-6275Google Scholar, 4Slonczewski J.L. Macnab R.M. Alger J.R. Castle A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 384-399Google Scholar). Usually, pHi in E. coli is maintained at around 7.5 over a range of extracellular pH (pHo) values from 5.0 to 9.0 (3Slonczewski J.L. Rosen B.P. Alger J.R. Macnab R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6271-6275Google Scholar, 5Padan E. Zilberstein D. Schuldiner S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 650: 151-166Google Scholar). However, this strong pHi homeostasis can be disrupted by the addition of weak acids or weak bases to the culture medium. When pHo is lower than pHi, weak acids can traverse the membrane in their protonated (uncharged) form and release protons in the cytoplasm to decrease pHi. Similarly, when pHo is higher than pHi, weak bases can traverse the membrane in deprotonated (uncharged) forms and capture protons in the cytoplasm to increase pHi. These changes in pHi correlate well with tactic responses to weak acids and weak bases (4Slonczewski J.L. Macnab R.M. Alger J.R. Castle A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 384-399Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathway for chemotaxis in E. coliand S. typhimurium has been extensively studied at the molecular level (for reviews, see Refs. 6Parkinson J.S.

These organisms have a set of related methyl-accepting chemoreceptors that includes the serine receptor Tsr and the aspartate receptor Tar. These receptors have a remarkable ability to sense a variety of stimuli, including chemoattractants, chemorepellents, temperature, and pH. Tar and, presumably, the other chemoreceptors exist as a homodimer of about 60-kDa subunits (10Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Google Scholar). The dimeric cytoplasmic domains form stable complexes with the histidine kinase CheA and the adaptor protein CheW (11Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Google Scholar, 12Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Google Scholar). Furthermore, the receptors, together with the CheA and CheW proteins, cluster at a cell pole (13Maddock J.R. Shapiro L. Science. 1993; 259: 1717-1723Google Scholar). CheA phosphorylates itself and then serves as a phosphodonor for the response regulator CheY. The phosphorylated form of CheY interacts with the flagellar motor to promote clockwise rotation, which results in tumbling behavior by the cell. Without phospho-CheY bound, the motor rotates counterclockwise, which results in smooth swimming of the cell. Binding of an attractant to a receptor inhibits the associated CheA kinase, reducing the level of phospho-CheY and promoting smooth swimming. In principle, any step in this signal transduction pathway can be influenced by pH. In fact, the activity of the histidine kinase CheA depends sharply on pH (14Conley M.P. Berg H.C. Tawa P. Stewart R.C. Ellefson D.D. Wolfe A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3870-3877Google Scholar). However, the chemoreceptors have been considered to be the primary sensors for pHi, because the two major chemoreceptors, Tsr and Tar, have opposite pHi-sensing properties (15Krikos A. Conley M.P. Boyd A. Berg H.C. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1326-1330Google Scholar). When expressed as a sole chemoreceptor, Tsr mediates repellent and attractant responses to decreases and increases in pHi, respectively, whereas under these conditions Tar mediates the responses with opposite polarity. These receptors also sense changes in pHo (15Krikos A. Conley M.P. Boyd A. Berg H.C. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1326-1330Google Scholar). Moreover, the minor chemoreceptors Trg and Tap mediate Tar- and Tsr-type responses, respectively, to changes in pHi when they are expressed as the sole chemoreceptor (16Yamamoto K. Macnab R.M. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 383-388Google Scholar). In a wild-type E. coli cell, pHi responses mediated by Tsr predominate, presumably because Tsr is the most abundant chemoreceptor. In Vibrio cholerae, the related TcpI receptor is responsible for the pHo-dependent regulation of the expression of the toxin-coregulated pilus (17HaÌse C.C. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 730-734Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability to sense pH might be an intrinsic property of this receptor family. It is not clear why Tar and Tsr are different in their pH-sensing properties. However, this difference is very useful in understanding the mechanisms of receptor signaling. Krikos et al. (15Krikos A. Conley M.P. Boyd A. Berg H.C. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1326-1330Google Scholar) showed that the cytoplasmic regions of Tar (residues 256â468) and Tsr (residues 258â470) are responsible for their differential pHi-sensing properties. Furthermore, Oosawa et al.(18Oosawa K. Mutoh N. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2521-2526Google Scholar) showed that cells expressing a C-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of Tar (residues 256â553) can mediate responses to a weak acid, indicating that this fragment suffices for modulating the activity of CheA kinase in response to changes in pHi. In this study, we constructed a new series of chimeric receptors between Tar and Tsr and identified their pHi-sensing regions. Subsequent mutational analysis revealed the key residues: When these residues were swapped between Tar and Tsr, the pHi response was inverted. All strains used in this study are derivatives of E. coli K-12. Strain HCB339 (Î(tar-tap)5021 Îtsr-7028 trg::Tn10 thr leu his met rpsL136 (19Wolfe A.J. Conley M.P. Kramer T.J. Berg H.C. J.

Kawagishi, unpublished. which carry the tar and tsr genes, respectively, were constructed by subcloning the EcoRI fragments of pLAN931 and pLAN1031 (21Tatsuno I. Lee L. Kawagishi I. Homma M. Imae Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 755-762Google Scholar) into the EcoRI site of pSU18 (22BartolomeÌ B. Jubete Y. Martinez E. Cruz F.D. Gene. 1991; 102: 75-78Google Scholar). Plasmid pSU18 was digested with PstI and SacI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo), and ligated with aBglII linker to yield plasmid pSU18ÎPS, which lacks theKpnI site in the multicloning site.2 Plasmid pFH1012 was constructed by subcloning thetar-containing fragment of pLAN931 into the EcoRI site of pSU18ÎPS. Plasmids pAB157, pAB160, pTsar-Cla, and pTsar-Nde carrying the chimeric genes encoding Tasr-468, Tasr-256, Tsar-468, and Tsar-256, respectively, were provided by M. I. Simon of the California Institute of Technology (15Krikos A. Conley M.P. Boyd A. Berg H.C. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1326-1330Google Scholar). 3M. I. Simon, personal communication. The pUC118-based plasmids, which encode the Tar-Tsr hybrids Tasr-502, Tasr-441, Tasr431, Tasr-375, and Tasr-309 (Tar residue numbering), were constructed by spontaneous homologous recombination betweentar and tsr genes placed in tandem (23Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Google Scholar). Similarly, the pUC118-based plasmids that encode the Tsr-Tar hybrids Tsar-470, Tsar-441, Tsar-412, Tsar-354, and Tsar-309 were constructed by homologous recombination between tandem tsr andtar genes. The HindIII-EcoRI fragments containing the chimeric receptor genes from these plasmids were subcloned into the multicloning site of the medium copy number plasmid pSU18. To construct the sandwiched chimeric Tar (Tasar) and the point-mutant Tar receptors, oligonucleotide-based cassette mutagenesis was carried out as follows. We designed pairs of mutagenic oligonucleotides with overlapped regions of about 20 nucleotides at their 3â²-ends (synthesized by Sawadi Technology Co., Tokyo). Each pair of oligonucleotides was used for polymerase chain reaction with ExTaq polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto) to replace the wild-type sequence of the tar gene. The resulting fragments were digested withNdeI and KpnI and subcloned into the corresponding region of pFH101 to yield plasmids encoding the desired chimeric or mutant receptors. The plasmid encoding Tsasr was constructed in a similar fashion using the NdeI andBssHII sites of the tsr gene. The DNA sequences were verified by the dideoxy chain-termination method using reagents from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Swarming ability was determined as described previously (24Umemura T. Tatsuno I. Shibasaki M. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30110-30115Google Scholar) using Tryptone semisolid agar (1% Tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.25% agar) or minimal semisolid agar (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm glycerol, 0.1 mm each of threonine, leucine, histidine, and methionine, 1 mg/ml thiamine, 1 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.25% agar) supplemented with 0.1 mm aspartic acid. Chloramphenicol (25 Î¼g/ml) was added as required. Semisolid agar was inoculated with aliquots of overnight cultures (about 4 Ã 106 cells) and incubated at 30 Â°C. The temporal stimulation assay was carried out essentially as described previously (25Nishiyama S. Nara T. Imae Y. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6573-6580Google Scholar) with some modification. Changes in cytoplasmic pH (pHi) were elicited by the addition of sodium benzoate or acetate (2Kihara M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1209-1221Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 Â°C in TG broth (1% Tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) glycerol) with chloramphenicol. Cells were harvested at late exponential phase, washed twice with motility medium (MGM) adjusted to pH 6.0 or pH 7.4 (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmmethionine, 1 mm glycerol), and resuspended in MGM at room temperature. Serine, sodium aspartate, or sodium benzoate (pH 6.0) was added to the cell suspension, and aliquots were taken at intervals for microscopic observation. The swimming pattern of the cells was observed with a dark-field microscope and recorded on videotape. The smooth-swimming fraction of the cells was determined by analysis of the video recording with an Argus-10 image processor (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Shizuoka). Receptor expression and methylation were examined by immunoblot analysis as described previously (26Okumura H. Nishiyama S. Sasaki A. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1862-1868Google Scholar) with slight modification. To narrow down the pHi-sensing regions, we created a new series of chimeric receptors by spontaneous homologous recombination between the tar and tsrgenes placed in tandem on linearized plasmids (23Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric receptors, of which the N- and C-terminal regions were derived either from Tar and Tsr, were named Tasr, using the Tar residue at the junction point to differentiate different hybrids. Similarly, the chimeric receptors with the N-terminal Tsr sequences and the C-terminal Tar sequences were named Tsar, using the same nomenclature with Tar residue numbers. 4In this report, we adopt this system to rename the published and unpublished chimeric receptors obtained from M. I. Simon. The chimeric plasmid-borne genes were introduced into strain HCB339, which lacks the four chemoreceptors Tsr, Tar, Trg, and Tap. The resulting transformants were tested for their swarming ability. In Tryptone semisolid agar, cells expressing any Tasr or Tsar protein formed swarm rings, suggesting that the chimeric receptors were expressed and supported chemotaxis. We then examined their pHi-sensing properties in the temporal stimulation assay. Cells expressing wild-type Tar, or Tasr-309, -431, -441, or -502, showed attractant responses to a decrease in pHi(Fig. 1). Cells expressing Tasr-256 showed a repellent response, like cells expressing wild-type Tsr. On the other hand, cells expressing wild-type Tsr or Tsar-309, -354, -412, or -441 showed repellent responses to a decrease in pHi. Cells expressing Tsar-256 showed an attractant response to the same stimulation. These results suggest that residues 256â309 of Tar and residues 258â311 of Tsr are responsible for pHi sensing. To confirm that the identified region is responsible for pHi sensing, we constructed two âsandwich-typeâ chimeric receptors, Tasar-256â278 and Tasar-256â267, in which short stretches of the cytoplasmic domain of Tar were replaced by the corresponding Tsr sequences. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that these sandwiched chimeras were expressed at levels comparable to wild-type Tar (Fig.2). HCB339 cells expressing these mutant proteins were tested for their swarming ability (Fig.3). Additionally, we tested the attractant responses of these cells to aspartate directly by the temporal stimulation assay (Fig. 4). In minimal semisolid agar containing aspartate, cells expressing Tasar-256â278 produced a swarm ring comparable to that of wild-type Tar. However, Tasar-256â267 did not support swarming. This defect in swarming could be due to a defect in adaptation, because the temporal stimulation assay showed that the chimeric receptor retained aspartate-sensing ability.Figure 3Swarming abilities of HCB339 cells expressing the sandwiched chimeric Tar (Tasar) and the point-mutant Tar receptors. Aliquots (2 Î¼l of each) of overnight cultures were spotted onto minimal semisolid agar containing 0.1 mmaspartate and 25 Î¼g/ml chloramphenicol. The plate was incubated at 30 Â°C for 20 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Aspartate-sensing ability of the sandwiched Tar chimeras (Tasar) and the point-mutant Tar receptors.Immediately after the addition of 10% glycerol, various concentrations of aspartate were added to a suspension of HCB339 cells expressing wild-type Tar (closed circles), Tasar-256â278 (closed squares), Tasar-256â267 (open squares), Tar-R259G/S260E (open circles), Tar-D263R (open triangles), Tar-H267D (open diamonds), and Tar-R259G/S260E/D263R/H267D (closed triangles). After 20 s, the percentage of smooth-swimming cells was determined. âBasalâ indicates the smooth-swimming fraction in the absence of aspartate and glycerol. For simplicity, lines are drawn only for wild-type Tar, Tasar-256â278, Tar-R259/S260E, and Tar-R259G/S260E/D263R/H267D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then examined the responses of cells expressing the Tasar receptors to a decrease in pHi in the temporal stimulation assay. Typical time courses of responses mediated by wild-type Tar, wild-type Tsr, and the two Tasar chimeric receptors are shown in Fig. 4. When the pHo is 6.0, cells expressing wild-type Tar and Tsr showed attractant and repellent responses, respectively, after the addition of 3 mm sodium benzoate (pH 6.0). Cells expressing either of the two chimeric receptors (Tasar-256â278 and 256â267) showed weak repellent responses (i.e. Tsr-type responses) (Fig.5). Essentially similar responses were observed for another weak acid, acetate (data not shown). These results indicate that the sequence from His256 to His267 of Tar and the corresponding sequence from His258 to Asp269 of Tsr are involved in pHi sensing. Because the tripeptide sequence His256-Met257-Gln258 of Tar is perfectly conserved in Tsr, the nonapeptide sequences (Arg259âHis267 of Tar and Gly261âAsp269 of Tsr), in which three residues are conserved between Tar and Tsr, must be relevant (see Fig. 7). However, the responses mediated by the two chimeric receptors were weaker and more transient than that mediated by wild-type Tsr. Some other residues may be required for a complete Tsr-type response, or these chimeric receptors may be somewhat impaired in a general receptor function, such as adaptation.Figure 7Amino acid sequences of the predicted pHi-sensing regions of Tar and Tsr. These regions (256) were implicated in pHi taxis based on the results presented in Figs. 5 and 6. The second structures of these regions of Tar have been studied by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis (31Danielson M.A. Bass R.B. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32878-32888Google Scholar).Numbering of the residues corresponds to Tar. Shaded letters indicate the Tsr sequence. Boxes indicate pairs of residues that have opposite charges in Tar and Tsr. The sandwiched chimeras and point-mutant Tar receptors constructed in this study are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that this region is responsible for the type of pHi sensing, we also constructed the complementary sandwiched chimeric receptor, Tsasr-256â319. Expression of this receptor in strain HCB339 and its function as a serine chemoreceptor were confirmed by immunoblotting and in the swarm assay and the temporal stimulation assay, as described for the Tasar receptors (data not shown). As expected, HCB339 cells expressing this receptor showed attractant responses to decreases in pHi (Fig.6). Essentially similar responses were observed for another weak acid, acetate (data not shown). Thus, Tsasr mediates a Tar-type (or inverted) response to a decrease in pHi. Sequence alignment of the pHi-sensing regions of Tar and Tsr revealed three pairs of residues with opposite charges in Tar and Tsr (Fig.7). These residues seemed good candidates to be directly involved in pHi sensing. Therefore, we replaced these three sites in Tar (Arg259/Ser260, Asp263, and His267) by the corresponding residues in Tsr (Gly261/Glu262, Arg265, and Asp269), either individually or in combination. Immunoblotting analysis showed that these proteins were expressed in levels comparable to wild-type Tar (Fig. 2). Their abilities to support chemotaxis were examined in the swarm assay (Fig.3). The mutant Tar receptors supported formation of swarm rings in minimal semisolid agar containing aspartate. In the temporal stimulation assay for pHi taxis, cells expressing the âtripleâ mutant (Tar-R259G/S260E/D263R/H267D) or one of the âsingleâ mutants (Tar-R259G/S260E) showed repellent responses to a decrease in pHi, although the duration of these responses was much shorter than that mediated by wild-type Tsr (Fig.8). Thus, swapping of the two consecutive residues Arg259 and Ser260 of Tar with the corresponding residues of Tsr inverted the polarity of pHisensing. In contrast, cells expressing Tar-D263R or Tar-H267D still gave attractant responses to a decrease in pHi. However, the response mediated by the H267D mutant Tar was delayed both in its onset and its completion than the response mediated by wild-type Tar. The response mediated by the triple mutant Tar receptor appeared to combine the Tsr-type response of Tar-R259G/S260E and the slow response of Tar-H267D. Essentially similar responses were observed for another weak acid, acetate (data not shown). These results suggest that residues Arg259-Ser260 of Tar and Gly261-Glu262 of Tsr play important roles in determining the polarity of pHi sensing and that His267 of Tar and Asp269 of Tsr might also be involved in modulating the response to changes in pHi. In this study, we constructed and characterized various Tar/Tsr and Tsr/Tar chimeric receptors and identified the pHi-sensing region of the chemoreceptors. We also identified the key residue in the receptors that determines the polarity of the pHiresponse. The activities of some of the cytoplasmic signal-transducing proteins, CheA, CheB, CheR, and CheY (14Conley M.P. Berg H.C. Tawa P. Stewart R.C. Ellefson D.D. Wolfe A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3870-3877Google Scholar, 27Borczuk A. Staub A. Stock J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 918-923Google Scholar, 28Silversmith R.E. Appleby J.L. Bourret R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14965-14974Google Scholar, 29Mayover T.L. Halkides C.J. Stewart R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2259-2271Google Scholar) vary with pH in vitro, and the other signal-transducing proteins may also be affected by pH. However, because strain HCB339, which lacks the four chemoreceptors but has all of the cytoplasmic signal-transducing proteins, was used as the plasmid host throughout this study, the differences in pHi-sensing among the strains carrying the various plasmids can be attributed to the chemoreceptors they produce. To define the region responsible for pH sensing, we constructed a series of chimeric receptors between Tar and Tsr, using homologous recombination between two tandem receptor genes on linearized plasmids. This method can create a wide variety of chimeras between two homologous proteins, because it does not require restriction sites to be present at the chimeric junctions. The secondary structure of the cytoplasmic region of Tar has been predicted by the sequence alignment and its close examination of the related receptors (30Le Moual H. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 568-585Google Scholar, 31Danielson M.A. Bass R.B. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32878-32888Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a cytoplasmic fragment (residues 286â526) of Tsr was solved (32Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Google Scholar), but the fragment does not contain the pHi-sensing region identified in this study (residues 258â280 of Tsr). However, chemical modification and disulfide cross-linking of a series of mutant receptors generated by site-directed introduction of cysteine residues (31Danielson M.A. Bass R.B. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32878-32888Google Scholar, 33Chen X. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11858-11864Google Scholar, 34Bass R.B. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25006-25014Google Scholar, 35Bass R.B. Falke J.J. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 829-840Google Scholar, 36Butler S.L. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10746-10756Google Scholar) have given us a fairly clear picture of the three-dimensional structure of this region. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis located Arg259 of Tar on the solvent-exposed face and Ser260 on the buried face of a short helix connecting the second transmembrane helix (TM2) to the first methylation helix (MH1) (31Danielson M.A. Bass R.B. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32878-32888Google Scholar). More recently, disulfide scanning revealed that Ser260 of one subunit faces toward Ser260 of the partner subunit of the Tar homodimer (35Bass R.B. Falke J.J. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 829-840Google Scholar). This arrangement might be slightly different in Tsr, because its counterparts for Arg259 and Ser260 of Tar are Gly261 and Glu262, respectively (Fig. 7). Several inverted responses mediated by Tsr, Tar, and other chemoreceptors have been reported. Responses to temperature mediated by Tar are inverted when Tar becomes methylated after the addition of aspartate (25Nishiyama S. Nara T. Imae Y. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6573-6580Google Scholar, 37Nara T. Kawagishi I. Nishiyama S. Homma M. Imae Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17932-17936Google Scholar, 38Nishiyama S. Umemura T. Nara T. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 357-365Google Scholar) or when certain mutations are introduced into TM2 (39Nishiyama S. Maruyama I.N. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1275-1284Google Scholar). Responses of S. typhimurium to pH (2Kihara M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1209-1221Google Scholar) and ofE. coli to oxygen (40Dang C.V. Niwano M. Ryu J.-I. Taylor B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 275-280Google Scholar) are inverted when the cheBgene is deleted. These inverted responses might result from hypermethylation of the most abundant chemoreceptor, Tsr, in the absence of the methylesterase CheB. Tsr also plays a role in aerotaxis (41Rebbapragada A. Johnson M.S. Harding G.P. Zuccarelli A.J. Fletcher H.M. Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10541-10546Google Scholar, 42Zhulin I.B. Johnson M.S. Taylor B.L. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 335-342Google Scholar). These examples of inverted responses seem to involve changes in the interaction between the methylation helices (MHs) of the relevant receptors (25Nishiyama S. Nara T. Imae Y. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6573-6580Google Scholar). The residues identified in this study are located in the C-terminal part of the linker region, i.e.the predicted helix and turn preceding MH1, and, therefore, they may regulate the signaling state by altering the interactions among MHs. However, it should be noted that these residues are not necessarily pH sensor residues, although they are responsible for differential responses between Tar and Tsr. What is the mechanism of pHi sensing? Binding of a chemoattractant to a chemoreceptor is believed to trigger a subtle but critical inward movement of a continuous helix consisting of helix 4 of the periplasmic domain and TM2 (Ref. 43Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 257-265Google Scholar and references therein), which in turn may induce a critical movement of MH, which is the central processing unit for control of the cytoplasmic histidine kinase CheA (44Trammell M.A. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 329-336Google Scholar). A simple scenario may be that protonation and deprotonation at one or more residues alter the interactions between MHs. However, this cannot be the whole story. For example, the pKa value of the guanidino group of arginine is 12.48, which is much higher than the physiological pH. Possible explanations to resolve this difficulty include: (i) The pKa of Arg256 is somehow decreased to a physiological range; (ii) Arg256 interacts with one or more other residues that accept a proton to alter its interaction with Arg256; and (iii) the absolute value of pHi might not be the actual signal that is sensed by the chemoreceptors. Although previous studies indicated that changes in pHi serve as chemotactic stimuli (4Slonczewski J.L. Macnab R.M. Alger J.R. Castle A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 384-399Google Scholar), bacterial cells respond to other signals such as changes in proton motive force, oxidation-reduction potential, and membrane potential (45Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 683-690Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in pHi may affect one or more of these factors, which are sensed by the chemoreceptors. For example, changes in membrane potential would affect the conformation of the linker region and hence the signaling state of the chemoreceptors without involving protonation or deprotonation of the charged residues in the linker region. The presence of opposite charges between Tar and Tsr would result in their opposite polarity of signaling. The chemoreceptor forms a ternary complex with CheA and the adaptor protein CheW (11Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Google Scholar, 12Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Google Scholar) and is localized to the pole of the rod-shaped cell (13Maddock J.R. Shapiro L. Science. 1993; 259: 1717-1723Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic fragment of Tar fused to a leucine-zipper forms a well defined supramolecular structure in association with CheA and CheW, and the degree of methylation of the receptor is critical for the stability of the complex (46Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M.G. Stock J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Google Scholar). A hexagonal receptor-kinase network has been proposed (47Shimizu T.S. Le NoveÌre N. Levin M.D. Beavil A.J. Sutton B.J. Bray D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 792-796Google Scholar) based on the crystallographic trimer of dimers of the cytoplasmic fragment of Tsr (32Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Google Scholar). Moreover, the rate of formation of the receptorÂ·CheWÂ·CheA complex is greater than that had been expected and is affected by the ligand, raising the possibility that assembly/disassembly of the ternary complex is involved in signaling and adaptation (48Li G. Weis R.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 357-365Google Scholar). Therefore, interactions within and/or among receptor-kinase complexes might also play critical roles in pH sensing, as has been suggested for receptor signaling and/or signal amplification (Ref. 9Levit M.N. Liu Y. Stock J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 459-466Google Scholar and references therein). In any case, the mechanism of pHi sensing seems to be closely related to general receptor function. In this regard, it is intriguing that the linker region is suggested to be involved in sensing of pHi. Because of the high degree of sequence similarity of this regions among the related chemoreceptors and its location between TM2 and MH1, it has been speculated that this region may play a critical, but perhaps rather passive, role in transmembrane signaling (e.g. Refs. 8Falke J.J. Bass R.B. Butler S.L. Chervitz S.A. Danielson M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 457-512Google Scholar, 9Levit M.N. Liu Y. Stock J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 459-466Google Scholar), although a model involving two amphipathic helices in this region has been proposed (49Williams S.B. Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1093-1102Google Scholar). For the first time, this report presents experimental evidence that associates this âlinkerâ region to a particular receptor function. Our results raise the possibility that changes in pHi, and possibly other stimuli, alter the conformation of this part of the receptor and/or affect the way that it interacts with other polypeptides within or outside of the receptor dimer or with the membrane. Determination, of such changes in conformation and/or interactions involved in the pHi response in an in vitro system that reproduces the in vivo responses, should provide a valuable insight into the general mechanism of signaling mediated by chemoreceptors.

https://openalex.org/W2093546160,"The cytochrome bc1complex is a dimeric enzyme that links electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c by a protonmotive Q cycle mechanism in which ubiquinol is oxidized at one center in the enzyme, referred to as center P, and ubiquinone is re-reduced at a second center, referred to as center N. To understand better the mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation, we have examined the interaction of several inhibitory analogs of ubiquinol with the yeast cytochrome bc1complex. Stigmatellin and methoxyacrylate stilbene, two inhibitors that block ubiquinol oxidation at center P, inhibit the yeast enzyme with a stoichiometry of 0.5 perbc1 complex, indicating that one molecule of inhibitor is sufficient to fully inhibit the dimeric enzyme. This stoichiometry was obtained when the inhibitors were titrated in cytochrome c reductase assays and in reactions of quinol with enzyme in which the inhibitors block pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b. As an independent measure of inhibitor binding, we titrated the red shift in the optical spectrum of ferrocytochrome b with methoxyacrylate stilbene and thus confirmed the results of the inhibition of activity titrations. The titration curves also indicate that the binding is anti-cooperative, in that a second molecule of inhibitor binds with much lower affinity to a dimer in which an inhibitor molecule is already bound. Because these inhibitors bind to the ubiquinol oxidation site in thebc1 complex, we propose that the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex oxidizes ubiquinol by an alternating, half-of-the-sites mechanism. The cytochrome bc1complex is a dimeric enzyme that links electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c by a protonmotive Q cycle mechanism in which ubiquinol is oxidized at one center in the enzyme, referred to as center P, and ubiquinone is re-reduced at a second center, referred to as center N. To understand better the mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation, we have examined the interaction of several inhibitory analogs of ubiquinol with the yeast cytochrome bc1complex. Stigmatellin and methoxyacrylate stilbene, two inhibitors that block ubiquinol oxidation at center P, inhibit the yeast enzyme with a stoichiometry of 0.5 perbc1 complex, indicating that one molecule of inhibitor is sufficient to fully inhibit the dimeric enzyme. This stoichiometry was obtained when the inhibitors were titrated in cytochrome c reductase assays and in reactions of quinol with enzyme in which the inhibitors block pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b. As an independent measure of inhibitor binding, we titrated the red shift in the optical spectrum of ferrocytochrome b with methoxyacrylate stilbene and thus confirmed the results of the inhibition of activity titrations. The titration curves also indicate that the binding is anti-cooperative, in that a second molecule of inhibitor binds with much lower affinity to a dimer in which an inhibitor molecule is already bound. Because these inhibitors bind to the ubiquinol oxidation site in thebc1 complex, we propose that the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex oxidizes ubiquinol by an alternating, half-of-the-sites mechanism. methoxyacrylate decyl ubiquinol Electron transfer through the cytochromebc1 complex occurs by the protonmotive Q cycle mechanism in which ubiquinol is oxidized at one center, referred to as center P, and ubiquinone is re-reduced at a second center, referred to as center N (1Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the bovine (2Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J.

Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Google Scholar) cytochrome bc1 complexes have revealed that the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1complex is a symmetrical dimer. The role of the dimeric structure in the Q cycle mechanism is not fully understood. It is not known whether each monomer operates independently or whether there is electron transfer between the two monomers. There are numerous inhibitors that block electron transfer within thebc1 complex by acting specifically at center P or center N. The so-called Qp inhibitors block oxidation of ubiquinol at center P and prevent reduction of the high potential redox centers of the bc1 complex. Stigmatellin, hydroxyquinones, and methoxyacrylates such as myxothiazol and MOA1 stilbene, all act at center P (6Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Method Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar). The Qn inhibitors block re-reduction of ubiquinone by cytochrome b at center N and block reduction of cytochromeb that otherwise can occur by reversal of this reaction. Antimycin, one of the most extensively studied inhibitors of thebc1 complex, acts at center N (6Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Method Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar, 7Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 301: 129-154Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, we show that some of the inhibitors that block ubiquinol oxidation at center P inhibit the yeast enzyme with a stoichiometry of 0.5 per bc1 complex, indicating that one molecule of inhibitor is sufficient to fully inhibit the dimeric enzyme. The titration curves also indicate that the binding is anti-cooperative, in that a second molecule of inhibitor binds with markedly lower affinity to the dimer in which an inhibitor molecule is already bound. As an independent measure of inhibitor binding, we titrated the red shift in the optical spectrum of ferrocytochrome b with MOA stilbene and found that the inhibitor binds to the dimeric enzyme at two sites with two very different affinities, consistent with a model in which a second molecule of inhibitor does not bind to an enzyme dimer until all of the dimers are occupied by one inhibitor. To test the possible involvement of ubiquinone in the anti-cooperative behavior of the inhibitors, we titrated stigmatellin and MOA stilbene in a yeast mutant that lacks ubiquinone. The titer for the two inhibitors in the mutant was also 0.5 inhibitor per enzyme monomer, indicating that ubiquinone is not responsible for the anti-cooperative interactions in the dimeric enzyme. These results are discussed in the context of the crystal structures of the bc1complex and the implications for the mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation. Dodecylmaltoside was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DEAE-Bio-Gel was obtained from Bio-Rad. Yeast extract and peptone were from Difco. Antimycin, myxothiazol, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, menaquinone, horse heart cytochrome c, and decylubiquinone were purchased from Sigma. Stigmatellin was purchased from Fluka. MOA stilbene was obtained from Dr. U. Brandt (University of Frankfurt). Yeast cytochromebc1 complexes were isolated from Red Star cake yeast as described previously (8Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Google Scholar, 9Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Google Scholar). The Îcoq2 yeast mutant was obtained from Dr. C. Clarke (UCLA). The wild-type yeast strain, W303a, and the Îcoq2 yeast mutant were grown in 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose medium and harvested by centrifugation. The ubiquinol analog, decylubiquinol (DBH2), was used as substrate in the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase assays and was obtained by reducing the quinone as described by Trumpower and Edwards (10Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Google Scholar). One-hundred mg of decylubiquinone were dissolved in 5 ml of ethanol and then mixed with 10 ml of a buffer containing 25 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 25 Î¼m EDTA. The mixture was reduced by slowly adding solid sodium dithionite and then solid sodium borohydride. The reduced mixture was extracted with 16 ml of cyclohexane and the fractions washed with buffer. The cyclohexane was evaporated with a stream of argon and the reduced quinol was dissolved in 2 ml of ethanol containing 10 mm HCl. Each of the inhibitors was diluted in ethanol, and the concentration was determined from optical spectra obtained in an Aminco DW2aTMUV-visible spectrophotometer with the OLIS DW2 conversion and OLIS Software. The difference spectrum, after subtracting the ethanol background, was recorded from 250 to 400 nm. To determine accurately the concentration for each inhibitor, the absorbance was measured at concentrations that yielded 0.1â0.15 absorbance units after diluting stock solutions of the inhibitors. To minimize random dilution errors, each dilution was performed 5 or 6 times, and the diluted solutions were combined. The extinction coefficients used to calculate the concentrations of the stock solutions are as follows: for stigmatellin, 65.5 mmâ1 cmâ1 at 300 nm; for myxothiazol, 10.5 mmâ1 cmâ1 at 313 nm; for antimycin, 4.8 mmâ1cmâ1 at 320 nm (6Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Method Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar); and for MOA stilbene, 26.5 mmâ1 cmâ1 at 300 nm (11Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 163-170Google Scholar). All of the inhibitor dilutions were prepared daily, and the concentrations were determined before a titration was started. Ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase activities of the purified bc1 complex were assayed at room temperature in an assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 50 Î¼m cytochrome c. Cytochromebc1 complex was added to a final concentration of 2.5 nm and allowed to equilibrate with inhibitor by stirring for 2 min in the cuvette. Potassium cyanide was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The reaction was started by adding 50 Î¼m DBH2 (final concentration), and reduction of cytochrome c was monitored at 550â539 nm with the Aminco DW2aTM spectrophotometer in the dual wavelength mode. The extinction coefficient used to calculate cytochromec reduction was 21.5 mmâ1cmâ1 at 550â539 nm (12Margoliash E. Walasek O.F. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 339-348Google Scholar). For each inhibitor titration, the bc1 complex was pre-diluted in assay buffer minus cytochrome c and the concentration determined by difference spectra recorded in the Aminco DW2aTM spectrophotometer. The cytochromec1 concentration was determined from the difference spectrum of the ascorbate reduced versusferricyanide-oxidized enzyme, using an extinction coefficient of 17.5 mmâ1 cmâ1 at 553â548 nm (13Cavazzoni M. Svobodova J. Desantis A. Fato R. Lenaz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 246-254Google Scholar). Cytochrome b concentration was determined from the difference spectrum of the sodium dithionite reduced versusferricyanide-oxidized enzyme, using an extinction coefficient of 25 mmâ1 cmâ1 at 563â578 nm (13Cavazzoni M. Svobodova J. Desantis A. Fato R. Lenaz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 246-254Google Scholar). This pre-diluted enzyme was considered the stock solution, and the concentration was usually 3 Î¼m cytochromec1. The activity of this stock solution of enzyme was stable for a week at 4 Â°C. After determining the bc1 complex concentration, the enzyme was diluted daily a second time, to 33 nm, and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to the activity measurements. To initiate the assay an aliquot of the 33 nm dilution was diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 nm in assay buffer containing 50 Î¼m cytochrome c and 0.5 mm KCN. The activity of the bc1complex without inhibitor and after stirring 2 min in the assay buffer was determined at the beginning of each titration. This was taken as 100% activity for the inhibitor titration, orV0. At the end of each titration the activity of the bc1 complex without inhibitor was again determined to check the stability of the enzyme during the experiment. The non-enzymatic reduction of cytochrome c by DBH2 was subtracted from each activity trace. Because the enzyme was preincubated with inhibitors in the assay buffer containing cytochrome c, we could not correct for the non-catalytic rate of cytochrome c reduction by DBH2 at the beginning of each measurement. However, we found that this rate was less than 1% of the catalytic rate; therefore, an average of two non-catalytic rates of cytochrome c reduction was subtracted from the catalytic rate. Ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase activities using the higher enzyme concentration were assayed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy, using an OLIS-Rapid Scanning Monochromator (On-Line Instrument Systems Inc. Bogart, GA) equipped with a 1200 lines/mm grating blazed at 500 nm. This produced a spectrum of 75 nm width, centered at 550 nm, with a resolution of 0.4 nm. The dead time of the instrument was â¼2 ms, and the end of this period were chosen as time 0. Data were collected at 1000 scans/s. Reactions were started by mixing 100 nmbc1 complex in assay buffer with 0.5 mm potassium cyanide and 100 Î¼mDBH2 against an equal volume of 100 Î¼mcytochrome c in assay buffer. The inhibitors were added to the bc1 complex and incubated with the enzyme for 2 min before mixing into the stopped flow chamber. The non-enzymatic rate of reduction of cytochrome c by DBH2 was obtained by mixing equal volumes of 100 Î¼m cytochrome c in assay buffer against 100 Î¼m DBH2 in assay buffer. The reaction was followed for 2 s. For each inhibitor concentration, four data sets were averaged, and the non-enzymatic rate was subtracted from each scan. From the three-dimensional data set composed of wavelength, absorbance, and time, the time course of cytochrome creduction was extracted using the OLIS software. The rate of cytochromec reduction was calculated from the absorbance increase at 550 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 18.5 mmâ1 cmâ1 (14Kubota T. Yoshikawa S. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 91-98Google Scholar). Pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS Rapid Scanning Monochromator. The rationale for this pre-steady state kinetics method was discussed previously (15Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Google Scholar). Reactions were started by rapid mixing of 3 Î¼mbc1 complex in assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20 against an equal volume of the same buffer containing 50 Î¼m menaquinol. The bc1 complex was diluted shortly before each titration, and the exact concentration was determined as described above. A fresh solution of menaquinol substrate was prepared before every experiment as described previously (15Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Google Scholar). The inhibitors were incubated with the enzyme 2 min before starting the reaction. An oxidized spectrum was obtained by mixing the oxidizedbc1 complex against assay buffer and averaging the data sets to a single scan. For each inhibitor concentration, three data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted from each scan. From the three-dimensional data set composed of wavelength, absorbance, and time, the time course and amplitude change for cytochrome b reduction at 563 nm was extracted using the OLIS software. Prior to mixing to initiate the oxidant-induced reduction, 3 Î¼mbc1 complex was incubated for 15 min with 8 Î¼m antimycin in assay buffer, pH 7.0, and 30 Î¼m DBH2 to partially reduce the enzyme. Varying amounts of stigmatellin were added to thebc1 complex after the incubation with DBH2 and incubated for 2 min prior to mixing with the oxidase and cytochrome c. Oxidant-induced reduction reactions were started by mixing the partially reduced enzyme against an equal volume of buffer containing 6 Î¼m cytochromec oxidase and 30 Î¼m cytochrome c. A spectrum of the oxidized mixture of cytochrome c plus cytochrome c oxidase was obtained by mixing with an equal amount of buffer and averaging the data set to one scan. The oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS-Rapid Scanning Monochromator. For each inhibitor concentration, three data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted from each scan. From the data sets the amplitude change for cytochromeb reduction was obtained as described above. The bc1 complex was diluted to an approximate concentration of 3 Î¼m in assay buffer, and the exact concentration was determined as described above. A base line was obtained by reducing the bc1 complex with dithionite in both sample and reference cuvettes in the Aminco DW2aTM spectrophotometer. Increasing amounts of MOA stilbene or myxothiazol were added to the sample cuvette and an equal amount of ethanol to the reference cuvette. After allowing the inhibitor to equilibrate with the enzyme for 2 min, a difference spectrum was recorded for each concentration of inhibitor added. A 2-fold excess of inhibitor was added at the end of the titration to establish the maximum change of the red shift. For each inhibitor concentration the absorbance difference at 568â560 nm, for MOA stilbene, or at 564â559 nm, for myxothiazol, was measured. In the experiments reported below we show that some inhibitors of thebc1 complex that block ubiquinol oxidation at center P fully inhibit the enzyme with a stoichiometry of 0.5 inhibitor per enzyme monomer. As a control for these experiments, we performed a set of inhibitor titrations with antimycin, which inhibits the enzyme at center N. The results in Fig.1A show the inhibition of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity by antimycin in a catalytic assay using 2.5 nmbc1complex. The dashed line shows the fitting of a linear titration curve with an intercept of one inhibitor per enzyme. Antimycin fully inhibits the enzyme at a titer of one inhibitor per enzyme, although there is a significant hysteresis in the titration curve at low antimycin concentrations. An explanation for the hysteresis is discussed below. In establishing optimal conditions for the ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase assays, we found that a buffer containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 250 mm sucrose was essential to obtain consistently turnover numbers greater than 100 sâ1. In addition, when the yeast enzyme was diluted to 3 Î¼m in this buffer, it remained stable for 1 week at 4 Â°C. A similar result was reported previously for the bovine bc1complex (14Kubota T. Yoshikawa S. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 91-98Google Scholar). We also found that it was necessary to incubate the enzyme with inhibitor for 2 min in the assay buffer before beginning the reaction, to obtain maximum inhibition, particularly in cytochrome creductase assays using low (2.5 nm) concentrations ofbc1 complex. Lack of equilibration of inhibitor with enzyme may account for the higher inhibitor stoichiometries observed in some studies, as discussed below. To establish that the titer for inhibition by antimycin is independent of enzyme concentration, we also performed a titration using 1.5 Î¼mbc1 complex, following the pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b. In this assay a stoichiometric excess of stigmatellin is included to block reduction of cytochrome b through center P, and the reduction of cytochrome b through center N is inhibited by varying amounts of antimycin. As shown in Fig. 1B, at this highbc1 complex concentration, the stoichiometry of antimycin per bc1 complex is also 1:1. In this assay also there was a slight hysteresis in the titration curve at low antimycin concentrations. From titrating the inhibitor with 2.5 nm or 1.5 Î¼mbc1complex, it is clear that the stoichiometry for inhibition of the yeastbc1 complex by antimycin is one inhibitor per enzyme monomer. This agrees with previous results for titration of the yeast enzyme with this inhibitor (16Tsai A.L. Kauten R. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 418-426Google Scholar). Fig. 2Ashows the inhibition of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity by stigmatellin in a catalytic assay using 2.5 nmbc1 complex. The dotted line shows a theoretical linear titration curve with a slope of 2, which would correspond to a titer of 0.5 eq of inhibitor per enzyme monomer. At low inhibitor concentrations, the data points in the titration fall on the theoretical titration curve and extrapolate to a titer of 0.5. Because these results were unexpected, we repeated this titration with different preparations of enzyme and made measurements in triplicate each time. We also took special care to determine accurately the concentrations of inhibitor and bc1 complex for each experiment as described under âExperimental Procedures.â With 14 preparations of enzyme, which differed in activity from 140 to 240 sâ1, which we attribute to different degrees of delipidation during the ion-exchange chromatography in the presence of detergent, we found that there were slight variations in the degree of linearity of the titration curves, but the data consistently indicated a titer that ranged from 0.45 to 0.55 eq of inhibitor per enzyme monomer. The deviation from linearity of the titration curve in Fig.2A would be expected if the Kd value of the inhibitor is comparable with or greater than the enzyme concentration in the assay, because a portion of the inhibitor would not be bound to the enzyme. To test this possibility, we repeated the titration with stigmatellin, using 50 nmbc1 complex in a ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase assay. At this high enzyme concentration, reduction of cytochrome c occurs so rapidly that the reaction must be followed in a stopped flow spectrophotometer, and data points are collected over a 2-s interval. As shown in Fig.2B, at the higher enzyme concentration the experimental points fit the theoretical linear titration curve very well, and at 0.5 eq of stigmatellin per bc1 monomer more than 95% of the enzyme is inhibited. We also examined the amount of stigmatellin required for inhibition of cytochrome b reduction in a pre-steady state assay in which the bc1 complex is present at 1.5 Î¼m (Fig. 2C). In this assay a stoichiometric excess of antimycin is included to block reduction of cytochromeb through center N, and the reduction of cytochromeb through center P is inhibited by varying amounts of stigmatellin. In this assay also 0.5 eq of stigmatellin fully inhibit the enzyme. The results from the titrations of cytochrome c reductase activity and pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome bindicate that one molecule of stigmatellin fully inhibits the dimeric yeast bc1 complex. Furthermore, the lack of displacement to values greater than 0.5 eq per cytochromec1 in the linear titration curves indicates that the inhibitor binds in an anti-cooperative manner, i.e. a second molecule of inhibitor does not bind to a dimer to which one molecule of inhibitor is already bound. As a further measure of the stoichiometry of stigmatellin interaction with the bc1 complex, we examined the amount of stigmatellin required to inhibit the oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b. Binding of stigmatellin depends on the redox state of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (6Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Method Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar, 17Link T.A. Haase U. Brandt U. von Jagow G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 221-232Google Scholar), and in this reaction the antimycin-inhibitedbc1 complex is partially reduced with DBH2. This reduces the iron-sulfur protein, cytochromec1, and a portion of the high potential cytochrome b and the quinone pool. Subsequent addition of cytochrome c plus cytochrome c oxidase then elicits additional reduction of cytochrome b concomitant with oxidation of cytochrome c1 and the Rieske protein. The inset in Fig. 3shows the redox status of the cytochromes in partially reducedbc1 complex and the increment in cytochromeb reduction that results from the oxidation of the high potential redox components. As seen from the titration results in Fig. 3, 0.5 eq of stigmatellin fully inhibits the oxidant-induced reduction of cytochromeb. This result is the same as that obtained from the titrations of cytochrome c reductase activity and pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b, but in this case there is a pronounced hysteresis in the titration curve. A possible explanation for this hysteresis is discussed below. MOA stilbene is a member of the methoxyacrylate class of inhibitors that includes myxothiazol, strobilurin, and oudemansin (6Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Method Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar). These inhibitors block ubiquinol oxidation at center P, but they differ from stigmatellin in that they prevent reduction of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster (17Link T.A. Haase U. Brandt U. von Jagow G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 221-232Google Scholar), whereas stigmatellin allows reduction of the cluster and locks the Rieske protein in the reduced conformation, proximal to cytochrome b (4Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.-K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Google Scholar, 5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Google Scholar). A representative titration of the ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase activity of the bc1complex with MOA stilbene is shown in Fig.4A. Under these conditions, using 2.5 nmbc1 complex in the standard catalytic assay, the binding of the inhibitor is not sufficiently tight to extrapolate a stoichiometry of binding directly from the titration curve. However, if 50 nmbc1 complex is used for the cytochromec reductase assay, the data from the inhibitor titration fits well to a linear curve corresponding to 0.5 molecules of inhibitor per bc1 monomer, as shown in Fig.4B. The difference in the titration curves in Fig. 4, A andB, suggests that the Ki of MOA stilbene for the bc1 complex is in the range of the 2.5 nm enzyme concentration used in the standard catalytic assay. Further evidence to this effect was obtained by titrating the pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b, using 1.5 Î¼mbc1 complex in the assay. Varying amounts of MOA stilbene were used to inhibit cytochromeb reduction through center P, while blocking reduction through center N with an excess of antimycin. As seen in Fig.4C, there is a slight hysteresis in the titration curve at low inhibitor concentrations, but the reduction of cytochromeb is fully inhibited at 0.5 eq of MOA stilbene perbc1 monomer. Inhibition of the dimericbc1 complex by 0.5 eq of inhibitor perbc1 monomer and the anti-cooperative nature of the inhibition indicate that binding of the inhibitor in one monomer prevents oxidation of ubiquinol or binding of a second molecule of inhibitor at the second ubiquinol oxidation site in the dimer. To test whether this behavior is dependent on the endogenous ubiquinone in thebc1 complex, we repeated these experiments withbc1 complex from the Îcoq2yeast mutant that lacks endogenous quinone (18Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4136Google Scholar). The titration curves in Fig. 5 show inhibition of the pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b by stigmatellin (Fig. 5A) and MOA stilbene (Fig. 5B). With both inhibitors the reduction of cytochrome b is completely blocked by 0.5 eq of inhibitor per bc1 monomer. These results establish that ubiquinone is not responsible for the anti-cooperative binding of these two Qp inhibitors in the yeastbc1 complex. Methoxyacrylates cause a red shift in the Î± band of the reduced cytochrome b when they bind to the bc1 complex (6Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Method Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar, 19Brandt U. ShaÌgger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 499-506Google Scholar). We used this characteristic to obtain a titer for binding of MOA stilbene to the bc1 complex that does not depend on inhibition of electron transfer within the enzyme. The results of such a titration with bc1 complex from a wild-type yeast strain are shown in Fig.6A. The inset shows the difference spectrum that results from the red shift and the increment in absorbance at 568 nm versus 560 nm that was used to quantitate binding of the inhibitor. As increasing amounts of MOA stilbene were added to the enzyme, the absorbance increased in a linear manner until 0.5 eq of inhibitor per bc1monomer was bound. A similar result was obtained when the red shift was titrated in theÎcoq2 mutant (Fig. 6B), although the titration curve is less linear, suggesting that the inhibitor binds somewhat less tightly in the mutant. With bc1complexes from both the wild-type strain and theÎcoq2 mutant, a second line can be fitted where the absorbance signal increases only slightly, attributable to lower affinity binding in the second monomer. It is not possible to determine accurately the binding constant for the low affinity site from these data, because of the anti-cooperative nature of the interaction between the high and low affinity sites. However, one can estimate from the linear nature of the pre-steady state titration curves at 1.5 Î¼m enzyme (Fig. 4C) and the biphasic titration of the red shift at 2.8 Î¼m enzyme that theKd value for the low affinity MOA stilbene site must fall between these two concentrations. Myxothiazol is a methoxyacrylate that blocks ubiquinol oxidation at center P in a manner like MOA stilbene. The two inhibitors differ, however, in the manner in which they inhibit the yeast bc1 complex. When ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase activity of the bc1complex is titrated with myxothiazol, the experimental points fit very well to a theoretical titration curve with a stoichiome"

The giant size of intact FSP is required to open both Ca2+ channels involved in triggering the AR. acrosome reaction egg jelly fucose sulfate polymer intact FSP hydrolyzed FSP FSP fragments generated by 5 h hydrolysis receptor for egg jelly polycystin-1 artificial seawater 2â²,7â²-bis-(2-carboxyl)-5-(and-6-)-carboxyfluorescein dihydropyridine carbohydrate recognition domain The sperm acrosome reaction (AR)1 is required for animal fertilization and is a potential target for the development of novel methods of non-hormonal contraception. Sea urchin spermatozoa are ideal for studying signal transduction underlying the animal sperm AR because they can be obtained as pure cells in vast quantities at low cost. The AR is triggered when sperm contact the jelly layer surrounding the egg (EJ). Morphologically, the AR involves the exocytosis of the acrosomal vesicle and the polymerization of actin to form the acrosomal process; both events are required for sperm to bind to and fuse with eggs. Physiologically, the AR requires the influx of Ca2+ and Na+ and the efflux of H+ and K+ions (1Schackmann R.W. Shapiro B.M. Dev. Biol. 1981; 81: 145-154Google Scholar, 2Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Google Scholar). There are two plasma membrane Ca2+ channels involved in AR induction: the first is receptor-operated and opens 1 s after sperm contact EJ, the second opens 5 s after the first in response to increased intracellular pH (pHi). The second channel can also transport Mn2+ (2Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Google Scholar, 3Guerrero A. Darszon A. J. Biol.

The Ca2+ channel blocker nisoldipine does not block Mn2+ movement through the second channel but does block the first channel and hence also blocks the AR (3Guerrero A. Darszon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19593-19599Google Scholar).Eighty percent of the mass of sea urchin EJ is a fucose sulfate polymer (FSP) of >1 million daltons (5SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 33-48Google Scholar). Purified FSP, having no amino acid content, induces the AR (5SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 33-48Google Scholar, 6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar). However, oligosaccharides of EJ glycoproteins substantially potentiate the FSP-induced AR, suggesting there is more than one receptor system regulating ion channels that trigger the AR (7Keller S.H. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 304-312Google Scholar). 2N. Hirohashi and V. D. Vacquier, manuscript in preparation. 2N. Hirohashi and V. D. Vacquier, manuscript in preparation. FSP is a linear polymer of Î±-l-1,3-fucose with a species-specific pattern of sulfation of the fucosyl residues (8Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Google Scholar). The sulfation pattern is responsible for FSP's species-specific induction of the AR (9Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourao P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6965-6971Google Scholar, 10Vilela-Silva A.C. Alves A.P. Valente A.P. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 927-933Google Scholar). FSP is also a potent inhibitor of human blood coagulation through its high affinity binding to heparin cofactor II (11Pereira M.S. Mulloy B. Mourao P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7656-7667Google Scholar).Receptor for egg jelly-1 (REJ1) is a 1450-amino acid glycoprotein located in the plasma membrane over the sea urchin sperm acrosomal vesicle and also on the sperm flagellum. Available data support the hypothesis that REJ1 is at least one of the sperm receptors for FSP (6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar,12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). Purified REJ1 neutralizes the AR activity of EJ (12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). An affinity column of REJ1 binds only FSP when crude EJ is applied (6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to REJ1 induce Ca2+ influx into sperm (13Trimmer J.S. Schackmann R.W. Vacquier V.D. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9055-9059Google Scholar) and induce the AR (14Trimmer J.S. Ebina Y. Schackmann R.W. Meinhof C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1121-1128Google Scholar). Approximately 1000 residues of REJ1 consist of a domain named âthe REJ module,â which is found in only one other protein family, the polycystin-1s (PKD1; Refs. 12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar and 15Wu G. Somlo S. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 69: 1-15Google Scholar). PKD1 is mutated in 85% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the most frequent human genetic disease (16Arnaout M.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2001; 52: 93-123Google Scholar). The polycystin-1 proteins are a new class of signaling molecules whose function remains to be clarified. Recent work shows that they may be regulators or subunits of nonselective cation channels (17Gonzalez-Perret S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Google Scholar). The âREJ moduleâ homology between REJ1 and PKD1 is restricted to extracellular regions. Both proteins have carbohydrate binding, C-type lectin domains (12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar, 18Weston B.S. Bagneris C. Price R.G. Stirling J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1536: 161-176Google Scholar). Ligands for PKD1 remain unknown.FSP is the only ligand known to bind to a protein containing a REJ module. Because FSP is a giant polymer, we studied what effect reduction of its size might have on sperm physiology. Mild acid hydrolysis of purified FSP randomly cleaves the large polymer to smaller size. Treatment of sperm with fragmented FSP triggers the opening of the second but not the first Ca2+ channel and also fails to induce the AR. Further results suggest that intact and fragmented FSP compete for the same binding site(s) and that the binding of fragmented FSP greatly desensitizes the AR response. The giant size of intact FSP is therefore required for the normal opening of both sperm Ca2+ channels involved in AR induction.DISCUSSIONLinear polymers of Î±-l-1,3-sulfofucose are only known in echinoderms (10Vilela-Silva A.C. Alves A.P. Valente A.P. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 927-933Google Scholar), the single invertebrate phylum leading to the evolution of vertebrates (29Mengerink K.J. Vacquier V.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 37-43Google Scholar). In addition to egg jelly coats, these polymers are also found in the extracellular matrix of the adult body wall in echinoderms (30Ribeiro A.C. Vieira R.P. Mourao P.A. Mulloy B. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 225-240Google Scholar). The egg FSPs mediate signal transduction in sperm and are also potent inhibitors of human blood coagulation (11Pereira M.S. Mulloy B. Mourao P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7656-7667Google Scholar,31Farias W.R. Valente A.P. Pereira M.S. Mourao P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29299-29307Google Scholar). Their biosynthesis has not been studied, and glycosidases that degrade them have not been described. The mouse sperm AR is also triggered by carbohydrate components of the egg's extracellular matrix; however these are oligosaccharide chains of unknown structure of the glycoprotein ZP3 (32Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 175-183Google Scholar). Also of interest is the fact that the sulfation pattern of FSP is responsible for its species-specific induction of the AR (8Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Google Scholar, 9Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourao P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6965-6971Google Scholar, 10Vilela-Silva A.C. Alves A.P. Valente A.P. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 927-933Google Scholar). Sulfation pattern is a relatively unknown structural mechanism to confer specificity on a cell-cell interaction leading to signal transduction and physiological activation. It is also unusual that a pure carbohydrate, completely lacking amino acids (6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar), should induce signal transduction leading to exocytosis in animal cells.In the present study, the fragmentation of purified FSP was achieved by mild acid hydrolysis, creating a size-heterogeneous population of fragments (Fig. 1A). Glycosidic bond cleavage was confirmed by an increase in reducing sugar with time (Fig. 1B). By 30 min of hydrolysis, gel analysis shows that FSP is still relatively large; however, it has already lost much of its ability to induce Ca2+ influx (Fig. 2B). By 2 h of hydrolysis about 13% of the sulfate groups are lost (Fig. 1D); however the percent AR induction has decreased from 80 to 20% (Fig.2A). By 5 h of hydrolysis gel filtration shows that FSP chromatographs as a broad peak with a relative mass of 60 kDa (Fig.1C). We cannot distinguish whether the small amount of sulfate loss, or the decrease in polymer size, are singly, or in combination, responsible for the loss of biological activity of hFSP. However, physically braking FSP by sonication at pH 8.0 yields the same data presented in Figs. 1A and 4A, suggesting that loss of polymer size is responsible for the characteristics of hFSP described herein (date not shown). In starfish, the giant pentasaccharide repeat polymer of EJ contains two sulfate groups per repeat. Solvolysis of the polymer shows that the loss of one sulfate per repeat greatly decreases its ability to induce the AR of starfish sperm (33Koyota S. Wimalasiri K.M. Hoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10372-10376Google Scholar).hFSP samples showed a marked decrease in the ability to induce Ca2+ influx after 30 min of hydrolysis (Fig.2B), yet the polymer size was still relatively large (Fig.1A). The concentration dependences of iFSP and 5h-hFSP to stimulate increases in Ca2+ and pHi and to induce the AR show that iFSP is always a more potent inducer than 5h-hFSP (Fig. 3). 5h-hFSP blocked iFSP from inducing the AR, and this inhibitory effect was restored by an excess amount of iFSP, suggesting that both types of FSP bind the same site(s) (Fig. 4, A andB). Although 22 Î¼g/ml hFSP induced a final [Ca2+]i elevation equivalent to 0.5 Î¼g/ml iFSP, AR did not occur in the hFSP-treated cells (Fig. 5). As previously documented by others, nisoldipine blocks the first Ca2+channel but not the second (3Guerrero A. Darszon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19593-19599Google Scholar). Our experiments show that the hFSP-induced increase in Ca2+ is not inhibited by 50 Î¼m nifedipine, suggesting that hFSP up-regulates the second channel but not the first (Fig. 6B). This hypothesis is supported by the data showing that Ni2+, which blocks the second sperm Ca2+ channel but not the first (4Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Google Scholar), completely blocks the 5h-hFSP-induced increase in Ca2+(Fig. 7).In regard to the mechanism of AR induction in different animal species, the egg ligands and their sperm receptors appear to be highly variable and evolutionarily unrelated (34Vacquier V.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1995-1998Google Scholar). However, the intracellular mechanism of the animal sperm AR appears to be conserved in that elevation of Ca2+ and pHi are required in all species (2Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Google Scholar). For example, planar lipid bilayer experiments show that sea urchin and mouse sperm possess a readily detectable, Ca2+-selective, sperm-specific, high conductance, multistate, voltage-dependent channel with similar voltage dependence (35Beltran C. Darszon A. Labarca P. Lievano A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 23-26Google Scholar, 36Lopez-Gonzalez I. De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Santi C.M. Florman H.M. Felix R. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 210-219Google Scholar).In the NH2-terminal extracellular portion of both proteins called the âREJ module,â sea urchin REJ1 and human PKD1 have structural motifs identifying them as âC-type lectin-like,â carbohydrate-binding proteins (12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar, 18Weston B.S. Bagneris C. Price R.G. Stirling J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1536: 161-176Google Scholar). Ligands for PKD1 are unknown, but the available evidence suggests that FSP binds REJ1 with high affinity (6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar). REJ1 has two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) that could bind FSP (12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). REJ1 has only one transmembrane segment at its extreme COOH terminus with only 15 residues being putatively cytoplasmic; therefore, REJ1 cannot be a pore-forming ion channel subunit. Because some (but not all) monoclonal antibodies to REJ1 induce Ca2+ elevations and the AR, REJ1 must be a regulator of sperm Ca2+ channels (12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar, 13Trimmer J.S. Schackmann R.W. Vacquier V.D. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9055-9059Google Scholar). The location of REJ1 over the acrosomal vesicle supports its role in AR regulation.Given a molecular mass of â¼60 kDa in 5h-hFSP and an average molar ratio of 1.1 sulfate groups per fucose residue (8Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Google Scholar), the average 5h-hFSP fragment has about 220 fucosyl residues. This would seem large enough to bridge many CRDs of many REJ1 proteins. In addition to binding the plasma membrane receptor REJ1, egg FSP also has affinity for bindin, the protein released from the acrosomal vesicle that species-specifically attaches the sperm to the sea urchin egg (37Vacquier V.D. Swanson W.J. Hellberg M.E. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 1-10Google Scholar). Studies on how the size of FSP affects its affinity to bindin have shown that the large size is again important. Little binding occurred below an FSP average size of 15 kDa. In addition, sulfate groups were essential for the binding of FSP to bindin (38DeAngelis P.L. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13946-13952Google Scholar). Why is such a giant size of FSP required for the normal physiological response of opening both Ca2+ channels? As with other CRD-containing proteins (39Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Google Scholar), the two CRDs of REJ1 should recognize terminal sugar residues of oligosaccharides; therefore, perhaps only the first and last residues bind REJ1. 5h-hFSP must bind REJ1 receptors because its AR-inhibiting activity is overridden by an excess amount of iFSP, and it can also induce Ca2+ increases in sperm.Our data, and the data of others (4Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Google Scholar), show that mere elevation of [Ca2+]i to a certain concentration is not what induces the AR; it is the pathway leading to induction that is important. It could be that hFSP uncouples components of the pathway, a phenomenon that can be demonstrated in these cells by other means. For example, seawater is â¼10 mm Ca2+. Treatment of sperm with EJ in 2 mm Ca2+ makes the cells refractory to AR induction and to increases in [Ca2+]i when the Ca2+ is returned to 10 mm (40Guerrero A. Darszon A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 980: 109-116Google Scholar, 41Guerrero A. Garcia L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Darszon A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 329-338Google Scholar). This AR inactivation is hypothesized to result from uncoupling the linkage between the sperm EJ receptors and Ca2+ channels. Pretreatment of sperm with 5h-hFSP causes a marked decrease in the AR response, yet [Ca2+]iincreases to reasonably high levels. Desensitization of the AR response by hFSP is thus different from AR inactivation. This might be due to opening of the second Ca2+ channel before the first channel opens, the order of opening being crucial to the AR. Normally, the first channel causes rapid increases in [Ca2+]i, whereas the second is responsible for the sustained high level of [Ca2+]i. The first channel may be activated by the binding of FSP to REJ1 (6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar), whereas the second channel, which is normally activated by the up-regulation of the first channel, has characteristics of a store-operated channel (4Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Google Scholar). That binding of hFSP to the cell surface bypasses the first channel and up-regulates the second channel suggests that the sensor regulating the second channel could involve unidentified cell surface receptors. The sperm acrosome reaction (AR)1 is required for animal fertilization and is a potential target for the development of novel methods of non-hormonal contraception. Sea urchin spermatozoa are ideal for studying signal transduction underlying the animal sperm AR because they can be obtained as pure cells in vast quantities at low cost. The AR is triggered when sperm contact the jelly layer surrounding the egg (EJ). Morphologically, the AR involves the exocytosis of the acrosomal vesicle and the polymerization of actin to form the acrosomal process; both events are required for sperm to bind to and fuse with eggs. Physiologically, the AR requires the influx of Ca2+ and Na+ and the efflux of H+ and K+ions (1Schackmann R.W. Shapiro B.M. Dev. Biol. 1981; 81: 145-154Google Scholar, 2Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Google Scholar). There are two plasma membrane Ca2+ channels involved in AR induction: the first is receptor-operated and opens 1 s after sperm contact EJ, the second opens 5 s after the first in response to increased intracellular pH (pHi). The second channel can also transport Mn2+ (2Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Google Scholar, 3Guerrero A. Darszon A. J. Biol.

The Ca2+ channel blocker nisoldipine does not block Mn2+ movement through the second channel but does block the first channel and hence also blocks the AR (3Guerrero A. Darszon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19593-19599Google Scholar). Eighty percent of the mass of sea urchin EJ is a fucose sulfate polymer (FSP) of >1 million daltons (5SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 33-48Google Scholar). Purified FSP, having no amino acid content, induces the AR (5SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 33-48Google Scholar, 6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar). However, oligosaccharides of EJ glycoproteins substantially potentiate the FSP-induced AR, suggesting there is more than one receptor system regulating ion channels that trigger the AR (7Keller S.H.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Google Scholar). The sulfation pattern is responsible for FSP's species-specific induction of the AR (9Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourao P.A. J. Biol.

Both proteins have carbohydrate binding, C-type lectin domains (12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar, 18Weston B.S.

FSP is the only ligand known to bind to a protein containing a REJ module. Because FSP is a giant polymer, we studied what effect reduction of its size might have on sperm physiology. Mild acid hydrolysis of purified FSP randomly cleaves the large polymer to smaller size. Treatment of sperm with fragmented FSP triggers the opening of the second but not the first Ca2+ channel and also fails to induce the AR. Further results suggest that intact and fragmented FSP compete for the same binding site(s) and that the binding of fragmented FSP greatly desensitizes the AR response. The giant size of intact FSP is therefore required for the normal opening of both sperm Ca2+ channels involved in AR induction.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 927-933Google Scholar), the single invertebrate phylum leading to the evolution of vertebrates (29Mengerink K.J. Vacquier V.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 37-43Google Scholar). In addition to egg jelly coats, these polymers are also found in the extracellular matrix of the adult body wall in echinoderms (30Ribeiro A.C. Vieira R.P. Mourao P.A. Mulloy B. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 225-240Google Scholar). The egg FSPs mediate signal transduction in sperm and are also potent inhibitors of human blood coagulation (11Pereira M.S. Mulloy B. Mourao P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7656-7667Google Scholar,31Farias W.R. Valente A.P. Pereira M.S. Mourao P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29299-29307Google Scholar). Their biosynthesis has not been studied, and glycosidases that degrade them have not been described. The mouse sperm AR is also triggered by carbohydrate components of the egg's extracellular matrix; however these are oligosaccharide chains of unknown structure of the glycoprotein ZP3 (32Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 175-183Google Scholar). Also of interest is the fact that the sulfation pattern of FSP is responsible for its species-specific induction of the AR (8Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Google Scholar, 9Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourao P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6965-6971Google Scholar, 10Vilela-Silva A.C. Alves A.P. Valente A.P. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 927-933Google Scholar). Sulfation pattern is a relatively unknown structural mechanism to confer specificity on a cell-cell interaction leading to signal transduction and physiological activation. It is also unusual that a pure carbohydrate, completely lacking amino acids (6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar), should induce signal transduction leading to exocytosis in animal cells.In the present study, the fragmentation of purified FSP was achieved by mild acid hydrolysis, creating a size-heterogeneous population of fragments (Fig. 1A). Glycosidic bond cleavage was confirmed by an increase in reducing sugar with time (Fig. 1B). By 30 min of hydrolysis, gel analysis shows that FSP is still relatively large; however, it has already lost much of its ability to induce Ca2+ influx (Fig. 2B). By 2 h of hydrolysis about 13% of the sulfate groups are lost (Fig. 1D); however the percent AR induction has decreased from 80 to 20% (Fig.2A). By 5 h of hydrolysis gel filtration shows that FSP chromatographs as a broad peak with a relative mass of 60 kDa (Fig.1C). We cannot distinguish whether the small amount of sulfate loss, or the decrease in polymer size, are singly, or in combination, responsible for the loss of biological activity of hFSP. However, physically braking FSP by sonication at pH 8.0 yields the same data presented in Figs. 1A and 4A, suggesting that loss of polymer size is responsible for the characteristics of hFSP described herein (date not shown). In starfish, the giant pentasaccharide repeat polymer of EJ contains two sulfate groups per repeat. Solvolysis of the polymer shows that the loss of one sulfate per repeat greatly decreases its ability to induce the AR of starfish sperm (33Koyota S. Wimalasiri K.M. Hoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10372-10376Google Scholar).hFSP samples showed a marked decrease in the ability to induce Ca2+ influx after 30 min of hydrolysis (Fig.2B), yet the polymer size was still relatively large (Fig.1A). The concentration dependences of iFSP and 5h-hFSP to stimulate increases in Ca2+ and pHi and to induce the AR show that iFSP is always a more potent inducer than 5h-hFSP (Fig. 3). 5h-hFSP blocked iFSP from inducing the AR, and this inhibitory effect was restored by an excess amount of iFSP, suggesting that both types of FSP bind the same site(s) (Fig. 4, A andB). Although 22 Î¼g/ml hFSP induced a final [Ca2+]i elevation equivalent to 0.5 Î¼g/ml iFSP, AR did not occur in the hFSP-treated cells (Fig. 5). As previously documented by others, nisoldipine blocks the first Ca2+channel but not the second (3Guerrero A. Darszon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19593-19599Google Scholar). Our experiments show that the hFSP-induced increase in Ca2+ is not inhibited by 50 Î¼m nifedipine, suggesting that hFSP up-regulates the second channel but not the first (Fig. 6B). This hypothesis is supported by the data showing that Ni2+, which blocks the second sperm Ca2+ channel but not the first (4Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Google Scholar), completely blocks the 5h-hFSP-induced increase in Ca2+(Fig. 7).In regard to the mechanism of AR induction in different animal species, the egg ligands and their sperm receptors appear to be highly variable and evolutionarily unrelated (34Vacquier V.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1995-1998Google Scholar). However, the intracellular mechanism of the animal sperm AR appears to be conserved in that elevation of Ca2+ and pHi are required in all species (2Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Google Scholar). For example, planar lipid bilayer experiments show that sea urchin and mouse sperm possess a readily detectable, Ca2+-selective, sperm-specific, high conductance, multistate, voltage-dependent channel with similar voltage dependence (35Beltran C. Darszon A. Labarca P. Lievano A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 23-26Google Scholar, 36Lopez-Gonzalez I. De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Santi C.M. Florman H.M. Felix R. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 210-219Google Scholar).In the NH2-terminal extracellular portion of both proteins called the âREJ module,â sea urchin REJ1 and human PKD1 have structural motifs identifying them as âC-type lectin-like,â carbohydrate-binding proteins (12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar, 18Weston B.S. Bagneris C. Price R.G. Stirling J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1536: 161-176Google Scholar). Ligands for PKD1 are unknown, but the available evidence suggests that FSP binds REJ1 with high affinity (6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar). REJ1 has two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) that could bind FSP (12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). REJ1 has only one transmembrane segment at its extreme COOH terminus with only 15 residues being putatively cytoplasmic; therefore, REJ1 cannot be a pore-forming ion channel subunit. Because some (but not all) monoclonal antibodies to REJ1 induce Ca2+ elevations and the AR, REJ1 must be a regulator of sperm Ca2+ channels (12Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar, 13Trimmer J.S. Schackmann R.W. Vacquier V.D. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9055-9059Google Scholar). The location of REJ1 over the acrosomal vesicle supports its role in AR regulation.Given a molecular mass of â¼60 kDa in 5h-hFSP and an average molar ratio of 1.1 sulfate groups per fucose residue (8Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Google Scholar), the average 5h-hFSP fragment has about 220 fucosyl residues. This would seem large enough to bridge many CRDs of many REJ1 proteins. In addition to binding the plasma membrane receptor REJ1, egg FSP also has affinity for bindin, the protein released from the acrosomal vesicle that species-specifically attaches the sperm to the sea urchin egg (37Vacquier V.D. Swanson W.J. Hellberg M.E. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 1-10Google Scholar). Studies on how the size of FSP affects its affinity to bindin have shown that the large size is again important. Little binding occurred below an FSP average size of 15 kDa. In addition, sulfate groups were essential for the binding of FSP to bindin (38DeAngelis P.L. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13946-13952Google Scholar). Why is such a giant size of FSP required for the normal physiological response of opening both Ca2+ channels? As with other CRD-containing proteins (39Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Google Scholar), the two CRDs of REJ1 should recognize terminal sugar residues of oligosaccharides; therefore, perhaps only the first and last residues bind REJ1. 5h-hFSP must bind REJ1 receptors because its AR-inhibiting activity is overridden by an excess amount of iFSP, and it can also induce Ca2+ increases in sperm.Our data, and the data of others (4Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Google Scholar), show that mere elevation of [Ca2+]i to a certain concentration is not what induces the AR; it is the pathway leading to induction that is important. It could be that hFSP uncouples components of the pathway, a phenomenon that can be demonstrated in these cells by other means. For example, seawater is â¼10 mm Ca2+. Treatment of sperm with EJ in 2 mm Ca2+ makes the cells refractory to AR induction and to increases in [Ca2+]i when the Ca2+ is returned to 10 mm (40Guerrero A. Darszon A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 980: 109-116Google Scholar, 41Guerrero A. Garcia L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Darszon A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 329-338Google Scholar). This AR inactivation is hypothesized to result from uncoupling the linkage between the sperm EJ receptors and Ca2+ channels. Pretreatment of sperm with 5h-hFSP causes a marked decrease in the AR response, yet [Ca2+]iincreases to reasonably high levels. Desensitization of the AR response by hFSP is thus different from AR inactivation. This might be due to opening of the second Ca2+ channel before the first channel opens, the order of opening being crucial to the AR. Normally, the first channel causes rapid increases in [Ca2+]i, whereas the second is responsible for the sustained high level of [Ca2+]i. The first channel may be activated by the binding of FSP to REJ1 (6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar), whereas the second channel, which is normally activated by the up-regulation of the first channel, has characteristics of a store-operated channel (4Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Google Scholar). That binding of hFSP to the cell surface bypasses the first channel and up-regulates the second channel suggests that the sensor regulating the second channel could involve unidentified cell surface receptors. Linear polymers of Î±-l-1,3-sulfofucose are only known in echinoderms (10Vilela-Silva A.C. Alves A.P. Valente A.P. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A.

In regard to the mechanism of AR induction in different animal species, the egg ligands and their sperm receptors appear to be highly variable and evolutionarily unrelated (34Vacquier V.D.

In the NH2-terminal extracellular portion of both proteins called the âREJ module,â sea urchin REJ1 and human PKD1 have structural motifs identifying them as âC-type lectin-like,â carbohydrate-binding proteins (12Moy G.W.

The location of REJ1 over the acrosomal vesicle supports its role in AR regulation. Given a molecular mass of â¼60 kDa in 5h-hFSP and an average molar ratio of 1.1 sulfate groups per fucose residue (8Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Google Scholar), the average 5h-hFSP fragment has about 220 fucosyl residues. This would seem large enough to bridge many CRDs of many REJ1 proteins. In addition to binding the plasma membrane receptor REJ1, egg FSP also has affinity for bindin, the protein released from the acrosomal vesicle that species-specifically attaches the sperm to the sea urchin egg (37Vacquier V.D. Swanson W.J. Hellberg M.E. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 1-10Google Scholar). Studies on how the size of FSP affects its affinity to bindin have shown that the large size is again important. Little binding occurred below an FSP average size of 15 kDa. In addition, sulfate groups were essential for the binding of FSP to bindin (38DeAngelis P.L. Glabe C.G. J. Biol.

It could be that hFSP uncouples components of the pathway, a phenomenon that can be demonstrated in these cells by other means. For example, seawater is â¼10 mm Ca2+. Treatment of sperm with EJ in 2 mm Ca2+ makes the cells refractory to AR induction and to increases in [Ca2+]i when the Ca2+ is returned to 10 mm (40Guerrero A. Darszon A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 980: 109-116Google Scholar, 41Guerrero A. Garcia L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Darszon A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 329-338Google Scholar). This AR inactivation is hypothesized to result from uncoupling the linkage between the sperm EJ receptors and Ca2+ channels. Pretreatment of sperm with 5h-hFSP causes a marked decrease in the AR response, yet [Ca2+]iincreases to reasonably high levels. Desensitization of the AR response by hFSP is thus different from AR inactivation. This might be due to opening of the second Ca2+ channel before the first channel opens, the order of opening being crucial to the AR. Normally, the first channel causes rapid increases in [Ca2+]i, whereas the second is responsible for the sustained high level of [Ca2+]i. The first channel may be activated by the binding of FSP to REJ1 (6Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar), whereas the second channel, which is normally activated by the up-regulation of the first channel, has characteristics of a store-operated channel (4Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Google Scholar). That binding of hFSP to the cell surface bypasses the first channel and up-regulates the second channel suggests that the sensor regulating the second channel could involve unidentified cell surface receptors.

Currently, oxidative mitochondrial damage is thought to cause 4HPR-induced apoptosis, although the exact mechanism has not yet been clarified. 4HPR effectively induces apoptosis in hepatoma cells although the susceptibility differs in a cell-specific manner. Hep-3B and PLC/PRF/5 cells were more susceptible to 4HPR than were Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells, and the resistance to 4HPR seems to be related to growth inhibition (G1 arrest). We further observed that 4HPR specifically down-regulates cytochrome coxidase subunit III (CO III) transcript levels through destabilization of its mRNA and thus decreases the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). To explore the mechanism whereby the CO III transcript was decreased by 4HPR, we used adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) ligands, which modulate mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ÎÎ¨m) without altering CO III transcription. Intriguingly, bongkrekic acid, a specific ANT inhibitor, enhanced 4HPR-induced ÎÎ¨m disruption, which in turn decreased the level ofCO III transcripts, which was accompanied by increases in the generation of reactive oxygen species and in apoptosis. In contrast, atractyloside, an activator of ANT, inhibited those 4HPR-induced effects. Taken together, these results indicate that down-regulation of CO III, a molecular marker of oxidative stress, may result from upstream ÎÎ¨m disruption and that ligands of ANT may be capable of modulating 4HPR-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Thus, various clinical chemoprevention trials targeting human cancers with 4HPR are currently in progress (5Lippman S.M. Lotan R. J.

Additionally, 4HPR exhibits therapeutic effects as indicated by tumor regression in 4HPR-treated animals bearing carcinogen-induced or xenotransplanted human tumors (7Formelli F. Barua A.B.

Cell killing by 4HPR is antagonized by deregulated bcl-2 expression as well as by certain antioxidants (12Delia D. Aiello A. Formelli F. Fontanella E. Costa A. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Pierotti M.A. Blood. 1995; 85: 359-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4HPR stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which strongly suggests that the causative role of 4HPR is linked to apoptosis-inducing oxidative stress (13Delia D. Aiello A. Meroni L. Nicolini M. Reed J.C. Pierotti M.A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Oridate N. Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Mitchell M.F. Hong W.K.

Recently, the target site of 4HPR-induced ROS generation was shown to be the electron transport chain component of the mitochondrial inner membrane (16Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Oridate N. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6380-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of 4HPR-induced ROS generation and apoptosis is still unclear. Recently, we have observed that 4HPR effectively induces apoptosis in hepatoma cells, although the susceptibility to 4HPR-induced apoptosis differs in a cell-specific manner. 4HPR decreases levels of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (CO III) transcript, which is accompanied by a decrease in cytochromec oxidase activity during apoptosis. Cytochrome coxidase, the terminal component (complex IV) in the electron transport chain, is a complex enzyme composed of 13 subunits (17Kadenbach B. Merle P. FEBS Lett. 1981; 135: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The larger and catalytically active subunits (I, II, and III) are encoded by mitochondrial DNA, whereas the remaining smaller subunits are encoded by nuclear genes (18Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). CO III plays a role in the assembly and stabilization of the entire enzyme complex and is involved in proton translocation (19Wilson K.S. Prochaska L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or in energy conversion by cytochrome coxidase (20Wu S. Moreno-Sanchez R. Rottenberg H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16298-16305Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase was reported to be a potential target site for daunomycin and other related anthracycline chemotherapeutic drugs (21Papadopoulou L.C. Tsiftsoglou A.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1072-1078PubMed Google Scholar, 22Papadopoulou L.C. Theophilidis G. Thomopoulos G.N. Tsiftsoglou A.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the target site of 4HPR-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis is unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism whereby theCO III transcript is decreased and to examine whether the 4HPR-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis is modulated. 4HPR, kindly supplied by the Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Spring House, PA), was dissolved in absolute ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at a concentration of 10â2m and was stored in aliquots at â20 Â°C for a maximum of 1 week. Antioxidants, includingN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), were obtained from Sigma. The antioxidant solutions were made just before use in fresh medium and were adjusted to pH 7.4. Bongkrekic acid (BA), atractyloside (Atr), and cyclosporin A (CsA) were purchased from Calbiochem. In all experiments, the final concentration of Me2SO did not exceed 0.1% (v/v), a concentration that is nontoxic to the cells. H2O2 was obtained from Sigma. 5,5â²,6,6â²-Tetraethylbenzimidazocarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), 3,3â²-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6), and 5,6-carboxy-2â²,7â²-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Hepatoma cell lines, including Hep-3B, PLC/PRF/5, Hep-G2, and SK-HEP-1, were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Thep53 gene status in Hep-3B and in PLC/PRF/5 cells is a deletion or point mutation, respectively, whereas p53 is wild-type in Hep-G2 and in SK-HEP-1 cells (23Puisieux A. Galvin K. Troalen F. Bressac B. Marcais C. Galun E. Ponchel F. Yakicier C. Ji J. Ozturk M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured and treated with 4HPR in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in air containing 5% CO2. Cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde (1% in PBS) and stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). At least 200 cells were counted for each time point, and all counting was done in a blinded fashion. Hepatoma cells (1 Ã 106) were seeded in 6-cm Petri dishes and allowed to attach. Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of 4-HPR for 72 h. For analysis of genomic DNA, cells were harvested and collected together with the nonattached cells in the supernatant. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A. After incubation at 37 Â°C for 30 min, extracts were treated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K for an additional 16 h at 37 Â°C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and then chloroform and were then precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate. Twenty Î¼l of each extract was dissolved in 50 Î¼l of H2O, loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel, and electrophoresed in the presence of 0.5 Î¼g/ml ethidium bromide. All hepatoma cell lines were plated in 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Nalge Nunc Int., Naperville, IL) at a density of 103 cells/well and treated with 5 or 10 Î¼m 4HPR for 3 days. The cells were labeled with 1 Î¼Ci of [methyl-3H]thymidine/well (specific activity, 5 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 24 h at 37 Â°C and then were harvested on fiberglass filter paper strips with a multiple automated sample harvester (Inotech, Dottikon, Switzerland). Each sample was lysed hypotonically, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 4530, Packard Instruments Co.). Measurement of cell cycle distribution and apoptotic/hypodiploid cells was performed using a modification of the technique described previously (24Kim D.G. Jo B.H. You K.R. Ahn D.S. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells (1 Ã 106) were collected at each time interval for flow cytometry, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stored at 4 Â°C. Cell cycle distributions of monolayer cells and detached cells harvested with trypsin were performed at intervals following 4HPR treatment using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with an argon laser set to excite at 488 nm. Propidium iodide (40 Î¼g/100 Î¼l of PBS) was added to 1 Ã 106 cells suspended in 800 Î¼l of PBS together with 100 Î¼l of RNase A (1 Î¼g/ml) and incubated at 37 Â°C for 30 min before flow cytometry analysis of 2 Ã104 cells. Red fluorescence due to propidium-bound DNA was measured using a 630 nm-long bandpass filter. Data were analyzed as single-parameter frequency histograms in an SFIT model. The sub-G1 fraction was estimated by gating hypodiploid cells in the DNA histogram using a C-30 program. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum until 60% confluent and were then treated with 10 Î¼m 4HPR for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted from treated or untreated cells using phenol and guanidine thiocyanate solution (Tri-reagent; Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's instructions, fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels containing formaldehyde, and transferred to membranes. Blots were hybridized overnight with 2 Ã 106 cpm/ml cDNA probe labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by random priming, washed, then exposed to x-ray film at â70 Â°C, as described previously (25Kim D.G. Kang H.M. Jang S.K. Shin H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The probes were then removed by submerging the membranes in hot water for a few minutes, and membranes were rehybridized with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA or with the 12 S mitochondrial ribosomal protein gene cDNA to normalize RNA loading. Human cDNAs for mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit genes (CO I,CO II, and CO III), nuclear cytochrome oxidase subunit genes (CO IV and CO VIb), and theANT2 gene were obtained from an expressed sequence tag (EST) data base from human fetal liver (26Choi S.S. Yun J.W. Choi E.K. Cho Y.G. Sung T.C. Shin H.S. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To inhibit mitochondrial transcription, ethidium bromide (5 Î¼g/ml) was added to control and to Hep-3B cells treated with 20 Î¼m 4HPR. Hep-3B cells were also treated with noncytotoxic doses of the various inhibitors and ligands for ANT alone or in combination with 10 Î¼m 4HPR for 48 h. Northern blotting was performed using total RNA extracted at the indicated times and probed with CO IIIcDNA. Cytochrome coxidase activity was determined using partially purified mitochondria as described previously (27Heerdt B.G. Augenlicht L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19120-19126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modification. 4HPR-treated or control cells were trypsinized and washed once with PBS and then washed twice with ice-cold freshly prepared 0.25 msucrose, resuspended in sterile water, and kept on ice for 10 min. Cells were then disrupted using several strokes of a Dounce homogenizer followed by the addition of sucrose to a concentration of 0.34m. Homogenates were centrifuged to remove nuclei and cellular debris, and mitochondria were sedimented from the supernatants by a final centrifugation at 20,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 550 nm (28Morin P.E. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8494-8500Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and reagent volumes were calculated on the basis of a 1-ml total assay volume. 0.9 ml of Lubrol PX (0.244% w/v) (Sigma) in 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) was added to each cuvette to permeabilize the mitochondria. Cytochrome c reduced with sodium dithionite (Sigma) was added, and the reaction was then initiated by the addition of mitochondrial protein and was measured for 2 min. Cytochrome oxidase activity is reported as a decrease in absorbance (a first-order rate constant) in units/sÂ·mg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percent viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion at the indicated time points. For measurement for ÎÎ¨m, cells were treated with 10 Î¼m4HPR for 3 days. JC-1 was added to the medium at 5 Î¼g/ml, and incubation was continued in the dark for 15 min (30Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Roeser N.F. Nissim I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2826-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Stained cells were harvested, washed once in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. A Becton Dickinson FACScan was used to analyze a minimum of 10,000 cells/sample. Forward and side scatter were used to gate the viable population of cells. JC-1 monomers emit at 527 nm (FL-1 channel) and âJ-aggregatesâ emit at 590 nm (FL-2 channel). The intracellular generation of ROS was measured using the oxidation-sensitive fluorescein DCFH-DA. Exponentially growing cells (2Ã 105/ml) were loaded with 50 Î¼mDCFH-DA for 15 min at 37 Â°C and then treated with or without 10 Î¼m 4HPR or 1 mm H2O2for 1 h. The cells were incubated for 3 h with antioxidant NAC or ANT ligands prior to loading with DCFH-DA. After labeling and treatment, the samples were centrifuged and washed twice with PBS. The pellets were disrupted by freezing and thawing and were diluted in water. The fluorescence intensity of each cell suspension was read using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology Int., South Brunswick, NJ) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from cells in lysis buffer (10 mmPIPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEGTA, 25 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 40 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and lysis was confirmed by microscopy. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation through 30% sucrose (800 Ã g, 10 min at 4 Â°C), mitochondria were collected at 10,000 Ã g for 20 min at 4 Â°C, and the remaining cell membranes were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 Ãg for 45 min at 4 Â°C as described previously (31Buckley C.D. Pilling D. Henriquez N.V. Parsonage G. Threlfall K. Scheel-Toellner D. Simmons D.L. Akbar A.N. Lord J.M. Salmon M. Nature. 1999; 397: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The supernatant (S-100 fraction) was used as the cytosolic extract. After adjustment for protein concentration, 30 Î¼g of each cell lysate was boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE before immunoblot analysis with antibody against cytochrome c(PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Signals were detected using an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Autoradiographs of Northern hybridization were scanned using a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and densitometric data were analyzed using the accompanying software on a PowerMac 6100 (Apple). The level of mRNA for GAPDH or 12 S rRNA was determined in the same manner. Expression levels of each gene relative to the untreated control were calculated by normalization against the level of GAPDH or 12 S rRNA followed by calculating the ratios of mRNAs from cells treated for the indicated times and from untreated cells. Cells treated with 10 Î¼m 4HPR were stained with the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33258. Hep-3B and PLC/PRF/5 cells (mutant-type p53) revealed condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclear morphologies, whereas Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells (wild-type p53) showed homogeneous and round chromatin (data not shown). We then measured apoptosis of cells treated with 10 Î¼m 4HPR at various time intervals. This time course analysis demonstrated that within 72 h, 38 Â± 3.6% (mean Â± S.E.) of Hep-3B cells and 35 Â± 3.0% of PLC/PRF/5 cells were apoptotic, whereas less than 8 Â± 1.0% of wild-type Hep-G2 cells or SK-HEP-1 cells were apoptotic (Fig.1A). However, it should be noted that 40 Â± 5.0% of Hep-G2 and 38 Â± 4.0% of SK-HEP-1 cells eventually became apoptotic at the higher concentrations of 20 and 15 Î¼m 4HPR, respectively. The cells displayed disintegrated nuclei and nonrandom DNA fragmentation, as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that 4HPR-triggered cell death is independent ofp53-induced apoptosis and that cells with wild-typep53 are resistant to 4HPR. Thus, we next examined whetherp53-induced growth arrest may play a role in this resistance. We treated hepatoma cells with 5 Î¼m 4HPR, which is a sublethal dose, to induce apoptosis in p53 mutant cells. At that concentration, 4HPR did not inhibit the growth ofp53 mutant PLC/PRF/5 cells (97 Â± 11%) compared with untreated controls, and it actually accelerated the growth of Hep-3B cells (214 Â± 18%). In contrast, 4HPR significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited the growth of wild-typep53 Hep-G2 (33 Â± 4% or 4.3 Â± 0.3%) and SK-HEP-1 cells (59 Â± 3% or 6.1 Â± 1.2%) at 4HPR concentrations of 5 or 10 Î¼m, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2A. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that, following 72 h of exposure to 4HPR, Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells accumulated in the G1 phase, and this was accompanied by decreased numbers of cells in the S phase (Fig.2B and Table I). In contrast, 4HPR increased or did not alter the number of Hep-3B cells or PLC/PRF/5 cells, respectively, in S phase. When the dose of 4HPR was increased to 15â20 Î¼m, apoptosis was finally induced in these cells, which indicates that wild-type p53 cells were growth-arrested at the G1 check point of the cell cycle and that this inhibition was related to the resistance of apoptosis. Histograms of DNA content also demonstrated sub-G1fractions indicative of apoptosis, and these sub-G1fractions were increased in mutant-type p53 cells over the time course without preceding the growth arrest of the cells.p21/WAF1 is thought to be a key downstream mediator ofp53-induced cell cycle arrest (G1 arrest) in the response to DNA damage (32el-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y Wilman K.G. Mercer W.E. Kastan M.B. Kohn K.W. Elledge S.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bae I Fan S. Bhatia K. Kohn K.W. Fornace Jr., A.J. O'Connor P.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2387-2393PubMed Google Scholar), and the primary targets ofp21 are the cdk-cyclins, which regulate the progression of eukaryotic cells through the cell cycle. Thus, we examined whether the regulation of p53/p21 expression is responsible for the 4HPR-induced G1 arrest of Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells. Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells simultaneously showed p53 andp21 mRNA expression, demonstrating that these cells have functional wild-type p53, whereas PLC/PRF/5 and Hep-3B cells were p53-defective as described previously (23Puisieux A. Galvin K. Troalen F. Bressac B. Marcais C. Galun E. Ponchel F. Yakicier C. Ji J. Ozturk M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 4HPR treatment did not change the levels of p53 mRNA in Hep-G2 or in SK-HEP-1 cells. In contrast, this drug did increase the level of p21 mRNA in SK-HEP-1 cells (Fig.2C). Thus, the growth inhibition of hepatoma cells seemed to be independent of p53 function.Table ICell cycle phase distribution in hepatoma cells following treatment with sublethal doses of 4HPRHep-3BPLC/PRF/5Hep-G2SK-HEP-1Control4HPRControl4HPRControl4HPRControl4HPR%G163.2 Â± 3.21-aMean Â± S.E.58.8 Â± 1.155.4 Â± 4.054.9 Â± 4.659.4 Â± 5.073.5 Â± 6.41-bp < 0.05.54.1 Â± 4.275.7 Â± 7.21-cp < 0.01.S30.6 Â± 2.236.5 Â± 2.01-bp < 0.05.38.4 Â± 4.041.5 Â± 3.229.5 Â± 4.213.8 Â± 2.21-bp < 0.05.34.9 Â± 4.420.5 Â± 1.51-cp < 0.01.G2/M6.2 Â± 0.34.7 Â± 0.36.2 Â± 0.54.7 Â± 0.111.2 Â± 0.912.6 Â± 0.111.0 Â± 2.23.8 Â± 3.01-cp < 0.01.Hep-3B and PLC/PRF/5 cells were treated with 5 Î¼m 4HPR, while Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells were treated with 10 Î¼m4HPR for 72 h.1-a Mean Â± S.E.1-b p < 0.05.1-c p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Hep-3B and PLC/PRF/5 cells were treated with 5 Î¼m 4HPR, while Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells were treated with 10 Î¼m4HPR for 72 h. Cytochrome coxidase activity was measured to determine whether this enzyme is a target site for retinoids. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was decreased during 4HPR treatment of Hep-3B cells (Fig.3A). A comparison of cytochrome c oxidase activity and cell viability at the indicated time points reveals that the percent survival of cells was much higher than the percent decrease of enzyme activity, implying that reduced enzyme activity may be associated with cell death. In contrast, cytochrome c oxidase activity of SK-HEP-1 cells was slightly decreased with almost no change in cell viability along the time course. We next examined whether 4HPR could inhibit the biosynthesis of cytochrome c oxidase subunits at the transcriptional level or could directly inhibit cytochrome c oxidase activity. Two different kinds of cytochrome c oxidase subunit genes, mitochondrial encoded (CO I, CO II, and CO III) and nuclear encoded (CO IV and CO VIb) genes, were chosen for this analysis, and we assessed steady-state levels of their mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 3B(left), treatment of hepatoma cells for 48 h with 10 Î¼m 4HPR suppressed expression of the CO IIIsubunit gene only in Hep-3B and in PLC/PRF/5 cells. The CO III cDNA probe hybridized to two RNA molecules of distinct size, the lower band being the size of the mature 780-base message of the human mitochondrial CO III gene (34Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijin M.H.L. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J.H. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7684) Google Scholar). The upper band is the mitochondrial RNA species 15 (CO III) and 14, which migrate as a single abundant band from the mitochondrial polyadenylated fraction even under denaturing conditions (35Montoya J. Ojala D. Attardi G. Nature. 1981; 290: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Suppression of theCO III transcript in PLC/PRF/5 cells following 4HPR treatment was greater than that noted in Hep-3B cells, and this was related quantitatively to the fraction of apoptotic cells. Transcripts of the CO III gene were quantitatively decreased during the time course of 4HPR treatment of Hep-3B cells (Fig. 3B,middle), and this decrement was proportionally greater than the decrease in enzyme activity and viability of Hep-3B cells. However, substantial levels of the CO III gene transcript in SK-HEP-1 cells were noted along the time course with a minimal decrement at each time point (Fig. 3B, right). To establish whether the down-regulation of CO III transcript is an event resulting from specific oxidative stress, we treated Hep-3B cells with a pro-oxidant, H2O2 (1 mm), for 72 h, and cell viability and CO III mRNA expression were examined at the indicated time intervals. H2O2 decreased the viability of Hep-G2 cells to 50% of controls, but did not alter their more abundant CO III transcripts (Fig.4A). However, the rarer transcripts of CO III (the larger size band) decreased along the time course, which is consistent with a previous report (36Elliott R.M. Southon S. Archer D.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the down-regulation of the CO III transcript might be specific for 4HPR-induced oxidative stress. To study the possibility that the low levels of mitochondrial CO III transcript observed after 4HPR treatment result from an increased turnover rate, we followed the decay of mRNA levels 24 h after the addition of ethidium bromide, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial transcription (37Perlman R. Penman S. Nature. 1970; 227: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), to the culture medium. Comparable levels ofCO III mRNA were observed after the addition of ethidium bromide to control and to 4HPR treated cells (Fig. 4B). The remaining CO III mRNA decreased to 20 and 5%, respectively, of controls 24 h after treatment, and thus 4HPR seems to decrease the stability of CO III mRNA, not to decrease its rate of transcription. To determine the mechanism underlying the CO III down-regulation, we used ANT ligands, which do not regulate CO III transcription but modulate ÎÎ¨m reduction. The ÎÎ¨m reduction and CO III transcript levels were measured in cells treated with 4HPR alone or with 4HPR in combination with ANT ligands. The effect of ANT ligands on 4HPR-triggered ÎÎ¨m reduction was monitored by uptake of JC-1, a cationic lipophilic fluorescent dye. At relatively high levels of ÎÎ¨m, the dye JC-1 forms J-aggregates, which emit at 590 nm in the red-orange range of visible light.

Methyl substitution of the phosphate backbone impaired kinase activation but not binding, indicating that interaction with the DNA backbone was involved in kinase activation. Experiments with RNA and RNA/DNA hybrid fragments suggested that the discrimination between RNA and DNA ends resides in the double-stranded DNA binding function of DNA-PKcs. DNA fragments exposing only one ssDNA end activated DNA-PKcs poorly, suggesting that DNA-PKcs distinguishes between DSBs and ssDNA breaks by simultaneous interaction with two ssDNA ends.

A single DSB can lead to chromosomal fragmentation and cell death or to chromosomal translocations and cancer. DSBs are induced by ionizing radiation, DNA replication or V(D)J recombination, a site-specific recombination process that generates the molecular diversity of the immune system. In response to ionizing radiation, cells target DSBs for repair and also activate several signaling pathways that lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (1Ross G. Endocr.

Several protein kinases involved in the DSB signaling pathway have been identified and include DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), ATM (2Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C. Chessa L.

Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P.

DNA-PK kinase activity is required for effective DSB repair, survival (15Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N. Story M. Tung C.S. Peterson S. Chen D. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DNA-PK has also been reported to be required for induction of apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation in thymocytes (20Wang S. Guo M. Ouyang H. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Kurimasa A. Chen D. Fuks Z. Ling C. Li G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1584-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA-PK appears to signal the presence of DSBs by its kinase activity. DNA-PK activation by DSBs can therefore be used as a model for how proteins specifically recognize and signal the presence of DSB lesions.DNA-PK is a serine-threonine protein kinase that is composed of a 465-kDa catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, (21Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P.

Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Ku is a heterodimer of 70 and 86 kDa that binds specifically to DSBs (22Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs contains a separate DNA binding function that binds DNA ends with lower affinity and specificity compared with Ku (27Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 28Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 29West R. Yaneva M. Lieber M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).DNA-PKcs and Ku show only weak association in the absence of DNA (30Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S. Mimori S. Hardin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, when Ku binds to a DNA end, a 12-amino acid sequence from the Ku80 C terminus becomes exposed that specifically binds and recruits DNA-PKcs to the DNA end (31Gell D. Jackson S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 32Singleton B. Torres-Arzayus M. Rottinghaus S. Taccioli G. Jeggo P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3267-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, Ku translocates inwardly from the DNA end, permitting DNA-PKcs to interact with the terminal nucleotides (25de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 28Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The cooperative interactions between DNA-PKcs, the DNA end, and the C terminus of Ku80 result in stable assembly of DNA-PK and robust kinase activation. This model for DNA-PK assembly is supported by specific photocross-linking of DNA-PKcs, but not Ku, to the terminal nucleotides when DNA-PKcs and Ku assemble on DNA ends (33Yoo S. Dynan W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4679-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).In its purified form, DNA-PK kinase activity is specifically activated by double-stranded DNA ends (12Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). We have further specified that DNA-PK activation involves interaction with ssDNA ends exposed at the DSB (34Hammarsten O. DeFazio L. Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1541-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, we have provided support for the existence of separate single- and double-stranded DNA binding sites in DNA-PKcs (35Leuther K.K. Hammarsten O. Kornberg R.D. Chu G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, we still have limited knowledge of how chemical modifications of the terminal nucleotides of a DSB affect kinase activation. This is relevant, since a majority of DSBs generated by ionizing radiation expose nucleotides with altered chemistry, such as thymidine glycol, 8-hydroxyguanine, and phosphoglycolate that preclude direct repair. (36Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 20-24Google Scholar). Because DNA-PK is required for efficient repair of ionizing radiation-induced DSBs, the enzyme must be able to recognize these altered chemical structures. Indeed, it has been shown that DNA-PK is activated by DSBs introduced by ionizing radiation and DNA fragments that end with 3â²-phosphoglycolates (37Weinfeld M. Chaudhry M. D'Amours D. Pelletier J. Poirer G. Povirk L. Lees-Miller S. Radiat. Res. 1998; 148: 22-28Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that a subset of the DSBs produced by ionizing radiation are not recognized by DNA-PK and thus are inefficiently repaired, such as DNA ends damaged with cis-platin (38Turchi J.J. Henkels K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13861-13867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Turchi J.J. Patrick S.M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7586-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Turchi J. Henkels M. Zhou Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Several studies have shown that ssDNA breaks (SSBs) activate DNA-PK poorly (11Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 37Weinfeld M. Chaudhry M. D'Amours D. Pelletier J. Poirer G. Povirk L. Lees-Miller S. Radiat. Res. 1998; 148: 22-28Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 41Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Brown G. Lewis S. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on a low resolution structure of DNA-PKcs, we have proposed that kinase activation results when a ssDNA end is inserted into an enclosed channel present in the enzyme (35Leuther K.K. Hammarsten O. Kornberg R.D. Chu G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This model provides a possible explanation for the requirement of ssDNA ends for kinase activation, since double-stranded DNA would not be able to enter the enclosed channel. However, a SSB potentially exposes ssDNA ends by fraying. Therefore, the requirement of ssDNA ends does not provide an explanation for how DNA-PK discriminates between SSBs and DSBs.Because of the potential general importance of DNA-PK activation by DSBs in DNA damage signaling, we have analyzed the requirements for DNA-PKcs kinase activation by DSBs. A series of symmetrical DNA fragments with defined modifications of the terminal nucleotides were synthesized. The DNA fragments were tested for their ability to bind and activate DNA-PKcs. We found that a wide range of modified nucleotides activated DNA-PKcs, indicating a relaxed specificity for the chemical nature of the DNA terminus. In addition, DNA-PKcs kinase activation seemed to require interaction with two single-stranded ends, which potentially explains why DSBs, but not SSBs, are capable of activating DNA-PK effectively. The data suggest how DNA-PK can be specifically activated by DSBs but still permissive for the diverse chemical structures exposed when DSBs are introduced by ionizing radiation.DISCUSSIONIn previous reports, we have shown that ssDNA ends activate DNA-PKcs. This provided a possible explanation for how DNA-PK is specifically activated by broken DNA, since the DNA backbone must be damaged to expose the necessary ssDNA ends. The data did not clarify why SSBs activate DNA-PK poorly nor which part of the ssDNA ends is recognized by DNA-PK. The molecular details of DNA-PK kinase activation by DNA ends are important to understand how the cell is able to recognize the chemically diverse structures that occur when DSBs are introduced by ionizing radiation.Collectively, our data indicate that DNA-PKcs has a relaxed specificity for the chemical structure of the terminal nucleotides of a DNA end. DNA fragments with abasic nucleotides bound and activated DNA-PKcs to the same extent as a DNA fragment ending with unpaired dA. This suggests that the base position in DNA is not specifically contacted by DNA-PKcs. It is therefore unlikely that the base modifications introduced by ionizing radiation will impede DNA-PK activation. DNA fragments with exclusively 3â² or 5â² polarity at the ends both activated DNA-PKcs, indicating a lack of strand polarity preference. No effect on DNA binding and kinase activation was evident when the terminal nucleotides were replaced by ribonucleotides or nucleotides with phosphothioester linkages. We also found that to prevent activation of DNA-PKcs a DSB must contain an incompatible chemical modification on both strands (Fig. 6). The data indicate that the ssDNA binding site in DNA-PKcs accepts a wide variety of chemical modifications, lacks strand polarity preference, and allows activation by DSBs even when one of the strands is incompatible with activation. Therefore, production of DSBs that avoid detection by DNA-PK is likely to be a rare event. This is in line with the finding that linear plasmid DNA generated by Î³ radiation activates DNA-PK to the same extent as plasmid DNA cleaved with restriction enzymes (37Weinfeld M. Chaudhry M. D'Amours D. Pelletier J. Poirer G. Povirk L. Lees-Miller S. Radiat. Res. 1998; 148: 22-28Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that more complex DSBs produced by high linear energy transfer radiation (44Nias A. An Introduction to Radiobiology.2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998: 102-105Google Scholar) and drugs such as calicheamicin or etoposide are not recognized by DNA-PK. In fact, DNA ends damaged with the anticancer drugcis-platin are unable to activate DNA-PK, and this could explain the ability of cis-platin to sensitize cells to ionizing radiation (38Turchi J.J. Henkels K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13861-13867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Turchi J.J. Patrick S.M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7586-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Turchi J. Henkels M. Zhou Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Three findings indicate that, in addition to the requirement for ssDNA ends, interaction with the DNA backbone is important for kinase activation. A DNA fragment extended with a hydrophilic spacer holding a dT at each of the four ssDNA ends bound and activated DNA-PKcs poorly. Although it is possible that the hydrophilic spacer simply interfered with activation, the data suggested that exposure of a correct terminal nucleotide was not sufficient for kinase activation. This indicated that efficient activation of DNA-PKcs involved interaction with the DNA backbone. This conclusion was further strengthened by the finding that methylphosphonate-modified DNA was bound by DNA-PKcs but activated its kinase poorly. The methylphosphonate modification replaces the negatively charged hydroxyl group in the phosphate backbone, resulting in an uncharged backbone. This suggest that the negative charge of the DNA backbone is required for kinase activation but not for binding. In addition we found, in agreement with others, that a double-stranded RNA fragment was unable to activate DNA-PKcs (11Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). However, a hybrid DNA fragment with identical overall structure but with three ribonucleotides at all four single-stranded ends activated DNA-PKcs efficiently. This indicates that the ssDNA binding site in DNA-PKcs fails to distinguish RNA from DNA strands. Therefore DNA-PK must distinguish RNA from DNA by its interactions with the double-stranded portion of DNA ends. Together these three observations show that interactions with the backbone, not just the ssDNA ends, of a DSB is involved in DNA-PKcs kinase activation.Ionizing radiation produces 10-fold more SSBs in DNA compared with DSBs (44Nias A. An Introduction to Radiobiology.2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998: 102-105Google Scholar). SSBs are known to be relatively nontoxic to cells (44Nias A. An Introduction to Radiobiology.2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998: 102-105Google Scholar) and are quickly repaired. In contrast, the few DSBs that are produced by ionizing radiation are very toxic to cells and take several hours to be fully repaired (45Wang H. Zeng Z. Bui T. DiBiase S. Qin W. Xia F. Powell S. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 270-277PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wang H. Zeng Z. Bui T. Sonoda E. Takata M. Takeda S. Iliakis G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, cells have a potent signaling system capable of distinguishing between SSBs and DSBs. Several reports indicate that DNA-PK is inefficiently activated by SSBs (11Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 37Weinfeld M. Chaudhry M. D'Amours D. Pelletier J. Poirer G. Povirk L. Lees-Miller S. Radiat. Res. 1998; 148: 22-28Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 41Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Brown G. Lewis S. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that DNA-PK plays a role in the discrimination among SSBs and DSBs in the cell. This possibility is supported by the finding that DNA-PK-deficient cells repair DSBs inefficiently, but have no defect in SSB repair (47Kemp L. Sedgwick S. Jeggo P. Mutat. Res. 1984; 132: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 48Darroudi F. Natarajan A. van der Schans G. van Loon A. Mutat. Res. 1990; 235: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One way for DNA-PK to discriminate between DSBs and SSBs is by simultaneous interaction with two ssDNA ends. A SSB is unable to expose two ssDNA ends with the configuration found in the context of a DSB. Therefore, a requirement for two ssDNA ends would render DNA-PK activation specific for DSBs. In support for this possibility, we found that three distinct DNA constructs that expose only one ssDNA end (D44-ss5â², D34-gap10, and the lariat DNA fragment) activated DNA-PKcs poorly. It is possible that these DNA fragments contain structures that mask activation by a single ssDNA end. However, the combined data support the possibility that DNA-PK discriminates SSB from DSB by a requirement for interaction with two ssDNA ends for efficient kinase activation.Based on a low resolution structure of DNA-PKcs, we have proposed that DNA-PKcs is activated when one ssDNA end enters an enclosed channel present in the enzyme (Fig.10A). Although this model potentially explains the requirement for ssDNA ends for activation, it does not provide a good explanation why DNA-PKcs seemes to require simultaneous interaction with two single strands for activation (Fig.9). One possibility is that activation of DNA-PKcs requires dimerization of two DNA-PKcs molecules each bound to a DNA end as we suggested previously (34Hammarsten O. DeFazio L. Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1541-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 10B). This configuration would have the added benefit of restricting full activation of DNA-PK until synapsis of the two ends of a DSB is complete. Since the uncharged backbone of methylphosphonate-modified DNA bound DNA-PKcs but failed to activate its kinase activity, it is possible that specific contacts with the charged phosphate backbone are involved in kinase activation. According to this model, interaction with the charged phosphate could occur within the enclosed channel.In conclusion, we have found that DNA-PKcs recognizes DNA ends containing a wide range of modified nucleotides and seems to require simultaneous interaction with two ssDNA ends for activation. These properties potentially make DNA-PK activation specific for DSBs but still capable of recognizing DNA ends with damaged terminal nucleotides. DNA-PK is therefore a suitable candidate for detection of DSBs when cells are damaged by ionizing radiation. With this knowledge it will be interesting to examine DNA-PK recognition of cross-linked DNA fragments and complex strand breaks such as those produced by cytotoxic cancer therapy and high linear energy transfer radiation. The resolution and detection of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs)1 is important in maintaining genomic integrity. A single DSB can lead to chromosomal fragmentation and cell death or to chromosomal translocations and cancer. DSBs are induced by ionizing radiation, DNA replication or V(D)J recombination, a site-specific recombination process that generates the molecular diversity of the immune system. In response to ionizing radiation, cells target DSBs for repair and also activate several signaling pathways that lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (1Ross G. Endocr. Relat Cancer. 1999; 6: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Several protein kinases involved in the DSB signaling pathway have been identified and include DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), ATM (2Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C. Chessa L.

DNA-PK has also been reported to be required for induction of apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation in thymocytes (20Wang S. Guo M. Ouyang H. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Kurimasa A. Chen D. Fuks Z.

DNA-PK activation by DSBs can therefore be used as a model for how proteins specifically recognize and signal the presence of DSB lesions. DNA-PK is a serine-threonine protein kinase that is composed of a 465-kDa catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, (21Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P.

AdoMet is the major donor of methyl groups for transmethylation reactions in eukaryotic systems (3Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol.

S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), generated by the transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet, is converted to adenosine and homocysteine by AdoHcy hydrolase (5Chiang P.K. Gordon R.K. Tal J. Zeng G.C. Doctor B.P. Pardhasaradhi K. McCann P.P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Because cells try to maintain low AdoHcy levels, the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio is indicative of the relative potential for transmethylation reactions, once theS-methyl moiety has been transferred and the AdoHcy is cleaved by AdoHcy hydrolase (6Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Martin J.L. Pick A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Homocysteine can be readily transformed into cysteine, thereby participating in the metabolism of glutathione, the scavenger tripeptide involved in the sulfur redox status of eukaryotes (7Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Finally, 2â5% of total intracellular AdoMet is used as a precursor for higher polyamines such as spermidine and spermine in all living cells (8Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 285-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). After AdoMet is decarboxylated, the released aminopropyl moiety can be captured by putrescine and spermidine to synthesize spermidine and spermine, respectively (9Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar).MAT enzymes are involved in two enzymatic activities. In the first reaction AdoMet and tripolyphosphate (PPPi) are synthesized from ATP and l-methionine. In the second, the tripolyphosphate is hydrolyzed to orthophosphate (Pi) and pyrophosphate (PPi) before the products are released. MAT-I and MAT-III, products of the same MAT1A gene, are predominantly expressed in adult liver (10Pajares M.A. Corrales F. Duran C. Mato J.M. Alvarez L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MAT-II, a product of theMAT2A gene, is present in most tissues of the fetus and newborn, and in the kidney, brain, lymphocytes, testis, lens, as well as the early regenerating liver of adults (11De La Rosa J. Ostrowski J. Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. Kotb M. LeGros Jr., H.L. Valentine H. Geller A.M. J. Biol.

Cabrero C. Pajares M.A. Ortiz P. Martin-Duce A. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1990; 11: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas MAT-II (Mr 185,000) is a heterooligomeric complex comprised of Î±2/Î±2â² (11De La Rosa J. Ostrowski J.

The Î±2â² subunit of the MAT-II isozyme is considered to be a post-translational modification of the Î±2 subunit that occurs as the organism matures.There are few reports on AdoMet metabolism in Trypanosomatids. Yarlettet al. (15Yarlett N. Garofalo J. Goldberg B. Ciminelli M.A. Ruggiero U. Sufrin J.R. Bacchi C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) described two different MAT isoforms inTrypanosoma brucei, which were evident from Eadie-Hofstee and Hanes-Woolf plots, that had different affinities forl-methionine and ATP. The depletion of polyamine metabolism with the irreversible enzyme-activated inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, Î±-dl-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), caused massive accumulation of AdoMet and decarboxylated AdoMet (dcAdoMet) in trypanosomes. The reason for this buildup is due to the unregulated nature of the trypanosome MAT (16Bacchi C.J. Yarlett N. Acta Trop. 1993; 54: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In mammalian tissues this enzyme is closely regulated by its product, whereas the MAT activity in trypanosomes is not. After DFMO treatment and increases in AdoMet concentration, the methylation index (the ratio of AdoMet to AdoHcy) in trypanosomes raises to >100, whereas in mammalian cells this ratio is on the order of 5â10 (17Yarlett N. Bacchi C.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This striking difference between host and parasite may be the grounds for establishing MAT as a drug target in polyamine-based chemotherapy (3Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).In this report we describe the cloning and organization of theMAT2 gene from Leishmania infantum, as well as the heterologous expression, protein purification, and kinetic analysis of the recombinant enzyme.DISCUSSIONThe existence of multiple MAT genes and isozymes in different species is well established. Previous kinetic studies (15Yarlett N. Garofalo J. Goldberg B. Ciminelli M.A. Ruggiero U. Sufrin J.R. Bacchi C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported two isoforms of the enzyme in T. brucei. The sequence described in this report conserved homologies with S. cerevisiae (60%), Mus musculus (59%), Homo sapiens (59%), Rattus novergicus (58%), P. falciparum (53%), and E. coli (52%) MAT-II (encoded by the MAT2 gene). Sequence homology analysis showed similarities with S. cerevisiae (59%), R. novergicus (57%), H. sapiens (56%), and E. coli (52%) MAT-I/III (encoded by the MAT1 gene).MAT1 and MAT2 sequences described so far have shown high homology, and the BLAST algorithm sequence analysis indicated a higher degree of conserved homology with MAT-II. The reason for the existence of two MAT isozymes is still obscure. Only AdoMet generated by the reaction catalyzed by the metK enzyme would be used to repress the methionine biosynthetic enzyme (36Hobson A.C. Smith D.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because none of the E. coli strains showed size differences in themetK region, it is tempting to speculate thatmetX arose from a duplication of the metK locus (38Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The occurrence of duplicated genes encoding proteins is frequent in Leishmania sp.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In our study we found two identical copies for the gene that encodes MAT-II. We were not able to determine whether these copies in the L. infantumgenome meet cellular needs for AdoMet, i.e. needs that are accommodated for in other source cell MAT-I/III and MAT-II isoforms.These two copies, arranged in a head-to-tail tandem, are separated by a 4-kb IR. There is no evidence of introns. Most tandemly arranged genes in Trypanosomatids are transcribed into large polycistronic precursor RNAs, which are subsequently processed into monocistronic mRNAs by trans-splicing, in turned followed by addition of a 39-nucleotide spliced leader to the 5â²-ends and a poly(A)-tail to the 3â²-ends (32LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Gene. 1991; 103: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This âcut and pasteâ mechanism is interrelated, whereby the poly(A) addition is governed by the location of the splice acceptor site on the downstream gene (32LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Gene. 1991; 103: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because no poly(A) signals have been described in Trypanosomatids, the explanation generally accepted for this phenomenon is that the distance between splice acceptor site and the polyadenylation site is conserved (43Teixeira S.M. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1998; 31: 1503-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The 3â²-UTR of L. infantum MAT2 transcript was not analyzed in detail in this study, because no difference in luciferase activity was observed between L. infantum promastigotes transfected with plasmids containing or lacking IR sequences. The minimal vector for transient gene expression in Leishmania consists of a circular plasmid containing a signal for trans-splicing followed by a reporter gene (36Hobson A.C. Smith D.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because polyadenylation and trans-splicing are coupled, a second trans-splicing signal should exist downstream of the reporter gene, a signal which, in our case, seems to be provided by the vector sequence itself. In addition to the suitable distance between the spliced leader acceptor site and the polyadenylation site, the presence of several polypyrimidine-rich motifs is also crucial, because only AG dinucleotides located downstream of a polypyrimidine tract are used as splice acceptor sites. The presence of a 2-kb conserved region upstream of each MAT2 gene, containing both the polypyrimidine tracts and the splice acceptor site, not only suggests the duplication of the ORF but also the surrounding regions, and is indicative of similar control elements for transcription of these two MAT2genes.Because the sequences located upstream of the coding regions in both copies of the MAT2 gene are exactly the same, it is impossible for us to ascertain, by 5â² mapping analysis, whether both ORFs are able to originate mature mRNAs. It has been shown here that expression of the firefly luciferase gene transfected in L. infantum is dependent on the presence of Leishmania5â²-DNA sequences. These DNA sequences can be provided by truncated 415-, 355-, or 136-bp fragments from the same region that contains the AG trans-splicing acceptor site. All these fragments gave rise to high levels of the luciferase activity. We have shown that a polypyrimidine tract and an AG site located upstream of the luc gene start codon were sufficient to yield luciferase activity without the presence of a promoter region.The 42-kDa polypeptide predicted on the grounds of theoretical ORF for MAT-II is considerably smaller than 49-kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE in this study. Such discrepancies have been reported for MAT isozymes from different species (3Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Anomalously slow migration in SDS-PAGE has been attributed to excess charge density, or more specifically to an unusually high acidic amino acids content. Although the entire MAT-II peptide has a net charge of â7, because many of the basic residues are located in the carboxyl-terminal portion, the first 210 amino acids have a net charge of â19.L. infantum recombinant MAT-II shows significant sigmoidal kinetic behavior for both l-methionine and ATP. Positive cooperativity for l-methionine was found using Lineweaver-Burk plots but was observed to disappear in the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP (5 mm). Nevertheless, sigmoidal behavior was not ruled out for ATP in the presence of saturating concentration of the l-amino acid. TheKâ² values calculated for l-methionine and ATP correspond to a low affinity enzyme, resembling the dimeric form (MAT-III) of hepatic MAT-I/III isoforms. The tripolyphosphatase activity observed in recombinant L. infantum MAT-II has a sigmoidal behavior and is extremely sensitive to the presence of AdoMet in the incubation medium. The presence of AdoMet in the assay buffer has a paradoxical effect on both MAT and tripolyphosphatase activity. MAT-II is negatively regulated by its product AdoMet in the micromolar range in most of mammalians sources, as well as in S. cerevisiae and E. coli, whereas the simultaneous presence of AdoMet enhances tripolyphosphatase activity several times. The Ki for AdoMet inhibition ofLeishmania MAT-II is very high in comparison with its host counterparts and T. brucei. The estimatedKi of 1.5 mm suggests that, unlike the mammalian enzyme, Leishmania MAT activity is weakly regulated by its product. In addition, Northern blot analysis shows that MAT2 is only synthesized by promastigotes in a low range. These characteristics may explain the anomalous accumulation of intracellular AdoMet and dcAdoMet after treatment with DFMO in Trypanosomatids. Other substrate and product analogues showed a weak inhibitory effect on recombinant MAT activity. The final products of dephosphorylation, PPi and Pi, inhibit MAT-II more efficiently than AdoMet. AdoMet analogues, such as AdoHcy,S-adenosylcysteine, or S-adenosylethionine, moreover, only proved to have an inhibitory effect at the millimolar level.All these results suggest poor post-translational MAT-II regulation inLeishmania parasites. Further experiments will be necessary to assess the MAT2 gene regulation, either at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT1;S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetase, EC 2.5.1.6) catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) from l-methionine and ATP (1Cantoni G.L. J. Biol.

The depletion of polyamine metabolism with the irreversible enzyme-activated inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, Î±-dl-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), caused massive accumulation of AdoMet and decarboxylated AdoMet (dcAdoMet) in trypanosomes. The reason for this buildup is due to the unregulated nature of the trypanosome MAT (16Bacchi C.J. Yarlett N. Acta Trop. 1993; 54: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In mammalian tissues this enzyme is closely regulated by its product, whereas the MAT activity in trypanosomes is not. After DFMO treatment and increases in AdoMet concentration, the methylation index (the ratio of AdoMet to AdoHcy) in trypanosomes raises to >100, whereas in mammalian cells this ratio is on the order of 5â10 (17Yarlett N. Bacchi C.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This striking difference between host and parasite may be the grounds for establishing MAT as a drug target in polyamine-based chemotherapy (3Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the cloning and organization of theMAT2 gene from Leishmania infantum, as well as the heterologous expression, protein purification, and kinetic analysis of the recombinant enzyme. DISCUSSIONThe existence of multiple MAT genes and isozymes in different species is well established. Previous kinetic studies (15Yarlett N. Garofalo J. Goldberg B. Ciminelli M.A. Ruggiero U. Sufrin J.R. Bacchi C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported two isoforms of the enzyme in T. brucei. The sequence described in this report conserved homologies with S. cerevisiae (60%), Mus musculus (59%), Homo sapiens (59%), Rattus novergicus (58%), P. falciparum (53%), and E. coli (52%) MAT-II (encoded by the MAT2 gene). Sequence homology analysis showed similarities with S. cerevisiae (59%), R. novergicus (57%), H. sapiens (56%), and E. coli (52%) MAT-I/III (encoded by the MAT1 gene).MAT1 and MAT2 sequences described so far have shown high homology, and the BLAST algorithm sequence analysis indicated a higher degree of conserved homology with MAT-II. The reason for the existence of two MAT isozymes is still obscure. Only AdoMet generated by the reaction catalyzed by the metK enzyme would be used to repress the methionine biosynthetic enzyme (36Hobson A.C. Smith D.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because none of the E. coli strains showed size differences in themetK region, it is tempting to speculate thatmetX arose from a duplication of the metK locus (38Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The occurrence of duplicated genes encoding proteins is frequent in Leishmania sp.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In our study we found two identical copies for the gene that encodes MAT-II. We were not able to determine whether these copies in the L. infantumgenome meet cellular needs for AdoMet, i.e. needs that are accommodated for in other source cell MAT-I/III and MAT-II isoforms.These two copies, arranged in a head-to-tail tandem, are separated by a 4-kb IR. There is no evidence of introns. Most tandemly arranged genes in Trypanosomatids are transcribed into large polycistronic precursor RNAs, which are subsequently processed into monocistronic mRNAs by trans-splicing, in turned followed by addition of a 39-nucleotide spliced leader to the 5â²-ends and a poly(A)-tail to the 3â²-ends (32LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Gene. 1991; 103: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This âcut and pasteâ mechanism is interrelated, whereby the poly(A) addition is governed by the location of the splice acceptor site on the downstream gene (32LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Gene. 1991; 103: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because no poly(A) signals have been described in Trypanosomatids, the explanation generally accepted for this phenomenon is that the distance between splice acceptor site and the polyadenylation site is conserved (43Teixeira S.M. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1998; 31: 1503-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The 3â²-UTR of L. infantum MAT2 transcript was not analyzed in detail in this study, because no difference in luciferase activity was observed between L. infantum promastigotes transfected with plasmids containing or lacking IR sequences. The minimal vector for transient gene expression in Leishmania consists of a circular plasmid containing a signal for trans-splicing followed by a reporter gene (36Hobson A.C. Smith D.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because polyadenylation and trans-splicing are coupled, a second trans-splicing signal should exist downstream of the reporter gene, a signal which, in our case, seems to be provided by the vector sequence itself. In addition to the suitable distance between the spliced leader acceptor site and the polyadenylation site, the presence of several polypyrimidine-rich motifs is also crucial, because only AG dinucleotides located downstream of a polypyrimidine tract are used as splice acceptor sites. The presence of a 2-kb conserved region upstream of each MAT2 gene, containing both the polypyrimidine tracts and the splice acceptor site, not only suggests the duplication of the ORF but also the surrounding regions, and is indicative of similar control elements for transcription of these two MAT2genes.Because the sequences located upstream of the coding regions in both copies of the MAT2 gene are exactly the same, it is impossible for us to ascertain, by 5â² mapping analysis, whether both ORFs are able to originate mature mRNAs. It has been shown here that expression of the firefly luciferase gene transfected in L. infantum is dependent on the presence of Leishmania5â²-DNA sequences. These DNA sequences can be provided by truncated 415-, 355-, or 136-bp fragments from the same region that contains the AG trans-splicing acceptor site. All these fragments gave rise to high levels of the luciferase activity. We have shown that a polypyrimidine tract and an AG site located upstream of the luc gene start codon were sufficient to yield luciferase activity without the presence of a promoter region.The 42-kDa polypeptide predicted on the grounds of theoretical ORF for MAT-II is considerably smaller than 49-kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE in this study. Such discrepancies have been reported for MAT isozymes from different species (3Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Anomalously slow migration in SDS-PAGE has been attributed to excess charge density, or more specifically to an unusually high acidic amino acids content. Although the entire MAT-II peptide has a net charge of â7, because many of the basic residues are located in the carboxyl-terminal portion, the first 210 amino acids have a net charge of â19.L. infantum recombinant MAT-II shows significant sigmoidal kinetic behavior for both l-methionine and ATP. Positive cooperativity for l-methionine was found using Lineweaver-Burk plots but was observed to disappear in the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP (5 mm). Nevertheless, sigmoidal behavior was not ruled out for ATP in the presence of saturating concentration of the l-amino acid. TheKâ² values calculated for l-methionine and ATP correspond to a low affinity enzyme, resembling the dimeric form (MAT-III) of hepatic MAT-I/III isoforms. The tripolyphosphatase activity observed in recombinant L. infantum MAT-II has a sigmoidal behavior and is extremely sensitive to the presence of AdoMet in the incubation medium. The presence of AdoMet in the assay buffer has a paradoxical effect on both MAT and tripolyphosphatase activity. MAT-II is negatively regulated by its product AdoMet in the micromolar range in most of mammalians sources, as well as in S. cerevisiae and E. coli, whereas the simultaneous presence of AdoMet enhances tripolyphosphatase activity several times. The Ki for AdoMet inhibition ofLeishmania MAT-II is very high in comparison with its host counterparts and T. brucei. The estimatedKi of 1.5 mm suggests that, unlike the mammalian enzyme, Leishmania MAT activity is weakly regulated by its product. In addition, Northern blot analysis shows that MAT2 is only synthesized by promastigotes in a low range. These characteristics may explain the anomalous accumulation of intracellular AdoMet and dcAdoMet after treatment with DFMO in Trypanosomatids. Other substrate and product analogues showed a weak inhibitory effect on recombinant MAT activity. The final products of dephosphorylation, PPi and Pi, inhibit MAT-II more efficiently than AdoMet. AdoMet analogues, such as AdoHcy,S-adenosylcysteine, or S-adenosylethionine, moreover, only proved to have an inhibitory effect at the millimolar level.All these results suggest poor post-translational MAT-II regulation inLeishmania parasites. Further experiments will be necessary to assess the MAT2 gene regulation, either at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. The existence of multiple MAT genes and isozymes in different species is well established. Previous kinetic studies (15Yarlett N. Garofalo J. Goldberg B. Ciminelli M.A. Ruggiero U. Sufrin J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2100343265,"Î²-d-Glucosylhydroxymethyluracil, also called base J, is an unusual modified DNA base conserved among Kinetoplastida. Base J is found predominantly in repetitive DNA and correlates with epigenetic silencing of telomeric variant surface glycoprotein genes. We have previously found a J-binding protein (JBP) in Trypanosoma, Leishmania, andCrithidia. We have now characterized the binding properties of recombinant JBP from Crithidia using synthetic J-DNA substrates that contain the glycosylated base in various DNA sequences. We find that JBP recognizes base J only when presented in double-stranded DNA but not in single-stranded DNA or in an RNA:DNA duplex. It also fails to interact with free glucose or free base J. JBP is unable to recognize nonmodified DNA or intermediates of J synthesis, suggesting that JBP is not directly involved in J biosynthesis. JBP binds J-DNA with high affinity (Kd = 40â140 nm) but requires at least 5 bp flanking the glycosylated base for optimal binding. The nature of the flanking sequence affects binding because J in a telomeric sequence binds JBP with higher affinity than J in another sequence known to contain J in trypanosome DNA. We conclude that JBP is a structure-specific DNA-binding protein. The significance of these results in relation to the biological role and mechanism of action of J modification in kinetoplastids is discussed.

In all kinetoplastids, J is abundantly present in telomeric repeats (3van Leeuwen F. Taylor M.C. Mondragon A. Moreau H. Gibson W. Kieft R. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2366-2371Google Scholar). In the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, J is also found in the telomeric variant surface glycoprotein (VSG)1 gene expression sites involved in antigenic variation (4van Leeuwen F. Wijsman E.R.

The presence of J in inactive telomeric VSG gene expression sites but not in the active site suggests that J may be involved in the transcriptional repression of VSG gene expression sites and thus antigenic variation (3van Leeuwen F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1745-1751Google Scholar). It has been suggested that J is involved in long term transcriptional repression and that J could also suppress unwanted recombination between repetitive sequences in the genome (3van Leeuwen F.

Whether this is true and whether J is the cause or the consequence of this silencing remain to be determined. However, consistent with both ideas, the protrusion of the sugar group of the major groove of DNA, at specific locations, could allow the recognition and binding of proteins that would mediate J function. These proteins could lead to gene silencing and/or suppression of DNA recombination, both of which are involved in the mechanism of antigenic variation. Our recent discovery of J-binding proteins (JBPs) in kinetoplastids that specifically bind J-containing DNA is compatible with this idea (10Cross M. Kieft R. Sabatini R. Wilm M. de Kort M. van der Marel G. van Boom J. van Leeuwen F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6573-6581Google Scholar). By understanding how JBP specifically recognizes and binds the unique modified base in DNA could represent a first step in elucidating the function and mechanism of J action. In this report, we use recombinant JBP to study the interaction between JBP and J-DNA. We utilize DNA duplexes with base J at defined positions to determine the kinetics and specificity of the interaction between J-DNA and JBP. We show that JBP recognizes with very high specificity the glucosylated base only when present in double-stranded DNA. The inability for free base J to compete with JBP-binding J-DNA, the requirement for one helical turn of double-stranded DNA for optimal binding, and the higher affinity of JBP for repetitive DNA suggest that DNA structure is an essential component of the recognition of base J by JBP. Thus, there is more to the JBP/J-DNA interaction than just glucose recognition. Our findings suggest it is the glucosylated base in DNA, rather than DNA or base J itself, that is recognized by JBP. We conclude that JBP is a structure-specific DNA-binding protein. T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Invitrogen. [Î³-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Standard nonmodified oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. Oligos were end-labeled with [Î³-32P]ATP and purified by exclusion chromatography. For double-stranded DNA substrates, the labeled oligo was annealed to its nonlabeled complementary strand by heating in a 3-fold excess of the complementary strand for 5 min at 95 Â°C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The oligos were verified by native gel analysis to be double-stranded. Double-stranded oligo competitors were prepared in a similar manner except that both strands were nonlabeled.Table IDuplex oligonucleotides used in this studySequenceOligo1-aSubstrate Tel-T-OH is also known as Tel-V; see Ref. 10.5â²-CAGAAGGCAGCJGCAACAAG-3â²VSG-1JGTCTTCCGTCGACGTTGTTC5â²-ACCCTAACCCJAACCCTAAC-3â²Tel-1JTGGGATTGGGATTGGGATTG5â²-ACCCJAACCCJAACCCJAACCCJA-3â²Tel-4JTGGGATTGGGATTGGGATTGGGAT5â²-ACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAAC-3â²Tel-TTGGGATTGGGATTGGGATTGOH OH OH OHâ£ â£ â£ â£5â²-ACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTA-3â²Tel-T-OHTGGGATTGGGATTGGGATTGGGAT5â²-ACCCTAACCCJAACCCTAAC-3â²ssTel-1J5â²-CAGAAGGCAGCJGCAACAAG-3â²VSG-isoJGTCTTCCGJCGACGTTGTTC5â²-TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT-3â²VSG-AAAGAACAACGTCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGA5â²-TTCTTGTJGCAGCTGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT-3â²VSG-BAAGAACAACGTCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGA5â²-TTCTTGTJGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCTGC-3â²VSG-2J5AAGAACAACGTCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGACG5â²-TTCTTGTJGCAGCTGCCTJCTGTTTCTGCTGC-3â²VSG-2J10AAGAACAACGTCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGACG5â²-CAGAAGGCAGCJGCAACAAGCAGAAGGCAGCJGCAACAAG-3â²VSG-2J19GTCTTCCGTCGACGTTGTTCGTCTTCCGTCGACGTTGTTC1-a Substrate Tel-T-OH is also known as Tel-V; see Ref. 10Cross M.

Open table in a new tab The VSG-2J19 substrate (Table I) was generated by ligation of two molecules of the VSG-1J J-oligo using the corresponding 40-mer complementary âsplintâ oligo. For ligation 20 pm of the J-oligo kinased with [Î³â32P]ATP was hybridized to 10 pmol of unlabeled complementary oligo, and the resulting nick between the two molecules of VSG-1J was ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation product was gel-purified on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8m urea gel, DNA recovered by ethanol precipitation, and hybridized to unlabeled complementary oligo (40 pmol). VSG-2J5 and VSG-2J15 were chemically synthesized as described above. Crithidia fasciculata JBP was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography as described previously (10Cross M. Kieft R. Sabatini R. Wilm M. de Kort M. van der Marel G. van Boom J. van Leeuwen F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6573-6581Google Scholar). However, to increase the purity of the affinity-purified JBP fraction, the His6 tag was increased to His10 by PCR. The affinity-purified JBP was concentrated to 2 ml in a Centricon-100 apparatus and loaded onto a Sephadex S-200 (Amersham Biosciences 16/60) column equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The fractions containing JBP were pooled and concentrated to 200 Î¼l by Centricon-100 (10â20 mg/ml final concentration). JBP purified in this manner was more than 95% pure as judged by its appearance on the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. In this procedure, we are able to obtain â¼2 mg of JBP from 5 liters of bacterial culture. The standard binding reaction mixture (20 Î¼l) contained 35 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl, 10 Î¼g of bovine serum albumin, 2 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 4 Î¼g of Î±-casein, and indicated amounts of protein and radiolabeled DNA substrates. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and analyzed on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1) using 0.5Ã TBE at 150 V for 60â90 min at room temperature. After drying, the gels were exposed to film and to a PhosphorImager screen for quantitation of the bands. Under conditions in which [DNA] < Kd, the concentration of the protein that results in 50% maximal formation of a protein-DNA complex is approximately equal to Kd. The Kd= [protein][DNA]/[protein-DNA] was measured as the concentration of JBP at which half of the maximal target J-DNA is bound. To keep the J-DNA concentration below Kd, 10 fmol of labeled oligonucleotide was used in a total reaction volume of 20 Î¼l with varying amounts of JBP. The data from three titration gels were averaged to obtain the reported Kd values. JBP was incubated with the VSG-1J duplex (Table I) and immediately loaded onto a native gel to examine the on rate for complex formation. To determine the off rate, a complex was formed between the labeled VSG-1J substrate and JBP. Following the 10-min incubation, 300-fold molar excess of unlabeled VSG-1J substrate was added, and the reaction was immediately loaded onto the native gel. For competition assays 40 fmol of32P-labeled DNA substrates were used together with 10â500-fold excess of unlabeled substrate. The protein (25 nm) was added to the mixture last. Identical results were obtained if the labeled substrate was added last, after the preincubation of cold competitor and JBP. We have developed previously a rapid isolation procedure for His-tagged recombinant JBP produced in E. coli (10Cross M. Kieft R. Sabatini R. Wilm M. de Kort M. van der Marel G. van Boom J. van Leeuwen F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6573-6581Google Scholar). We have further improved this procedure by replacing the His6 tag by a His10tag. The recombinant JBP obtained was â¼95% pure, as judged by its appearance in Coomassie-stained gels, and thus was suitable for investigating the specific interaction of JBP and J-modified DNA (J-DNA). Table I lists the modified substrates used in this study, which vary in the amount and sequence context of base J as well as in the overall size and sequence of the oligos. The specificity of the interaction of JBP and J-DNA was determined by competition and direct binding assays. Fig.1 shows the inability of JBP to bind to unmodified DNA. We see no competition of the shifted complex using unlabeled unmodified substrate (identical sequence with thymine instead of J) at concentrations sufficient for J-DNA to result in 90% inhibition (Fig. 1B). There is also no competition with up to 500-fold excess of nonmodified DNA. This was further analyzed by a direct binding assay using labeled unmodified DNA. Unmodified DNA does not result in a shifted complex with JBP (Fig. 1C). Thus, our highly purified recombinant JBP has similar binding specificity as native JBP assayed in kinetoplastid nuclear extracts (10Cross M. Kieft R. Sabatini R. Wilm M. de Kort M. van der Marel G. van Boom J. van Leeuwen F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6573-6581Google Scholar). Indirect evidence indicates that J is made in two steps. A thymine in DNA is converted to 5-(hydroxymethyl)uracil, which in turn is glycosylated to form J (Fig. 1A; Ref. 8van Leeuwen F. Kieft R. Cross M. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5643-5651Google Scholar). To determine whether JBP has some affinity for the putative intermediate in J synthesis, we tested whether DNA containing 5-(hydroxymethyl)uracil could inhibit JBP binding. Substrate Tel-T-OH, which is the same as Tel-1J but has 4 of the thymines replaced with 5-(hydroxymethyl)uracil, was unable to compete significantly for JBP binding (Fig.1B). 500-Fold excess of Tel-T-OH failed to complete to similar levels as 10-fold Tel-1J. Furthermore, if we test the Tel-T-OH substrate in the direct binding assay, we see what appears to be a very small amount of shifted complex (Fig. 1C). By PhosphorImager analysis, this apparent shift is â¼100-fold less than the complex formed with J-containing DNA (Tel-1J). We also tested the free glycosylated nucleotide (pdJ), glucose, and activated nucleotide sugars potentially involved in J synthesis, UDP-Glc, and GDP-Glc. None of these were found to compete with J-oligos for JBP binding up to 500-fold molar excess (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Glucose and pdJ fail to compete even up to 1,000-fold molar excess (data not shown). Next, we tested single-stranded J-oligonucleotides to examine the requirement of base J in duplex DNA for JBP binding. As shown in Fig.1C, there was no detectable binding of the ssTel-J substrate. Fig. 1D shows that JBP does not bind to an RNA:J-DNA hybrid, whereas the same J-DNA strand annealed to a complementary DNA strand readily formed a complex with JBP. JBP binding to the RNA:J-DNA duplex could not be induced by inclusion of magnesium or mangenese over a concentration range of 0.5â10 mm (data not shown). Identical results were obtained with the VSG-1J (Fig.1D) or Tel-1J substrates (not shown). The failure of the RNA:J-DNA substrate to bind JBP is not because of the failure of the radiolabeled J-DNA strand to hybridize to the RNA complement, as shown in Fig. 1E. The mobility of the hybridized substrates is lower than that of substrates subjected to boiling in formamide. Taken together, these results demonstrate that JBP specifically recognizes J only in the context of dsDNA. The failure of JBP to recognize the RNA:J-DNA duplex may reflect the sensitivity of JBP to the global conformation of the helix (e.g. A-form versusB-form). To determine the relative binding affinity of JBP for J-DNA, we used the gel shift assay to investigate the binding of JBP to J-DNA duplexes (VSG-1J and Tel-1J) that have a single centrally located J modification. The dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by titrating under conditions of relatively low concentrations of J-DNA duplex ([J-DNA] âª Kd). The DNA substrates were incubated with increasing amounts of JBP protein, and the complex was analyzed on native gels. The results of the gel shift assay in Fig. 2,A and C, show that the amount of free J-DNA decreases with increasing concentrations of JBP. The binding curve (Fig. 2, B and D) is hyperbolic, indicative of a true equilibrium process. We calculate the dissociation constants for JBP with the VSG and telomeric substrates of 160 and 43 nm, respectively (Table II). Thus, JBP has a 3.5-fold higher affinity for the telomeric than for the VSG substrate.Table IISummary of Kd of JBP bound to J-DNA of various sequences and contextOligoLengthKdntnmTel-1J2040 Â± 2.6Tel-4J2437 Â± 1.5VSG-1J20140 Â± 8.3VSG-A30176 Â± 20VSG-B30166 Â± 26VSG-isoJ20120 Â± 4VSG-2J532130 Â± 6VSG-2J1032120 Â± 2.5VSG-2J1940110 Â± 8 Open table in a new tab It is clear from these binding studies that JBP is not able to bind 100% of the DNA substrate. The inability to shift all input DNA into complex is due to the impurity of the J-oligo following chemical synthesis of J-DNA. During the de-blocking step of synthesis a small fraction of each oligo preparation undergoes a nucleophilic attack by ammonia resulting in the replacement of the glucose moiety in base J by an amino group. This fraction of oligo preparation is unable to bind JBP. Small variations in the fraction of aminomethylthymidine in the J-oligos can explain the variability in maximal percent binding that depends on the oligo tested. However, the â¼4-fold difference in affinity reported here is not due to the quality of each of the J-DNA substrates because the lower affinity data are from the substrate that resulted in the higher maximal percent binding (â¼70% maximal binding by the VSG-1J substrate compared with â¼50% for the Tel-1J). In addition, the Tel-4J substrate, containing 4 J molecules, has a higher percentage of substrate bound by JBP (over 80%) but still results in a similar Kd as the single J-modified telomeric sequence (Fig. 4A and TableIII).Table IIIJ-DNA truncation substrates and percent relative binding to JBPSubstrateSequenceDuplexBinding%13-16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+100AAGAACAACGTCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGA13-7TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+126 Â± 10AAGAACAACGTCGACGGAAGA13-6TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+122 Â± 10AAGAACAACGTCGACGGAAG13-5TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+81 Â± 11AAGAACAACGTCGACGGAA13-4TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+39 Â± 8AAGAACAACGTCGACGGA13-3TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+9 Â± 5AAGAACAACGTCGACGG13-2TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+27 Â± 9AAGAACAACGTCGACG13-1TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+7 Â± 3AAGAACAACGTCGAC13-0TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+5 Â± 3AAGAACAACGTCGA13TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCTâ4 Â± 3AAGAACAACGTCG7-16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+100 Â± 3AACGTCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGA6-16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+100 Â± 6ACGTCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGA5-16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+79 Â± 10CGTCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGA4-16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+36 Â± 8GTCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGA3-16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+47 Â± 8TCGACGGAAGACAAAGACGA2-16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+38 Â± 12CGACGGAAGACAAAGACGA1-16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+20 Â± 3GACGGAAGACAAAGACGA0-16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+4 Â± 1ACGGAAGACAAAGACGA16TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+5 Â± 2CGGAAGACAAAGACGA77TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+126 Â± 11AACGTCGACGGAAGA66TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCT+117 Â± 13ACGTCGACGGAAG55TTCTTGTTGCAGCJGCCTTCTGTTTCTGCTâ67 Â± 10CGTCGACGGAA Open table in a new tab In addition to equilibrium binding, we attempted to use the gel shift assay to determine the on/off rates of JBP interaction with J-DNA. The dissociation rate constant was examined by adding excess unlabeled substrate to a pre-equilibrated JBP-labeled substrate complex and measuring the decay of the preexisting complex as a function of time. However, we see maximal competition at the shortest time point possible (i.e. loading a running gel immediately following competitor addition). Similarly, we see maximal complex formation following the shortest reaction incubation period possible by the gel shift assay (data not shown). Therefore, the short time scales required for the association and dissociation do not allow us to obtain reliable values for these reaction constants using this method. It is interesting that even with this high off rate we are able to detect complex formation by gel shift analysis. This is believed to be due to a caging effect of the polyacrylamide gel matrix that stabilizes complexes that are formed prior to gel entry (12Cann J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17032-17042Google Scholar). To examine the effects of multiple Js on JBP binding, we tested the telomeric substrate containing four telomeric repeats with all four of the thymines converted to base J (Tel-4J, Table I). OurKd estimation indicates that JBP has similar binding affinities for the telomeric substrate independent of the amount of J modification (Table II and Fig. 4B). These results suggest that JBP contains a single binding site for J and that a single modified base in DNA is sufficient for maximal high affinity binding. Furthermore, JBP seems to have a preference for J in the context of telomeric versus a relatively nonspecific sequence. However, we find no effect on the affinity of JBP for J within several different sequence contexts other than the telomeric sequence (Tables I and II). Thus, JBP recognizes J-DNA in a relative sequence-independent manner with higher affinity for the telomeric sequence potentially due to its altered secondary structure. To determine the minimal substrate for JBP recognition, we used a 30-mer J-oligo hybridized to complementary oligos containing various truncations from each end (Table III). As J in ssDNA does not detectably bind JBP (Fig. 1C), the truncations allowed us to quickly scan the extent of duplex DNA required at regions flanking base J without synthesizing different sized J-oligos. This also avoided the technical problems we have encountered in synthesizing the J-oligos. The use of a single J-oligo allowed us to quantitate the changes in binding due to the extent of DNA duplex rather than those due to potential varying J levels in each J-oligo preparation. If we express the percent binding relative to the control 30-mer duplex containing the full complementary duplex regions of 13 and 16 nt flanking 5â² and 3â² of base J, respectively (i.e. substrate 13â16 or VSG-A; Tables I and III), the largest decrease in complex formation occurs with a truncation from 5 to 4 nt of duplex on each side of base J (Fig.3A; Table III). A low level of binding (20â30%) is still present with only 1â4 bp of duplex flanking base J. This is especially evident with truncations on the 5â² side of base J (substrates 4â16 to 1â16). This low level of binding requires at least 1 bp of duplex flanking J because we see no shifted complex formed with the 0â16 and 16 substrates. In contrast, the 3â² side of J requires at least 2 bp of duplex for this low level of binding. We see an apparent stimulation in complex formation following the truncation from 16 to 7 nt of duplex on the 3â² side of J but not on the 5â² side of J from 13 to 5 nt of duplex. This stimulation is also found with the double truncated substrates 7-7 and 6-6 (Fig. 3A). No stimulation was observed, however, when we truncated oligo VSG-B, which is identical in sequence to VSG-A, but has base J at position 8 instead of 14 (see Table I). By using the VSG-B substrate, we have been able to confirm the minimal requirement for 5 bp of duplex on the 3â² side of J (data not shown). Because this substrate lacks the stimulatory effect described above, we therefore think that this unusual effect is only associated with oligo VSG-A and without significance for understanding the minimal duplex requirements for the binding of JBP to J-DNA. These truncation effects on JBP binding could not be attributed to a failure of the radiolabeled J-strand to hybridize to its truncated complement. Analysis of the annealed strand by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the mobility of the hybridized truncated substrates had been altered relative to that of J-DNA that had not been subjected to annealing (ssJ-DNA, Fig.3B). We interpret this mobility shift as indicative of effective hybridization. The 13-0 and 13 substrate failed to form stable duplexes, which may explain their lack of JBP binding. However, 13-1 was duplexed but still relatively inactive for JBP binding (Fig.3, A and B). It is interesting that the 5-5 substrate does not migrate as a duplex in the absence of JBP but nevertheless results in greater than 60% binding compared with the full-length duplex. Apparently the 5-5 substrate can form a duplex in solution in the presence of Mg2+ ions during the binding reaction, but this duplex dissociates during gel electrophoresis in low salt buffer. This suggests that JBP may stabilize J-DNA duplexes during the electrophoresis once the JBPÂ·J-DNA complex is formed. Taken together, these results indicate that there must be at least 5 nucleotides of duplex flanking base J for maximal stable association of JBP. These 11 nucleotides represent approximately one helix turn of B-form DNA. It is evident from Fig. 3A that at high concentrations of JBP (15 pmol) only 40% of this J-modified substrate (13â16 or VSG-A) is driven into a JBPÂ·J-DNA complex that remains stable during gel electrophoresis. Again, this relatively low percent binding is due to the impurity of the J-oligo following chemical synthesis of J-DNA. In fact, the presence of two populations of J-modified DNA oligo can be visualized on the high percentage acrylamide gel in Fig. 3B(indicated as the double bands in the ssDNA region of the gel). We have demonstrated that only the upper band binds JBP (data not shown). Because this species only represents â¼60% of the total J-DNA in the binding reaction, the maximal amount of complex formed would be 60%. Thus, 40% maximal binding in these reactions represents â¼70% conversion of the âactiveâ J-DNA into stable complex with JBP. The lower band of ssJ-DNA is thought to contain the chemically modified version of base J (as described above), thus making this substrate unreactive toward JBP. The apparent smear of radioactivity in the gel shift represents dissociation of bound complex during electrophoresis indicating the relative instability of complex formation with this substrate. For purposes of this analysis, we only quantitate the stable complex indicated as Bound in Fig. 3A. It is interesting that the dissociation occurs earlier during electrophoresis for substrates containing minimal regions of duplex flanking base J, consistent with the quantitation results of product representing stable complex formation (Table III). This would explain the decrease in size of the smear as we assay from substrate 13-5 to substrate 13 and 5-16 to 16 (Fig. 3A). None of these problems with this particular J-modified substrate detracts from the qualitative nature of this assay, indicating optimal requirements of the duplex nature of J-DNA for JBP interaction. During the titration experiment, using the Tel-4J substrate, we see an additional slower migrating species in the native gel in reactions containing higher concentrations of JBP (Fig.4A), presumably due to the binding of multiple JBPs to one oligo. Examination of the results in Fig. 4A and the corresponding binding curve in Fig.4B gives no indication of cooperative binding. In addition, as mentioned above, there is no enhanced affinity of JBP for this substrate over the single J-containing DNA. Because the minimal substrate for JBP binding appears to require 5 nt flanking J (Fig. 3), we may not expect optimal binding of multiple JBPs to the Tel-4J substrate. This substrate contains 4 J molecules in an oligo of 24 nt in length. Thus, the separation between each modified base is maximally 5 nt. In addition, the Js located near the ends of the oligo have only 4 or 1 nt on the 5â² or 3â² side of the base, respectively (Table I). Thus, the opti"

During evolution, the Î´1 isoform has presumably become a more specialized lens protein and has lost ASL activity (6Kondoh H. Araki I. Yasuda K. Matsubasa T. Mori M.

ASL and Î´ crystallin are members of a superfamily of enzymes that are active as homotetramers and catalyze similar Î²-elimination reactions in which a CÎ±âN or CÎ±âO bond is cleaved with the subsequent release of fumarate as one of the products. Members of the superfamily include class II fumarase (11Woods S.A. Schwartzbach S.D. Guest J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), aspartase (12Woods S.A. Miles J.S. Roberts R.E. Guest J.R. Biochem.

Babbitt P.C. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9768-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the overall amino acid sequence homology between these proteins is low (20â30%), there are three highly conserved regions that are remote from each other in the monomer structure but which cluster together in the tetramer to form the four active sites (15Simpson A.

The location of the active site has been confirmed with the structure determination of various superfamily members with bound inhibitors, substrate analogues, or substrates (19ValleÌe F.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13955-13965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), is responsible for proton abstraction (base catalysis), whereas Lys-289 has been proposed to stabilize the carbanion intermediate (15Simpson A. Bateman O. Driessen H. Lindley P. Moss D. Mylvaganam S. Narebor E. Slingsby C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Saribas A.S. Schindler J.F. Viola R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6313-6319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lys-289 belongs to the flexible 280's loop (residues 270â290), and, although this lysine's role in catalysis is supported by its strict conservation across superfamily, the same is not true for His-162. This histidine is replaced by glutamine in all aspartases and by tryptophan in CMLE (see Fig. 1). There is also no consensus in the superfamily regarding the catalytic acid. Our recent structural (26Sampaleanu L.M. Vallee F. Slingsby C. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2732-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and biochemical (27Chakraborty A.R. Davidson A. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) studies of duck Î´1 and Î´2 crystallin suggested that a number of conformational changes occur during catalysis and that the strictly conserved Ser-283 might be the putative catalytic acid. To gain further insight into the catalytic mechanism of Î´2 crystallin/ASL, a number of active site residues were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, and the crystal structure of the inactive S283A Î´2 crystallin mutant was solved at 1.96 â« with bound substrate. The argininosuccinate substrate was found in all four active sites. The conformation of the substrate in this structure differs from that observed previously in the H162N dÎ´c2 structure (19ValleÌe F. Turner M.A. Lindley P.L. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The S283A dÎ´c2 structure and the mutagenesis results suggest that Thr-161 may play a role in catalysis. The site-directed mutagenesis studies reinforce the putative role for Ser-283 as the catalytic acid. The structure of the S283A dÎ´c2 mutant and mutagenesis results reveal a complex network of interactions of active site residues and seven structured water molecules that are responsible for substrate binding and specificity. The enzymatic mechanism is re-examined in the light of the results presented here. The Unique Site Elimination mutagenesis technique (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used to generate the site-directed mutants of dÎ´c2. The wild type dÎ´c2 gene was subcloned from pET3d (a gift from Dr. W. E. O'Brien, Baylor, Texas) into the XbaI and HindIII sites of the pUC19 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The pUC19-dÎ´c2 vector was subsequently used as a template for all mutagenesis reactions. When the oligonucleotide primers were designed, in addition to the mutation in the desired codon, silent mutations were introduced to either activate or inactivate a restriction endonuclease site in the template sequence. The endonuclease site served as a useful screening tool for identifying positive mutants. The mutated cDNA was then subcloned back into the pET3d vector, in-frame with a 3â², six-histidine tag (28Sampaleanu L.M. Davidson A.R. Graham C. Wistow G.J. Howell P.L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Selection of positive mutants was performed by restriction enzyme mapping and subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing (Advanced Protein Technology Center at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto). The mutant dÎ´c2 cDNA cloned into the pET-3d expression vector was transformed intoEscherichia coli BB101, a strain with the genotypeara Î(lac proAB) ÎslyD (kanr) nalA argEam rif thi Fâ² [lacIqproAB+] (Î»DE3). The slyD deletion prevents the expression of a 21-kDa histidine-rich E. coli protein that binds strongly to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Novagen) used for purification. In the Î»DE3 prophage, the gene for T7 RNA polymerase is under the control of the isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside-induciblelacUV5 promoter. The protein was expressed and purified as described previously for the C-terminal histidine-tagged dÎ´c2 (28Sampaleanu L.M. Davidson A.R. Graham C. Wistow G.J. Howell P.L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified protein was eluted with 15 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm imidazole, and the eluate was collected in two 7.5-ml fractions. The first 7.5-ml fraction contained most of the purified protein, as determined by absorption readings at Î» = 280 nm as well as the presence of the expected 50-kDa band on an SDS-PAGE gel (data not shown). Only the first 7.5-ml fraction was dialyzed overnight at 4 Â°C into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. Each 1 liter of bacterial culture yielded â¼28 mg of â¼98% pure protein. Silver-strained native gels (6% acrylamide) of the wild type and mutant proteins were also run to assess the oligomeric state of the proteins. Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed on an AVIV CD spectropolarimeter (model 62A DS). All scans were performed between 200 and 260 nm (0.1-cm path length) on protein solutions of 0.4 mg/ml (in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmEDTA). The samples were scanned five times and averaged. To examine the thermal stability of each protein, the loss of ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored, as the protein sample was heat-denatured. Protein solutions of 0.2 and 0.4 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA were used, and the readings were averaged. The temperature was increased from 25 to 101 Â°C in 2 Â°C increments with 1 min of equilibration before each reading. The ASL activity was assayed by monitoring the release of fumarate at 240 nm (extinction coefficient of 2.44 mmâ1 cmâ1) as described in a previous study (28Sampaleanu L.M. Davidson A.R. Graham C. Wistow G.J. Howell P.L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in triplicate. The initial velocities were averaged and normalized to the amount of protein used. Michaelis-Menten plots were used to determine the kinetic parameters Km (millimolar) andVmax (Î¼mol minâ1mgâ1 protein). The S283A dÎ´c2 mutant was crystallized at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The protein (9 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmEDTA) was preincubated with 75 mm argininosuccinate (disodium salt, Sigma Chemical Co.). Subsequently, 5-Î¼l drops of the protein-argininosuccinate solution were mixed with an equal amount of the precipitating solution (12% w/v polyethylene glycol 2000 MME, 300 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and suspended over a 1-ml reservoir of the precipitating solution. Rectangular crystals grew within â¼3 weeks to a maximal size of 0.9 Ã 0.9 Ã 0.4 mm. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a flash frozen crystal (100 K) using an MAR 345 image plate detector at station X8C (Î» = 0.96 â«) at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven, NY. The crystal was soaked prior to flash freezing for â¼2 min in a 15% v/v glycerol/precipitating solution. The crystal diffracted to 1.94-â« resolution, and the data measured were processed using the DENZO/SCALEPACK software package (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar).

The molecular replacement solution for the four molecules in the asymmetric unit had a correlation coefficient of 0.71 and a packing value of 0.59.

Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), and no low resolution or Ï cutoff applied to the data. Ten percent of the reflections were randomly selected and used to compute a free R value (Rfree) for cross-validation of the model (31Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Each refinement step consisted of torsion angle simulated annealing (34Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), grouped and individual B-factor refinement, and the subsequent calculation of Ïa-weighted 2âFoâ â âFcâ and âFoâ â âFcâ electron density maps (35Brunger A.T.

Sect. 1986; A42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). These maps were then used to correct the model by manual rebuilding in TURBO-FRODO (37Roussel A. Cambillau C. Turbo-Frodo. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were initially applied and gradually relaxed during the refinement. A cis-peptide was modeled between Ser-321 and Thr-322 in all monomers. Water molecules with proper hydrogen-bonding coordination and electron densities higher than 1Ï on 2âFoâ â âFcâ and 2.5Ï on âFoâ â âFcâ Ïa-weighted maps were progressively introduced while monitoring the decrease inRfree. Strong Ïa-weighted âFoâ â âFcâ electron density allowed the substrate to be modeled in all four active sites. XPLO2D (38Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A.

MacArthour M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to analyze the stereochemistry of the models. The final refinement statistics are presented in Table I. The amino acid sequences for the superfamily members were retrieved from the Swiss-Prot data base, and ClustalX (41Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar) was used to perform the multiple sequence alignment. An initial profile was determined by aligning Î´ crystallin and ASL sequences, and the rest of amino acid sequences were subsequently aligned to this profile. For simplicity, only a few representative sequences of each enzyme in the superfamily are shown in Fig. 1. The structural comparison between monomers belonging to different or to the same Î´ crystallin structure was performed using the RIGID option in the program TURBO-FRODO (37Roussel A. Cambillau C. Turbo-Frodo. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar). Structurally equivalent residues located in the core helices, at the beginning and the end of each helix in domain 2, were selected, and an iterative least-squares fitting procedure was performed. The H162N dÎ´c2 structure with argininosuccinate bound (19ValleÌe F. Turner M.A. Lindley P.L. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) identified a number of residues as being important in substrate binding and specificity. Our previous mutagenesis studies had determined the role of a number of these residues (27Chakraborty A.R. Davidson A. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the role of every residue shown to be involved in substrate binding, we therefore constructed the following mutants: S29A, D33N, D89N, R238Q, T281V, N291L, D293N, K325N, D330N, and K331Q. In addition, our previous mutagenesis results had shown that the N116L, S283A, T161V, and E296Q mutants were either inactive or exhibited low residual ASL activity (27Chakraborty A.R. Davidson A. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Asn-116 is implicated in substrate binding because its OÎ´1 is within hydrogen-bond distance of the nitrogen of the CâN bond cleaved during the reaction mechanism (19ValleÌe F. Turner M.A. Lindley P.L. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas structural comparisons of wild type dÎ´c1 and dÎ´c2 suggest that Ser-283 and Thr-161, in addition to His-162 and Glu-296, are involved in catalysis (26Sampaleanu L.M. Vallee F. Slingsby C. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2732-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To better understand our previous mutagenesis results and to confirm the role each of these residues plays in substrate binding and catalysis, the mutants N116D, E296D, S283C/D/H/T, T161D/S, and H162E were also constructed and analyzed. Circular dichroism (CD) studies were performed to assess the conformational integrity and thermal stability of each protein. The secondary structure of the wild type and mutant proteins was investigated to determine whether the differences observed in the enzymatic activity were the consequence of a conformational change in the protein. All proteins exhibited similar far ultraviolet CD spectra. All spectra have similar minima at 208 and 222 nm, typical for proteins comprised of largely Î±-helical secondary structure (TableII). These results suggest that the mutations investigated do not significantly alter the secondary structure of the protein. The unfolding of the protein was also monitored by the change in ellipticity at 222 nm as the temperature of the sample was increased. All transitions were found to be cooperative (data not shown) and irreversible. Although no thermodynamic parameters can be obtained from irreversible reactions, monitoring the loss of structure as a function of temperature does serve as a simple method for comparing the stability of the wild type and mutant proteins. All proteins are heat-stable to 50 Â°C (data not shown), and therefore any variations in the thermal stability are unlikely to affect the enzyme assay, which was performed at 25 Â°C. Wild type dÎ´c2 and the majority of the mutants all have comparable thermal stabilities with the mid-point of the transition ranging from â¼65 to 68 Â°C (TableII). D33N, R238Q, S283C, E296D, and D330N have thermal stabilities that vary from that of the wild type protein. Only the S283C mutation results in a more thermostable protein (Tm = 80 Â°C). Given that the thermal denaturation is irreversible, it is difficult to determine whether these variations are significant or whether they just reflect changes in the way these proteins come out of solution.Table IIKinetic parameters, molar ellipticity, and Tm values for wild type and mutant dÎ´c2 crystallinsMutantVmaxKmkcatkcat/KmCatalytic efficiencyMolar elipticity atTm2-aTemperature at which half the signal is lost at 222 nm.208 nm222 nmÎ¼mol minâ1mgâ1mmsâ1sâ1mâ1%deg cmâ2dmolâ1Â°CWT1.10 Â± 0.040.05 Â± 0.013.67 Â± 0.13(6.79 Â± 0.56) Ã 104100â17792â1590667S29A1.25 Â± 0.040.07 Â± 0.014.15 Â± 0.12(6.06 Â± 0.63) Ã 10489.27 Â± 11.81â18350â1627264D33N0.60 Â± 0.053.45 Â± 0.622.01 Â± 0.17(5.81 Â± 1.15) Ã 1020.86 Â± 0.18â18101â1630357D89NInactiveâ17984â1595367N116D0.04 Â± 0.011.39 Â± 0.490.13 Â± 0.02(9.59 Â± 3.70) Ã 1010.14 Â± 0.06â17945â1597362T161D2-bMutants of putative catalytic residues are shown in boldface.Inactiveâ18281â1621764T161S0.83 Â± 0.020.06 Â± 0.012.78 Â± 0.08(4.92 Â± 0.68) Ã 10472.52 Â± 11.72â17902â1591567H162EInactiveâ17810â1595864R238QInactiveâ17178â1568355T281V0.60 Â± 0.010.14 Â± 0.012.00 Â± 0.04(1.44 Â± 0.98) Ã 10421.22 Â± 1.50â17693â1617063S283AInactiveâ17333â1546367S283CInactiveâ17143â1571580S283DInactiveâ17913â1607869S283HInactiveâ17530â1582067S283TInactiveâ17530â1576466N291LInactiveâ17948â1600965D293N0.05 Â± 0.010.23 Â± 0.110.16 Â± 0.03(6.91 Â± 3.60) Ã 1021.02 Â± 0.54â17426â1548264E296DInactiveâ17600â1584560K325N0.17 Â± 0.033.60 Â± 1.360.57 Â± 0.09(1.57 Â± 0.65) Ã 1020.23 Â± 0.10â18041â1619166D330NInactive2-cActivity was so low it did not fi"
https://openalex.org/W2145787701,"Genetic studies in Drosophila and mice have shown that eyes absent (eya) is an important and conserved transcriptional regulator of development. Along with eyeless/Pax6, sine oculis, anddachshund, eya genes function as master regulators in eye development and can induce ectopic eye formation. Furthermore, the loss-of-function mutants of these genes in the fly causes partial or complete loss of the compound eye, and this is associated with inappropriate apoptosis. Conversely, ectopic eyelessexpression in the context of eyes absent or sine oculis mutations results in apoptosis, suggesting that the proper ratio of these factors regulates apoptosis. Here we report that enforced expression of fly eya or of one of its mammalian homologs, Eya2, triggers rapid apoptosis in interleukin-3-dependent 32D.3 murine myeloid cells, which express Eya family members but not Pax6. Eya-induced cell death overrides survival factors and has many features typical of apoptosis, including plasma and mitochondrial membrane changes and caspase activation. Eya-induced apoptosis is blocked by Bcl-2 overexpression but not by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk, suggesting that mitochondria are a major target in Eya-induced apoptosis.

Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar,2Bonini N.M. Fortini M.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). During larval stages, a small set of progenitor cells proliferate to form the eye disc. This is followed by a wave of differentiation that occurs when a morphogenetic furrow sweeps across the eye field in a posterior to anterior fashion. In the wake of this furrow, cells differentiate into cell clusters that eventually form the ommatidia of the eye. By contrast, cells continue to proliferate ahead of the furrow, and as the furrow moves anteriorly, their cell cycle becomes synchronized (3Bonini N.M. Choi K.-W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have established that key regulators inDrosophila eye development include the transcription factorseyeless, sine oculis, dachshund, andeyes absent(eya).1 All are highly conserved throughout evolution and play essential roles in eye formation (1Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 4Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J.

Rubin G.M. Development. 1994; 120: 3473-3486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, ectopic expression ofeyeless or its murine homolog Pax6 is sufficient to promote ectopic eye development (8Halder G. Callaerts P. Gehring W.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Similarly, ectopic expression of eya along with either sine oculis ordachshund is capable of inducing ectopic eyes (9Bonini N.M. Bui Q.T. Gray-Board G.L. Warrick J.M. Development. 1997; 124: 4819-4826PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen R. Amoui M. Zhang Z. Mardon G. Cell. 1997; 91: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Pignoni F.

Furthermore, there appears to be a hierarchical regulation, such thateyeless regulates the expression of eya,sine oculis and dachsund (9Bonini N.M. Bui Q.T. Gray-Board G.L. Warrick J.M. Development. 1997; 124: 4819-4826PubMed Google Scholar, 12Halder G. Callaerts P. Flister S. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Development. 1998; 125: 2181-2191PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shen W. Mardon G. Development. 1997; 124: 45-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, feedback loops exist such that once eyelessinduces the expression of eya, sine,oculis, and dachsund, these factors are then capable of regulating the expression of one another, ensuring the proper implementation of the eye development program (12Halder G. Callaerts P. Flister S. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Development. 1998; 125: 2181-2191PubMed Google Scholar). Once the program is initiated, other downstream eye targets are activated including those involved in photoreceptor development, which involves the induction of dectapentaplegic and the repression ofwingless (14Hazelett D.J. Bourouis M. Walldorf U. Treisman J.E. Development. 1998; 125: 3741-3751PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, this network is even more complex in vertebrates, which have multiple orthologs of each fly gene. For example, four murine homologs of eya have been identified asEya1, Eya2, Eya3, and Eya4(15Xu P.-X. Woo I. Her H. Beier D.R. Mass R.L.

A common denominator of the eyeless, sine oculis,dachshund, and eya mutations is either partial or complete loss of the compound eye (1Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 4Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J.

Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 4Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J.

Rubin G.M. Development. 1994; 120: 3473-3486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, when eyeless is ectopically overexpressed in the wing disc of eya orsine oculis mutants, it promotes ectopic cell death rather than eye development (12Halder G. Callaerts P. Flister S. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Development. 1998; 125: 2181-2191PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, dachshundoverexpression in either the antennal, leg, or wing disc also leads to inappropriate cell death (13Shen W. Mardon G. Development. 1997; 124: 45-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise role these developmental regulators perform in controlling programmed cell deaths is unresolved. It has been suggested thateya may inhibit cell death either directly or indirectly as a default pathway that occurs following inappropriate proliferation or differentiation (1Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Immortal interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent 32D.3 murine myeloid cells provide an excellent system to evaluate apoptotic regulators, similar to primary hematopoietic progenitors, as they continuously require hemopoietins for their survival, and in vivo, this fail-safe mechanism strictly regulates hematopoietic cell numbers (19Greenberger J.S.

Expression analyses demonstrated that the Eya family genesEya1â3 were expressed in these cells, but that they failed to express Pax6, suggesting that this network of factors may play a role in regulating hematopoietic cell survival. Surprisingly, the overexpression of murine Eya2 or human EYA2induced rapid apoptosis that overrides the survival functions provided by serum and IL-3. Similarly, inducible expression of the flyeya gene also triggered rapid cell death, demonstrating that this apoptotic pathway is conserved from arthropods to vertebrates. Moreover, biochemical and genetic data indicate that the major target of the Eya-induced cell death pathway is mitochondria. A model for how this apoptotic pathway may function during normal development is proposed. mRNA was extracted from exponentially growing cultures of 32D.3 cells or the developing mouse eye (embryonic day 10.5) using Qiagen Direct mRNA mini kit according to protocol by the manufacturer. Reverse transcription was performed with Qiagen Sensiscript RT kit according to the directions from the manufacturer. PCR was performed using a DNA thermal cycler (MJR Research, Waltham, MA). PCR reactions contained 2 Î¼l of the cDNA product, 1Ã reaction buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dNTP, 20 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 25 Î¼l. The GAPDH primers were provided courtesy of Dr. Rachid Drissi (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). The primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: Eya1, sense primer 5â²-CTAACCAGCCCGCATAGCCG-3â² and antisense primer 5â²-TAGTTTGTGAGGAAGGGGTAGG-3â²; Eya2, sense primer 5â²-CTCGCAACAAGCAGTGACTGG-3â² and antisense primer 5â²-GGACGGATAATCCTGGTGCAC-3â²; Eya3, sense primer 5â²-AGCACAAATGCCAGCCTGATAC-3â² and antisense primer 5â²-CTTCCACATGCACCTGGTCAC-3â²; Pax6, sense primer 5â²-GGGCAGGTATTACGAGACTGG-3â² and antisense primer 5â²-GAGACAGGTGTGGTGGGCTG-3â²; and GAPDH, sense primer 5-GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGG-3â²and antisense primer 5â²-GTGGTGCAGGATGCATTGCTG-3â². To isolate a human homolog ofDrosophila eya, a partial human clone, HPBEJ79, from an EST hemangioma cDNA library was obtained from Human Genome Sciences. This EST contained an insert of 1445 nucleotides with most of the 5â²-718 bases being 65% identical to Drosophila eya. To acquire a complete cDNA, 5â²-RACE (Invitrogen) was employed using mRNA from the human neuroblastoma cell lines LA-N-5 and CHP-134 (both obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA), which had abundant levels of EYA2 transcripts as determined by Northern blotting. 2B. E. Fee et al., manuscript in preparation. Three sequential 5â²-RACE reactions were required to retrieve the entireEYA2 cDNA. Three partial cDNA clones, one from each set of 5â²-RACE extensions, were ligated by standard cloning procedures to generate a complete EYA2 cDNA, which is predicted to encode a protein of 538 amino acid residues. Based on areas of high homology between human EYA2 and eya, EYA2 primers were used for the isolation of murine Eya2, sense primer 5â²-GGGACATTTGCATCCAGATAC-3â² and antisense primer 5â²-AGCTTCCTCATCCAGTCCAC-3â². RT-PCR was performed as described above, and a 300-base pair fragment was isolated from a murine T-cell leukemia cell line (RL-12). To extend the 3â²-end of the murine cDNA, 3â²-RACE was performed as described by manufacturer protocol (Invitrogen). To extend the 5â²-end of the murine cDNA, 5â²-RACE was performed (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a gene-specific antisense oligonucleotide (2.5 pmol), sample mRNA (500 ng), and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The mRNA template was then degraded with RNase H, and the purified cDNA was tailed with dCTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (producing an oligo(dC)n-3â² tail). The oligo(dC)-tailed cDNA was then amplified by PCR using an anchor primer to oligo(dC) tail and a gene-specific nested primer. In addition to 5â²-RACE, we searched the EST data base at NCBI and identified an EST that was identical to the 5â²-end of our cDNA. Based on the sequence of this EST and PCR, we isolated this EST and with 5â²-RACE extended it until the Eya2 cDNA contained the most 5â²-ATG and several upstream in-frame stop codons. A sequence encoding the FLAG epitope MDYKDDDDK (Sigma) was attached to the 5â²-end of fly eya, murine Eya2, and human EYA2 cDNAs (the eya cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Seymour Benzer, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). This cloning was accomplished with primers designed to include seven base pairs (CAAGGCA) 5â² of the Eya2 ATG and the FLAG sequence in frame with Eya2. High fidelity PCR was then performed using Expand Taqpolymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA sequencing was performed to ensure no mistakes were generated during PCR. The tagged Eya2s and fly eya were then cloned into the XhoI (blunted) site of the dexamethasone (dex)-inducible vector pMAM-Neo (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 32D.3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine medium supplemented with 20 units of IL-3 as described previously (24Cleveland J.L.

Parental 32D.3 cells were electroporated by washing the cells (90% viable) with RPMI 1640 medium (without additives), adding 20 Î¼g of the linearized FLAG-tagged pMAM-Neo-Eya expression plasmids into the electroporation chamber and mixing with 1 ml of cells (at 5 Ã 106cells/ml) (for review see Refs. 23Askew D.S.

Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2217-2226PubMed Google Scholar). The chamber was then placed into a cell electroporator and electroporated with 1180 farads, 375 volts, and low resistance. Transfected cells were selected in medium containing gentamycin 418 and individual clones were isolated as described previously (23Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cleveland J.L. Troppmair J. Packam G. Askew D.S. Lloyd P. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Nunex G. Ihle J.N. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2217-2226PubMed Google Scholar). Control clones containing the vector pMAM-Neo were isolated in parallel. Prior to the start of all experiments, cells were set twice at 0.5 Ã 106 cells/ml on consecutive days to ensure that they were in equivalent exponential phase of their growth. To induce expression of the Eya proteins, clones were treated with 1.5 Î¼m dex (Sigma). Cytospins were made ofEya2/eya clones with or without dex (100 Î¼l of cells at 0.5 Ã 106 cells/ml). The slides were then fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher) for 10â20 min at room temperature, and the cells were permeabilized with cold acetone for 2 min. The slides were then washed with 1Ã PBS for 5 min and blocked in 10% bovine serum albumin/1Ã PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Primary FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) was diluted 1:1000 in 10% bovine serum albumin/1Ã PBS and placed on the slides for 2 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed three times with 1Ã PBS (5 min each). The slides were incubated for 2 h with fluoroscein-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 25â50-fold in 10% bovine serum albumin/1Ã PBS. After three washes with 1Ã PBS, the slides were mounted with 0.1% p-phenylenediamine in 1:9 PBS:glycerol before microscopic examination. Confocal imaging was performed using a Leica DM-IRBE microscope together with Leica TCS-NT software and equipped with a Nikon Ã 100, 1.4 numerical aperture objective, and an argon/krypton laser (Î»= 488/565) to excite fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Texas Red fluorescence. The viability of vector-only andEya2/eya cells cultured in IL-3 growth medium was assessed following treatment with or without dex using a hemocytometer and trypan blue dye exclusion as an indicator of cell viability. Cell morphology was assessed following cytospins and staining with Wright-Geimsa. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by loading dex-treated and untreated cells with either 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6, 250 nm) or tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRM, 500 nm) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice in growth medium and then resuspended in growth medium containing 100 nm of the respective dye. The cells were incubated for 2 h, washed in PBS, and then analyzed for fluorescence changes by flow cytometry (for DiOC6) or confocal microscopy (for TMRM) (25Dai H. Kramer D.L. Yang C. Murti K.G.

Early plasma membrane changes were studied by using an Annexin-V-FITC kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH. 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2), and cell density was adjusted to 5.0 Ã 105/ml. To 190 Î¼l of cells, 10 Î¼l of Annexin-V-FITC was added and incubated for 10 min in the dark. The cells were then washed in binding buffer, 10 Î¼l of 20 Î¼g/ml propidium iodide (PI) was added, and the sample was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. The analysis of genomic DNA fragmentation was carried out as described previously (23Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar). 1.0 Ã 106 cells were washed with PBS, pelleted, resuspended in 20 Î¼l of buffer (10 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium laurylsarcosine, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K), and incubated for 1 h at 50 Â°C. DNA loading buffer was added, the samples incubated for 2 min at 70 Â°C, loaded into the dry wells of a 2% agarose gel (0.1 Î¼g/ml ethidium bromide), run at 20 volts overnight in Tris-based boric acid EDTA, and the gel was photographed. Electron micrographs were performed by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital electron microscope facility using standard protocols. z-VAD.fmk (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 400 Î¼m, which effectively delays death of 32D.3 cells that are deprived of IL-3 (25Dai H.

Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1% sodium citrate with 50 Î¼g/ml propidium iodide and analyzed as described previously (23Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cleveland J.L. Troppmair J. Packam G. Askew D.S. Lloyd P. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Nunex G. Ihle J.N. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2217-2226PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, and 75â100 Î¼g of proteins were loaded/lane and resolved by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry transfer cell (20 volts for 1 h, Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad). After transfer, blots were incubated in a fast green FCF staining solution (0.1% fast green FCF (Sigma F7258), 20% methanol, 5% acetic acid) for 2 min and destained for 5 min (20% methanol, 5% acetic acid). The blots were then washed in TBS-Tween 20 three times for 10 min and blocked for 1 h (5% nonfat dry milk, TBS-Tween 20). The primary antibody was then diluted in blocking solution and placed on the blots for 1h. Three washes followed in TBS-Tween 20 for 10 min each. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was then added in blocking buffer for 30 min to each blot and then washed in TBS-Tween as stated above before luminescence detection (SuperSignal, Pierce). The primary antibodies used were as follows: caspase-9 (Calbiochem), caspase-3 (PharMingen), PARP (Oncogene Research, C-2-10, Boston, MA), anti-Î²-tubulin (Oncogene Research), FLAG M2 (Sigma), Bad (B36420, Transduction Laboratories), Bak (G-23, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), Bax (13686E, PharMingen), Bcl-2 (15021A PharMingen), Bcl-XL (B22620, Transduction Laboratories), and Mcl-1 (M54020, Transduction Laboratories). By screening cDNA libraries from Human Genome Sciences, we identified a human homolog of Drosophila eya, EYA2, from a hemangioma library (clone HPBEJ79). Using this EYA2cDNA, we probed multiple tissue blots of fetal murine tissue. These results revealed that in addition to its expression in the eye,Eya2 is also expressed in E15.5 fetal brain, lung, and liver (data not shown). The fetal liver is the principal site of definitive hematopoiesis at this stage of murine development (26Marine J-C McKay C. Wang D. Topham D.J. Parganas E. Nakajima N. Pendeville H. Yasukawa H. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1999; 98: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the collection of eye developmental regulators may also play a role in the development and/or survival of hematopoietic progenitors. Therefore, we assessed expression of the Eyafamily and Pax6 in IL-3-dependent 32D.3 myeloid cells, which share many properties of primary hematopoietic progenitors. In particular, 32D.3 cells continuously require IL-3 for their survival (23Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly three of the four murineEya members (Eya1, Eya2, andEya3) were expressed in exponentially growing 32D.3 cells, and their expression was not dependent upon IL-3 (Fig.1). By contrast, Pax6expression was not detected in 32D.3 cells, although it was detected in RNA isolated from the developing murine eye (Fig. 1). To determine whether Eya proteins could influence the survival of 32D.3 cells, we performed 5â²-RACE of the partial humanEYA2 cDNA from a Human Genome Science clone (HPBEJ79) to obtain a full-length cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberY10261) and then cloned the full-length murine Eya2from RNA prepared from an Eya2-expressing murine T-cell leukemia cell line (RL-12) by RT-PCR and 5â²- and 3â²-RACE (GenBankTM accession number BC003755). We then FLAG-tagged fly eya, murine Eya2, and human EYA2. The FLAG-tagged Eyas were then cloned into a pMAM-Neo vector, and stable clones were generated in 32D.3 cells following electroporation and growth in G418 medium and cloning by limiting dilution. The pMAM-Neo vector is dex-inducible, and after induction with dex, we detected proteins for eya, murine, and human Eya2 at 95, 64, and 70 kDa, respectively (Fig.2A). The predicted molecular masses for these proteins are 80 (eya), 58 (murine Eya2), and 59 kDa (human EYA2) (15Xu P.-X. Woo I. Her H. Beier D.R. Mass R.L. Development. 1997; 124: 219-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Dev. Biol. 1998; 196: 42-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that all Eya proteins may be posttranslationally modified. Eya proteins have been variably reported to be nuclear or cytosolic (1Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 27Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Dev.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6815-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and Eya localization has been suggested to be regulated by interactions with the sine oculis/Six homeobox family of proteins (15Xu P.-X. Woo I. Her H. Beier D.R. Mass R.L. Development. 1997; 124: 219-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed murine Eya2 localization by confocal microscopy following induction with dex. Eya2 was localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus yet was excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 2B). Similar results were also evident in clones that inducibly express flyeya and in cells that overexpress human EYA2 (data not shown). The nuclear localization of a significant fraction of Eya2 is consistent with its generally accepted function as a regulator of transcription (11Pignoni F. Hu B. Zavitz K.H. Xiao J. Garrity P.A. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1997; 91: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 29Xu P-X. Cheng J. Epstein J.A. Mass R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11974-11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To assess the role of fly eya and murine and human Eya2 in regulating 32D.3 cell survival, vector-only and Eya-expressing clones were treated with dex and then deprived of IL-3. As a control, cells were also cultured in medium containing both IL-3 and serum and treated with dex. Surprisingly, human and murine Eya2-expressing clones rapidly died following the addition of dex, even when these cells were cultured in replete IL-3 growth medium containing the full complement of survival factors (Fig. 3). Similarly 32D.3 cells engineered to express fly eya also rapidly died following the addition of dex, whereas (as expected) dex had no effect on the survival of parental 32D.3 cells or on vector-only expressing cells (Fig. 3). Thus, eya and Eya2overexpression induces cell death, and this pro-apoptotic function is conserved between fly, mouse, and human proteins. Eya loss-of-function mutants in the fly exhibit excessive proliferation, suggesting that eya may regulate the cell cycle (11Pignoni F. Hu B. Zavitz K.H. Xiao J. Garrity P.A. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1997; 91: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Thus, we also measured whether the induction of Eya expression led to changes in the cell cycle distribution in exponentially growing cultures or in cells deprived of IL-3, a condition in which 32D.3 cells arrest in G1 (23Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar). No obvious changes were evident in Eya-overexpressing clones (data not shown), suggesting that Eya-induced cell death was not a consequence of overt influence on cell cycle traverse. To assess whethereya-induced death was apoptotic in nature, we analyzed both the DNA integrity and the ultrastructure of eya andEya2-expressing cells before and after treatment with dex. A hallmark of apoptosis is the condensation of chromatin into âmicronucleiâ and the cleavage of genomic DNA into oligonucleosomal units, resulting in a âDNA ladderâ (30Kitanaka C. Kuchino Y. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). After dex treatment, there was obvious internucleosomal DNA cleavage occurring in Eya2clones (Fig. 4A), and Wright-Gei"

A number of Dsb proteins, which catalyze the oxidation, reduction, and isomerization of disulfide bonds in newly exported proteins, has been identified in Escherichia coli(1Rietsch A. Beckwith J.

DsbA is a small soluble protein, which contains a thioredoxin-fold with a highly unstable disulfide bond. DsbA acts by using its active site disulfide bond to rapidly oxidize folding proteins. This oxidation of a target protein results in the reduction of the active site CXXC motif of DsbA (12Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) observes that the CXXC motif of DsbB is oxidized in the presence of a functional respiratory chain. This provides the first link between disulfide bond formation and electron transfer chains. By reconstituting the DsbA-DsbB system with purified electron transfer components in vitro, Baderet al. (7Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) identifies ubiquinone as the first electron acceptor of DsbB. Reduced quinones are then reoxidized by the terminal oxidases cytochromes bd and bo, which finally transfer electrons to oxygen. The observation that quinones are electron acceptors in DsbB explains why disulfide bonds are formed during anaerobic growth of E. coli. Menaquinones, which are synthesized upon oxygen deletion, are able to oxidize reduced DsbB. Reduced menaquinones are then reoxidized by anaerobic reductases such as fumarate reductase (7Bader M.

This novel catalytic activity is apparently the major source of disulfides in prokaryotes. Recently, Bader et al. (18Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) discovered a novel ubiquinone reduction activity in DsbB and shows that DsbB contains a single high affinity quinone-binding site. To understand the DsbB-quinone interaction in and the mechanism of Q reduction by DsbB requires knowledge of the Q-binding site. The availability of azido-Q derivatives in our laboratory (19Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encouraged us to study the quinone:protein interaction and identify the quinone-binding domain in DsbB by photoaffinity labeling. Herein we report the conditions for photoaffinity labeling of DsbB with azido-Q derivatives and the identification of a Q-binding peptide. Sodium cholate was obtained from Sigma and recrystallized from methanol.N-Dodecyl-Î²-d-maltoside was from Anatrace. Insta-Gel liquid scintillation mixture was from Packard Instruments. Other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. The ubiquinone derivatives 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (Q0C10), 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (azido-Q), 3-azido-2-methyl-5-[3H]methoxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone ([3H]azido-Q), 5-azido-2,3-dimethoxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (5-azido-Q), and 5-azido-2,3-[3H]dimethoxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (5-[3H]azido-Q) were synthesized by methods reported previously (19Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DsbA (16Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol.

Reduced DsbA was prepared by incubation of 10 mg/ml purified protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1%N-dodecylmaltoside with 10 mmdithiothreitol for 20 min on ice. Excess dithiothreitol was removed by a 2-ml Pierce desalting column preequilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, containing 100 mmNaCl and 0.1% N-dodecylmaltoside. The DsbB concentration was determined after reduction of protein-bound quinone with NaBH4 using a millimolar extinction coefficient ofE276 = 46.5 mmâ1 cmâ1 (16Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10302-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). DsbB activity was assayed by measuring its ability to catalyze ubiquinone reduction by reduced DsbA at room temperature in a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 300 mmNaCl, 0.1% dodecylmaltoside, 5.2 nmol of reduced DsbA, and 25 nmol of Q0C10. The reaction was started by the addition of an appropriate amount of azido-Q treated-DsbB or untreated-DsbB. The reduction of Q0C10 was followed by measuring the absorption decrease at 275 nm using a millimolar extinction coefficient of E275 = 12.25 mmâ1 cmâ1 (19Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 5-azido-Q or azido-Q was used as the electron acceptor, the absorption decrease at 306 and 315 nm, respectively, was followed using the same extinction coefficient of Q0C10 (19Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DsbB as prepared was in 0.1%N-dodecylmaltoside, which masks the quinone-binding site (18Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DsbB was diluted with 1% sodium cholate to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 50 mmK+/Na+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and then concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. The concentrated DsbB was diluted again with 1% sodium cholate in the same buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration again to 10 mg/ml. This dilution and concentration process was repeated five times. They serve the purposes of replacing N-dodecylmaltoside with sodium cholate and partially depleting endogenous Q8, thus facilitating the interaction between DsbB and azido-Q. 400 Î¼l of DsbB (2.6 mg/ml) in 50 mmK+/Na+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% of sodium cholate was incubated with 16 Î¼l of [3H]azido-Q (26 mm in 95% ethanol) at 0 Â°C for 1 h in the dark. The specific radioactivity of [3H]azido-Q used was 1.6 Ã 104 cpm/nmol in 95% ethanol and 6 Ã 103 cpm/nmol in the 50 mm K+/Na+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.0% sodium cholate in the presence of DsbB. This mixture was transferred to a 2-mm light path quartz cuvette. The cuvette was sealed with paraffin film and mounted on an illuminating apparatus. The assembly was immersed in ice water in a container with a quartz window and then illuminated with long wavelength UV light (Spectroline EN-14, 365 nm long wavelength, 23 watts) for 7 min at a distance of 4 cm from the light source. DsbB activity was assayed before and after the illumination. To determine the amount of [3H]azido-Q incorporated into DsbB, illuminated samples were spotted on Whatman filter paper and developed with a mixture of chloroform and methanol (v/v) (2:1) to remove non-protein bound [3H]azido-Q. After the paper was air-dried, the origin spot was cut into small pieces and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. The UV-illuminated [3H]azido-Q-treated DsbB was applied as a strip to Whatman filter paper. After non-protein bound Q was removed as described above, the strip containing the protein was cut out and eluted with ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1.0m urea and 0.1% SDS. The eluted protein was digested with protease V8 at 37 Â°C for 40 h using a V8:DsbB ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The V8 digest of [3H]azido-Q-labeled DsbB was mixed with an equal volume of 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, incubated at 37 Â°C for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5415D) for 10 min to remove any precipitate. 100-microliter aliquots of the supernatant solution were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a SupelcosilTM-LC-308 column (C8, 5 Î¼m-particles, 300-â« pores, 4.6 mm inner diameter, 25-cm length) using a gradient formed from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 1-ml fractions were collected. The absorbance from 160 to 400 nm of each fraction was recorded with a Waters 996 diode array detector. The radioactivity of each fraction was measured. Peaks with high specific radioactivity were collected, dried, and subjected to peptide sequence analysis. Amino acid sequence analyses were done at the Molecular Biology Resource Facility, Saint Francis Hospital of Tulsa Medical Research Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center under the supervision of Dr. Ken Jackson. To analyze the quinone-binding properties of DsbB, we first purified His-tagged DsbB protein from overproducing cells using Ni affinity chromatography (18Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These preparations contain 0.5â0.6 mol of bound coenzyme Q8 (ubiquinone-40)/mol of DsbB protein. When this DsbB preparation is titrated with exogenous Q0C10Br or Q0C10, no additional Q is observed for binding, suggesting that the vacant Q-binding site(s) has been masked either by the dodecylmaltoside detergent or by phospholipids present in the buffer. The fact that exogenously added Q0C10is unable to displace the Q8 that copurifies with the DsbB protein suggests that the binding affinity of Q0C10 is weaker than that of endogenous Q8 (18Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).

We previously showed that we could partially remove endogenous Q8 (from 0.5â0.6 mol/mol down to 0.3 mol/mol protein) by a repetitious dilution ultrafiltration procedure in which the dodecylmaltoside detergent was exchanged with sodium cholate. This procedure also serves to unmasks the Q-binding site. That unmasking occurs during detergent exchange is evident from the binding of 0.7 mol of Q0C10Br/mol of DsbB, which had undergone detergent exchange (18Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Purified DsbB after detergent exchange proved to be an excellent preparation for studying ubiquinone:protein interactions and for identifying the Q-binding site with azido-Q derivatives. Two azido-Q derivatives, azido-Q and 5-azido-Q, were synthesized as described previously (19Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tested for their suitability for identifying Q-binding sites in DsbB. Both derivatives exhibit substantial electron acceptor activity with DsbB (see TableI). The maximal activity observed for these two Q analogues 5-azido-Q and azido-Q was 35 and 17%, respectively, compared with the activity observed with Q0C10. Therefore, we concluded that these quinone analogues served as sufficiently physiological substrates to allow us to use them to study the Q-binding properties of DsbB.Table IElectron acceptor activity of azido-Q derivatives for DsbBAzido-Q derivativesWavelengthActivity1-aAssay conditions were as described in âExperimental Proceduresâ with the exception that the indicted Q derivatives were used, and Q reduction was monitored at indicated wavelengths.nm%Q0C102751001-b100% activity represents 8.95 Î¼mol Q reduced/mg protein of the sodium cholate replaced DsbB/min.

Because quinone derivatives used were in well excess, DsbB as prepared or its Q-deficient preparation gave the same activity. Open table in a new tab [3H]Azido-Q and 5-[3H]azido-Q were prepared by methylation of the hydroxyl groups on 5-H-2,3-dihydroxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone and 3-H-2-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone, respectively, with C[3H]3I before nucleophilic substitution with NaN3. These two [3H]azido-Q derivatives have the same electron acceptor activity for DsbB as their unlabeled isomers, suggesting that they can serve as reasonably physiological substrates. We then tested both of these derivatives for their ability to inactivate DsbB after photo cross-linking. Our rationale being that if inactivation occurs upon cross-linking, this would indicate at least that the cross-linking interferes with an important part of DsbB activity, possibly by reacting directly to the quinone-binding site in DsbB. We and others (19Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and have previously used this method successfully for other proteins. When DsbB was incubated with 10-fold molar excess of these [3H]azido-Q derivatives for 1 h at 0 Â°C in the dark and then illumination with a long wavelength of UV light for 7 min, the [3H]azido-Q-treated sample showed inactivation and radioactivity uptake by protein, indicating that [3H]azido-Q is suitable for use in identifying the Q-binding domain in DsbB. 3-Azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone has been successfully used to identify the Q-binding sites in succinate-Q reductase and cytochrome bc1 complex from several sources (19Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lee G.Y. He D.Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31916-31923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the other quinone analogue 5-[3H]azido-Q, we failed to detect radioactive uptake by DsbB after illumination. This analogue was apparently unable to inactive DsbB. There are a number of possible reasons for this failure including 1) a low affinity of this derivative for the Q-binding site in DsbB or 2) intramolecular cyclization between the generated nitrene and its neighboring methoxy or methylene group on the Q molecule during illumination. When DsbB was incubated with various concentrations of the [3H]azido-Q and illuminated, the activity decreased as the concentration of azido-Q increased (Fig.1). Maximum inactivation of â¼40% was obtained when 10 mol of azido-Q/mol of DsbB was used. Inactivation was not attributed to inhibition of DsbB by photolyzed products of azido-Q, because when azido-Q was photolyzed in the absence of protein and then added to DsbB, no inhibition was observed. Inactivation was also not due to damage of DsbB by the illuminating process, because when the enzyme alone was illuminated, no activity loss was observed. Because DsbB activity is assayed in the presence of excess Q0C10 (25 Î¼m), the extent of inactivation of the azido-Q-treated DsbB after illumination is a measure of the fraction of Q-binding sites covalently linked to azido-Q. Whether [3H]azido-Q can occupy 40% Q-binding sites in DsbB, one would expect to see a decrease in the activity of an azido-Q-treated sample before illumination. The failure to observe such a decrease is because of the facts that the concentration of Q0C10 in the assay mixture is several orders of magnitude higher than that of azido-Q, and that the azido-Q has a much lower affinity for DsbB than Q0C10. Thus Q0C10 can easily displace azido-Q from the binding sites, and the inferior electron transfer activity of azido-Q is not expressed. After illumination, the covalently linked azido-Q cannot be displaced by Q0C10 as inhibition occurs. When azido-Q-treated DsbB was illuminated at 0 Â°C for various lengths of time, activity decreased as illumination time was increased; maximum inactivation (40%) was reached in 7 min. The amount of azido-Q uptake paralleled the extent of inactivation until the maximum was reached (approximately 0.45 mol of azido-Q uptake/mol of DsbB at 40% inactivation), suggesting that inactivation is the result of binding of azido-Q at the ubiquinone-binding site. Because purified DsbB after detergent exchange with sodium cholate still contains 0.3 mol of endogenous Q, one would ideally expect to observe a maximum uptake of 0.7 mol of azido-Q/mol of DsbB. That we observe lower than ideal uptake is not unexpected, azido-Q has a substantial weaker binding affinity than does Q0C10. Although illumination for longer than 7 min caused no further decrease in activity, azido-Q uptake continued but at a much slower rate, suggesting that this slower incorporation is the result of nonspecific binding of azido-Q to protein. The photoinactivation rate of DsbB was affected by the protein, alcohol, and detergent concentrations in the system. Interaction with azido-Q derivative was most effective when the reaction system contained 1â1.2 mg/ml DsbB, 1% sodium cholate, and <1% ethanol. Because Q0C10 is a better electron acceptor than azido-Q, it is expected that in the presence of Q0C10 during illumination a drastic decrease in inhibition and azido-Q uptake by DsbB would be observed. This indeed is the case in the presence of equal molars of Q0C10 and azido-Q. Less than 5% inactivation was observed. To identify the Q-binding domain in DsbB by isolating and sequencing an azido-Q-linked peptide, it is absolutely necessary that [3H]azido-Q-labeled DsbB be free from contamination with unbound azido-Q and susceptible to proteolytic digestion. Therefore, unbound azido-Q in illuminated [3H]azido-Q-treated DsbB was removed. We performed this method by paper chromatography with a mixture of chloroform:methanol (2:1). Labeled DsbB, devoid of unbound azido-Q, remained at the paper origin. It was eluted from the paper with ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% SDS and 1m urea. The inclusion of 0.1% SDS and 1 m urea in the elution buffer unfolds and disaggregates the labeled DsbB, thus increasing proteolytic efficiency. Fig. 2 shows 3H radioactivity distribution among the V8 peptides of DsbB separated by HPLC. Most of the radioactivity was found in a fraction with a retention time of 33.5 min. Radioactivity recovery is approximately 60% based on that applied to the HPLC column. The partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this peptide was found to be NH2-HTMLQLY corresponding to amino acid residues 91â97 of DsbB. Because this peptide has resulted from the V8 digestion, it probably comprises residues His91/Glu112 of DsbB. The Q-binding domain in the proposed structure of DsbB (Fig.3) is located in the connecting loop between transmembrane helices 3 and 4 on the periplasm side of the membrane. Some radioactivity is also found in a fraction with a retention time of 58.1 min. This fraction is most likely to be the undigested DsbB.Figure 3Proposed secondary structure of DsbB.The shaded area is the Q-binding peptide identified in this report.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the Q-binding site in DsbB resembles the one in NADH-quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (22Faig M.

The three-dimensional structure of NADH-quinone acceptor oxidoreductase from human and mouse, co-crystallized with substrate duroquinone, has been determined at 1.7-â« resolution (22Faig M. Bianchet M.A. Chen S. Winski S. Ross D. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3177-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Duroquinone is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule that bridges the NÎµ of histidine 161 and the âOH of tyrosine 128. In addition, five aromatic residues of NADH-quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (Trp-105, Phe-106, Phe-178, Tyr-126, and Tyr-128) provide most of the hydrophobic contacts. The sequence alignment shows that amino acid residues involved in Q binding in NADH-quinone acceptor oxidoreductase appear to be conserved in the two periplasmic loops of DsbB. They correspond to Trp-31, Phe-32, Tyr-46, Arg-48, His-91, and Phe-106 of DsbB. We already have good genetic and biochemical data that indicate Arg-48 residue is involved in quinone binding. DsbB mutants in this Arg-48 residue show a major in vivo defect in their ability to catalyze disulfide bond formation. The purified R48H DsbB protein exhibits an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant Kmfor ubiquinone seven times greater than that of the wild-type BsbB, suggesting that this highly conserved arginine residue plays an important role in the interaction of DsbB with quinones (23Kadokura H.

However, the biochemical mechanism by which GÎ²Î³ activates these effectors is not well understood. We have previously shown that GÎ²Î³ could increase the kinase activity of Btk-family tyrosine kinases (11Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Wan Y. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8601-8605Google Scholar). Btk kinase was the first tyrosine kinase shown to be directly regulated by G proteins (11Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Wan Y. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Defects in Btk are responsible for X chromosome-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans and X chromosome-linked immunodeficiency in mouse. GÎ²Î³ subunits were shown to bind directly to the PH (pleckstrin homology) domain and its adjacent BM (Btk motif) domain (within the Tec-homology (TH) domain) of Btk (15Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Google Scholar, 16Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Google Scholar). This interaction was assumed to be responsible for the GÎ²Î³ activation of Btk. Here we show that GÎ²Î³ can stimulate a purified recombinant Btk lacking the PH/TH module as well as full-length Btk, demonstrating that the effect of GÎ²Î³ on Btk kinase activity is actually mediated by an alternate domain. In vitro binding studies further show that GÎ²Î³ can bind to both the PH/TH module and the catalytic domain, providing an activation mechanism for Btk. In addition, GÎ²Î³ could stimulate the membrane translocation of full-length Btk, but not BtkÎPHTH. The membrane anchorage is also dependent on Btk interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate since a Btk mutant defective in interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate was not able to be translocated to the membrane. These data support a model whereby GÎ²Î³ can regulate Btk signaling by increasing its membrane localization and directly stimulating its catalytic activity. Sf9 cells were coinfected with baculoviruses containing cDNAs for GÎ²1 and GÎ³2 with a His6 tag (17Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 72 h and resuspended in buffer I (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were lysed by sonication and Genapol was added to 0.1%. After addition of AlF 4â, the lysates were gently agitated for 1 h at 4 Â°C. Ni-NTA beads were added and incubated for 4 h. After extensive washes in buffer I, GÎ²Î³ was eluted three times in buffer I with 500 mm imidazole. After concentration and desalting into storage buffer (40 mmTris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Genapol), GÎ²Î³ was flash frozen at â80 Â°C. Kinase assays were performed as previously described (12Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Google Scholar, 13Jiang Y. Ma W. Wan Y. Kozasa T. Hattori S. Huang X.Y.

Purified Btk or BtkÎPHTH kinase (from Sf9 cells) (20 nm) in Btk kinase buffer (30 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 Î¼mATP) was combined with 70 Î¼m Btk substrate peptide. 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was added, and the mixture (total 20 Î¼l) incubated at 30 Â°C for 8 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer. After 90 Â°C for 5 min, the substrate peptide was separated on 20% SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and autoradiographed. GST pull-down assay was done as previously described (18Ma Y.-C. Huang X.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12197-12201Google Scholar). Two micrograms each of GÎ²Î³ and GST-Btk fusion proteins were combined as indicated in the figures in 300 Î¼l of binding buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmMgCl2) and incubated at 4 Â°C for 2 h. Complexes were washed extensively in buffer with 100 mm NaCl and run on SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred and Western blotted with antibody against GÎ² (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Btk immunocomplex kinase assay was done as described (19Wan Y. Bence K. Hata A. Kurosaki T. Veillette A. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17209-17215Google Scholar). Whole-cell extract of HEK-293 cells transfected with Btk-GFP (green fluorescent protein) or myr-BtkÎPHTH-GFP (the first 15 amino acid residues of c-Src was fused to the N-terminal of BtkÎPHTH-GFP) with or without GÎ²Î³, were pre-cleared with 20 Î¼l of protein A agarose beads, and Btk was immunoprecipitated with 1 Î¼g of polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing three times with IP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and three times with kinase buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2), 5 Î¼g of peptide substrate and 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP were added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 Â°C for 30 min. After SDS/PAGE, the gel was autoradiographed and quantified. Fold of stimulation by GÎ²Î³ was normalized by the expressed Btk, and mutant proteins detected by Western blot with anti-Btk antibody. HEK-293 cells were plated onto coverslips coated with gelatin. These cells were transfected with plasmids carrying GFP, PHBM-GFP (20Varnai P. Rother K.I. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10983-10989Google Scholar), Btk-GFP, Btk(R28C)-GFP, BtkÎPHTH-GFP, Btk-GFP plus GÎ²1 and GÎ³2, BtkÎPHTH plus GÎ²1 and GÎ³2, Btk(R28C)-GFP plus GÎ²1 and GÎ³2 as indicated in the figures. Btk and Btk mutant cDNAs were subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). The cells were either grown in serum-free media or serum containing media for 48 h and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. The coverslips were then fixed onto slides and imaged using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. We set out to study the biochemical mechanism by which GÎ²Î³ activates Btk. We previously showed that GÎ²Î³ subunits could stimulate Btk-family kinase activity (11Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Wan Y. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8601-8605Google Scholar). Also, there were two reports of the direct interaction of GÎ²Î³ with the PH domain and a portion of the adjacent sequences of the TH domain of Btk (15Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Google Scholar, 16Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Google Scholar). In light of these binding data, we investigated whether this interaction was responsible for stimulation of the kinase activity of Btk by GÎ²Î³. Previously, utilizing purified recombinant Btk kinases, we have shown that deletion of the PH/TH module has little effect on the intrinsic catalytic activity of Btk on peptide substrates (21Lowry W.E. Huang J. Lei M. Rawlings D. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45276-45281Google Scholar). This PH/TH module does, however, mediate protein substrate recognition, as purified Btk lacking this domain (BtkÎPHTH) was unable to phosphorylate larger protein substrates but was able to phosphorylate peptide substrates (21Lowry W.E. Huang J. Lei M. Rawlings D. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45276-45281Google Scholar). If GÎ²Î³ binding to the PH/TH module of Btk was responsible for the increased kinase activity of Btk, this model would predict that GÎ²Î³ should increase the kinase activity of full-length Btk but not the PHTH-truncated Btk (BtkÎPHTH). As shown in Fig.1, we found that GÎ²Î³ could increase the kinase activity of both Btk and BtkÎPHTH. Purified Btk (lanes 1â6) or BtkÎPHTH (lanes 8â13) were assayed in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of GÎ²Î³ subunits. The kinase activity of Btk and BtkÎPHTH was measured by the phosphorylation of a peptide substrate and autophosphorylation. GÎ²Î³ increased both the phosphorylation of the peptide substrate as well as the autophosphorylation of both Btk and BtkÎPHTH with similar kinetics. These data indicate that the interaction of GÎ²Î³ with the PH/TH module is not essential for GÎ²Î³ activation of Btk and that, in addition to the PH/TH module, GÎ²Î³ must have other contact site(s) on Btk. To identify the additional interacting site(s) of GÎ²Î³ on Btk, we purified GST fusion proteins of different domains of Btk: GST-PHTH, GST-SH3SH2, and GST-CAT (for catalytic domain) (Fig.2A). Purified GÎ²Î³ was incubated with these GST fusion proteins and GST alone (as a negative control). Bound GÎ²Î³ was precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads and Western blotted with an anti-GÎ² antibody (Fig. 2B). While GST and GST-SH3SH2 did not precipitate GÎ², GST-PHTH and GST-CAT did (Fig. 2B). Similar experiments using cell extracts expressing GÎ²Î³ as a source for G proteins yielded identical results (data not shown). These data demonstrate that GÎ²Î³ has two contact sits on Btk: the PH/TH module and the catalytic domain. Since GÎ²Î³ could increase the kinase activity of BtkÎPHTH, the interaction with the catalytic domain is likely responsible for the GÎ²Î³ activation of Btk. Btk is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase. It was proposed that membrane translocation is accompanied by activation (22August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Google Scholar, 23Li Z. Wahl M.I. Eguinoa A. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13820-13825Google Scholar, 24Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Google Scholar, 25Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Google Scholar, 26Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Google Scholar). To investigate the activation mechanism further, we used fluorescence microscopy to analyze the subcellular distribution of Btk and BtkÎPHTH after stimulation GÎ²Î³ (Fig.3). We fused the GFP to Btk and BtkÎPHTH to monitor the distribution of these proteins in living cells. GFP alone was used as negative control; with or without serum, GFP is uniformly distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 3A). The PH/BM domain of Btk alone (PHBM-GFP) was used as positive control (20Varnai P. Rother K.I. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10983-10989Google Scholar); addition of serum, which contains a variety of growth factors (some that act through G protein-coupled receptors), caused PHBM-GFP to be redistributed from cytoplasm to plasma membrane (Fig.3B). While Btk-GFP was uniformly distributed throughout cells in the absence of serum, co-expression of GÎ²Î³ or addition of serum led to predominantly plasma membrane localization (Fig.3C). This indicates that after GÎ²Î³ stimulation, Btk is indeed translocated from cytosol to plasma membrane. On the other hand, GÎ²Î³ or serum had no effect on the subcellular distribution of BtkÎPHTH-GFP, which is mainly in the cytosol (Fig. 3D). Thus, GÎ²Î³ could translocate Btk, but not BtkÎPHTH, to the plasma membrane. Since GÎ²Î³ could not translocate BtkÎPHTH to the membrane, the PH/TH module must be essential for this translocation event. Because the PH/TH module can bind to GÎ²Î³ directly and GÎ²Î³ is membrane-associated, it is possible that this direct interaction is responsible for Btk membrane anchorage. Also, the PH domain of Btk can bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), the product of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (27Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Google Scholar). To test whether the membrane anchorage of Btk-GFP after GÎ²Î³ stimulation is due to the PH/TH module binding to GÎ²Î³ or binding to PIP3, we investigated the response of Btk(R28C)-GFP after GÎ²Î³ stimulation (Fig.4). Mutation of arginine to cysteine at residue 28 within the PH domain reduces the binding to PIP3, but not to GÎ²Î³ (16Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Google Scholar, 28Hyvonen M. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3396-3404Google Scholar). This mutation also causes X chromosome-linked agammaglobulinemia in patients (29Vihinen M. Kwan S.P. Lester T. Ochs H.D. Resnick I. Valiaho J. Conley M.E. Smith C.I. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 280-285Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, co-expressing Btk(R28C)-GFP and GÎ²Î³ did not lead to subcellular redistribution of Btk(R28C)-GFP, implying that the PIP3-PH interaction is essential for Btk membrane translocation. A prediction of this model would be that GÎ²Î³-induced Btk membrane translocation is PI 3-kinase-dependent. To test this, we examined the Btk-GFP subcellular distribution after GÎ²Î³ stimulation in the presence of a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. As shown in Fig. 4B, treatment with LY294002 blocked GÎ²Î³-induced Btk-GFP membrane translocation. A role for PI 3-kinase in Btk activation had been observed for other types of receptors (22August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Google Scholar, 23Li Z. Wahl M.I. Eguinoa A. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13820-13825Google Scholar, 24Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Google Scholar, 25Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Google Scholar, 26Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Google Scholar). Therefore, GÎ²Î³-induced Btk membrane translocation depends on PI 3-kinase activation by GÎ²Î³ and the generation of PIP3. To test whether constitutive membrane localization is sufficient to activate Btk, we examined the kinase activity of Btk-GFP and myr-BtkÎPHTH-GFP, in which the myristoylation signal sequence from c-Src (amino acid residues 1â15) was fused to the N terminus of BtkÎPHTH-GFP (Fig.5A). The membrane localization of myr-BtkÎPHTH-GFP was verified by GFP localization on the cell membrane (Fig. 5B). GÎ²Î³ increased the kinase activity of Btk-GFP (by â¼3- to 4-fold) (Fig. 5C). Btk-GFP had been shown to have similar level of kinase activity with Btk (26Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Google Scholar). More importantly, the basal kinase activity of myr-BtkÎPHTH-GFP (in the absence of GÎ²Î³) was higher than that of Btk-GFP (Fig.5C). Co-expression of GÎ²Î³ further increased the kinase activity of myr-BtkÎPHTH-GFP moderately (by â¼1.5-fold) (Fig.5C). These data imply that constitutive membrane localization could partially activate Btk and that GÎ²Î³ could further increase the kinase activity of membrane-localized Btk. Î¤he data shown here reveal a possible activation mechanism by which GÎ²Î³ regulates a tyrosine kinase. Here we show that GÎ²Î³ can bind to not only the PH/TH module but also the catalytic domain of Btk. Given that GÎ²Î³ could activate BtkÎPHTH, it is unlikely that the interaction of GÎ²Î³ with the PH/TH module transmits allosteric information to the catalytic domain, leading to increased kinase activity of full-length Btk. Rather, the direct contact of GÎ²Î³ with the catalytic domain is responsible for the activation. Based on our data, we proposed an activation model in which GÎ²Î³ plays a dual role in both membrane translocation and direct activation of Btk (Fig.6). Activation of G protein-coupled receptors, such as chemokine receptors in lymphocytes, leads to the release of GÎ²Î³ subunits from heterotrimeric G proteins. GÎ²Î³ then directly or indirectly activates a PI 3-kinase, which produces PIP3. Btk is anchored to the membrane through binding to PIP3 with its PH/TH module. GÎ²Î³ then directly activates Btk by directly causing a conformational change in the catalytic domain of Btk, leading to increased kinase activity. Activated Btk could modulate various biological responses such as actin cytoskeletal reorganization, gene expression, calcium mobilization, apoptosis, and cell differentiation (14Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Google Scholar, 29Vihinen M. Kwan S.P. Lester T. Ochs H.D. Resnick I. Valiaho J. Conley M.E. Smith C.I. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 280-285Google Scholar, 30Satterthwaite A.B.

Since addition of the myristoylation signal sequence of c-Src to the N terminus of BtkÎPHTH increased myr-BtkÎPHTH kinase activity in cells in the absence of GÎ²Î³, constitutive membrane localization can partially activate Btk in cells. The direct interaction of GÎ²Î³ with the catalytic domain of Btk and the subsequent activation of Btk kinase activity might have general implications for the activation mechanism of other GÎ²Î³ effectors by GÎ²Î³. GÎ²Î³ can interact with the N-terminal PH domain of PLC-Î²2. It has recently been proposed that this binding might lead to the activation of PLC-Î²2 (32Wang T. Dowal L. El-Maghrabi M.R. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7466-7469Google Scholar). However, it was also reported that GÎ²Î³ could interact with the catalytic core of PLC-Î²2 (33Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Google Scholar). Although no direct biochemical data are available on a GÎ²Î³ effect on a PH-deleted PLC-Î²2, it is possible that, similar to Btk, the interaction with the catalytic core rather than the PH domain is responsible for the activation of PLC-Î²2 by GÎ²Î³. This model would be consistent with an observation that transfer of the PH domain of PLC-Î²2 to PLC-Î²1 did not confer the GÎ²Î³ regulation on PLC-Î²1 (34Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Google Scholar). Furthermore, GÎ²Î³ has been shown to interact with the catalytic core of adenylyl cyclase type II (35Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Google Scholar, 36Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. et al.Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Google Scholar). Moreover, the crystal structure of the p21-activated kinase shows that the GÎ²Î³-binding motif within the catalytic domain of p21-activated kinase forms an Î± helix, which packs against the inter-lobe hinge, preventing the small lobe from moving into its active state orientation (37Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Google Scholar). Although no data yet has shown direct stimulation of purified p21-activated kinase activity by purified GÎ²Î³, this could provide a structural model for GÎ²Î³ activation of protein kinases. Therefore, it could be a general mechanism that GÎ²Î³ binds directly with the catalytic domain (or core) of its effector proteins, to induce conformational changes in the active site, leading to increased activity.

However, deletions at the unique C-terminal extension of this PFK produced a markedly allosteric enzyme. Thus, a mutant lacking the last 26 C-terminal residues exhibited hysteresis in the time course, intense cooperativity (nH = 3.8), and a 200-fold decrease in the apparent affinity for fructose 6-phosphate (S0.5 = 4500 Î¼m), strong activation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Kact = 0.1 Î¼m) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Kact = 40 Î¼m), dependence on enzyme concentration, proton inhibition, and subunit association-dissociation in response to fructose 6-phosphateversus the nonhysteretic and hyperbolic wild-type enzyme (nH = 1.0; Km = 22 Î¼m) that remained as a stable tetramer.

Extensive studies established PFK as an example of a complex allosteric enzyme whose activity is thought fundamental for the control of energy production and is tightly regulated by a variety of allosteric mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 1Uyeda K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1979; 48: 193-244Google Scholar, 2Sols A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1981; 19: 77-101Google Scholar, 3Kemp R.G. Foe L.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 57: 147-154Google Scholar). Thus, it shows a very high degree of positive cooperativity (sigmoidal kinetics) as well as a high S0.5 for Fru-6-P and is sensitive to a number of effectors. Fructose bisphosphates are the most potent regulators (reviewed in Ref.4Van Schaftingen E. Adv. Enzymol. 1987; 59: 315-395Google Scholar), although some isozymes, such as the mammalian C type (5SaÌnchez-MartÄ±Ìnez C. EsteÌvez A.M. AragoÌn J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 635-640Google Scholar) or that from yeast (6Bartrons R. Van Schaftingen E. Vissers S. Hers H.-G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 137-143Google Scholar), are only sensitive to Fru-2,6-P2 (active in the micromolar range). ATP binding to its inhibitory site is regarded as central for the function of PFK, since it influences the action of other ligands (7Reinhart G.D. Lardy H.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1477-1484Google Scholar, 8Colombo G. Tate P.W. Girotti A.W. Kemp R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9404-9412Google Scholar, 9BoscaÌ L. AragoÌn J.J. Sols A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2100-2107Google Scholar). Hysteresis in the time courses of PFK reaction is also characteristic of several eukaryotic isozymes (7Reinhart G.D. Lardy H.A.

The regulatory properties of this enzyme are pH and concentration dependent, which operate by altering its oligomeric structure. A tetramer was demonstrated to be the smallest active form of rabbit muscle PFK (13Hesterberg L.K. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2030-2039Google Scholar), which upon protonation (14Bock P.E. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5630-5636Google Scholar) reversibly isomerizes to an inactive form and then slowly dissociates to dimers and monomers. Increasing concentrations of enzyme promote self-association that can lead to aggregates larger than tetramer, as reported for muscle (15Luther M.A. Hesterberg L.K. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2463-2470Google Scholar) and liver (16Reinhart G.D. Lardy H.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1491-1495Google Scholar) PFK. This phenomenon involves pronounced changes in the kinetic properties (9BoscaÌ L. AragoÌn J.J. Sols A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2100-2107Google Scholar, 11BaÌr J. HuÌbner G. KopperschlaÌger G.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1491-1495Google Scholar) and can be important in accounting for its function in vivo (17AragoÌn J.J. Sols A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2945-2950Google Scholar). The allosteric nature of PFK has been verified in the simple prokaryotic enzyme by three-dimensional structure and specific mutation analyses (Refs. 18Schirmer T. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 140-145Google Scholar, 19Auzat I. Byrnes W.M. Garel J.-R. Chang S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7062-7068Google Scholar, 20Auzat I. Le Bras G. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 476-480Google Scholar, 21Pham A.S. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4150-4158Google Scholar, and references therein). However, our knowledge of the structural changes that support the allosteric behavior of eukaryotic PFK is considerably lower. This is a more complex form of enzyme in both structure and regulation (1Uyeda K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1979; 48: 193-244Google Scholar, 2Sols A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1981; 19: 77-101Google Scholar, 22Poorman R.A. Randolph A. Kemp R.G. Heinrikson R.L. Nature. 1984; 309: 467-469Google Scholar) and no crystal structure for it has been provided yet. Eukaryotic PFKs are about twice the size of the bacterial enzyme as a result of duplication, fusion, and mutation of an ancestral prokaryotic gene, thus leading to the formation of new allosteric sites (22Poorman R.A. Randolph A. Kemp R.G. Heinrikson R.L. Nature. 1984; 309: 467-469Google Scholar). Therefore, structure/function data from the prokaryotic enzyme are difficult to extrapolate to eukaryotic isozymes, although several site-directed mutagenesis studies to identify amino acid residues implicated in ligand-binding sites have been carried out recently with the latter PFK types (23Li J. Zhu X. Byrnes M. Nelson J.W. Chang S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24599-24606Google Scholar, 24Heinisch J.J. Boles E. Timple C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15928-15933Google Scholar, 25Li Y. Rivera D. Ru W. Gunasekera D. Kemp R.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16407-16412Google Scholar, 26Rodicio R. StrauÃ A. Heinisch J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40952-40960Google Scholar). We have used the nonallosteric enzyme from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (DdPFK) as an alternative way to investigate the molecular bases of control mechanisms of PFK from eukaryotic cells. Despite having a marked degree of similarity to other isozymes (27EsteÌvez A.M. MartÄ±Ìnez-Costa O.H. SaÌnchez V. AragoÌn J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 442-451Google Scholar), DdPFK is unusual among eukaryotic PFKs in that it displays hyperbolic kinetics, exhibiting a high affinity for Fru-6-P and no sensitivity to any of the characteristic effectors of other isoforms (28MartÄ±Ìnez-Costa O.H. EsteÌvez A.M. SaÌnchez V. AragoÌn J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1007-1017Google Scholar). DdPFK is also devoid of a concentration-dependent activity, being a stable tetramer (28MartÄ±Ìnez-Costa O.H. EsteÌvez A.M. SaÌnchez V. AragoÌn J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1007-1017Google Scholar). Therefore, this enzyme is particularly suitable to undertake at least partial restoration of an allosteric behavior by mutations. In addition to leading to the structural reasons for its lack of specific control properties, this approach could provide valuable information into the molecular mechanisms underlying Fru-6-P cooperativity and its relation with the action of allosteric effectors. We have found that deletions at the C-tail region of DdPFK convert it into an allosteric enzyme, displaying intense Fru-6-P cooperativity, strong activation by fructose bisphosphates, and subunit association-dissociation, among other properties characteristic of regulatory PFKs, although remaining practically insensitive to ATP inhibition. Further analyses indicated that deletion, or substitution, of the final C-terminal residue is enough to generate an allosteric behavior. These findings provide new insight into the allosteric control of PFK.

The plasmid pMUT1 was used as a template to generate all other deletion mutants and their corresponding PCR products were cloned as NheI-EcoRI fragments into pMUT2.

Heinisch J.J. AragoÌn J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 100-104Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were grown in 1 liter of rich medium containing glucose to early stationary phase and recombinant enzymes were purified by 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) fractionation and chromatography on DE52 and blue Sepharose CL-6B as described previously (29EsteÌvez A.M. Heinisch J.J. AragoÌn J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 100-104Google Scholar), except that PFK activity was eluted from the latter column with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0â1.5 m KCl in equilibration buffer. All final preparations of recombinant enzymes were judged to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE analysis on 10% gels and Coomassie Blue staining (28MartÄ±Ìnez-Costa O.H. EsteÌvez A.M. SaÌnchez V. AragoÌn J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1007-1017Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). PFK activity was measured in an assay mixture that unless otherwise indicated contained 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, 0.15 mm NADH, 1 mm MgATP, 1.2 units of aldolase, 10 units of triose-phosphate isomerase, 1 unit of glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase, and 5â10 Î¼l of the purified enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. After 5 min, the reaction was started by adding 1 mm Fru-6-P and was followed by measuring the absorbance change at 340 nm at 25 Â°C. When PFK activity was assayed in permeabilized cells, Glu-6-P was added to Fru-6-P in a proportion 3:1. When the effect of Fru-1,6-P2 was examined, pyruvate kinase (1 unit) and lactate dehydrogenase (1 unit) were used as coupling enzymes in the presence of 0.2 mmP-enolpyruvate. Auxiliary enzymes were desalted by centrifugation and dialysis against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 20% (v/v) glycerol. One unit of activity is defined as the amount that catalyzes the conversion of 1 Î¼mol/min of substrate at 25 Â°C. PFK samples dialyzed against 50 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, were applied to a Amersham Bioscience, Inc. Superose 6 HR 10/30 column equilibrated and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. When indicated, the elution buffer contained 6 mm Fru-6-P. Fractions of 0.11 ml were collected and tested for enzyme activity and ELISA analysis. For calibration, standard proteins ranging from 13.7 to 669 kDa were used. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Permeabilization of yeast cells was carried out with a toluene/ethanol/Triton X-100 mixture as described in Ref. 31AragoÌn J.J. SaÌnchez V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 849-855Google Scholar. Mass spectrometry of recombinant enzymes was performed on a Bruker (Bremen, Germany) Reflex II matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer. ELISA analysis was performed in antibody capture mode (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 553-612Google Scholar) using 1/2,000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit antibody against DdPFK (28MartÄ±Ìnez-Costa O.H. EsteÌvez A.M.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 553-612Google Scholar); samples containing no antigen were used as a blank. Prediction of secondary structure was obtained from the PHD server (33Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-589Google Scholar). DdPFK has been reported to share about a 40% identity with other isozymes (27EsteÌvez A.M. MartÄ±Ìnez-Costa O.H. SaÌnchez V. AragoÌn J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 442-451Google Scholar). Most amino acid residues involved in putative binding sites of substrates and allosteric effectors are conserved in this enzyme, except for a few changes located at the sites assigned to ADP/AMP activation (Arg â Ser288), Fru-2,6-P2/Fru-1,6-P2activation (Ser â Ala568), and ATP inhibition (Arg â Val775) (Fig. 2). The rabbit muscle PFK sequence H763AHLEHISR at the C termini, identified by Valaitiset al. (34Valaitis A.P. Foe L.G. Kemp R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5044-5048Google Scholar) as critical for ATP inhibition, is absent in DdPFK. Our initial approach to generate allosteric properties in DdPFK was to reverse the single changes by site-directed mutagenesis. The corresponding cDNAs were expressed in a PFK-deficient strain ofS. cerevisiae (5SaÌnchez-MartÄ±Ìnez C. EsteÌvez A.M. AragoÌn J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 635-640Google Scholar) and enzyme mutants were purified (Fig.1) and characterized. However, neither S288R and A568S mutants (Table II) nor the V775R mutant (to be reported elsewhere) exhibited kinetic properties significantly different from those of the nonallosteric wild-type enzyme, nor they were sensitive to other effectors such as AMP/ADP, citrate, Pi, or NH 4+. Then the lack of control properties in DdPFK could be related to: (i) other unidentified residues important for the binding of specific ligands; (ii) the changes observed at the putative ATP inhibitory site, since ATP inhibition was proposed as basic for PFK regulatory characteristics (9BoscaÌ L. AragoÌn J.J. Sols A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2100-2107Google Scholar); or (iii) that some of the structural motifs unique to this isozyme prevent allosteric transitions in some way. Regarding the latter possibility, the highest variability among PFK sequences is exhibited at the C-tail region, from about position 770 of DdPFK (Fig.2). Additionally, this enzyme contains a C-terminal extension of 20â40 amino acids with respect to other eukaryotic PFKs. A deletion of the 26 C-terminal residues (Î26) was made in DdPFK to test the role of this extension and the mutant enzyme was obtained as above. Surprisingly, this mutant exhibited dramatic changes in its kinetic behavior versus the wild-type enzyme. Whereas the initial rate of product formation of wild-type DdPFK was linear (28MartÄ±Ìnez-Costa O.H. EsteÌvez A.M. SaÌnchez V. AragoÌn J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1007-1017Google Scholar), a pronounced lag phase before attaining the steady state,i.e. hysteresis (35Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5788-5799Google Scholar), was observed with the Î26 mutant when the assay was initiated with Fru-6-P (Fig.3). The duration of the lag time (Ï) was in the order of minutes and decreased with increasing Fru-6-P concentration, which at 2.5 mm augmented Ï 2-fold. This hysteretic behavior, typical of allosteric PFKs (7Reinhart G.D. Lardy H.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1477-1484Google Scholar, 10Emerk K. Frieden C. Arch. Biochem.

Inset,A, plot of transition time (Ï) versus Fru-6-P concentration; B, reaction time course of wild-type PFK and Î26 at 3 mm Fru-6-P.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 4, the Î26 mutant exhibited an intense positive cooperativity for Fru-6-P with a Hill coefficient of 3.8 and a 200-fold decrease in the apparent affinity for this substrate with respect to the hyperbolic (nH = 1.0) wild-type enzyme (S0.5and Km values of 4500 and 22 Î¼m, respectively). As seen in Table II, Î26 showed about a 3-fold decrease in the Kcat value, which was not large, indicating that catalysis was not grossly affected by the deletion. In contrast to the nonallosteric wild-type enzyme, this mutant was strongly activated by 1 Î¼m Fru-2,6-P2, which shifted to the left the Fru-6-P saturation curve (Fig. 4), abolishing the cooperativity (nH = 1.05) and reducing the S0.5 value to 0.5 mm without significant effect on the Vmax. A Kact value of 0.1 Î¼m was obtained for Fru-2,6-P2 and a similar activation effect was observed with Fru-1,6-P2, but with a higher Kact value of 40 Î¼m(Table II). The Î26 mutant also exhibited a concentration-dependent activity as shown by including an aggregating agent, PEG (36Reinhart G.D. Hartleip S.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 65-76Google Scholar), in the assay, this elicited an effect on the Fru-6-P saturation curve similar to that exerted by the addition of 1 Î¼m Fru-2,6-P2. This observation was confirmed by studying the truncated enzyme in permeabilized cells (the mutant producing yeast), i.e. in situ, where the enzyme is concentrated and the S0.5 andnH values decreased to 0.25 mm and 1.5, respectively, from 11 mm and 3.0, respectively, in a dialyzed cell-free extract assayed in dilute solution (data not shown). A concentration-dependent behavior is absent in the wild-type enzyme (28MartÄ±Ìnez-Costa O.H. EsteÌvez A.M. SaÌnchez V. AragoÌn J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1007-1017Google Scholar). The binding of Fru-6-P to the Î26 mutant, as analyzed by protection against thermal inactivation of the enzyme, was found to be cooperative with an nH value of 3.7 and an apparent dissociation constant of 4.5 mm, whereas that of the wild-type enzyme was hyperbolic (Fig.5). Thus, the kinetic curve of the mutant did practically not deviate from the binding curve, meaning that the enzymic cooperativity of Î26 was due solely to equilibrium binding of Fru-6-P and not to change in the catalytic rate constants of the various enzyme-substrate complexes (37Neet K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 64: 139-192Google Scholar). The kinetic properties of the Î26 mutant with respect to MgATP were not significantly different from those of the wild-type enzyme (TableII), except that it was moderately inhibited by this compound (59% inhibition at 10 mm MgATP). Among other PFK effectors, neither ADP, AMP, citrate, Pi, nor P-enolpyruvate modified the activity of this mutant assayed at 3 mm Fru-6-P and 5 mm MgATP, and only a 66% activation was elicited by NH 4+, each of these compounds being used at a concentration of 2 mm (data not shown). Proton inhibition of animal PFK is well known to work by decreasing Fru-6-P affinity (7Reinhart G.D. Lardy H.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1477-1484Google Scholar), which can be concomitant with an increase in cooperativity (38Frieden C. Gilbert H.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5644-5647Google Scholar), and by increasing the affinity for binding of MgATP to its inhibitory site (39Pettigrew D.W. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 254: 1887-1895Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the inhibitory effect of pH on the Fru-6-P saturation curve of two different C-terminal deletions. An increase in the cooperativity of the Î26 mutant was apparent, although not intense, when lowering the pH value from 8.0 to 7.2 or 6.4 (Fig. 6A). This effect was more noticeable (Fig. 6B) in a Î8 mutant (see below), which kinetic behavior was similar to that of Î26 but was insensitive to ATP inhibition (Table II). Apparent affinity of these mutants for Fru-6-P was less significantly affected. The kinetics of the wild-type enzyme was reported (28MartÄ±Ìnez-Costa O.H. EsteÌvez A.M. SaÌnchez V. AragoÌn J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1007-1017Google Scholar) to remain hyperbolic even at pH 5.5. It is noteworthy that in addition to high Fru-6-P concentration, all the above conditions that decreased Fru-6-P cooperativity of the Î26 mutant, also decreased hysteresis in the time courses of the PFK reaction (data not shown). The oligomeric state of the Î26 mutant was analyzed by FPLC size-exclusion chromatography, to test its relation with enzyme function. As shown in Fig. 7, the truncated DdPFK eluted basically as inactive dimers and monomers that slowly reactivated upon incubation with 5 mm Fru-6-P. In addition, the Î26 mutant stabilized into an active tetramer when chromatographed in the presence of this ligand. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme eluted as an active tetrameric form independently of the presence of Fru-6-P. Increasing the concentration of KCl from 0.1 to 0.5 m in the equilibration and elution buffers, which favors protein-protein interactions, also shifted the association-dissociation equilibrium of the mutant enzyme to the active tetramer, which then contributed 61% to the eluted protein (data not shown). This behavior is consistent with the dilution-mediated inactivation/dissociation of muscle (40Bock P.E. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5637-5643Google Scholar) and liver (41Reinhart G.D. Lardy H.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1484-1490Google Scholar) PFK prevented by Fru-6-P. C-terminal deletions of longer (Î36) and shorter (Î14) extension than Î26 were first carried out for a structure/function characterization of the C-tail region of DdPFK.

However, the 3â² box functions only when transcription is driven by a specialized U snRNA promoter; mRNA promoters cannot substitute for the U snRNA promoter (17Ma B. Hernandez N. J. Biol.

Proudfoot N.J. Murphy S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2867-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it remains to be seen whether the 3â² box functions as a transcription termination signal, as observed for rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase I (26Bartsch I. Schoneberg C. Grummt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2521-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or as an RNA processing signal, like the AAUAAA element of polyadenylated mRNAs (27Brown C.E.

Sm antigens then assemble onto the Sm binding site, and the resulting immature U2 snRNP is imported into the nucleus for final assembly into a mature U2 snRNP (35Allmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G.

Addition of U2 snRNP-specific antigens may occur in Cajal bodies (also known as coiled bodies or CBs) (40Matera A.G.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Approximately 65% of mature human U2 snRNA ends in 3â²-terminal CCA, as do all mature tRNAs; the other 35% ends in 3â² CC or possibly 3â² C, as these are not easily distinguished experimentally (44Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 208: 99-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 3â²-terminal A of U2 snRNA must be added posttranscriptionally because the U2 snRNA coding region ends with CC/CC, where the slashindicates the last encoded nucleotide (45Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 46Chen Y. Sinha K. Perumal K. Reddy R. RNA (N.

If 3â² exonucleolytic processing removes the encoded 3â² CC during U2 snRNA maturation, as appears to be the case in vitro (33Huang Q. Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7178-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Kleinschmidt A.M. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3131-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Huang Q. Pederson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), then the cell may need to build or rebuild the 3â²-terminal A, CA, or CCA of U2 snRNA. Using a variety of synthetic and natural U2 snRNAs as substrate, we show here that the human but not the E. coli CCA-adding enzyme can build and repair the 3â²-terminal CCA sequence of human U2 snRNA. The human CCA-adding enzyme is also active on native U2 snRNPs. The yeast (48Wolfe C.L. Hopper A.K. Martin N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4679-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and vertebrate CCA-adding enzymes (49Hopper A.K. Science. 1998; 282: 2003-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 50Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) are known to be present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm, consistent with the possibility that the human CCA-adding enzyme may build the 3â² end of immature U2 snRNPs in the cytoplasm or nucleus or repair the 3â² end of mature nuclear U2 snRNPs.DISCUSSIONAll vertebrate U snRNAs belonging to the Sm class of U snRNPs and some small nucleolar RNAs such as U3 small nucleolar RNA apparently use the same 3â² end formation apparatus: specialized U snRNA promoter elements drive transcription by a form of RNA polymerase II that allows recognition of a highly conserved 3â² end formation signal (3â² box) located 6â25 nt downstream from the U snRNA coding (20Ach R.A. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2070-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whether the 3â² box functions as a transcription termination signal or as an RNA processing signal is still unknown (25Cuello P. Boyd D.C. Dye M.J. Proudfoot N.J. Murphy S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2867-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); however, the first detectable U snRNA precursors have 3â²-terminal tails that extend nearly to the 3â² box (22Yuo C.Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The 3â²-terminal sequence of most U snRNAs can be aligned with the corresponding genes, suggesting that nucleases are capable of generating the mature 3â² end of most U snRNA precursors. However, â¼65% of mature human U2 snRNA ends in 3â²-terminal CCA; the other 35% ends in 3â² CC or possibly 3â² C (44Perumal K. Gu J. Reddy R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 208: 99-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 3â²-terminal A of U2 snRNA cannot be encoded because the 3â² end of the U2 snRNA gene is CC/CC, where the slash indicates the last encoded nucleotide (47Pavelitz T. Rusche L. Matera A.G. Scharf J.M. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 3â²-terminal A is also unlikely to be an untemplated addition by the transcribing RNA polymerase (72Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar) because transcription must continue for >10 bp beyond the 3â² end to generate the U2+10 family of precursors. We cannot exclude template-instructed misincorporation, as occurs in certain RNA viruses (73Cattaneo R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but this has never been observed for a cellular RNA polymerase. Thus, the solitary 3â²-terminal A of U2 snRNA is almost surely added posttranscriptionally.One candidate for posttranscriptional addition of 3â²-terminal A to U2 snRNA is the SRP 7SL adenylating enzyme (62Perumal K. Sinha K. Henning D. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21791-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); another is the CCA-adding enzyme (tRNA nucleotidyltransferase), which builds and repairs the 3â²-terminal CCA of tRNA. In fact, the 3â² end of U2 strongly resembles the minimal substrate for the CCA-adding enzyme: a tRNA minihelix (the âtop half âof tRNA) in which the acceptor stem stacks on the TÏC stem/loop. Not only is U2 stem IV 12 bp, the optimal length for CCA addition by the E. coli and S. shibatae enzymes to a minihelix substrate (12Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar), but the stem is followed by A185CCAOH, where A185 is formally analogous to the discriminator base of tRNA, most frequently a purine (74Crothers D.M. Seno T. Soll G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3063-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, in principle, the CCA-adding enzyme might be capable of completely rebuilding the 3â²-terminal CCA sequence of U2 snRNA if nucleases overprocessed the U2 snRNA precursor or other 3â² exonucleases attacked the mature U2 snRNA.To ask whether CCA-adding enzymes can add 3â²-terminal A, CA, or CCA to U2 snRNA precursors, we used three sets of substrates (full-length U2 snRNA, 3â²-terminal stem/loops III and IV, and stem/loop IV alone), each lacking 3â²-terminal A, CA, or CCA. We assayed these substrates with CCA-adding enzymes of both classes from all three kingdoms (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar): class I CCA-adding enzymes from archaea (S. shibatae, M. jannaschii, P. furiosus, and M. thermoautotrophicum), class II enzymes from Gram-positive (B. stearothermophilus and B. subtilis) and Gram-negative (E. coli) eubacteria, and the human class II enzyme. All substrates were active with the human class II CCA-adding enzyme, including 3â²-terminal stem/loop IV alone (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), and CCA addition was faithful (Fig. 2E); however, the E. coli class II CCA-adding enzyme was inactive on the U2 snRNA substrates but fully active on tRNA substrates, consistent with the idea that CCA addition to U2 snRNA is specific. In contrast to CCA-adding enzymes, the SRP 7SL RNA adenylating enzyme nonspecifically added long 3â²-terminal tails of >400 nt to U2 and other RNA substrates (Fig. 4). Thus, the SRP RNA adenylating enzyme behaves like a poly(A) polymerase and is unlikely to play a role in U2 snRNA biosynthesis. These results suggest that the 3â² stem/loop of U2 snRNA does in fact resemble a tRNA minihelix, the smallest efficient substrate for class I and II CCA-adding enzymes (12Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar, 57Hou Y.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and that CCA addition to U2 snRNA could take place in vivo.We also found that the human CCA-adding enzyme is active on natural U2 snRNA purified from nuclear extract (Fig. 4) and on native U2 snRNPs (Fig. 5). In the mature 17S U2 snRNP, SF3a and SF3b splicing factors are bound to the 5â²-terminal domain including stem/loops I, IIa, and IIb; Sm proteins are bound to the conserved Sm-binding sequence; and U2-specific proteins Aâ² and Bâ are bound to stem/loop IV (62Perumal K.

However, assembly of Sm proteins onto U2+10 precursors occurs before formation of the mature 3â² end (34Kleinschmidt A.M. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3131-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Huang Q. Pederson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and U2 snRNP particles are the substrates for U2 snRNA 3â² processing (34Kleinschmidt A.M. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3131-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 67Pederson T. Kleinschmidt A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 179Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 68Wendelburg B.J. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4132-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The activity of the human CCA-adding enzyme on native U2 snRNPs is consistent with the observation that 3â² maturation of U2 snRNA occursin vivo after snRNP assembly has begun.There are ample precedents for the ability of CCA-adding enzymes to recognize tRNA-like structures. tRNA consists of two structurally and functionally independent domains: a âtop halfâ or minihelix consisting of the acceptor stem stacked on the TÏC stem/loop, and a âbottom halfâ consisting of the DHU stem/loop stacked on the anticodon stem/loop (77Weiner A.M.

Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 79-111Google Scholar). Not only does a tRNA minihelix serve as substrate for CCA-adding enzymes (12Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar, 57Hou Y.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but single-stranded RNA viruses often have 3â²-terminal tRNA-like structures that serve as substrates for enzymes of tRNA metabolism including tRNA synthetases, the CCA-adding enzyme, and RNase P (11Giege R.

A. 1989; 86: 5335-5339Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Maize mitochondrial mRNAs also contain posttranscriptionally added 3â²-terminal nucleotides that could be the product of a mitochondrial form of the CCA-adding enzyme (82Williams M.A. Johzuka Y. Mulligan R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4444-4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Almost all U snRNAs have 3â²-terminal stem/loops, presumably to confer stability on the RNAs (83Yu Y.T. Scharl E.C. Smith C.M. Steitz J.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World II. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 487-524Google Scholar), and some small RNAs may be stabilized by posttranscription adenylation (45Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 46Chen Y. Sinha K. Perumal K. Reddy R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1277-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although direct RNA sequencing data are scanty, the U2 snRNA 3â²-terminal stem/loop appears to be followed by CCA only in mammals (human and rat); even frog U2 snRNA lacks CCA (Fig. 7). The U2 sequences of other organisms are either cDNA or DNA sequences. The cDNA sequences are all derived from poly(A)-tailed RNA, so that it is impossible to distinguish posttranscriptional 3â²-terminal A addition from the poly(A) tail. The DNA sequences almost all have C+A-rich 3â²-flanking regions; whether this C+A-rich region plays a role in 3â² end formation remains to be seen (20Ach R.A. Weiner A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2070-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Cuello P. Boyd D.C. Dye M.J. Proudfoot N.J. Murphy S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2867-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38Huang Q. Pederson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but it has already led to arbitrary assignment of U2 snRNA 3â² ends based solely on DNA sequence information. Because U2 snRNA sequences are strongly conserved from yeasts to mammals, failure to conserve the 3â²-terminal CCA suggests that this sequence is not required for U2 snRNA function; however, mammalian U2 snRNA is known to be very stable (84Weinberg R.A. Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 38: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and CCA addition could serve to protect U2 snRNA from 3â² exonucleases. In fact, U2 might exploit the CCA-adding enzyme, which exists in nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial forms (48Wolfe C.L. Hopper A.K. Martin N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4679-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 3T. Suzuki, personal communication. as the functional homolog of telomerase, to replenish 3â²-terminal nucleotide sequences that are lost by attrition (76Wells S.E. Ares Jr., M. Mol. Cell.

The CCA-adding enzyme (ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase) synthesizes and regenerates the 3â²-terminal CCA sequence of tRNA by adding three consecutive nucleotides in the order of C, C, and A (1Deutscher M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 2Sprinzl M. Cramer F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2042425954,"Chemical modification of mitochondria with the arginine-specific reagents phenylglyoxal (PGO) and 2,3-butanedione (BAD) decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and stabilizes it in the closed conformation (Eriksson, O., Fontaine, E., and Bernardi, P. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 12669â12674). Unexpectedly, modification of mitochondria with the arginine-specific reagentp-hydroxyphenylglyoxal (OH-PGO) resulted instead in PTP opening. Sequential modification with OH-PGO and PGO (or BAD) revealed that the effects on the PTP depended on the order of the additions. PTP opening was observed when OH-PGO preceded, and PTP closing was observed when OH-PGO followed, the addition of PGO (or BAD). The differential effects of OH-PGO and PGO on the PTP open probability (i) were not modified by the conformation-specific ligands of the adenine nucleotide translocase bongkrekate and atractylate; and (ii) were also observed in de-energized mitochondria, indicating that the effect is exerted directly on the PTP. OH-PGO dramatically sensitized PTP opening, which was triggered by depolarization even in the presence of EGTA. These data show that arginine modification modulates the PTP conformation in a ligand-selective fashion and suggest that the effects of OH-PGO, PGO, and BAD are mediated by the same arginine residues. We analyzed the structure of the arginine adducts by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a test peptide and N-acetylarginine. The results indicate that both OH-PGO and PGO react with arginine at a stoichiometry of 2:1 and form stable adducts that may be feasible to identify the PTP at the molecular level.

Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Google Scholar). Opening of the PTP may result in mitochondrial depolarization, swelling, and rupture of the outer membrane causing release of proteins from the intermembrane compartment. These events are under intense investigation in studies of the signal transduction of apoptosis, where the PTP may integrate several stimuli converging on mitochondria (2Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Google Scholar). Studies on isolated mitochondria have shown that the PTP is controlled by the membrane potential as well as by several ligands. High ÎÎ¨, CsA, ADP, H+, and BKA stabilize the closed conformation of the PTP, whereas low ÎÎ¨, intramitochondrial Ca2+, Pi, and CATR promote the open conformation (1Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Google Scholar). The molecular machinery of the PTP is not understood in great detail. It has been proposed that the PTP is composed of the ANT, the outer membrane VDAC, and mitochondrial cyclophilin (CyP-D), which by interactions with proteins of the Bcl-2 family would assemble to a pore-forming complex (3Vieira H.L. Haouzi D. El Hamel C. Jacotot E. Belzacq A.S. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Cell Death. Diff. 2000; 7: 1146-1154Google Scholar). This model has grown out of the findings that the ANT as well as the Bcl-2 proapoptotic homologue Bax behave as ion channels in model membranes (4Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Google Scholar, 5Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Google Scholar) and that the ANT inhibitors BKA and CATR affect the PTP conformation (6LeÌ-QuoÌc D. LeÌ-QuoÌc K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 466-478Google Scholar). Direct evidence as to the molecular identity of the PTP is still lacking, and presently the study of the role of specific proteins in the permeability transition is hampered by the lack of proper tools. The characterization of functionally important amino acids residues by the use of amino acid-specific covalent reagents has provided important clues on the mechanism of the PTP. Covalent modification has revealed the role of (i) one or more histidines that react with diethylpyrocarbonate and may be involved in CyP-D binding and pH sensing (7Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Google Scholar, 8Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Google Scholar); (ii) at least two cysteines controlling the PTP conformation by thiol-disulfide interconversions (9Chernyak B.V. Bernardi P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 623-630Google Scholar); and (iii) arginine residues that react with PGO and BAD favoring the closed conformation of the PTP (10Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Google Scholar). To investigate further PTP modulation by arginine reagents, we have characterized the effects of the arginine-specific reagent OH-PGO (11Yamasaki R.B. Vega A. Feeney R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 32-40Google Scholar). We show that, in contrast with PGO, and despite their structural similarity, OH-PGO strongly promoted the open conformation of the PTP. The inducing effect of OH-PGO (i) was prevented by pretreatment with PGO, suggesting that the two reagents are reacting with one or more of the same arginine residues; (ii) was strongly favored by mitochondrial de-energization, indicating that arginine reagents affect the PTP voltage dependence (10Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Google Scholar) in a ligand-dependent way; and (iii) was not affected by the conformation-specific ligands of the ANT, BKA, and CATR. To clarify the nature of the adduct(s) of PGO and OH-PGO with arginine, we have analyzed their structures by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and time-of-flight) mass spectrometry after reaction with a test peptide or withN-acetylarginine. Data showed that each reagent formed one major stable product with arginine at a stoichiometry of 2:1. Taken together, these results offer new insights into PTP modulation by arginine modification and should help to identify components of the PTP by chemical modification. A portion of these results has been presented in abstract form (12Eriksson O. Linder M. Kinnunen P. Bernardi P. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 238aGoogle Scholar). Rat liver mitochondria were prepared from male Wistar rats and preincubated with PGO or BAD as previously described (10Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Google Scholar). Preincubation of mitochondria with OH-PGO was performed at 1 mg of protein/ml in modification medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 100 Î¼m EGTA, 3 Î¼m rotenone, 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8.0, for 15 min at room temperature. The modification reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 6.8 with Hepes and cooling to 4 Â°C, followed by sedimentation of mitochondria by centrifugation at 8000 Ã g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended at 1 mg of protein/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 100 Î¼m EGTA, 100 Î¼m bovine serum albumin, 3 Î¼m rotenone, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The centrifugation was repeated once whereupon mitochondria were resuspended at 50 mg of protein/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 100 Î¼m EGTA, 3 Î¼m rotenone, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Control mitochondria were preincubated similarly, but OH-PGO was omitted. Unless otherwise stated, experiments were carried out in standard assay medium containing 250 mmsucrose, 5 mm succinate, 5 mmPi-Tris, 3 Î¼m rotenone, and 10 mmHepes-Tris, pH 7.4. For sequential modification experiments, mitochondria were incubated at 1 mg of protein/ml in modification medium containing 2 mmOH-PGO for 15 min at room temperature. Excess reagent was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 Ã g whereupon mitochondria were resuspended in modification medium containing either 2 mm PGO or 2 mm BAD for 15 min at room temperature. The modification reaction was terminated, and mitochondria were washed twice by centrifugation as described above. Alternatively, the reagents were used in reverse order, i.e. incubation of mitochondria was performed first in modification medium containing PGO or BAD followed, after centrifugation, by incubation in OH-PGO-containing medium. The medium was supplemented with 10 mm borate when BAD was used. PTP opening was assayed as the mitochondrial CsA-sensitive Ca2+ release and/or swelling. Medium [Ca2+] was measured with the indicator dye arsenazo III as the absorbance difference at the wavelength couple 665â685 nm, whereas swelling was monitored as the decrease of absorbance at 540 nm (10Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Google Scholar). PTP closing was measured as shrinkage of mitochondria essentially as described previously (Ref. 10Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Google Scholar, see Ref. 13Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Google Scholar for a thorough description). Briefly, mitochondria were suspended at 0.3 mg of protein/ml in a medium containing 30 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm Ca2+, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, at room temperature to induce the permeability transition. The absorbance of the suspension was monitored at 540 nm, and the incubation was continued until the absorbance stabilized at about 50% of the initial value (i.e. until all mitochondria had undergone permeability transition), which took 30â40 min. The arginine reagent to be tested was then added to the mitochondrial suspension, and this time was taken as time, t = 0 min. At the indicated intervals 4% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 7000 was then added to induce shrinkage of mitochondria with an open PTP. Shrinkage was completed in less than 1 min following addition of PEG. Because the absorbance of the mitochondrial suspension following permeability transition was not exactly identical for all preparations, the absorbance measured after completed shrinkage (A) was normalized by setting the absorbance preceding PEG addition (Ao) to zero and the absorbance following addition of PEG and shrinkage at t = 0 min (Amax) to one unit using the formula, Anorm = (A âAo)/(Amax âAo). For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry 100 Î¼m of the test peptide pEWPRPQIPP or 1 mmN-acetylarginine was allowed to react with 10 mmPGO or OH-PGO in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.5, for 60 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For desalting, the reaction mixture was equilibrated in a Zip Tip C18 silica bead microcolumn (Millipore), which was then washed repeatedly with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Adsorbed compounds were eluted with acetonitrile, and the obtained eluate was mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with either saturated Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid 2:1 (for the test peptide) or 2% 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 10% ethanol (for N-acetylarginine). 0.5 Î¼l of this solution was applied on the target. Reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Biflex III spectrometer. For calibration, the peaks of Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and of peptides of known masses were used. The peptide was selected because of its size, being optimal for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and because it contained one single arginine and no primary amines that could conceivably give rise to minor side-products. For pH titration of the arginine adduct 1 mmN-acetylarginine was allowed to react with 10 mmOH-PGO in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, as above. To quench excess reagent, 7 mg/ml polyarginine (average mw 110 kDa) was added, the mixture was incubated for 30 min whereupon the arginine adduct was separated on a PD-10 Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The pKa of the phenol OH of the adduct was found to be 6.9 as determined by absorbance at Î» = 340 nm (11Yamasaki R.B. Vega A. Feeney R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 32-40Google Scholar) following addition of aliquots of HCl or KOH. The total mitochondrial Ca2+ of freshly isolated mitochondria was 8.4 Â± 0.7 nmol/mg of protein (mean Â± S.E., n = 5) as analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. This corresponds to a free Ca2+ of about 5 Î¼m (14Coll K.E. Joseph S.K. Corkey B.E. Williamsson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8696-8704Google Scholar). CsA was a gift from Novartis, OH-PGO was purchased from Pierce, carboxyatractyloside was from Calbiochem, and all other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. Freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria were preincubated for 15 min with 2 mm OH-PGO followed by removal of excess reagent by centrifugation. Mitochondria were then resuspended in standard assay medium containing succinate as the substrate, and 20 Î¼mCa2+ was added (Fig. 1). Control mitochondria readily accumulated and retained Ca2+(Fig. 1A, trace a) and maintained a constant volume (panel B, trace a), indicating that these conditions were insufficient to open the PTP. Mitochondria pretreated with OH-PGO released Ca2+ soon after it had been taken up (panel A, trace b) and underwent rapid swelling (panel B, trace b); and both processes were fully prevented by the addition of 1 Î¼m CsA (panels A and B, traces c), indicating that the PTP was the main pathway for Ca2+ release and sucrose uptake.Panel C depicts the concentration dependence of PTP induction by OH-PGO, from which a K50 of 0.3 mm OH-PGO could be estimated. These findings are of interest, because our previous studies have shown that arginine modification by PGO and BAD causes strong inhibition of the PTP (10Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Google Scholar). Thus, the present results suggest that the effect of arginine reagents on the PTP depends on the nature of the adducts rather than on the modification of arginine(s) as such. We next investigated whether reaction with PGO, which inhibits the PTP, would prevent the PTP-inducing effects of OH-PGO, and if, conversely, OH-PGO would prevent the inhibitory effects of PGO. Mitochondria were incubated either (i) with 2 mm PGO followed by 2 mm OH-PGO for 15 min, excess reagent being removed after each incubation, or (ii) with the same reagents but in the opposite order. Mitochondria were then suspended in the standard assay medium containing succinate as the substrate and 20 Î¼m Ca2+ was added to study the response of the PTP. The results depicted in Fig. 2show that mitochondria incubated first with OH-PGO failed to accumulate Ca2+ (Fig. 2A, trace a) and underwent large amplitude swelling (panel B, trace a). These results were due to PTP opening, because the addition of 1 Î¼m CsA fully restored Ca2+ uptake and prevented swelling (results not shown). In contrast, when the incubation was carried out with PGO first, mitochondria accumulated and retained Ca2+ (panel A, trace b), and they did not undergo swelling (panel B, trace b), indicating that the PTP remained closed. These results show that the response of the PTP to modification by PGO and OH-PGO depends on the order of addition of the reagents. Similar results were obtained when PGO was substituted by BAD (not shown). The assays used to study the PTP in these protocols depend on Ca2+ uptake, which in turn relies on substrate transport and respiration. It was therefore important to exclude the possibility that the effects of OH-PGO were exerted at levels that may indirectly affect the PTP under these experimental conditions. We have previously shown that PGO induces closing of the PTP in fully de-energized mitochondria, a condition where reaction with effectors that modulate the PTP indirectly can be easily excluded (10Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Google Scholar). We have used this method to investigate whether the effects of OH-PGO were directly related to the PTP. In keeping with our previous results (10Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Google Scholar), the experiments of Fig. 3 show that the addition of 0.5 mm Ca2+ readily opened the PTP (trace a) and that PTP closing was achieved by the addition of ADP plus CsA (trace b). Incubation of mitochondria with 2 mm PGO resulted in PTP closing with an apparenttÂ½ of 8 min for the reaction (trace c). As expected, incubation of mitochondria with 2 mm OH-PGO had minor effects on the already open PTP (trace d), yet incubation of mitochondria with 2 mm PGO plus 2 mm OH-PGO significantly decreased the rate of PTP closing as compared with that observed with 2 mm PGO alone (trace e, compare with trace c). Because OH-PGO induced 50% inhibition of the PGO-induced PTP closing, it can be estimated that the rate constants for modification by PGO and by OH-PGO were approximately equal. These results demonstrate that OH-PGO antagonized the effects of PGO even under conditions where a contribution from electron or substrate transport can be ruled out, and strongly suggest that modification by OH-PGO and PGO directly affects the conformation of the PTP at the same site. The ANT contains several conserved arginine residues that constitute potential targets for OH-PGO. The permeability transition is inhibited by BKA, which binds to the ANT at the matrix side thereby locking the carrier in âmâ-conformation, while it is promoted by CATR, which binds to the ANT at the cytosolic side thereby locking it in the âcâ-conformation (6LeÌ-QuoÌc D. LeÌ-QuoÌc K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 466-478Google Scholar). It was thus of interest to study whether the reactivity of the PTP-arginine(s) was affected by conformation-selective ANT ligands. The results presented in Fig.4 show that, at concentrations sufficient to completely inhibit adenine nucleotide transport by the ANT (15Klingenberg M. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 56: 97-105Google Scholar), neither BKA nor CATR had any significant effect on the rate of PGO-induced PTP closing (closed symbols), and neither compound had significant effects on the PTP in control mitochondria that had undergone the permeability transition (open symbols). Likewise, ATP (1 mm) and ADP (1 mm) had no effects on the rate of PGO-induced PTP closing (not shown). These results indicate that arginine modification of the PTP was insensitive to the BKA- and CATR-induced conformational changes of the ANT. It appears unlikely that the arginine of interest was located on the ANT binding sites for BKA or CATR. In the course of the experiments with OH-PGO we observed that it was necessary to supplement the medium with an oxidizable substrate during and after incubation with OH-PGO to prevent swelling of the mitochondria prior to the addition of Ca2+. This observation suggested that energization might affect modification of the PTP by OH-PGO. To explore this possibility, freshly isolated mitochondria were energized with succinate (Fig.5, traces a and c) or de-energized with myxothiazole and oligomycin (trace b), followed by the addition of 2 mm OH-PGO directly to the cuvette. It can be seen that the addition of OH-PGO to energized mitochondria had no effect on mitochondrial absorbance indicating that the PTP remained closed throughout the experiment (trace a). However, in de-energized mitochondria the addition of OH-PGO readily induced swelling (trace b), which was completely prevented by 1 Î¼m CsA (not shown). Remarkably, addition of FCCP to energized mitochondria incubated in the presence of OH-PGO immediately induced opening of the PTP (trace c), whereas FCCP had no effects when added to untreated mitochondria (results not shown). These findings demonstrate that PTP opening by OH-PGO is favored by mitochondrial de-energization. It should be emphasized that no Ca2+ was added in these experiments, and that endogenous Ca2+ was thus sufficient to induce the permeability transition in de-energized mitochondria treated with OH-PGO. Increasing the concentration of EGTA had no effect on rate of OH-PGO-induced swelling. These experiments suggest that OH-PGO dramatically increases the sensitivity of the PTP to Ca2+ at low membrane potential. In contrast, we found that PGO-induced PTP closing was similar regardless of whether mitochondria were energized or de-energized during modification (results not shown). As a first step to understand the mechanism by which arginine modification modulates the PTP, it was necessary to analyze the structure of the arginine adducts. For this purpose we elected to study the arginine adducts produced by reaction of OH-PGO, PGO, and BAD with the test peptide pEWPRPQIPP. The crude reaction mixture was subjected to analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and the region between 1050 and 1450 m/z of the resulting mass spectra are shown in Fig. 6. In the absence of reagents, the test peptide gave rise to a single peak corresponding to its monoisotopic mass (M+H+) of 1101.6 Da (trace a). The intensity of this peak decreased markedly following reaction with PGO or OH-PGO, with two new peaks appearing atm/z 1351.6 (trace b) andm/z 1383.4 (trace c), respectively. On the other hand, the BAD adduct appeared to be unstable under the conditions of sample preparation, because no reaction products of the test peptide and BAD could be detected (not shown). None of the arginine reagents alone gave rise to peaks in the displayed region, and no peak could be detected at higher m/z ratios (not shown). To ascertain that the observed molecules were due to modification of peptide arginine, we studied the products formed in the reaction of N-acetylarginine with PGO and OH-PGO. Peaks could be detected at m/z 467.1 andm/z 499.0 for the PGO adduct (Fig. 6,inset, trace a) and the OH-PGO adduct, respectively (Fig. 6, inset, trace b), in addition to a peak at m/z 217.0 corresponding to the mass of intact N-acetylarginine (not shown). These data demonstrate that PGO and OH-PGO reacted with the guanidine moiety of arginine yielding, for each reagent, one major product that increased the molecular mass by 250 and 282 Da, respectively. The measured mass of the PGO adduct corresponds to one of the proposed structures for the reaction product between PGO and arginine (16Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Google Scholar), whereas the OH-PGO adduct was 32 Da heavier, suggesting the presence of two additional oxygen atoms. These data strongly suggest that PGO and OH-PGO react with arginine at a stoichiometry of 2:1 to produce the stable compounds shown in Fig. 7.Figure 7Structure of the arginine adducts of PGO(a) and OH-PGO (b). The molecular mass of the detected PGO adduct corresponds to one of the structures proposed in a previous study (15Klingenberg M. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 56: 97-105Google Scholar). The OH-PGO adduct was 32 Da heavier than the PGO adduct, the difference in mass corresponding to the two hydroxyl oxygens.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this study we have investigated chemical modification of mitochondria by the arginine-specific reagent OH-PGO. Incubation of mitochondria with OH-PGO induced a chemical modification that increased the sensitivity of the PTP to Ca2+ and to depolarization. This effect appears to result from a direct modification of the PTP and to be mediated by one or more of the same arginines that react with PGO and BAD. This interpretation is supported by the antagonism between PGO and OH-PGO observed both during Ca2+-induced PTP opening and in PTP closing experiments. Based on the finding that arginine modification with PGO prevents uncoupler-induced PTP opening (17Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 361-364Google Scholar) and on the function of arginines in the voltage-sensing elements of ion channels (18Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Google Scholar) we have proposed that the arginine of interest plays a role in the sensing of the ÎÎ¨ by the PTP. The finding that arginine modification by OH-PGO rendered the PTP extremely sensitive to depolarization lends further support to the notion that arginine residues are implicated in PTP voltage sensing. Modification by OH-PGO would result in a shift of the âgating potentialâ (i.e. the threshold potential at which PTP opening occurs, see Ref. 1Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Google Scholar for review) to more negative values that are closer to the resting ÎÎ¨, resulting in an increased probability of pore opening; whereas PGO (and BAD) would cause the opposite effects, with the threshold moving away from the resting ÎÎ¨ thus resulting in a decreased probability of PTP opening upon depolarization. These results are novel, because they demonstrate that the consequences of arginine modification on the PTP depend on the nature of the ligand rather than on modification as such and that subtle differences in the chemical nature of the reagent may change the response from inhibition to activation. It is intriguing that a similar picture has emerged from studies of PTP modulation by quinones (19Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Google Scholar) and that also in that case hydroxylation was able to turn a PTP inhibitor into an activator (20Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Google Scholar). Two alternative mechanisms can be invoked to explain the opposing effects of OH-PGO and PGO (or BAD). Either they modify one or more of the same arginines, the effect on the PTP being determined by the properties of the adducts, or PTP-opening and PTP-closing reagents modify arginine residues at separate sites, affecting the PTP conformation by different mechanisms. To address this issue, we have performed sequential modification experiments based on the rationale that, if the reagents modify one or more of the same arginines, the effect of the reagent added first should prevail. If, on the other hand, the reagents modify separate arginines the outcome should be independent of the order of addition of the reagents, because both arginines would be modified anyway. Our results indicate that the effect of the reagents was critically dependent on the order of addition, suggesting that the same site was being modified (Fig. 2). Binding to the same site is also supported by the chemical similarity of PGO and OH-PGO, because it appears extremely unlikely that any arginine would exhibit high reactivity toward one of the reagents while being completely inert with the other. To clarify the mechanism by which arginine modification by OH-PGO affects the PTP conformation, it was essential to exclude indirect effects on the PTP. For this purpose we studied chemical modification under conditions where the PTP is independent of other mitochondrial functions such as substrate transport, respiration, and membrane potential. This can be achieved by measuring PTP closing in mitochondria that have already undergone the permeability transition. Such mitochondria are by definition de-energized, and their matrix content is similar to the suspension buffer regarding the composition of molecular species smaller than 1500 Da. Obviously, because the modification by OH-PGO could not be measured as PTP closing, we investigated the effect of OH-PGO on the rate of PGO-induced PTP closing, which proceeded as an apparent first order reaction with atÂ½ of 8 min. This value compares well with the rate of PGO modification as assayed by Ca2+ transport (17Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 361-364Google Scholar). In the presence of OH-PGO the rate was reduced by â¼50% as estimated by the fraction of mitochondria with PTP in open conformation, suggesting that the rate constants for modification with PGO and OH-PGO were approximately equal (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the effect of arginine reagents on the PTP are independent of substrate transport, respiration, and membrane potential, thus suggesting that the effect on PTP conformation was due to modification of an arginine located on the PTP. Much evidence shows that the ANT is implicated in PTP function, although its exact role in the molecular machinery of the PTP remains debated (1Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Google Scholar). It is possible that the ANT itself constitutes the pore-forming component (21Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Google Scholar), but it is also conceivable that the ANT, being the most abundant inner membrane protein, exerts an indirect, conformation-dependent effect on the PTP by influencing the surface potential (22Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Google Scholar, 23Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the link, if any, between the PTP-reactive arginines and the ANT we have studied the relationship between accessibility of the arginine to chemical modification and ANT conformation. The results indicated that arginine modification was independent of the BKA- and CATR-induced conformational changes of the ANT, and it appears unlikely that the arginine or arginines of interest were located on the binding sites of BKA and CATR, because that should have led to protection against chemical modification. Such protecting effects of BKA and CATR have indeed been observed with chemical modification of their binding sites by thiol- and lysine-specific reagents (24Majima E. Shinohara Y. Ikawa K. Yamaguchi N. Hung Y.-M. Terada H. Biochemistry. 1995; 33: 9530-9536Google Scholar, 25Bogner W. Aquila H. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 611-620Google Scholar). Thus, in agreement with our previous findings (10Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Google Scholar), the present study provided no evidence for a direct link between the OH-PGO-reactive arginines and the ANT. To analyze the structure of the arginine adducts formed by modification, we used N-acetylarginine and an octapeptide containing one arginine residue in a non-terminal position. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction products between the test substances and PGO or OH-PGO shows that modification yielded one major reaction product resulting from the addition of two molecules of the reagent to one arginine. The mass of the PGO adduct corresponds to one of the structures proposed by Takahashi (16Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Google Scholar). It is thus clear that the dramatic difference in the effects of PGO and OH-PGO on the PTP can be traced to relatively subtle differences in the structure of their adducts. This in turn allows for some predictions regarding the role of the arginine of interest in the PTP. It appears unlikely that the arginine(s) is(are) located on a protein-protein interaction site, because the bulky adduct of both PGO and OH-PGO would tend to interfere with such interactions and should lead to a similar effect on the PTP conformation. For similar reasons, it is unlikely that the arginine is located in an anion binding site. Irrespective of the detailed mechanism, however, our findings are fully consistent with a critical role of the arginine residue(s) in PTP voltage sensing, where small differences in the physical properties of the adduct, such as charge, hydrophobicity, polarity, and bulkiness, could be expected to exert a large influence on the voltage-dependent changes of PTP conformation. Indeed, the low pKa of the phenol OH groups of OH-PGO (11Yamasaki R.B. Vega A. Feeney R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 32-40Google Scholar) and its arginine adduct, carrying about 1.5 negative charges compared with the PGO adduct at neutral pH, suggests that the difference in effect of the compounds can be traced to a difference in their charge state. The finding that the adducts of PGO and OH-PGO can readily be detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry may prove useful for probing the PTP at molecular level. We are currently performing experiments to detect PGO and OH-PGO adducts on VDAC and CyP-D and to test whether PGO and OH-PGO can be used to predictably modulate PTP function in intact cells.

Eight NR1 splice variants exist, four of which arise from alternative splicing of the C-terminal exon cassettes. Alternative splice variants may display a differential ability to interact with synaptic anchoring proteins, and splicing of C-terminal exon cassettes may alter the mechanism(s) of subcellular localization and targeting. The NR1â4 isoform has a significantly different C-terminal composition than the prototypic NR1-1 isoform. Whereas the NR1-1 C terminus is composed of C0, C1, and C2 exon cassettes, the NR1â4 C terminus is composed of the C0 and C2â² cassettes. In the present study, we address the importance of the NR1â4 C-terminal exon cassettes (C0C2â²) in subcellular localization in differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, in organotypic cultures of dorsal root ganglia, and also in heterologous cells. NR1â4-green fluorescent protein chimeras were created with deletion of either C0, C2â², or both cassettes to address their importance in subcellular distribution and cell surface expression of the NR1â4 subunit. These experiments demonstrate that the NR1â4 splice variant found predominantly in the spinal cord uses the C0 cassette, to a large degree, to organize the subcellular distribution of this receptor subunit. Although the role of the C2â² subunit is less clear, it may be involved in subunit clustering. However, this clustering is not always as efficient as that attributed to C0 alone or to the natural combination of C0C2â². Finally, although an intact C-terminal domain is neither necessary for interaction with the NR2A subunit nor surface expression of the NR1â4 subunit, the C-terminal domain fragment alone blocks surface expression of native NR1â4, in a dominant negative fashion, when the two are coexpressed.

N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor N-methyl-d-aspartate dorsal root ganglion green florescent protein truncated NR1-4 (lacking C0 and C2) fused to GFP (shown in Fig. 1) nerve growth factor NMDA receptor subunit 1 NMDA receptor subunit 2 phosphate-buffered saline pheochromocytoma postsynaptic density protein of 95 kDa transmembrane domain 4 threonine/serine, any amino acid, valine nerve growth factor hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, acts upon theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR),1 a member of the ionotropic class of glutamate receptors (1Monaghan D.T. Bridges R.J. Cotman C.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 29: 365-402Google Scholar). Functional NMDARs are heteromers composed of the two subunits NR1 and NR2 (2Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E. Araki K. Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Google Scholar, 3Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1217-1221Google Scholar). A third NMDAR subunit, NR3, has been described, but its biological significance is only just beginning to be investigated (4Sun L. Margolis F.L. Shipley M.T. Lidow M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 392-396Google Scholar, 5Das S. Sasaki Y.F. Rothe T. Premkumar L.S. Takasu M. Crandall J.E. Dikkes P. Conner D.A. Rayudu P.V. Cheung W. Chen H.S. Lipton S.A. Nakanishi N. Nature. 1998; 393: 377-381Google Scholar). Although much is known about the physiological role that NMDARs play in long term potentiation, learning, and memory (6Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Google Scholar, 7Thompson S.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R218-R221Google Scholar), much remains to be learned about the mechanisms by which these receptors are sorted, targeted, and anchored, both at the synapse and at extra-synaptic sites. To date, considerable research has focused on NMDAR C-terminal domain interactions, specifically those interactions between the NR2 subunit C-terminal threonine/serine, any amino acid, and valine ((T/S)XV) motif and PDZ domain-containing proteins located at the synapse (8Bassand P. Bernard A. Rafiki A. Gayet D. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2031-2043Google Scholar, 9Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Google Scholar, 10Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Google Scholar). PDZ domains contain an 80â90-amino acid sequence that forms the binding site for proteins containing the C-terminal (T/S)XV motif (11Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Google Scholar). The post-synaptic density 95 (PSD-95) family of proteins contain 1â3 PDZ domains (12Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 116: 123-131Google Scholar, 13O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Blackshaw S. Ehlers M.D. Rothstein J.D. Huganir R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 364-369Google Scholar, 14Kennedy M.B. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 243-257Google Scholar). Whereas most data implicate PSD-95 as the major protein that facilitates clustering of NMDAR on the post-synaptic density, a growing body of evidence supports the importance of cytoskeletal elements in the localization of this receptor at the synapse. The NR1 subunit has been shown to interact directly with the cytoskeletal proteins neurofilament (15Ehlers M.D. Fung E.T. O'Brien R.J. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 720-730Google Scholar) and tubulin (16van Rossum R.D. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 962-973Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NR1 C terminus may be cross-linked to the actin cytoskeleton via interaction with Î±-actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins (17Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Google Scholar). Although these findings only begin to explain how the NMDAR is clustered and anchored at the synaptic membrane, they do suggest that the C terminus is important, if not essential, to this process. Current research in this area has focused largely on the NR2 subunits and the NR1 subunit isoform, NR1-1. Eight NR1 splice variants exist, four of which arise from alternative splicing of C-terminal exon cassettes (18Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Google Scholar). Given the general consensus that the NR1 C terminus makes important cytoskeletal contacts, different splice variants might display a differential ability to interact with anchoring proteins. Furthermore, splicing of C-terminal exon cassettes may alter the mechanism(s) of subcellular localization and targeting used by NR1 isoforms. The NR1â4 splice variant has a significantly different C-terminal composition than the prototypic NR1-1 splice variant. The NR1-1 C terminus is composed of C0, C1, and C2 exon cassettes, and in contrast, the NR1â4 C terminus is composed of C0 and the alternatively spliced C2â² cassette (18Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Google Scholar). A potentially important difference between the two variants lies within their extreme C termini as follows: the C1 and C2 cassettes are absent from NR1â4 and an amino acid frameshift following alternative splicing gives rise to the NR1â4 C2â² cassette that terminates in a (T/S)XV motif that is entirely absent from NR1-1 C termini (18Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Google Scholar). The presence of a (T/S)XV motif in the NR1â4 C terminus suggests a potential for this subunit to interact directly with PDZ-containing proteins such as those belonging to the PSD-95 family. In the present study we address the importance of the NR1â4 C-terminal exon cassettes (C0 and C2â²) in subcellular localization in differentiated PC12 cells and organotypic cultures of dorsal root ganglia (DRG). NR1â4-GFP chimeras were created with deletion of either C0, C2â², or both cassettes to address their importance in subcellular distribution and cell surface expression of the NR1â4 subunit. Routine culturing and differentiation of PC12 cells (obtained from Dr. R. A. Bradshaw, University of California, Irvine, CA) with 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) have been described previously (19LeVatte M.A. Cassam A.K. Dekaban G.A. Weaver L.C. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 1321-1336Google Scholar). Differentiation of PC12 cells with NGF for all the reported experiments was allowed to proceed for at least 5 days before experimental use. HEK293 cells and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1%l-glutamine, and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% C02 humidified atmosphere(all culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen). Purified plasmid DNA (1 Î¼g/well, prepared with a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada)) and LipofectAMINE (10 Î¼l/well; Invitrogen) were used to transfect differentiated PC12, HEK293, and COS7 cells as described in the manufacturer's instructions. After transfecting the cells for 5 h, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to each well. After an additional 24 h at 37 Â°C, the media were removed from each well, and fresh media were added. A luciferase reporter plasmid (10 ng of pCIG-2 luciferase per well, provided by Dr. C. A. Strathdee, Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada) was used to monitor transfection efficiency. Organotypic cultures were made from the DRG of postnatal day 7â9 Wistar rats as described previously (20Marsh D.R. Holmes K.D. Dekaban G.A. Weaver L.C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-12Google Scholar). Marsh et al. (20Marsh D.R. Holmes K.D. Dekaban G.A. Weaver L.C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-12Google Scholar) also describe the biolistic gene transfer to organotypic cultures. HEK293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and the plasmids pNR1C0C2â²GFP or pNR1GFPC0C2â² in Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) for 24 h. The transfection media were replaced with complete medium for a further 48 h. The cells were then passaged and seeded at single cell density into 60-mm tissue culture plates (Nunc) containing complete medium supplemented with 800 Î¼g/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Transgene expression and clone homogeneity were assessed using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry to examine pNR1C0C2â²GFP/pNR1GFPC0C2â² fusion protein expression. Colonies were selected 7â14 days later and mechanically harvested from the dish. Cells were maintained thereafter in the presence of 800 Î¼g/ml geneticin. Recombinant polymerase chain reaction techniques were used to remove C-terminal cassettes and to incorporate restriction endonuclease sites to allow construction of all NR1â4-GFP chimeras (Fig. 1). The chimeras were verified by DNA sequencing to ensure that all fusion proteins were in frame and of the correct sequence. Vectors pNF-2 (NR1-1GFP, a generous gift from Dr. T. E. Hughes, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) and pNR1â4, pNR2A, and pNR2D (generous gifts from Dr. S. Nakanishi, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) were used as PCR templates. The NR2D and NR2A cDNAs were excised and ligated into the expression vectors pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pHEX (21Strathdee C.A. McLeod M.R. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 479-485Google Scholar), respectively. Hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged chimeras were created by excisingHindIII-BspEI fragments from the NR1â4GFP chimeras and inserting the correspondingHindIII-BspEI-HA containing fragments from the vector HANR1GFP (a generous donation from Dr. M. Sheng, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Massachusetts General, Hospital, Boston). For cell surface labeling of NR1â4, a mouse monoclonal anti-HA epitope antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to fixed, nonpermeabilized cells at a concentration of 1:2000. For colocalization of NR1â4GFP with NR2A, a rabbit polyclonal anti-NR2A/B antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was added to fixed, permeabilized cells at a concentration of 1:500. Following incubation at room temperature for 48 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with biotin-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody or biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (for anti-HA and anti-NR2A labeling, respectively, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for 16 h, washed again with PBS, and then incubated with rhodamine-streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 3 h. Cells were washed two more times with PBS and then stored at 4 Â°C until analyzed by confocal microscopy. At 48 h post-transfection, fixed or live cells were imaged using the Zeiss LSM510 or Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 MP laser scanning confocal microscopes. Images were processed using LSM510 (Carl Zeiss Inc., North York, Ontario, Canada) or Lasersharp 2000 software (Bio-Rad), Adobe Photoshop 5.02 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA), and Corel Draw 8 (Corel Inc., Kanata, Ontario, Canada). To quantify clustering of NR1â4-GFP fusion proteins in differentiated PC12 cells, 10â15 neurites from transfected cells (from two separate transfections) were chosen randomly for image acquisition. Images were then processed using Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Inc. Silver Spring, MD) to count clusters per neurite length. Gamma and contrast values were adjusted prior to counting to reduce background such that the same setting was applied to each image. Neurite length of â¼40 Î¼m was analyzed per image such that, for each construct, a total neurite length of 350â400 Î¼m was assessed. At 48 h post-transfection, HEK293 cells cultured in 100-mm plates were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and surface proteins were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 Â°C (36Meddows E. Le B.B. Grimwood S. Wafford K. Sandhu S. Whiting P. McIlhinney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18795-18803Google Scholar). Cells were washed once with cold PBS and then with 0.1 m glycine/PBS for 10 min at 4 Â°C. Cells were washed two more times with cold PBS and then harvested using 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, v/v, and for every 10 ml of lysis buffer, 1 complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added prior to use). To isolate cell surface proteins, 50 Î¼l of Ultralink immobilized streptavidin beads were used per 100 Î¼g of total cell protein. Briefly, protein was solubilized in 200 Î¼l of precipitation buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.02% sodium azide) and then incubated with streptavidin for 2 h at 4 Â°C. Samples were then centrifuged 3 min at 2500 Ãg. This process was repeated one additional time. Pellets were washed four times in precipitation buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer subjected to electrophoresis as described below. At 48 h post-transfection, PC12 cells were harvested and lysed in a commercial cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Protein concentrations for each sample were then determined in triplicate using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, containing 8 m urea, as described previously (23Arp J. Ford C.M. Palker T.J. King E.E. Dekaban G.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 211-222Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) using the trans-blot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The same electrophoresis and immunoblotting conditions were applied for the analysis of biotinylated cell surface proteins precipitated with streptavidin beads. The anti-NMDA R1 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone 54.1, PharMingen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) that recognizes an epitope between amino acids 660 and 811 of the NR1-1 protein was used at a dilution of 1:500. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-NMDA R2A/B (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), goat polyclonal anti-NR2D (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-PSD-95 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), mouse monoclonal anti-Î±-actinin (Sigma), and mouse monoclonal anti-Î²-tubulin (PharMingen) antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:500, 1:200, 1:200, 1:500, 1:800, and 1:500, respectively. The goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used at a dilution of 1:5000. NR1C0C2â²GFP and NR1GFPC0C2â² stable cell lines were seeded into 6-well plates (Nunc) at 200,000 cells per well. Additionally, 293 cells were seeded at 200,000 cells per well and transiently transfected with pNR1C0C2â²GFP or pNR1â4. Transient transfections were supplemented with 10 ng of a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the regulation of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. Cycloheximide (Calbiochem) was resuspended in PBS and applied to the wells to give a final concentration of 100 Î¼g/ml. Cells were harvested in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and NR1 protein levels were assessed using SDS-PAGE and then Western-blotted with an Î±-NR1 antibody (PharMingen). Densitometry readings were derived from the resultant blots using a Bio-Rad GS700 Imaging Densitometer. Protein decay values were fitted with exponential regression curves, and the half-life was calculated as follows: TÂ½ = 0.69/K, where Y = span(eâKx) + plateau. Where applicable, data are presented as means Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison test, using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA). To characterize the importance of the NR1â4 C terminus in NMDAR localization, NR1â4-GFP fusion chimeras were made with deletions in their C-terminal domains, C0 and/or C2â² (Fig.1). GFP was fused, in frame, to the extreme C terminus of NR1â4 or immediately following the fourth transmembrane domain, producing fluorescent NR1â4 receptor subunit proteins. To determine whether each NR1â4-GFP chimera expressed a protein of the predicted molecular weight, PC12 cells were transfected, harvested 48 h later, and immunoblotted using an anti-NR1 monoclonal antibody. Immunoblotting confirmed the presence and predicted molecular weight of each NR1â4-GFP chimera and HANR1â4-GFP chimera (not shown), as well as endogenous NR1 (Fig. 2A). Other NMDAR protein complex members, NR2A/B, NR2D, PSD-95, and Î±-actinin-2, were also detected in the PC12 cells used in our experiments (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C demonstrates that the NR1â4 C-terminal domain fused to GFP was also the correct size when immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibody. Densitometry was used to quantify the level of NR1â4-GFP expression, after normalization for protein content. Transfection efficiency was normalized by measuring luciferase activity from a cotransfected luciferase reporter plasmid (n = 3, Fig. 2D). Expression levels for each chimera, relative to luciferase activity, were similar with the exception of NR1GFPC0C2â² and NGFP that consistently exhibited 2-fold lower expression. The inclusion of the HA epitope tag at the N-terminal splice site did not affect expression levels (data not shown). To verify that the fusion of GFP to NR1â4 did not destabilize the resulting protein, we treated HEK293 cells that stably expressed NR1C0C2â²GFP and NR1GFPC0C2â² with 100 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide for varying times and analyzed the resultant protein levels via SDS-PAGE and then Western blot with NR1 antibody (PharMingen). NR1C0C2â²GFP and NR1â4 proteins were similarly analyzed in transiently transfected 293 cells. The decay kinetics of these chimeras, with a representative blot, are displayed together in Fig. 2E. Both stably and transiently transfected NR1C0C2â²GFP exhibited similar decay kinetics, although transient expression greatly increased the variability of the assay. Stably expressed NR1C0C2â²GFP decayed with a half-life of 1.58 h (r2 = 0.9776), whereas transiently expressed NR1C0C2â²GFP decayed with a half-life of 2.08 h (r2 = 0.5811). In contrast, stably expressed NR1GFPC0C2â² decayed with a half-life of only 0.42 h (r2 = 0.9811). Transiently expressed NR1â4 decayed with a half-life of 1.097 h (r2 = 0.6274) that was intermediate between the two enhanced GFP fusion variants. Similar relationships were obtained using flow cytometry to characterize the decay kinetics of the fused enhanced GFP moiety (data not shown). The subcellular distribution of each NR1â4-GFP chimera in transiently transfected, NGF-differentiated PC12 cells was examined by confocal microscopy 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 3). A full-length NR1â4-GFP chimera, NR1C0C2â²GFP (with contiguous intracytoplasmic C termini), formed distinct receptor-rich clusters throughout cell bodies and neurites (Fig. 3, A and Aâ², respectively). A chimera with the (T/S)XV restored at the end of the GFP C terminus of NR1C0C2â²GFP yielded the same result (data not shown). This was comparable with the distribution patterns of endogenous NR1-1, as shown by immunocytochemistry for native NR1, suggesting that a GFP-tagged receptor behaves like an endogenous NR1 receptor (Fig.3E). In the absence of C2â² or C0 cassettes (Fig. 3,B and C, respectively), chimeras tagged with GFP at their C terminus had no significant change in distribution, occurring in clusters throughout cell bodies as in Fig. 3A. However, the number of clusters typically observed in cell neurites expressing NR1C2â²GFP was decreased in comparison to cluster numbers in cells expressing NR1C0C2â²GFP or NR1C0GFP, especially in neurites (compare Fig. 3, Aâ²âCâ²). Cells expressing a fully truncated NR1â4-GFP chimera, lacking both C0 and C2â² cassettes, NGFP, lacked obvious clusters, and the chimera was typically distributed diffusely throughout cell bodies and neurites (Fig. 3, D andDâ²). We also quantified the effect of C-terminal deletion on formation of NR1â4-GFP fusion protein clusters in PC12 neurites (Fig.3G). NR1C0C2â²GFP and NR1C0GFP both displayed â¼4â5 clusters per 10-Î¼m length of neurite, whereas both NR1C2â²GFP and NGFP showed significantly reduced cluster number (n = 10). The distribution of GFP alone in PC12 cells is shown in Fig.3F and was observed to be uniformly distributed in the cell body and in neurites as described previously (24Holmes K.D. Cassam A.K. Chan B. Peters A.A. Weaver L.C. Dekaban G.A. J. Neurovirol. 2000; 6: 33-45Google Scholar). Cells expressing NR1â4-GFP chimeras with GFP fused immediately following TM4 typically showed very low fluorescence levels (data not shown). This occurred despite containing similar levels of protein expression as the NR1â4-GFP chimeras that had GFP fused at the extreme C termini (Fig.2). This could be attributed to improper protein folding resulting from the placement of GFP between contiguous protein domains rather than at the free C terminus where protein folding would be less hindered. Furthermore, unlike NR1â4 chimeras with an intact TM4-C0 structure, the anti-NR1 54.1 mAb failed to bind to its epitope located in the extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4. Thus NR1â4-GFP chimeras with GFP fused following TM4 were largely omitted from subsequent studies due to difficulty in analyzing cells with low fluorescence, the potential for altered confirmation in the TM3 and TM4 regions, and the lack of stability of these chimeras compared with chimeras with GFP fused to the extreme C termini. To examine the distribution of NR1â4 deletion mutants in a more natural neuronal environment, C-terminally tagged NR1â4-GFP chimeras were also expressed in DRG explant cultures of sensory neurons following biolistic delivery of expression vectors. Similar to the distribution profiles exhibited in PC12 cells, NR1C0C2â²GFP and NR1C0GFP formed discrete, receptor-rich clusters throughout cell bodies (Fig.4, A and B) and neurites (Fig. 4, Aâ² and Bâ²). This distribution was also very similar to the pattern of endogenously stained NMDAR in the DRG (Fig. 4D). In comparison to NR1C0C2â²GFP and NR1C0GFP, NR1C2â²GFP typically displayed greatly reduced numbers of clusters in the cell body and in the neurites of DRG neurons (Fig. 4,C and Câ²). This pattern resembled that found in PC12 cells although the reduced clustering observed with NR1C2â²GFP appeared to be more dramatic. Finally, like in PC12 cells, the NGFP chimera that lacked both C0 and C2â² cassettes was distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm with no obvious receptor clustering and was absent in neurites (Fig. 4E). Together the results from expression in PC12 cells and DRG suggest that the C0 domain is important in NR1â4 cluster formation. Those fusion proteins that lack the C0 domain display a greatly reduced ability to form clusters. Distributions of each chimera in heterologous cells such as HEK293 (see Fig. 6C), COS7, and RK13 cells (not shown) were similar to those observed in PC12 cells and DRG neurons.Figure 6Cell surface biotinylation of HEK293 cells expressing NR1â4-GFP chimeras. HEK293 cells were transfected with NR1â4-GFP chimeras, with or without NR2D cotransfection, and then incubated in PBS containing sulfo-NHS-Biotin, 48 h post-transfection, to label all cell surface protein. Cells were washed and harvested, and 100 Î¼g of total cell protein was incubated with ultralink streptavidin beads to precipitate biotinylated surface protein. Protein was precipitated serially, indicated by lanes 1 and 2 (A). For each chimera, electrophoresis and immunoblotting were carried out using all of the streptavidin-precipitated surface protein fraction and 20% of the intracellular protein fraction.

The full-length HANR1C0C2â²GFP was localized at the cell surface in both PC12 cells (Fig. 5, AâC) and COS7 cells (not shown). Removal of C2â² (HANR1C0GFP, Fig. 5,DâF), C0 (HANR1C2â²GFP, Fig. 5,GâI), or both (HANGFP, Fig. 5, JâL) had no influence on detection of these chimeras at the cell surface. Each chimera also displayed anti-HA immunoreactivity in neurites of differentiated PC12 cells (not shown). Similar results using the mAb 54.1 to the extracellular loop between TM3 and 4 of NR1 were obtained with the similar chimeras lacking the HA epitope tag. The microscopic observations of cell surface expression of NR1â4-GFP chimeras were confirmed by cell surface biotinylation of transfected HEK293 cells, followed by surface protein isolation with immobilized streptavidin. Surface and intracellular pools were then immunoblotted using anti-NR1 antibody (Fig.6A). To determine whether an NR2 subunit was necessary for this localization at the membrane surface, the biotinylation experiment was performed in the presence or absence of NR2D or NR2A. The chimeras were found on the membrane fraction equally well in the presence or absence of coexpressed NR2D (Fig. 6A) or NR2A (data not shown). In agreement with cell surface labeling by anti-HA antibody, each NR1â4 chimera, regardless of C-terminal deletion, was d"
https://openalex.org/W1998607580,"Replication protein A (RPA) is a heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA-binding protein that participates in multiple DNA transactions that include replication and repair. Base excision repair is a central DNA repair pathway, responsible for the removal of damaged bases. We have shown previously that RPA was able to stimulate long patch base excision repair reconstituted in vitro. Herein we show that human RPA stimulates the activity of the base excision repair component human DNA ligase I by approximately 15-fold. Other analyzed single-stranded binding proteins would not substitute, attesting to the specificity of the stimulation. Conversely, RPA was unable to stimulate the functionally homologous ATP-dependent ligase from T4 bacteriophage. Kinetic analyses suggest that catalysis of ligation is enhanced by RPA, as a 4-fold increase in kcat is observed, whereasKm is not significantly changed. Substrate competition experiments further support the conclusion that RPA does not alter the specificity or rate of substrate binding by DNA ligase I. Additionally, RPA is unable to significantly enhance ligation on substrates containing an unannealed 3â²-upstream primer terminus, suggesting that RPA does not stabilize the nick site to enhance ligase recognition. Furthermore when DNA ligase I is pre-bound to the substrate and limited to a single turnover, RPA is still able to stimulate ligation. Overall, the results support a mechanism of stimulation that involves increasing the rate of catalysis of ligation."

Research over the past 50 years has led to the conclusion that felinine must be synthesized in the kidney, as free felinine is not present in the blood or tissues of cats. We propose that felinine is present in the blood as Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine, a glutathione conjugate. To test our hypothesis [35S]cysteine was administered intraperitoneally to one entire male cat, and two radiolabeled fractions were isolated from the blood. We showed that the amounts of both fractions in serum were linked to the gender of the cat, with entire males expressing significantly higher levels compared with castrated males, entire females, or spayed females. Both fractions were characterized using amino acid analysis with one fraction (S18), containing an equimolar ratio of Cys, Glu, and Gly, while fraction S16 was found to contain Cys, plus free amino acids. Nanospray mass spectrometry confirmed the sequence of fraction S18 as being Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine and conclusively proving that felinine is present in the blood of cats as part of a larger molecule, thereby questioning the current theory that felinine is synthesized in the kidney.

In the domestic cat (Felis catus), the entire male has been found to produce the greatest amount of urinary felinine (122 Î¼mol/kg/day compared with 41, 36, and 20 Î¼mol/kg/day in castrated males, entire females, and castrated females, respectively (1Hendriks W.H. Tarttelin M.F. Moughan P.J. Physiol. Behav. 1995; 58: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The biological role of felinine in the cat remains unknown, but it has been postulated that it may be a precursor to a pheromone (2MacDonald M.L. Rogers Q.R. Morris J.G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1984; 4: 521-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Since its discovery in 1951, many workers have attempted to detect felinine in various tissues and body fluids of the cat. Both Westall (3Westall R.G. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Datta and Harris (4Datta S.P. Harris H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1951; 114: 39P-41PGoogle Scholar) failed to detect the presence of free felinine in the plasma of cats. Tallan et al. (5Tallan H.H. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) detected trace amounts of felinine in the plasma and in a bladder tissue extract but none in the kidney, liver, or brain. Roberts (6Roberts R.N. A Study of Felinine and Its Excretion by the Cat. State University of New York, Buffalo, NY1963Google Scholar) found trace amounts of felinine in the kidney, liver, and skin. The general failure to detect felinine in tissues of the cat has led to the conclusion that the kidney is the likely site of felinine synthesis. Using more sensitive methods for detecting felinine, Hendriks et al. (7Hendriks W.H. Rutherfurd S.M. Rutherfurd K.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 129: 211-216Google Scholar) reported that felinine was detectable in the kidney, urine, and bladder of the domestic cat, but that felinine could not be found in the liver, skin, blood, intestines, pancreas, or the spleen.There is convincing evidence that felinine is synthesized from the same isoprenoid pool as cholesterol (8Hendriks W.H. Woolhouse A.D. Tarttelin M.F. Moughan P.J. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 89-100Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The formation of felinine in vivo can occur through a condensation reaction of an allylic carbonium ion and cysteine. In a previous study we have shown that radioactivity from [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine is incorporated into felinine (7Hendriks W.H. Rutherfurd S.M. Rutherfurd K.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 129: 211-216Google Scholar), whiledl-[2-14C]leucine,dl-[2-14C]mevalonic acid, and [2-14C]acetate have been shown to be incorporated into felinine by Avizonis and Wriston (9Avizonis P.V. Wriston J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), Shapiro (10Shapiro I.L. In Vivo Studies on the Metabolic Relationship between Felinine and Serum Cholesterol in the Domestic Cat. University of Delaware, Newark, DE1962Google Scholar), and Wang (11Wang T.M. Further Studies on the Biosynthesis of Felinine. University of Delaware, Delaware, Newark, DE1964Google Scholar).A proposed metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of felinine in the domestic cat describes felinine being formed from isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP)1 and cysteine, possibly in the liver (10Shapiro I.L. In Vivo Studies on the Metabolic Relationship between Felinine and Serum Cholesterol in the Domestic Cat. University of Delaware, Newark, DE1962Google Scholar, 11Wang T.M.

Clauss E. Decker P. SchoÌberl A. Dtsch. Tieraerztl. Wochenschr. 1967; 74: 532-535PubMed Google Scholar). We propose felinine arises from a conjugation reaction between the cysteine in glutathione (GSH) and IPP to form the tripeptide Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine, rather than free felinine being formed from free cysteine and IPP. This mechanism would be similar to that described for the formation of isovalthine, another unusual sulfur amino acid that has been isolated from the urine of domestic cats, lions, and humans suffering from hypothyroidism and hypercholesterolemia (14Mizuhara S. Oomori S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 92: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Isovalthine has been shown to be formedin vitro as part of a glutathione-isovaleric acid conjugate (15Kuwaki T. Ohmori S. Mizuhara S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 78: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the case of the Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine conjugate, following formation in tissues such as the liver the peptide could then be transported via the blood to the kidney, where free felinine could be liberated by the actions of Î³-glutamyltransferase and aminopeptidase M and then be excreted in the urine. Our hypothesis would explain the absence of free felinine in the blood of domestic cats.The aim of this study was to determine whether a felinine-containing peptide is present in the blood of the domestic cat, and if so, to determine the structure of the peptide.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe studies reported here were approved by and conformed to the requirements of the Massey University Animal Ethics Committee (16Anonymous Code of Ethical Conduct for the Use of Live Animals for Teaching and Research.Revised Ed. Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand1992Google Scholar).Animals and DietDomestic short-haired cats (F. catus), 4â7 years old from the Feline Unit at Massey University (Palmerston North, New Zealand) were used as experimental animals. The body weights of the cats at the start of the experiment ranged from 3.52 to 4.11 kg. Throughout the study, the cats were fed a moist canned cat food that passed a minimum feeding protocol for proving an adult maintenance claim for a cat food (17Association of American Feed Control Officials Inc. Official Publication of the Association of American Feed Control Officials Inc. 2000. Atlanta, GA.Google Scholar). The diet provided the following nutrients (g/100 g dry matter): crude protein, 52; crude fat, 29; methionine, 1.2; cysteine, 1.8; taurine, 0.2; and calculated metabolisable energy of 461 kcal/100 g of dry matter. All cats had been vaccinated against feline rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia using a modified live vaccine (Felocell CVR, Norden Laboratories, MuÌnchen, Germany). Feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus have not been detected in the colony since its establishment in 1976.Preparation of Cat Serum for Reversed-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) AnalysisApproximately 1â5 ml of blood was collected into a plain tube (Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson). The blood was allowed to clot for 2 h, before being centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min for the collection of the serum. The serum was then ultrafiltered through a Vivaspin Concentrator (5000 molecular weight cutoff) (Vivascience Ltd., Lincoln, UK) by centrifugation at 7,500 rpm for 30 min. The ultrafiltrate was used for further analysis by HPLC and the retentate discarded.Analysis and Separation of Peptides by HPLCPeptides present in the ultrafiltered serum were separated by reversed-phase HPLC performed on a Phenomenex Luna 5-Î¼m column (4.6 Ã 150 mm), using a Waters HPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). A linear 75-min gradient was run, from 100% solvent I (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to 100% solvent II (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile), which commenced 15 min after sample injection. Peptides were detected by absorbance at 214 nm and were manually collected, as required. Where applicable, peaks were integrated using Millennium 32Â® Chromatography Manager software (Waters Corporation).Quantitation of 35S RadioactivityRadioactivity present in the [35S]cysteine injection solution, serum samples, and fractions collected from reversed-phase HPLC were determined as described by Hendriks et al. (7Hendriks W.H. Rutherfurd S.M. Rutherfurd K.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 129: 211-216Google Scholar).Amino Acid AnalysisThe amino acid content of the isolated peptides was determined on duplicate samples using a Waters ion-exchange HPLC system (Waters Corporation), utilizing post-column ninhydrin derivatization and detection at 570 and 440 nm, following hydrolysis in 6 m glass-distilled HCl containing 0.1% phenol for 24 h at 110 Â± 2 Â°C in evacuated sealed tubes. Cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan are partially or completely destroyed during the acid hydrolysis stage using this method.Mass Spectral AnalysisThe mass spectral analyses were performed at the Division of Immunology, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope (Duarte, CA), using electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode on a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca iontrap mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was based on collision-induced dissociation (CID). The sample, dissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile:water and 2% acetic acid, was introduced into the mass spectrometer via a nanospray needle assembly.Experiment 1One entire male cat (3.8 kg) was administered 1.85 ml of sterile isotonic (9 g/liter) saline containing 250 Î¼Ci (9.25 MBq) of [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) by intraperitoneal injection. The cat was individually housed in a metabolism cage with free access to food and fresh water during the experimental period. At times 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h a 1-ml blood sample was taken by jugular vein puncture, under anesthetic (isoflurane). Serum was separated from each blood sample and ultrafiltered prior to separation by HPLC as described previously. All the major peaks present in the chromatogram of each ultrafiltered serum sample, and the base-line regions between peaks, were manually collected into preweighed tubes, after which the tubes were reweighed to determine the quantity of fluid collected prior to measurement of radioactivity.Experiment 2Blood samples were taken from cats of different gender by jugular vein puncture. Serum was separated from each blood sample and ultrafiltered prior to separation and quantitation of peaks S16 and S18, by HPLC as described previously.Experiment 3Following an appropriate âcool downâ period, blood from the cat used in Experiment 1 was obtained. Fractions S16 and S18 were isolated from ultrafiltered serum as described previously and used for characterization studies.DISCUSSIONThis study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of [35S]cysteine to an entire male cat results in the incorporation of the 35S moiety into material found in three serum peaks separated by reversed-phase HPLC: the injection peak, S16, and S18. The injection peak was not characterized, but this is most likely composed of sulfate. Results from an experiment investigating S16 and S18 peaks in cats of different gender showed that although the amounts of material eluting under these peaks were gender-dependent, the level of S18 was more strongly linked to the gender of the cat, with entire male cats expressing 7â22 times more S18 material than cats of other gender. Results from the amino acid analysis of S18 showed the presence of Glu, Gly, and Cys, in a stoichiometry of â¼1:1:1. The knowledge that felinine breaks down under conditions of normal acid hydrolysis and potentially could give rise to Cys, due to the loss of the 2-methyl butanol group, along with the fact that peak S18 did not co-elute with either GSH or GSSG, suggested that this peak was not glutathione. This information taken together with the clear linkage between the level of expression of S18 and the gender of the cat strongly indicated that S18 was more likely to contain a felinine containing peptide than S16. It was also noted that S18, when reconstituted following freeze-drying, emitted a catty odor typical of stored felinine-containing samples. 2K. J. Rutherfurd and S. M. Rutherfurd, unpublished observation. S18, and not S16, was therefore further characterized by mass spectral analysis and amino acid sequencing.It is more likely that felinine is produced as the result of a glutathione conjugation reaction rather than de novosynthesis of the tripeptide, as no free felinine can be detected in any tissues or blood of the cat (7Hendriks W.H. Rutherfurd S.M. Rutherfurd K.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 129: 211-216Google Scholar). Consequently, the 35S label present in the felinine-containing peptide must originate from35S-GSH. However we did not detect any 35S-GSH in the serum of the cat. This is not altogether unexpected, since first, although the level of GSH in the blood of most species is in the order of 1.3 mm or lower (20Griffith O.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis, VIII. 3rd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1983: 521-529Google Scholar), most is confined to the erythrocytes, with the plasma only containing between 1 and 30 Î¼m GSH (21Sies H. Sakamoto Y. Higashi T. Tateishi N. Glutathione: Storage, Transport and Turnover in Mammals. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo/VNU Science Press, Utrecht, The Netherlands1983: 63-88Google Scholar). Second, the apparent level of GSH in most tissues and physiological fluids can alter rapidly post mortem or post-collection. In particular plasma GSH levels can drop rapidly after collection; in fact mouse plasma has a tÂ½ for GSH of around 10 min (20Griffith O.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis, VIII. 3rd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1983: 521-529Google Scholar). Therefore it is unlikely, under the conditions used here, that the GSH present in the cat serum at the time of analysis would have been detectable.Collision-induced dissociation of MH+ parent ion species has been found to be a very effective means of determining the structures of glutathione conjugates. CID has been found to specifically favor the rupture of peptide bonds in glutathione conjugates, in particular the Î³-glutamyl linkage (19Bailee T.A. Davis M.R. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In fact MS/MS has been employed as a screening process for the detection of unknown glutathione conjugates by either searching for species that differ in molecular weight by 129, the result of the loss of the Î³-Glu, or scanning for a molecular ion of 308, which indicates those MH+ ions that fragment to give protonated GSH (19Bailee T.A. Davis M.R. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The fragmentation pathway of S18 seen in our work is typical of that seen with other glutathione conjugates following MS/MS (19Bailee T.A. Davis M.R. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Zhu M. DeCaprio A.P. Hauer C.R. Spink D.C. J. Chromatogr. 1997; 688: 187-196Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Sequencing of S18 by mass spectrometry clearly indicates that the sequence of the peptide is Glu-felinine-Gly, and the high relative abundance of them/z 265 species is indicative that the residue removed is most likely a Î³-Glu. Therefore based on the mass spectrometry data, the sequence of the felinine-containing peptide isolated from cat serum is Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine (Fig.4).The biological role of GSH in protecting cells against chemically reactive and cytotoxic agents is well known. This protective function is due to the presence of the nucleophilic sulfhydryl group through which glutathione is able to form conjugates with reactive compounds. The conjugates may then be excreted into the bile or eliminated via the mercapturic acid pathway into the urine. The formation of GSH conjugates has been shown to be mediated either by specific GSH transferases in the liver or to be nonenzymatic in nature (23Mutlib A.E. Shockcor J. Espina R. Graciani N. Du A. Gan L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 735-745PubMed Google Scholar).In the case of the formation of Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine, both of the substrates, GSH and IPP, are naturally found in all mammals; therefore, if the reaction was nonenzymatic in nature then felinine could be expected in the urine of species other than the Felidae. It is therefore most likely that an enzyme specific to selected cat species and under hormonal control is responsible for the formation of Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine. The liver is a prime candidate for the site of Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine synthesis because of its high metabolic capacity as well as being a major site of cholesterol synthesis and also the largest supplier of glutathione in the body. The Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine would then be transported from the liver via the blood stream to the kidney where the enzymes responsible for the degradation of GSH, Î³-glutamyltransferase and aminopeptidase M, could degrade the Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine into its constituent amino acids. The Glu and Gly could be recycled, and the felinine would be excreted in the urine. As free felinine would not be present in any organs or the blood, this would explain the observations by several researchers that free felinine has only been found to any great extent in the urine of cats, and trace amounts in the kidney, where we propose felinine is liberated from the Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine peptide, and in the bladder, where contamination from the urine is clearly possible. However, this hypothesis remains to be proven.It can be calculated from the average glomerular filtration rate (2.94 ml/min/kg), the renal blood flow (10.61 ml/min/kg), and the 24-h excretion rate of felinine by entire male cats (1Hendriks W.H. Tarttelin M.F. Moughan P.J. Physiol. Behav. 1995; 58: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Ross L.A. Finco D.R. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1981; 42: 1704-1710PubMed Google Scholar) that the minimum concentration of the felinine-containing peptide in the blood of entire male cats, assuming 100% clearance efficiency by the kidneys, is 41.5 nmol/ml. The concentration of tripeptide in the blood of the entire male cats in the present study was determined to be 80.6 nmol/ml (TableI). The latter value is in the same order of magnitude and sufficient to account for the levels of felinine found in the urine of entire male cats.It is unlikely that the biological reason for the formation of Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine in cats is one of cell protection by the conjugation of potentially damaging agents given that all mammals contain the substrates required for Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine synthesis. The fact that the levels of both felinine and Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine produced by cats are so clearly gender-linked, along with the fact that females or castrated males can be induced to produce felinine following testosterone injections (25Tarttelin M.F. Hendriks W.H. Moughan P.J. Physiol. Behav. 1998; 65: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), adds further weight to the suggestion that the biological role of felinine is as a precursor to a pheromone.We have conclusively shown that contrary to all other reports, felinine can be found in the blood of cats albeit as part of a larger molecule. This discovery raises major questions regarding the validity of the current theory, which has prevailed for the past 50 years, that felinine is synthesized in the kidney and provides for the possibility that felinine may be synthesized in tissues other than the kidney. Felinine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that has been found in the urine of certain members of Felidae. In the domestic cat (Felis catus), the entire male has been found to produce the greatest amount of urinary felinine (122 Î¼mol/kg/day compared with 41, 36, and 20 Î¼mol/kg/day in castrated males, entire females, and castrated females, respectively (1Hendriks W.H. Tarttelin M.F. Moughan P.J. Physiol. Behav. 1995; 58: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The biological role of felinine in the cat remains unknown, but it has been postulated that it may be a precursor to a pheromone (2MacDonald M.L. Rogers Q.R. Morris J.G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1984; 4: 521-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Since its discovery in 1951, many workers have attempted to detect felinine in various tissues and body fluids of the cat. Both Westall (3Westall R.G. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Datta and Harris (4Datta S.P. Harris H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1951; 114: 39P-41PGoogle Scholar) failed to detect the presence of free felinine in the plasma of cats. Tallan et al. (5Tallan H.H. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) detected trace amounts of felinine in the plasma and in a bladder tissue extract but none in the kidney, liver, or brain. Roberts (6Roberts R.N. A Study of Felinine and Its Excretion by the Cat. State University of New York, Buffalo, NY1963Google Scholar) found trace amounts of felinine in the kidney, liver, and skin. The general failure to detect felinine in tissues of the cat has led to the conclusion that the kidney is the likely site of felinine synthesis. Using more sensitive methods for detecting felinine, Hendriks et al. (7Hendriks W.H. Rutherfurd S.M. Rutherfurd K.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 129: 211-216Google Scholar) reported that felinine was detectable in the kidney, urine, and bladder of the domestic cat, but that felinine could not be found in the liver, skin, blood, intestines, pancreas, or the spleen. There is convincing evidence that felinine is synthesized from the same isoprenoid pool as cholesterol (8Hendriks W.H. Woolhouse A.D. Tarttelin M.F. Moughan P.J. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 89-100Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The formation of felinine in vivo can occur through a condensation reaction of an allylic carbonium ion and cysteine. In a previous study we have shown that radioactivity from [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine is incorporated into felinine (7Hendriks W.H. Rutherfurd S.M. Rutherfurd K.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 129: 211-216Google Scholar), whiledl-[2-14C]leucine,dl-[2-14C]mevalonic acid, and [2-14C]acetate have been shown to be incorporated into felinine by Avizonis and Wriston (9Avizonis P.V. Wriston J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), Shapiro (10Shapiro I.L. In Vivo Studies on the Metabolic Relationship between Felinine and Serum Cholesterol in the Domestic Cat. University of Delaware, Newark, DE1962Google Scholar), and Wang (11Wang T.M. Further Studies on the Biosynthesis of Felinine. University of Delaware, Delaware, Newark, DE1964Google Scholar). A proposed metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of felinine in the domestic cat describes felinine being formed from isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP)1 and cysteine, possibly in the liver (10Shapiro I.L. In Vivo Studies on the Metabolic Relationship between Felinine and Serum Cholesterol in the Domestic Cat. University of Delaware, Newark, DE1962Google Scholar, 11Wang T.M. Further Studies on the Biosynthesis of Felinine. University of Delaware, Delaware, Newark, DE1964Google Scholar, 12Eggerer H. Liebigs Ann..Chem. 1962; 657: 212-218Google Scholar, 13Borchers J. Clauss E. Decker P. SchoÌberl A. Dtsch. Tieraerztl. Wochenschr. 1967; 74: 532-535PubMed Google Scholar). We propose felinine arises from a conjugation reaction between the cysteine in glutathione (GSH) and IPP to form the tripeptide Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine, rather than free felinine being formed from free cysteine and IPP. This mechanism would be similar to that described for the formation of isovalthine, another unusual sulfur amino acid that has been isolated from the urine of domestic cats, lions, and humans suffering from hypothyroidism and hypercholesterolemia (14Mizuhara S. Oomori S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 92: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Isovalthine has been shown to be formedin vitro as part of a glutathione-isovaleric acid conjugate (15Kuwaki T. Ohmori S. Mizuhara S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 78: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the case of the Î³-glutamylfelinylglycine conjugate, following formation in tissues such as the liver the peptide could then be transported via the blood to the kidney, where free felinine could be liberated by the actions of Î³-glutamyltransferase and aminopeptidase M and then be excreted in the urine. Our hypothesis would explain the absence of free felinine in the blood of domestic cats. The aim of this study was to determine whether a felinine-containing peptide is present in the blood of the domestic cat, and if so, to determine the structure of the peptide. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe studies reported here were approved by and conformed to the requirements of the Massey University Animal Ethics Committee (16Anonymous Code of Ethical Conduct for the Use of Live Animals for Teaching and Research.Revised Ed. Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand1992Google Scholar).Animals and DietDomestic short-haired cats (F. catus), 4â7 years old from the Feline Unit at Massey University (Palmerston North, New Zealand) were used as experimental animals. The body weights of the cats at the start of the experiment ranged from 3.52 to 4.11 kg. Throughout the study, the cats were fed a moist canned cat food that passed a minimum feeding protocol for proving an adult maintenance claim for a cat food (17Association of American Feed Control Officials Inc. Official Publication of the Association of American Feed Control Officials Inc. 2000. Atlanta, GA.Google Scholar). The diet provided the following nutrients (g/100 g dry matter): crude protein, 52; crude fat, 29; methionine, 1.2; cysteine, 1.8; taurine, 0.2; and calculated metabolisable energy of 461 kcal/100 g of dry matter. All cats had been vaccinated against feline rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia using a modified live vaccine (Felocell CVR, Norden Laboratories, MuÌnchen, Germany). Feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus have not been detected in the colony since its establishment in 1976.Preparation of Cat Serum for Reversed-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) AnalysisApproximately 1â5 ml of blood was collected into a plain tube (Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson). The blood was allowed to clot for 2 h, before being centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min for the collection of the serum. The serum was then ultrafiltered through a Vivaspin Concentrator (5000 molecular weight cutoff) (Vivascience Ltd., Lincoln, UK) by centrifugation at 7,500 rpm for 30 min. The ultrafiltrate was used for further analysis by HPLC and the retentate discarded.Analysis and Separation of Peptides by HPLCPeptides present in the ultrafiltered serum were separated by reversed-phase HPLC performed on a Phenomenex Luna 5-Î¼m column (4.6 Ã 150 mm), using a Waters HPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). A linear 75-min gradient was run, from 100% solvent I (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to 100% solvent II (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile), which commenced 15 min after sample injection. Peptides were detected by absorbance at 214 nm and were manually"

We examined the ability of SKF-82958 (SKF), a previously characterized full dopamine D1 receptor agonist, to stimulate the transcriptional activity of ERÎ± and ERÎ². Treatment of HeLa cells with SKF-82958 stimulated robust ERÎ±-dependent transcription from an estrogen-response element-E1b-CAT reporter in the absence of estrogen, and this was accompanied by increased receptor phosphorylation. However, induction of ERÎ²-directed gene expression under the same conditions was negligible. In our cell model, SKF treatment did not elevate cAMP levels nor enhance transcription from a cAMP-response element-linked reporter. Control studies revealed that SKF-82958, but not dopamine, competes with 17Î²-estradiol for binding to ERÎ± or ERÎ² with comparable relative binding affinities. Therefore, SKF-82958 is an ERÎ±-selective agonist. Transcriptional activation of ERÎ± by SKF was more potent than expected from its relative binding activity, and further examination revealed that this synthetic compound induced expression of an AP-1 target gene in a tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response element (TRE)-dependent manner. A putative TRE site upstream of the estrogen-response element and the amino-terminal domain of the receptor contributed to, but were not required for, SKF-induced expression of an ERÎ±-dependent reporter gene. Overexpression of the AP-1 protein c-Jun, but not c-Fos, strongly enhanced SKF-induced ERÎ± target gene expression but only when the TRE was present. These studies provide information on the ability of a ligand that weakly stimulates ERÎ± to yield strong stimulation of ERÎ±-dependent gene expression through cross-talk with other intracellular signaling pathways producing a robust combinatorial response within the cell.

Both are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. The mechanisms by which ERs activate target gene expression in response to estrogen signaling have been the subject of intense investigation since their respective cDNAs were cloned (1Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A. Bornert J.M. Argos P. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 320: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar, 2Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4200) Google Scholar). Because of the relatively recent identification of ERÎ², the bulk of our knowledge regarding the genomic effects of estrogens is derived from ERÎ± studies. For instance, upon binding to 17Î²-estradiol (E2), ERÎ± undergoes a series of biochemical alterations including increased phosphorylation and conformational changes as well as homodimerization and binding of the receptor to its target DNA sequence, the estrogen-response element (ERE; see Refs. 3Kushner P.J.

ERÎ² also undergoes conformational changes in response to ligand binding (6Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Gron H. Norris J.D. Gottlin E.B. Padilla K.M. Chang C.-Y. Ballas L.M. Hamilton P.T.

Ljunggren J. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar) and is phosphorylated in vivo (8Tremblay A. GigueÌre V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). With respect to DNA binding, ERÎ² binds to the same consensus ERE that ERÎ± does, although the latter receptor has an â¼4-fold higher affinity for this DNA sequence in comparison to ERÎ² (9Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19858-19862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 10Pace P. Taylor J. Suntharalingam S. Coombes R.C. Ali S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25832-25838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Whereas many aspects of the regulation of ERÎ± and ERÎ² transcriptional activity are quite similar (e.g. both bind to EREs and activate transcription in response to E2binding), a number of differences between these receptors have been noted. For instance, on ERE-containing reporters, ligands such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen exert partial agonist activity on ERÎ± but act as ERÎ² antagonists (11Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is likely related to differences in the poorly conserved structure and function of the hormone-independent activation function-1 (AF-1) domain that is located in the amino termini of these receptors (11Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Delaunay F. Pettersson K. Tujague M. Gustafsson J.-â«. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Cowley S.M. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal AF-2 domain is hormone-dependent, reflecting the ability of agonists to bind to the ligand binding domain of the receptor and induce a conformational change that creates a binding site for coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and its related family members (14Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar, 15McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, this domain is only â¼60% conserved between ERÎ± and ERÎ², and small differences in the affinity of these two receptors for ligands such as genistein and 16Î±-bromo-17Î²-estradiol have been demonstrated (16Kuiper G.G.

Although several contexts exist whereby the transcriptional activity of ERÎ± is derived predominantly from the AF-1 or AF-2 domains, in most cells the two activation functions work together to bring about a synergistic activation of transcription (18Tora L.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In contrast, the amino terminus of ERÎ² possesses relatively low transcriptional activity in comparison to ERÎ±, and this region has been shown to repress the activity of the AF-2 domain of ERÎ² (11Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Delaunay F. Pettersson K. Tujague M. Gustafsson J.-â«. Mol.

Estrogen receptors, in addition to their regulation by ligands, can also be activated by extracellular agents that initiate intracellular signal transduction pathways (reviewed in Ref. 21Weigel N.L. Zhang Y. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 76: 469-479Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For instance, epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 treatment of cells results in initiation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction cascade leading to phosphorylation of the Ser118 phosphorylation site of ERÎ± and stimulation of ERÎ± transcriptional activity (22Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P.

Similarly, activation of MAPKs by either epidermal growth factor treatment or by transfection of a dominant active form of Ras induces ERÎ² phosphorylation and transcriptional activity (8Tremblay A.

Labrie F. GigueÌre V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition to growth factors, insulin, heregulin, 3,3â²-diindolylmethane, and the neurotransmitter dopamine can also stimulate ERÎ± transcriptional activity in the apparent absence of ligand (27Riby J.E.

Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The latter was among the first agents demonstrated to stimulate ERÎ± transcriptional activity in a ligand-independent manner (31Power R.F. Mani S.K. Codina J. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). There is no information on the ability of dopamine to stimulate ERÎ² transcriptional activity. However, dopaminergic activation is not unique to ERÎ±, because this neurotransmitter also activates the human vitamin D (but not glucocorticoid) and chicken progesterone receptors (31Power R.F. Mani S.K. Codina J. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 32Matkovits T. Christakos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo studies have demonstrated that dopamine receptor agonists administered to the third ventricle of the brain lead to initiation of lordosis behavior, a progesterone receptor (PR)-dependent biological response in rodents (33Apostolakis E.M.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Dopamine receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, and five genes encoding the D1âD5 subtypes of dopamine receptor have been identified (36Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). Studies with subtype-specific synthetic dopamine receptor agonists indicate that it is the D1 and/or D5 dopamine receptors that stimulate steroid receptor transcriptional activity (33Apostolakis E.M.

Biol. 1997; 61: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and this is associated with D1 and D5 dopamine receptor stimulation of intracellular cAMP production (36Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the dopaminergic cell signaling pathway communicates with ERÎ± are not well defined, but it is presumed that increased ERÎ± phosphorylation contributes to this process. In this regard, it is interesting to note that cAMP signaling pathways stimulate ERÎ± transcriptional activity and phosphorylation (38Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 39LeGoff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chicken PR is also ligand-independently activated by treatment of cells with dopamine or agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels (31Power R.F. Mani S.K. Codina J. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 40Denner L.A. Weigel N.L. Maxwell B.L. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1990; 250: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, cAMP activation of PR-dependent transcription is not accompanied by increased receptor phosphorylation but rather by an increase in the phosphorylation of the SRC-1 coactivator with which the receptor interacts to stimulate gene expression (41Bai W. Rowan B.G. Allgood V.E. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10457-10463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Rowan B.G. Garrison N. Weigel N.L.

Taken together, the data support a model in which dopamine and cAMP signaling pathways stimulate gene expression in a receptor-specific manner. Alterations in the biology of dopamine and its receptors play an important role in a number of human diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, as well as contribute to the reward seeking behaviors associated with cocaine abuse (43Kuhar M.J. Ritz M.C. Boja J.W. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 299-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 44Katz J.L. Kopajtic T.A. Myers K.A. Mitkus R.J. Chider M. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The molecular mechanisms of dopamine and dopamine receptor action have therefore been extensively studied, and these efforts have been aided by the identification of high affinity and potent ligands for dopamine receptors. One such compound, SKF-82958 (SKF), is a full dopamine D1 subtype-selective receptor agonist with greater potency than dopamine (46O'Boyle K.M. Gaitanopoulos D.E. Brenner M. Waddington J.L. Neuropharmacology. 1989; 28: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 47Murray A.M. Waddington J.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 160: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). SKF has also been shown to stimulate the transcriptional activity of ERÎ± in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (27Riby J.E. Chang G.H.F. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37Gangolli E.A. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 61: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore used SKF-82958 to determine the ability of dopaminergic signaling pathways to regulate ERÎ² transcriptional activity. We observed that this D1 receptor-selective agonist stimulated the transcriptional activity of ERÎ± but had negligible agonist activity for ERÎ². We also found that SKF-82958 stimulates phosphorylation of ERÎ± to an extent similar to that observed for E2. However, SKF-82958 competed with E2 for binding to the receptor, suggesting that it exerts at least some of its effects on ERÎ± transcriptional activity as an ERÎ± agonist. Stimulation of ERÎ± transactivation was greater than that anticipated from its relative binding affinity for ERÎ±, and we therefore examined the ability of SKF-82958 to stimulate intracellular signal transduction pathways. Whereas SKF-82958 did not increase cAMP production, it did stimulate pathways leading to activation of AP-1, a transcription factor known to functionally interact with many steroid receptors (3Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Scanlan T.S. Shiau A.K. Uht R.M. Webb P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), and we therefore examined the contribution of AP-1 to SKF-induced ERÎ± transcriptional activity. These studies provide novel information on the ability of a compound to stimulate simultaneously the activity of two transcription factors and in so doing produce robust stimulation of gene expression through a combinatorial response within the cell. E2, tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and poly-l-lysine were obtained from Sigma. The anti-estrogens, ICI 182,780 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were gifts from Alan Wakeling (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK) and D. Salin-Drouin (Laboratoires Besins Iscovesco, Paris, France), respectively. 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) were purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA) as were dopamine and the synthetic D1 receptor agonist, SKF-82958. All other chemicals were reagent grade. The mammalian expression vectors for wild type human ERÎ± (pCMV5-hERÎ±) and its corresponding phosphorylation mutants (S104A/S106A/S118A, S118A and S167A) have been described previously (39LeGoff P.

Thep-169Î±CG-CAT and p-100Î±CG-CAT reporter genes contain portions of the chorionic gonadotropin gene, with or without a cAMP-response element (CRE), respectively, upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (56Kurten R.C. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1345-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thecoll73-CAT reporter and the coll60-CAT reporters contain portions of the collagenase gene upstream of CAT differing in the inclusion or exclusion of a TRE, respectively (57Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An expression vector for Î²-galactosidase, pCMVÎ², was obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The mammalian expression vector for FLAG-hERÎ± was constructed as follows. The yeast expression vector for human ERÎ±, YEPE2 (58Pham T.A. Elliston J.F. Nawaz Z. McDonnell D.P. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3125-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), was digested with TthIII, blunted, and subsequently digested with KpnI. The resulting fragment was cloned into theBamHI (blunted) and KpnI sites of pSelect-1 (Promega). The ER cDNA was removed from the resulting vector withKpnI and SalI restriction enzyme digestion and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pJ3Î© (59Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 181068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), to create pJ3-hERVal400. The amino-terminal FLAG epitope was created by utilizing a PCR approach. Briefly, a 5â² primer (5â²-GGGGTCGACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGATGACCATGACCCTCCAC) encoding a methionine residue linked to the FLAG epitope sequence (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) and the first six amino acids of human ERÎ± and a 3â² primer (5â²-GCGCTTGTGTTTCAACATTCTCC) corresponding to nucleotides 1017â1039 were used to amplify an 844-base pair nucleotide fragment of the ERÎ± cDNA using pSVMTwt:ER as template (30Smith C.L. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6120-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was digested with SalI andNotI and substituted for the SalI-NotI fragment of pJ3-hERVal400 to create pJ3-FLAG-hERÎ±Val400. To replace Val400 with cDNA encoding the wild type amino acid (Gly400), the NotI-SacI fragment of pSVMTwt:ER (corresponding to amino acids 65 to 595) was substituted for the corresponding region of pJ3-FLAG-hERÎ±Val400 to create pJ3-FLAG-hERÎ±. Reporter genes lacking the putative TRE were generated from the parentERE-E1b-CAT plasmid by deletion or site-directed mutagenesis. In the former case, a 195-bp fragment ofERE-E1b-CAT was removed by digestion with NdeI and Eco0109I. The resulting vector was blunt-ended with Klenow and religated to yieldERE-E1b-CAT(ÎNde-Eco). To remove the putative TRE sequence by site-directed mutagenesis, theSspI-HindIII fragment of ERE-E1b-CATwas subcloned into pALTER-1 (Promega). By using the PCR Site-directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen) and a mutagenic primer, the putative TRE sequence, TGACACA, was mutated to GGACTCA following the manufacturer's recommendations. The latter sequence had been demonstrated previously to prevent AP-1 binding (60Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat G. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Following sequencing to verify appropriate nucleotide substitutions, aNdeI-Eco0109I fragment was removed from pALTER-1 and substituted for the comparable region of ERE-E1b-CAT to generate ERE-E1b-CAT(mTRE). HeLa cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA transfections were performed by either Lipofectin (Invitrogen) or adenovirus-mediated approaches (61Allgood V.E. Zhang Y. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For transactivation assays, 24 h prior to transfection, 3 Ã 105 HeLa cells were seeded per well of a 6-well multiple dish in phenol red-free DMEM containing 5% dextran-coated, charcoal-stripped serum (sFBS). For Lipofectin transfections, cells were incubated with the indicated DNAs and Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Six hours later, the DNA/Lipofectin mixture was removed, and cells were fed with phenol red-free media containing 5% sFBS and the indicated treatments, and 24 h thereafter the cells were harvested. To prepare reagents for adenovirus-mediated transfections, replication-deficient adenovirus dl312 was propagated and covalently modified with poly-l-lysine by the method of Cristiano et al. (62Cristiano R.J. Smith L.C. Woo S.L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) modified as described previously (61Allgood V.E. Zhang Y. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CsCl-purified fractions of the modified virus were stored at â80 C until use. Adenovirus-DNA complexes were prepared by adding the lysine-modified adenovirus to plasmid DNA and subsequently incubating with a 200-fold molar excess of poly-l-lysine (Mr 18,000â20,000). The adenovirus-DNA-lysine complex was then added to the cells at a virus to cell multiplicity of infection of 500:1. After incubation for 2 h, the medium was replaced with phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% sFBS. Hormones and/or other treatments, as indicated, were added to the cells 4 h later, and the cells were then harvested 24 h thereafter. Assays of reporter gene expression were performed on cell extracts prepared by lysing cells by rapid freeze-thaw or addition of lysis buffer (Promega). CAT activity was measured by a phase-extraction method utilizing [3H]chloramphenicol (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) and butyryl-coenzyme A (Amersham Biosciences) as substrates (30Smith C.L.

https://openalex.org/W2035876094,"Secretion of the HasA hemophore is mediated by a C-terminal secretion signal as part of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) pathway in the Gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens. We reconstituted the HasA secretion pathway in Escherichia coli. In E. coli, this pathway required three specific secretion functions and SecB, the general chaperone of the Sec pathway that recognizes HasA. The secretion of the isolated C-terminal secretion signal was not SecB-dependent. We have previously shown that intracellular folded HasA can no longer be secreted, and we proposed a step in the secretion process before the recognition of the secretion signal. Here we show that the secretion of a fully functional HasA variant, lacking the first 10 N-terminal amino acids, was less efficient than that of HasA and was SecB-independent. The N terminus of HasA was required, along with SecB, for the efficient secretion of the whole protein. We have also previously shown that HasA inhibits the secretion of metalloproteases from Erwinia chrysanthemi by their specific ABC transporter. Here we show that this abortive interaction between HasA and the E. chrysanthemimetalloprotease ABC transporter required both SecB and the N terminus of HasA. N-terminal fragments of HasA displayed this abortive interaction in vivo and also interacted specificallyin vitro with the ABC protein of the Prt system. SecB also interacted specifically in vitro with the ABC protein of the Prt system. Finally, the HasA variant, lacking the first 10 N-terminal amino acids did not display this abortive interaction with the Prt system. We suggest that the N-terminal domain of HasA specifically recognizes the ABC protein in a SecB-dependent fashion, facilitating functional interaction with the C-terminal secretion signal leading to efficient secretion.

In Gram-negative bacteria, proteins that cross the cell envelope are secreted into the extracellular medium via at least four different specific pathways. These pathways can be classified into two groups, according to their dependence upon the Sec pathway. Proteins that follow the Sec pathway have a signal peptide and are secreted in two steps. They are translocated to the periplasm via the Sec machinery; they then cross the outer membrane and are transported to the extracellular medium by a complex multicomponent system. Proteins using the other pathways do not have a signal peptide and are exported from the cytoplasm to the extracellular medium in one step, with no periplasmic intermediate (1Wandersman C. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella tiphymurium Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press Washington, D. C., 1996: 955-967Google Scholar).One of these Sec-independent pathways is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1ABCATP-binding cassetteMBPmaltose-binding proteinPRTprotease secretion apparatus 1ABCATP-binding cassetteMBPmaltose-binding proteinPRTprotease secretion apparatus secretion pathway (2Binet R. Letoffe S. Ghigo J.M. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) also referred to as the type I pathway. This pathway is used for the specific secretion of proteins of many different families, including hydrolytic enzymes, virulence factors, and hemophores. Each of these proteins is secreted via a specific apparatus, usually encoded by a series of genes organized into a single operon.The ABC secretion apparatus forms a complex linking the inner and outer membranes and consists of three proteins: 1) an inner membrane ABC protein that hydrolyzes ATP, 2) a second inner membrane protein, the membrane fusion protein (MFP), which has a large periplasmic domain and, 3) an outer membrane protein (OMP).Proteins secreted by the ABC pathway do not have an N-terminal signal peptide (3Nicaud J.M. Mackman N. Gray L. Holland I.B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Instead, they usually have an uncleaved C-terminal secretion signal located within the last 50 C-terminal amino acids responsible for directing the secretion of the protein (4Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8979-8985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This C-terminal secretion signal is a key component of the ABC secretion pathway. It specifically recognizes the ABC protein, and this interaction is responsible for substrate specificity (5Binet R. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2298-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Delepelaire P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27952-27957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this interaction triggers assembly of the secretion apparatus proteins into a functional complex (7LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5804-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Thanabalu T. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6487-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).The structure of the ABC secretion system imposes specific constraints.Escherichia coli TolC, a component of several protein ABC exporters, was recently studied by crystallography and shown to form a channel across the periplasm (9Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). This channel has an inner diameter of 30 Angstroms. Other structural data for several protein substrates that use the TolC channel for secretion have shown that in their native form these proteins are too large to pass through this channel (10Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Baumann U., Wu, S. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).A second constraint concerns the interaction between the C-terminal secretion signal and the ABC protein. The C-terminal position of the secretion signal implies that the exoprotein must be completely synthesized before the secretion signal can interact with the secretion apparatus. In this case, other pathways, such as complete folding, aggregation, and degradation, may compete with the post-translational secretion pathway.Mechanisms for the regulation of protein folding have been investigated in other pathways of translocation across membranes. Some pathways, such as those responsible for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (12Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), mitochondrial import (13Lill R. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and export across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane via the Sec pathway (14Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), require chaperone proteins such as Hsp70, Hsp40, or SecB. Chaperone proteins are defined by their ability to bind transiently to non-native structures in polypeptide chains. These transient interactions prevent âillegitimateâ protein-protein interactions, thereby controlling the folding of proteins. For example, SecB is required for the translocation of some precursor proteins via the Sec system (15Collier D.N. Bankaitis V.A. Weiss J.B. Bassford P.J., Jr. Cell. 1988; 53: 273-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 16Collier D.N. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1993; 44: 151-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SecB has two different functions in this pathway: an antifolding activity, responsible for keeping precursors in an export competent state, and a targeting activity, responsible for enhancing the interaction between the precursor and the translocon (14Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both signal peptide and SecB bind SecA, the ATPase of the translocation machinery, in a cooperative manner (14Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cunningham K. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8630-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).In our laboratory, we have studied two ABC apparatuses reconstituted inE. coli as models: the Prt secretion system of Erwinia chrysanthemi (19Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. LeÌtoffeÌ S. Schwartz M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5046-5053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Has secretion system of Serratia marcescens (20Letoffe S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9876-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The Prt secretion system is involved in the secretion of E. chrysanthemi metalloproteases. The Has (heme acquisition system) secretion system is responsible for secretion of the HasA hemophore. HasA is a 188-amino acid protein that binds heme in the extracellular medium. This heme-binding protein is secreted byS. marcescens under conditions of iron limitation. It acquires heme directly or from hemoglobin and delivers it to the bacterium via a specific TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor, HasR (21Ghigo J.M. LeÌtoffeÌ S. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3572-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).The protease secretion (Prt) apparatus consists of the proteins PrtD (ABC protein), PrtE, and PrtF (22Letoffe S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Has apparatus consists of HasD (ABC protein), HasE, and HasF, or TolC (23LeÌtoffeÌ S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5372-5377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TolC is the E. coli HasF homolog and complements perfectly the function of HasF in HasA secretion (24Binet R. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Previous studies on these ABC secretion systems have shown that the SecB chaperone is required for secretion of the S. marcescens hemophore, HasA, via its specific (Has) ABC transporter while the secretion of E. chrysanthemi metalloproteases via their specific ABC transporter does not require SecB. A direct interaction between SecB and HasA is responsible for this effect, and a SecB analog is also required in the natural host, S. marcescens (25Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have shown that HasA is no longer secretion competent following accumulation in its native form in the cytoplasm (26Debarbieux L. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, complete folding is not consistent with secretion via the ABC pathway. This raises the question of the conformational state of HasA during the early events of secretion by the ABC pathway. These data also suggest that a co-translational event may initiate secretion and prevent complete folding (26Debarbieux L. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Previous studies have also shown that HasA is not secreted by the heterologous E. chrysanthemi protease secretion apparatus (Prt). However, HasA inhibits the secretion of E. chrysanthemi proteases by their own Prt transporter (23LeÌtoffeÌ S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5372-5377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibition is due to an abortive interaction between HasA and PrtD, theE. chrysanthemi protease-specific ABC protein (5Binet R. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2298-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In vitro assays have also shown a specific physical interaction between HasA and PrtD, the Prt ABC protein (7LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5804-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).All these data support that the early interaction occurring between HasA and the ABC protein is a crucial step for the efficient secretion by the ABC transporter. We further investigated this early step by studying the determinants of the abortive interaction between HasA and PrtD as well as the HasA and SecB relationship.In this study, we obtained evidence that the early interaction with the ABC protein involves SecB and the N-terminal domain of HasA. We also showed that the N-terminal region of HasA has an effect on its own secretion. This led us to propose a model in which SecB and the N-terminal region of HasA cooperate, targeting HasA to the ABC protein.DISCUSSIONIn the ABC secretion system, substrate specificity depends on interactions between the C-terminal secretion signal and the ABC protein (5Binet R. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2298-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Delepelaire P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27952-27957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Thanabalu T. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6487-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, both the Prt and Has systems can interact with HasA and proteases, either productively (Has system with HasA and proteases, and Prt system with proteases) or non-productively (Prt system with HasA) (5Binet R. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2298-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We used the properties of HasA in the two systems to study in more detail the functional interaction of the substrate with the ABC protein. Furthermore we have proposed that in the HasA case an initial step should occur in the secretion process (26Debarbieux L. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This led us to study the role of the N-terminal part of HasA in the secretion of HasA by its own transporter. We found that the N-terminal region of HasA is involved in secretion efficiency and renders secretion SecB-dependent. We also identified several properties of the inhibition of protease secretion by HasA overproduced in cells. (i) Similar to HasA secretion through its own transporter, this inhibition is dependent on SecB, whereas protease secretion by the Prt system is SecB-independent. (ii) In contrast to HasA secretion via its own transporter, which depends on the C-terminal secretion signal, the C-terminal part of HasA is not required for this inhibition. (iii) A stable and functional variant of HasA devoid of the first 10 N-terminal amino acids, produced in similar amounts to HasA, does not inhibit protease secretion. (iv) Finally, an N-terminal fragment of HasA, devoid of the C-terminal secretion signal, inhibits protease secretion.These results suggest that the SecB chaperone and the N-terminal part of HasA play specific roles in the abortive recognition of the Prt ABC transporter and in the recognition of the Has transporter. This interpretation was supported by in vitro experiments in which a functional version of PrtD (the ABC protein of the Prt system) tagged with six histidine residues at the N terminus, specifically recognized HasA, its N-terminal fragment and the SecB chaperone.Although the C-terminal secretion signal is strictly required for HasA secretion and can be secreted as an autonomous secretion signal, it did not seem to be involved in the inhibition of protease secretion. The C-terminal secretion signal of HasA did not interact with PrtD in ourin vitro assay and, unlike the C-terminal signal of protease G, did not inhibit the ATPase activity of the purified PrtD protein, or inhibited it only very slightly, at non-physiological concentrations (6Delepelaire P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27952-27957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The dependence of protease secretion inhibition by HasA on both the SecB chaperone and the N-terminal part of HasA and the inability of the HasA-(11â188) variant to inhibit Prt secretion, despite binding to SecB as shown by pre-MBP processing interference, indicate that the N-terminal part of HasA plays a very specific role in the abortive interaction with the Prt transporter.We demonstrated an interaction in vitro between SecB and PrtD, suggestive of a specific interaction. The in vivoabortive interaction of HasA with the Prt transporter requires both SecB and the N-terminal end of HasA, and both SecB and HasA interactin vitro with PrtD, the ABC protein of the Prt system. It is thus possible that this abortive interaction involves a ternary complex containing SecB, the N-terminal region of HasA and PrtD. In view of the SecB independence of the protease secretion, the interaction of SecB with PrtD is puzzling. It cannot be excluded that overproduction of the secretion functions in the reconstituted system could mask SecB dependence for the Prt case. Further studies will be required to assess the specificity of the SecB-ABC protein interaction.The N-terminal end of HasA also seems to have a specific function in the secretion of HasA via its own transporter because secretion of the HasA-(11â188) variant is less efficient than that of HasA, even though the biological function of the variant is unaffected. Furthermore, under our conditions, secretion of the variant was not SecB-dependent. This strongly suggests that there is also an interaction between the N-terminal region of HasA, SecB, and the ABC protein of the Has system itself. This interaction may account for the greater secretion efficiency. Unfortunately this interaction could not be seen in the in vitro system, because HasD, the ABC protein of the Has system is much less stable than PrtD.Thus, the C-terminal secretion signal is not the only region involved in secretion. Another region, in the N-terminal part of the protein, together with SecB, interacts with the ABC protein and may function as a targeting element to the secretion apparatus.SecB has two functions in the Sec system: maintaining the precursor in an unfolded conformation and targeting the precursor to SecA, the ATPase of the Sec system, which also recognizes the N-terminal signal sequence (14Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. van der Wolk J.P. Kimsey H.H. Kumamoto C.A. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In the Has system, SecB may also have two roles, targeting and antifolding, but the balance between antifolding and targeting activities may be different from that in the Sec system. The behavior of HasA-(11â188) resembles to some extent the SecB-independent translocation of some MBP mutants (15Collier D.N. Bankaitis V.A. Weiss J.B. Bassford P.J., Jr. Cell. 1988; 53: 273-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 16Collier D.N. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1993; 44: 151-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These MBP variants fold more slowly and bind SecB more tightly. There is, however, an important difference between these mutants and the HasA variant: the HasA variant is secreted less efficiently than the wild type whereas the MBP variants are secreted with similar efficiency to the wild type. This provides further evidence for the specific role of the N-terminal end of HasA and indicates a possible role for this part of the molecule in early targeting to the ABC protein.We have recently shown that HasA is able to fold to its native state in the cytoplasm independently of SecB. We have also shown that folded intracellular HasA, although no longer secretion-competent even if SecB is overproduced, interacts in an abortive manner with its own transporter and inhibits the secretion of newly synthesized HasA. As HasA secretion is very efficient, the time window during which HasA is competent for secretion is very short, strongly suggesting that HasA must interact early with the ABC transporter (26Debarbieux L. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The results obtained here, identifying the N-terminal part of HasA, in addition to the C-terminal secretion signal, as a key element in the secretion process, provide strong support for this interpretation and a possible underlying molecular basis. Furthermore the SecB dependence of the HasA analogs reinforces SecB function in this secretion pathway.Our data are consistent with a model in which the N-terminal end of HasA is involved in cotranslational targeting to the ABC protein and renders HasA secretion SecB-dependent, possibly by initiating folding events incompatible with secretion via the C-terminal secretion signal. As the HasA-(11â188) variant is able to achieve a fully functional conformation, a clear interpretation of secretion independence toward SecB may be due to modifications in folding kinetics resulting in a lower probability to reach off pathway such as complete folding. However, this provides evidence for the cooperative action of the N-terminal end of HasA with SecB.Our study also addressed the question of the number of binding sites on the ABC protein. It is possible that the N-terminal part of HasA recognizes the secretion signal binding site of the PrtD protein, hindering further access to proteases. However, as the N-terminal part of HasA plays a role in the efficiency of secretion via its own transporter and the C terminus is required for secretion, it is more likely that the HasD ABC protein has two peptide binding sites with different functions and specificities. The C-terminal secretion signal binding site would therefore be strictly required for secretion whereas the binding site for the N-terminal region would increase secretion efficiency in a SecB-dependent manner. It is unclear whether this is a general characteristic of such protein transporters. The nature of the SecB binding sites on HasA and the precise part of the N-terminal region of HasA involved in the early recognition of the transporter also remain to be determined. In Gram-negative bacteria, proteins that cross the cell envelope are secreted into the extracellular medium via at least four different specific pathways. These pathways can be classified into two groups, according to their dependence upon the Sec pathway. Proteins that follow the Sec pathway have a signal peptide and are secreted in two steps. They are translocated to the periplasm via the Sec machinery; they then cross the outer membrane and are transported to the extracellular medium by a complex multicomponent system. Proteins using the other pathways do not have a signal peptide and are exported from the cytoplasm to the extracellular medium in one step, with no periplasmic intermediate (1Wandersman C. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella tiphymurium Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press Washington, D. C., 1996: 955-967Google Scholar). One of these Sec-independent pathways is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1ABCATP-binding cassetteMBPmaltose-binding proteinPRTprotease secretion apparatus 1ABCATP-binding cassetteMBPmaltose-binding proteinPRTprotease secretion apparatus secretion pathway (2Binet R. Letoffe S. Ghigo J.M. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) also referred to as the type I pathway. This pathway is used for the specific secretion of proteins of many different families, including hydrolytic enzymes, virulence factors, and hemophores. Each of these proteins is secreted via a specific apparatus, usually encoded by a series of genes organized into a single operon. ATP-binding cassette maltose-binding protein protease secretion apparatus ATP-binding cassette maltose-binding protein protease secretion apparatus The ABC secretion apparatus forms a complex linking the inner and outer membranes and consists of three proteins: 1) an inner membrane ABC protein that hydrolyzes ATP, 2) a second inner membrane protein, the membrane fusion protein (MFP), which has a large periplasmic domain and, 3) an outer membrane protein (OMP). Proteins secreted by the ABC pathway do not have an N-terminal signal peptide (3Nicaud J.M. Mackman N. Gray L. Holland I.B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Instead, they usually have an uncleaved C-terminal secretion signal located within the last 50 C-terminal amino acids responsible for directing the secretion of the protein (4Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8979-8985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This C-terminal secretion signal is a key component of the ABC secretion pathway. It specifically recognizes the ABC protein, and this interaction is responsible for substrate specificity (5Binet R. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2298-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Delepelaire P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27952-27957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this interaction triggers assembly of the secretion apparatus proteins into a functional complex (7LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5804-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Thanabalu T. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6487-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The structure of the ABC secretion system imposes specific constraints.Escherichia coli TolC, a component of several protein ABC exporters, was recently studied by crystallography and shown to form a channel across the periplasm (9Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). This channel has an inner diameter of 30 Angstroms. Other structural data for several protein substrates that use the TolC channel for secretion have shown that in their native form these proteins are too large to pass through this channel (10Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Baumann U., Wu, S. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). A second constraint concerns the interaction between the C-terminal secretion signal and the ABC protein. The C-terminal position of the secretion signal implies that the exoprotein must be completely synthesized before the secretion signal can interact with the secretion apparatus. In this case, other pathways, such as complete folding, aggregation, and degradation, may compete with the post-translational secretion pathway. Mechanisms for the regulation of protein folding have been investigated in other pathways of translocation across membranes. Some pathways, such as those responsible for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (12Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), mitochondrial import (13Lill R. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and export across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane via the Sec pathway (14Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), require chaperone proteins such as Hsp70, Hsp40, or SecB. Chaperone proteins are defined by their ability to bind transiently to non-native structures in polypeptide chains. These transient interactions prevent âillegitimateâ protein-protein interactions, thereby controlling the folding of proteins. For example, SecB is required for the translocation of some precursor proteins via the Sec system (15Collier D.N. Bankaitis V.A. Weiss J.B. Bassford P.J., Jr. Cell. 1988; 53: 273-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 16Collier D.N. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1993; 44: 151-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kumamoto C.A.

SecB has two different functions in this pathway: an antifolding activity, responsible for keeping precursors in an export competent state, and a t"

The activation of Erk1,2 is an obligate element in the ability of the morphogen retinoic acid (RA) to promote primitive endoderm (PE) formation in mouse F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells (3Gao P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and in the adipogenic conversion of mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to yield mature adipocytes (4Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been implicated in development in Drosophila (5Noselli S. Trends Gen. 1998; 14: 33-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (6Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar), as well as in mammalian embryonal carcinoma P19 stem cells (7Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The P19 stem cells are particularly attractive as a model system of early development, because three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) can be derived from these mouse embryonal carcinoma cells in response to specific inducers and culture conditions (8Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RA stimulates the loss of the embryonic marker SSEA-1 and positive staining by the TROMA antibody specific for the cytokeratin endo A, a hallmark for primitive endoderm. The search to link RA action to activation of JNK revealed an important intermediary, the heterotrimeric G-protein G13. Expression of GÎ±13 rises sharply in P19 cells in response to RA as well as in early mouse embryos (8Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In P19 cells, suppression of this rise in GÎ±13 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides blocks the ability of RA to promote formation of PE (8Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The concept that heterotrimeric G-proteins are critical elements of development has been bolstered by recent studies of developmental pathways in which the following Î±-subunits have been implicated: Gs, Go, Gq, Gi2, and G12/G13(2,9). One of the most powerful approaches to the study of G-protein Î±-subunits takes advantage of specific mutations that suppress the intrinsic GTPase activity, yielding an Î±-subunit that is constitutively activated. Herein we explored the upstream control of JNK activation in P19 clones that have been stably transfected to express the constitutively active (CA) Q226L mutant form of GÎ±13. Expression of Q226L GÎ±13 in P19 cells leads to robust activation of JNK and formation of PE in the absence of RA. At the level of MAP kinase kinase upstream of JNK, MEK1 and MKK4 (also known as JNKK1) are activated. At the level of MAP kinase kinase kinase, expression of Q226L GÎ±13 results in activation of MEKK1. Expression of the dominant negative form of either MEKK4 or MEKK1 blocks Q226L GÎ±13-induced differentiation. Treatment with oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to MEKK1, 2, or 4 blocks Q226L GÎ±13-induced JNK activation and PE formation. Thus, MEKK1, 2, and 4 act downstream of GÎ±13 and upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the pathway mediating differentiation of these stem cells to primitive endoderm. The P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Both the stable transfectants and the wild-type clones were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) in a humidified atmosphere of 6% CO2. P19 cells cultured as monolayers on tissue culture plates in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% serum were induced to primitive endoderm by the addition of 10 nmall-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) for 2â4 days. pCDNA3 plasmids harboring no insert (i.e. empty vector), the wild-type, constitutively active, and dominant negative (DN) mutant forms of MEKK1 and MEKK4 were provided generously by Dr. Gary L. Johnson (Dept. of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). The pCMV5 plasmid harboring the Q226L mutant form of GÎ±13 was obtained from Dr. Alfred Gilman (Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, TX). The P19 cells were transfected with one or more plasmids using LipofectAMINE. Stably transfected P19 clones were selected in the presence of the neomycin analog G418 (400 Î¼g/ml). The wild-type and mutant forms of the MEKK1 and MEKK4 had been epitope-tagged with the hemagglutinin antigen to follow expression of each independently of endogenous MEKKs. Samples (10â50 Î¼g of protein per lane) of total cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis in SDS on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose blots. The blots were stained with primary antibodies and the immune complexes made visible using a second antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase and developed using the ECL method. The antibodies were purchased from the following sources: JNK1, MEKK1, MEK2, and MEK7 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); MEK1 from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA); MKK4 antibodies from Pharmogel Antibodies (San Diego, CA); phosphospecific antibodies to MEK1,2, MEK3,6, and MKK4 from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The immunoprecipitation reactions and solid-state assay of MEKKs and JNK were performed as detailed earlier (7Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), using the rGST-JNKK1 and rGST-c-Jun N-terminal fusion protein as substrates for the MEKKs and JNK activity assays, respectively. The vectors expressing the rGST-c-Jun and rGST-JNKK1 were provided generously by Dr. Roger Davis (HHMI, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA.) In some cases, P19 cells were treated with oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to MEKK1, 2, 3, and 4 as described earlier (8Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The staining of the embryonic antigen SSEA-1 with the monoclonal antibody MC-80 and the endoderm-specific marker antigen cytokeratin endo A by the monoclonal antibody TROMA was performed with antibodies purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IO). The P19 cells were cultured, stained, and subjected to analysis by epifluorescence microscopy as described previously. Because the differentiated cells often grow from monolayers to whorls of cells with multiple layers, the indirect immunofluorescence and phase contrast images may not appear to be in focus. This artifact is unavoidable under these conditions of differentiation. For all of the experiments reported, the data are compiled from at least three independent replicate experiments performed on separate cultures on separate occasions with highly reproducible results. The indirect immunofluorescence and phase contrast images are of representative fields of interest. The mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were stably transfected with an expression vector pCDNA3 either lacking an insert (empty vector) or harboring the cDNA for the constitutively active mutant form of GÎ±13 with the Q226L substitution (GÎ±13QL). The Q226L mutation reduces the intrinsic Î±-subunit GTPase activity responsible for the hydrolysis of GTP bound in the activated state of GÎ±13. Analysis of the levels of GÎ±13 mRNA in the stably transfected cells was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification. Expression of GÎ±13 mRNA was increased dramatically in the clones harboring the Q226L GÎ±13-containing expression vector (Fig. 1A). Amplification of the marker mRNA for GAPDH, used to evaluate loading consistency, was equivalent among the clones expressing Q226L GÎ±13 or empty vector. Crude membranes prepared from P19 clones harboring empty vector or vector expressing the Q226L GÎ±13 subunit were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotting to nitrocellulose, and staining with antibody against GÎ±13 (Fig. 1B). Expression of GÎ±13 Q226L as deduced from the increase in immunoreactive GÎ±13 in blots of crude membranes of stably transfected clones was about 1.2- to 1.7-fold greater than the expression of the endogenous GÎ±13 (Fig.1C). Treating P19 cells with RA induces activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and PE formation (7Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Expression of Q226L GÎ±13 mimics the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase by RA, as measured by the solid-state kinase assay (Fig. 2). Examined in a number of independent stably transfected clones, the increase in JNK activity ranged from 3.0- to 7.6-fold in clones expressing Q226L GÎ±13, and the average increase in kinase activity over basal from more than five clones was 4.2-fold. The amount of JNK1 expression itself was monitored in the Q226L GÎ±13-expressing clones and found to be the same as that observed for clones harboring the empty vector (Fig. 2) or for the wild-type cells (not shown). The ability of Q226L GÎ±13 to provoke JNK activation focused the analysis on the upstream control of kinase activation, commencing with a measurement of the expression and activity of members of the MAP kinase kinase family (Fig. 3). Expression of MEK1â4, 6, and MKK7 in the clones overexpressing Q226L GÎ±13 was probed by immunoblotting. Expression of MEK2 only was modestly greater (10â15%) in the clones expressing the Q226L GÎ±13 (Fig.3A). The expression of MKK7 was similarly increased (not shown). The expression levels of MEK1, MEK3, and MKK4 were not changed (Fig. 3, A and B). MEK6 expression in F9 stem cells was not detected (not shown). Activation of MEKs occurs through phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in MEK1 and 2 (Ser-217 and Ser-221), MEK3 (Ser-189 and Ser-207), and MKK4 (Ser-219 and Thr-261). Solid-state kinase assays of MEK kinase activities were precluded by a lack of suitable antibodies. As an alternative, we employed phosphospecific antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated, activated MEKs to evaluate the activities of MEKs. The activities of MEK1 and MEK2 were found to increase 80 and 40%, respectively, in the clones expressing Q226L GÎ±13, whereas the activity of MEK3 was unchanged (Fig. 3, AâD). Activity of MKK4, in contrast, was increased in the clones expressing Q226L GÎ±13. The activity of MKK4 (also known as JNKK1) was increased 60â70% in the P19 cells expressing the mutant GÎ±13. Thus, expression of constitutively active Q226L GÎ±13 provokes essentially no change in the expression of MAP kinase kinase family members. MEK1,4 and to a lesser extent MEK2 are constitutively activated similar to JNK1 in the clones expressing the Q226L mutant of GÎ±13. These levels of MEK activation are similar to reports in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells (10Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell.

MEKK1 activity increased 1.5- to 2.0-fold in P19 cells expressing the GÎ±13 Q226L mutant (Fig.4). Assays performed using a GST-tagged version of JNKK1 as a substrate reported a 1.9- to 2.2-fold increase in activation in response to expression of the constitutively active versions of either MEKK1 or MEKK4 (17Kanungo J. Potapova I. Malbon C.C. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24032-24039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of Q226L GÎ±13 yields an activation of MEKK1 not unlike that measured in these same stem cells in response to expression of either constitutively activated MEKK1 or MEKK4. Although the constitutively activated Q226L GÎ±13 led to chronic activation of MEKK1, the expression of MEKK1 itself was unchanged. The lack of suitable antibodies precluded similar direct measurements of MEKK4 activity. To test further the roles of the MAP kinase kinase kinases MEKK1 and MEKK4 in the activation of JNK1 in P19 cells expressing GÎ±13 Q226L, clones were co-transfected with vectors expressing the dominant negative form of either MEKK1 (DN-MEKK1) or MEKK4 (DN-MEKK4). The expression of DN versions of these two prominent MAP kinase kinase kinases was evaluated for ability to influence the downstream signaling to JNK. Expression of Q226L GÎ±13 mutant increased JNK1 activity â¼3-fold (Figs. 2 and 5), and co-expression of the dominant negative form of MEKK1 abolished this activation of JNK1. Not only did the DN-MEKK1 block the activation by Q226L GÎ±13, but it also suppressed the level of JNK1 below that observed in clones expressing the empty vector (Fig. 5). Expression of the dominant negative form of MEKK4 likewise abolished the ability of the Q226L GÎ±13 to activate JNK1 and suppressed the basal activity of JNK1 by 70%. These data demonstrate that activation of JNK by GÎ±13 Q226L mutant can be blocked by dominant negative forms of either MEKK1 or MEKK4. Would the expression of DN-MEKK1 or DN-MEKK4, which blocks the ability of Q226L GÎ±13 to activate JNK, also block the ability of Q226L GÎ±13 to promote PE formation? P19 cells were stably co-transfected with expression vectors harboring Q226L GÎ±13 in the absence or presence of those harboring either DN-MEKK1 or DN-MEKK4. The clones were selected, propagated, and stained with either antibodies for the embryonic marker SSEA-1 or with TROMA, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes cytokeratin endo A, a PE-specific marker protein in early development (Fig. 6). Expression of Q226L GÎ±13 provoked not only the activation of JNK but also the loss of expression of the embryonic marker SSEA-1. The clones expressed Q226L GÎ±13 stain positively by TROMA, in the absence of the morphogen retinoic acid, demonstrating the ability of the constitutively active GÎ±13 to promote PE formation without RA. Expression of the dominant negative mutant of DN-MEKK1 blocked PE formation as evidenced by the absence of TROMA staining and continued expression of the SSEA-1 embryonic antigen (Fig. 6). Expression of the dominant negative form of DN-MEKK4 in P19 clones co-expressing GÎ±13Q226L likewise resulted in the retention of the embryonal phenotype and suppression of PE formation established by the presence of SSEA-1 antigen and lack of positive staining by the TROMA antibody. Thus, the expression of dominant negative mutants of either MEKK1 or MEKK4 is capable of blocking the downstream signaling by GÎ±13 to activation of JNK and differentiation to primitive endoderm. To further address the role of MEKK1â4 in JNK activation and PE formation, we examined the effects of oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to MEKK1, -2, -3, or -4 on P19 cells transiently transfected with an expression vector harboring GÎ±13Q226L (Fig.7). Transient transfected P19 cells assayed at 48 h post-transfection displayed an increase in both JNK1 activity as well as in the PE marker stained with TROMA antibody (Fig. 7A), although less than that was obtained when the clones were allowed 96 h prior to sampling (which was not possible here). Cells transiently transfected with GÎ±13Q226L and treated with oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) antisense to MEKK1 (asMEKK1) displayed a loss of JNK1 activity and failed to form PE. Treatment with ODNs antisense to MEKK4 by the same approach also resulted in a reduction in JNK1 activity and failure to form PE. The treatment with antisense ODNs suppressed the expression of MEKK1â4, as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 7B). Treating cells with ODNs antisense to MEKK2 displayed a suppression of JNK1 activity and a reduction in PE formation, whereas treatment with ODNs antisense to MEKK3 failed to suppress the activation of JNK1 by GÎ±13Q226L. Despite the inability to block JNK activity, treatment with ODNs antisense to MEKK3 produced a reduction in PE formation in response to GÎ±13Q226L. These data suggest that MEKK2 is capable of transducing GÎ±13Q226L signals into activation of JNK1 and PE formation, whereas MEKK3 may be involved in GÎ±13Q226L-stimulated PE formation in a pathway independent of JNK1 activation. We explored whether the activation of JNK1 was obligate for PE formation in response to GÎ±13Q226L, as it is in response to PE formation caused by the morphogen retinoic acid. Cells transiently transfected to express GÎ±13Q226L were transfected concurrently with the dominant negative form of JNK1, JNK1(DN), and PE formation was measured by the staining of the TROMA1 antigen marker protein (Fig.8). Expression of the FLAG-tagged JNK1(DN) mutant and GÎ±13 was confirmed by immunoblotting. The expression of GÎ±13Q226L provoked expression of the PE marker, and this Ga13Q226L-stimulated PE formation was blocked by co-expression of the JNK1(DN). We examined also whether PE formation in response to expression of constitutively activated MEKK1 would be sensitive to the expression of the dominant negative JNK1. Expression of JNK1(DN) and the hemagglutinin antigen-tagged MEKK1(CA) were established by immunoblotting. Expression of the MEKK1(CA) stimulated PE formation, and this PE response to MEKK1(CA) was abolished when the cells were concurrently expressing the dominant negative version of JNK1. These data demonstrate that JNK1 activation is obligate for signaling from GÎ±13Q226L or MEKK1(CA) to PE formation. The present studies explore the signaling upstream of JNK in a mammalian model of development, the pluripotent mouse P19 embryonal stem cell. A role for JNK in signaling primitive endoderm formation in response to the morphogen RA was first identified in the P19 stem cells (7Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9). JNK has been implicated since in several models of development. In Drosophila dorsal closure, the basket gene product is an ortholog of JNK (18Riesgo-Escovar J.R. Jenni M. Fritz A. Hafen E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2759-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,19Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase network has been implicated in C. elegans embryogenesis, although the jnk-1 gene product most homologous to JNK appears to be obligate for coordinated locomotion (20Kawasaki M. Hisamoto N. Iino Y. Yamamoto M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3604-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). How the activity of JNK is activated in these systems remains to be fully elucidated. Expression of a constitutively active mutant form of GÎ±13 (Q226L) obviated the need for the morphogen and has been shown to promote robust PE formation (8Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression of the Q226L GÎ±13 provokes persistent activation of JNK as well as formation of PE, enabling this group to detail signaling upstream of JNK in these mammalian stem cells. At the level of MAP kinase kinase, it is clear that both MEK1 and MKK4 (which is also known as JNKK1) were persistently activated in clones expressing Q226L GÎ±13 (Fig. 9). MEK2 also displayed some activation, whereas MEK 3 activity was unaffected by the expression of constitutively active Q226L GÎ±13. Upstream signaling of JNK inC. elegans requires the jkk-1 gene (20Kawasaki M. Hisamoto N. Iino Y. Yamamoto M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3604-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas in Drosophila the hemipterous gene product is obligate (21Glise B. Noselli S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). There appears to be a high degree of conservation for signaling pathways operating in development at the levels of the MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase. Direct analysis at the level of MEKK reveals the activation of MEKK1 in clones expressing Q226L GÎ±13, establishing a clear linkage between GÎ±13 and MAP kinase kinase kinases. Although direct analysis of MEKK4 was not possible, we employed the expression of dominant negative mutants of both MEKK1 and MEKK4 in an attempt to test if either of the DN-MEKKs could block constitutive signaling from Q226L GÎ±13 to JNK and PE formation. The results of the analysis demonstrate that expression of DN-MEKK1 blocks the activation of JNK1 as well as the ability of the Q226L GÎ±13 to promote PE formation. Expression of DN-MEKK4 also blocks signaling from GÎ±13 to JNK and PE formation. These observations were extended by studies in which cells were treated with ODNs antisense to MEKK1â4 individually. Treatment with ODNs antisense to MEKK1, 2, or 4 suppressed both JNK1 activation and PE formation in response to expression of GÎ±13Q226L. Depletion of MEKK3, in contrast, blocked PE formation in response to expression of GÎ±13Q226L, but failed to suppress JNK1 activation. Thus, signaling via MEKK1, 2, or 4 from GÎ±13Q226L to PE formation requires JNK1, although MEKK3 appears to play a role in GÎ±13Q226L-stimulated PE formation independent of JNK1 activation. These studies reveal a central role for JNK1, and MEKK1/4 in the downstream signaling from Q226L GÎ±13 to the control of JNK and PE formation (Fig. 7). Orthologs of MKK4 and MEKK1/4 likely play a central role in the control of development in C. elegans (6Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin.

For mammalian P19 stem cells, inhibition of either JNK1 or MEKK4 by dominant negative versions leads to a block in the formation of primitive endoderm in response to either RA (17Kanungo J. Potapova I. Malbon C.C. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24032-24039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or to the expression of Q226L GÎ±13 (present work). Expression of dominant negative JNK1 was shown to block PE formation in response to either GÎ±13Q226L or constitutively active MEKK1. Expression of the constitutively active form of JNK, in contrast, failed to stimulate PE formation (7Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional signals, perhaps the result of activation of MAP kinase kinase or MAP kinase kinase kinase, are obligate for the PE formation to be initiated. InDrosophila, small molecular weight G-proteins have been implicated upstream of MAP kinase kinase activation in dorsal closure (21Glise B. Noselli S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Magie C.R. Meyer M.R. Gorsuch M.S. Parkhurst S.M. Development. 1999; 126: 5353-5364PubMed Google Scholar).

Such an arrangement, even in a simple system such as the lysis-lysogeny switch of coliphage Î», permits remarkable control of gene expression through a series of thermodynamically linked protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The Î» genetic switch, one of the most intensively studied systems in biology, has in many ways provided the basis for the study of switch biology in higher organisms (1Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch. Cell Press and Blackwell Scientific, Cambridge1986Google Scholar, 2Friedman D.I. Court D.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Coliphage 186, a member of the P2 family of phage, shows essentially no similarity with Î» at the protein or DNA level, and so the two have presumably evolved independently of each other. Nevertheless, the lysis-lysogeny switches of each show superficial similarity, and it is expected that a comparative analysis of the differences in detail between the two will improve overall understanding of switch operation, hence the present structure-function study of 186 CI repressor. The immunity repressor, CI, of coliphage 186 is responsible for maintenance of the stable lysogenic state and achieves this by binding directly over and repressing two promoters: pR, the promoter of the early lytic operon and pB, the promoter for the late promoter activator gene B (Fig.1). 186 contains a total of four binding sites for CI, including two sites (FL andFR) that flank the lytic promoter (6Dodd I.B Egan J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11532-11540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These flanking sites play a role fine-tuning CI-regulation of transcription from pR and from the lysogenic promoterpL. 1I. B. Dodd and J. B. Egan, manuscript in preparation.The flanking sites FL andFR each consist of an inverted repeat, while the CI binding site at the pB promoter contains a pair of inverted repeats. These four inverted repeats share sequence similarity and are separated in each case by a five-base pair A/T-rich spacer. These CI binding sites have been designated A type sites (Fig.1). The CI binding site at pR, responsible for repressing the early lytic genes, consists of three inverted repeats. There is a central A type site, which has a four- rather than five-base pair spacing between conserved bases and is designated an Aâ² site. Situated on either side of the Aâ² site are inverted repeats, again with an A/T-rich spacer, but unrelated in sequence to the A type sites (see Ref. 6Dodd I.B Egan J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11532-11540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, Fig. 1). These alternative recognition elements have been termed B type sites. Hence, the CI binding site at pR has the arrangement B-Aâ²-B. The recognition elements at pR all lie on the same face of the helix and are strongly supported by DNase I footprint data and by a library of 19 virulent (vir) mutations (6Dodd I.B Egan J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11532-11540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Lamont I. Brumby A.M. Egan J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 5492-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, CI is able to recognize two distinct DNA sequences. In the present work, we set out to determine whether there are two distinct DNA binding regions within the CI protein or whether there is just one motif that binds with relaxed specificity to the two different types of binding sites. To this end we have investigated the domain structure of CI by sequence analysis, linker insertion mutagenesis, and limited proteolysis. We have examined the self-association and DNA binding properties of the isolated domains and from the information so obtained carried out mutagenesis on residues predicted to be critical for DNA binding. Bacteria BL21 (Î»DE3) pLysS was used as the host for expression of CI and its variants from the T7 promoter of the pET3a vector (8Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). NK7049 (9Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N.

NK7049 (Î»RS45 pR shortlacZ) was used to assay transposon insertion mutants, NK7049 (Î»RS45 pR HincII/SnaBIlacZ) was used to assay the ability of CI and its variants to repress pR, and NK7049 (Î»RS45pB lacZ) was used to assaypB activity. Plasmids, bacteriophage pRAS1 was created by amplifying the 186 cI gene, including the native ribosome binding site by PCR using primers 108 and 55, digesting the PCR product with EcoRI and BamHI and ligating into pBluescriptKS (Stratagene), which had been digested with the same enzymes. pET3aHis6 is a derivative of pET3a, which has been engineered to encode a C-terminal thrombin cleavage sequence (LVPRGS) followed by a six-histidine affinity tag. pETCIHis6 was created by amplifying by PCR the cI gene from pET3aCI (10Shearwin K.E.

The region of the Î» cI gene encoding amino acids 93â236 of Î» repressor was amplified by PCR using a 5â²-primer designed to introduce an SphI site. The 186-cI PCR product was digested with NdeI and SphI, the Î» PCR product withSphI and SacII, and these fragments inserted intoNdeI/SacII-digested pET3aHis6. pETCI(HTHâ)His6 was generated by performing QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis on a pETCIHis6 template using primers 219 and 220. pMRR9 (11Neufing P.J.

Any regions amplified by PCR were checked by sequencing. Î»RS45 is a Î» phage vector used to transfer transcriptional reporter fusions made in pMRR9 into single copy. Î»RS45 and pMRR9 share portions of the N terminus of both the Î²-lactamase gene and thelacZ gene thus allowing any promoter insert in pMRR9 to be recombined into the phage (9Simons R.W. Houman F.

Escherichia coli strain BL21 pLysS containing the various pETCIHis6 constructs was grown in LB broth (500 ml) containing 100 Î¼g/ml carbenicillin, 30 Î¼g/ml chloramphenicol at 37 Â°C to anA600 of 0.55â0.7, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and growth continued for a further 2â3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5 (TEG150), and the cell pellet stored at â20 Â°C until use. For protein purification, the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl) and sonicated on ice, and cell debris removed by centrifugation (12 000 Ã g, 30 min, 4 Â°C). PMSF2 (50 Î¼m) was added to inhibit proteases. The supernatant was loaded onto a freshly charged 5-ml Hi-Trap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using a disposable syringe. The column was washed with 12-column volumes of buffer A, followed by 12-column volumes of buffer A containing 150 mm imidazole, and the protein eluted with 2-column volumes of buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. Fractions of 200 Î¼l were collected and assayed for protein by absorbance at 280 nm. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against TEG150. Purity of the dialyzed protein was examined by SDS-PAGE on 10% Tris-Tricine gels and judged to be better than 95% in all cases. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, using molar extinction coefficients of 23950 mâ1cmâ1 for CIHis6 and CI(HTHâ)His6, 15470mâ1 cmâ1 for CI (1â82)His6, 8480 mâ1cmâ1 for CI (83)His6 and 36440mâ1 cmâ1 for CI(hybrid)His6 (calculated using the SEDNTERP program). Yields for the various proteins were between 10 and 30 mg per 500 ml of culture. His6-tagged CI was shown to be equivalent to the wild type repressor by several criteria; (i) when expressed from a plasmid both forms of repressor gave immunity to infection by 186, (ii) in gel shift assays, purified CIHis6 bound with a 5-fold higher affinity than purified wild type protein, presumably due to the more rapid NiNTA affinity purification procedure giving a higher active fraction of protein, (iii) both CI and CIHis6 associated in solution in an equilibrium between monomers, dimers, tetramers, and octamers, and (iv) in vivo repression of pR andpB lacZ reporters by CI and CIHis6 were very similar (see Table I).Table IRepression of pR and pB lacZ reporters by CI variantsPlasmid1-aPlasmids present in strain NK7049 (Î»RS45 pRHincII/SnaBI lacZ) or NK7049 (Î»RS45pBlacZ).pRlacZpBlacZpET3a534 Â± 22 (n = 36)139 Â± 4.8 (n = 35)pETCI2.3 Â± 0.4 (n = 20)4.6 Â± 0.6 (n = 22)pETCIHis63.1 Â± 0.8 (n = 27)5.3 Â± 0.4 (n = 30)pETCI(1â82)His6547 Â± 33 (n = 21)143 Â± 6.4 (n = 22)pETCI (83â192)His6560 Â± 26 (n = 22)137 Â± 6.5 (n = 22)pETCI(hybrid)His689 Â± 5.4 (n = 23)64 Â± 2.0 (n = 24)pETCI(HTHâ)His6525 Â± 25 (n = 24)135 Â± 4.9 (n = 22)Î²-Galactosidase units are given as the mean Â± 95% confidence limits; n = number of assays.1-a Plasmids present in strain NK7049 (Î»RS45 pRHincII/SnaBI lacZ) or NK7049 (Î»RS45pBlacZ).

Linker insertion mutagenesis was performed according to the vendor's instructions (New England Biolabs), with minor modifications. In brief, pRAS1 was used in anin vitro reaction (5 Î¼l) containing target DNA (pRAS1, 20 ng), donor DNA (4.2-kb Transprimer pGPS5 carrying the kanamycin resistance gene, 5 ng) and transposase protein. After a 1-h strand transfer reaction at 37 Â°C, the enzyme was inactivated by heating to 75 Â°C for 10 min. Aliquots of the mixture were transformed by electroporation into NK7049 (Î» pR shortlacZ) and plated on LB plates containing kanamycin (20 Î¼g/ml), ampicillin (100 Î¼g/ml), and X-gal (20 Î¼g/ml) to select for transformants carrying the transposon within pRAS1. Blue colonies indicated the potential presence of a transposon within the CI gene, since CI was rendered unable to repress thepR lacZ reporter. These potential insertion mutants were further screened by a PCR-based assay. Plasmid DNA was isolated from those strains in which the transposon was confirmed as being within the CI gene. The plasmid DNA was digested with PmeI to remove the bulk of the transposon, the plasmids religated and retransformed into strain NK7049 (Î»pR short lacZ). The position and sequence of the resulting 15-bp insert was determined by DNA sequencing. The effects of the mutations were assayed in the same strain by measuring Î²-galactosidase activity. CIHis6 (1.1 mg/ml) in TEG150 was digested at 37 Â°C at CI to protease molar ratios of 280 (subtilisin), 370 (papain), or 1100 (proteinase K). At appropriate time points, 5 Î¼l of samples were diluted into an equal volume of 2Ã SDS loading buffer containing 20 mm PMSF, immediately heated to 95 Â°C for 1 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For samples to be analyzed by mass spectrometry, reactions (20 Î¼l) were stopped by the addition of PMSF and heating. Electrospray mass spectrometry was kindly performed by Dr. C. Bagley, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia. Cleavage points were deduced from mass spectrometry results using the PAWS program. Strain NK7049 transformed with the appropriate pMRR9 derivative was used as the host for growth of the Î»RS45 phage vector. Phage stocks obtained were plated on NK7049, and single recombinant plaques selected on the basis of color in the presence of X-gal and purified once by streaking across a lawn of NK7049. Independent blue lysogens from at least two recombinant plaques were purified by restreaking. Single copy status of these lysogens was confirmed by PCR (12Powell B.S. Court D.L. Nakamura Y. Rivas M.P. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5765-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For assay ofpR or pBÎ²-galactosidase activity, the appropriate CI expression plasmid (pETCIHis6 or the parental pET3a plasmid) was transformed into these lysogens, and liquid cultures started from single colonies. Kinetic LacZ assays were done in 96-well microtitre plates by an extensively modified Miller method (13Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Fresh colonies on selective LB plates were used to inoculate 200 Î¼l of LB + antibiotic. Plates were sealed and incubated at 37 Â°C for â¼16 h without shaking. These cultures were subcultured by diluting 2 Î¼l into 98 Î¼l of fresh medium and incubated with rotation to an A600 of 0.2â1.2 (log phase). A600 was measured using a Labsystems Multiskan Ascent plate reader with a 620-nm filter; theA620 values were converted toA600 (1-cm path length) values using an empirically derived relationship and adjusted for light-scattering non-linearity according to (14Bipatnath M. Dennis P. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were chilled and then permeabilized with polymyxin B (15Schupp J.M. Travis S.E. Price L.B. Shand R.F. Keim P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar) by adding 20 Î¼l of culture + 30 Î¼l of LB to 150 Î¼l of lysis buffer in a microtitre plate. Lysis buffer was TZ8 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgSO4, 10 mm KCl) + 2.7 Î¼l/ml 2-mercaptoethanol and 50 Î¼g/ml polymyxin B. The presence of detergents and chelating agents did not improve the assay. A higher pH value than used by Miller (13Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) improved display ofo-nitrophenol in the absence of NaCO3 added to stop the reaction. Assays were performed at 28 Â°C and were initiated by addition of 40 Î¼l of o-nitrophenyl-Î²-D galactoside (4 mg/ml in TZ8). The A414 of the reaction was read every 2 min for 1 h, and enzyme activity determined as the slope of the line of best fit of A414versus minutes (readings with A414 > 2.5 were ignored). Enzyme activity was found to be directly proportional to the A600 of the culture and the volume of culture added to the assay (V in Î¼l). LacZ units were calculated as 200,000 Ã (A414/min)/(A600 ÃV) and were roughly equivalent to standard Miller units. Sedimentation experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using absorbance optics and a four-hole An60Ti rotor. Approximately 100 Î¼l of sample and 105 Î¼l of reference solution were loaded in the sectors of the epon centerpieces. Following 24 h of centrifugation, scans were compared at 3-h intervals to ensure that equilibrium had been reached. Data were collected at 280 nm at a spacing of 0.003 cm. The buffer for all experiments was TEG 150. Protein was prepared for centrifugation by exhaustive dialysis against TEG 150, and the dialysate used as the reference solution for centrifugation. Buffer density (Ï) was measured in an Anton-Paar precision density meter to be 1.03953 g/ml at 5 Â°C and 1.03644 g/ml at 20 Â°C. The partial specific volumes (Î½Ì) were calculated (using the SEDNTERP program) as 0.727 ml/mg for CIHis6, 0.712 ml/g for CI (1â82)His6, and 0.736 for CI (83)His6. Sedimentation data was analyzed using Sigmaplot 4.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Il) initially by fitting each data set (absorbanceversus radial distance) individually to Equation 1, the basic sedimentation equilibrium equation, in order to estimate whole cell molecular weights.Ar=Ar,0exp(M(1âÎ½Â¯Ï)Ï2(r2âr02)/2RT)+eEquation 1 where Ar and Ar,0are the absorbances at radial distance, r, andr,0, M is apparent molecular weight,Î½Ì is the partial specific volume, Ï is the solution density, Ï is the rotor speed in radians per second, T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin, R is the gas constant ande is a baseline error term. M,Ar,0, and e were fitting parameters. All data sets were then analyzed globally by fitting to an extended version of Equation 1, modified to take into account association between species. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were conducted on a Biacore 2000 using a streptavidin-coated chip (SA chip, BIAcore AB, Sweden). Biotinylated DNA (PAGE-purified, SigmaGenosys, Sydney) was prepared by adding a slight molar excess of the non biotinylated strand over the biotinylated strand. The strands were annealed by heating to 90 Â°C for 3 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Between 68 and 135 response units (RU) of DNA was immobilized at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l/min. Flow cell 1, containing no DNA, was used as a reference channel, while flow cell 2, containing two tandem Î»OL operator sites (90 RU), was used as a negative control. A32A DNA (68 RU) was immobilized in flow cell 3, and B32B DNA (135 RU) in flow cell 4. The binding buffer for Biacore experiments was TEG150. Proteins, diluted in TEG150, were pumped across all four flow cells at 20 Î¼l/min and 25 Â°C, and responses recorded at 1Hz. The first step in investigating the structure-function relationship of 186 CI was to search for homologs. A number of proteins related to the 186 CI repressor were identified by BLAST (16Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The 186 CI amino acid sequence was used initially to search the protein data base, and four prophage proteins (repressors from phage ÏR67, Hemophilus influenzae phages HP1 and S2, and Vibrio cholerae phage K139) with homology to CI repressor were identified. The unfinished microbial genomes data base was also searched with 186 CI as the input sequence, and two additional proteins were found. The first was fromKlebsiella pneumoniae (WUSTL Genome Sequencing Center) and, judging from other sequence similarities, appears to be the CI homolog of a phage closely related to 186, present as a prophage. The second was a putative prophage repressor fromSalmonella typhi (CT18 phage) (Sanger Center, Cambridge, UK). Several partial sequences related to 186 CI were also evident in the unfinished genomes of otherSalmonella subspecies (typhimurium, paratyphi, enteriditis) but have not been included here. A block alignment of these 186-like proteins was then used to search the BLOCK data base (24Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Pietrokovski S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This more powerful search method detected, in addition to those proteins already identified, the CI protein from Ï80, a lambdoid phage, as being related to the 186 like repressors. Alignment of the 186 CI repressor amino acid sequence with those of the seven related repressor proteins reveals two blocks of homology, one of â¼70 amino acids at the N terminus, and a second block of â¼60 amino acids at the C terminus (Fig. 2). The two blocks are separated by a low homology region of 40â50 amino acids. This non-conserved region may represent an unstructured linker joining two more highly structured domains. In the case of the Ï80 repressor, homology was less evident at the C-terminal end. The C termini of the lambdoid repressors form part of the RecA recognition site, with cleavage of the repressor occurring within the central linker (25Roberts J.W. Roberts C.W. Mount D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2283-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Sauer R.T. Ross M.J. Ptashne M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4458-4462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 186 CI is not RecA-sensitive (7Lamont I. Brumby A.M. Egan J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 5492-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Each CI-like protein in Fig. 2 was examined for the presence of protein motifs using a number of search methods. Potential helix-turn-helix motifs were identified by both the Dodd and Egan (22Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) weight matrix method and the GYM2 pattern recognition method (23Gao Y. Mathee K. Narasimhan G. Wang X. Proc. 6th SPIRE Conference September 21â24, 1999. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Cancun, Mexico1999: 63-72Google Scholar) in some of the proteins. The S.D. scores obtained for each protein by the Dodd and Egan method are shown in parentheses following each sequence in Fig. 2. An S.D. score above 2.5 is considered good evidence for a HTH; likely HTH motifs were identified in some of the proteins, and both search methods always identified the same location as the potential HTH region (solid line in Fig. 2). Thus, although a number of the proteins including CI itself have poor S.D. scores, the alignment of amino acids within the N-terminal block of homology coincides with the position of the predicted HTH motifs in each case. We take this as evidence that 186 CI very likely contains an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif. We have used two techniques, linker insertion mutagenesis and limited proteolysis, to investigate the domain structure of the 186 CI repressor protein, with the aim of determining whether one or both of the putative domains have the potential to bind DNA. In linker insertion mutagenesis (27Goff S.P. Prasad V.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 586-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Biery M.C. Stewart F.J. Stellwagen A.E. Raleigh E.A. Craig N.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) a short stretch of amino acids is inserted into the protein of interest. The effect of the inserted amino acids on the activity of the protein is dependent upon the location of the insertion. For example, an insertion located on a surface loop of the protein or in a relatively unstructured region would be expected to have a minor effect on protein function. In contrast, an insertion within a tightly folded or buried region is more likely to interfere with protein function, whether by disrupting protein structure, protein folding, or through an effect on protein stability. To define the regions of CI that are either tolerant or intolerant to insertions, we have used the Genome Priming System-Linker Scanning system (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). In this system, a modified Tn7-based transposon is used in an in vitro reaction to make random (1.7 kb) insertions into the gene of interest. The majority of the transposon sequence is then removed by restriction digest and religation, leaving a 15-base pair insertion. In four of the six possible reading frames, this insertion results in a five-amino acid linker, while the other two reading frames generate stop codons. Thus, two sets of CI mutants were generated; (i) a set of truncated proteins and (ii) a set of proteins containing randomly located five-amino acid insertions. The activities of these CI mutants were measured by their ability to repress a single copy, chromosomally inserted pR lacZ reporter, NK7049 (Î»RS45 pR shortlacZ). In this system, unrepressedpR lacZ gave 839 (Â± 77) units, while wild type CI from pRAS1 repressed pRlacZ to 0.7 (Â± 0.8) units. Transposon insertions that resulted in truncated protein products occurred at amino acids 36, 61, 74, 103, 106, 107, 110, 112, 123, 173, and 185. These truncated CI proteins invariably lost the ability to repress the pR lacZ reporter. Even a protein truncated at amino acid 185, resulting in just a seven-amino acid C-terminal deletion, was inactive, indicating that these amino acids are required for CI function or stability. Among the second set of mutants (Fig. 3), insertions of five amino acids had quite different effects, depending on the position of the insertion. Î²-galactosidase units for the inactive or partially active mutants are given to the right of Fig. 3; active mutants were defined as those that gave less than two units of Î²-galactosidase activity and are shown to the left of Fig. 3. Insertions within the N-terminal region, with one exception, abolished the ability of CI to repress pR. The exception was the insertion at amino acid 5, which lies just outside the conserved N-terminal region and which remained fully active. Western blotting of cell extracts prepared from the inactive mutants indicated that the inactivity of two of the mutants (insertions at amino acids 15 and 66) reflected a lack of CI in the soluble fraction (data not shown). Together these data are consistent with the idea that insertions within the conserved HTH-containing N-terminal region disrupt"
https://openalex.org/W2130871807,"Studies of two temperature-sensitiveEscherichia coli topA strains AS17 and BR83, both of which were supposed to carry a topA amber mutation and a temperature-sensitive supD43,74 amber-suppressor, led to conflicting results regarding the essentiality of DNA topoisomerase I in cells grown in media of low osmolarity. We have therefore reexamined the molecular basis of the temperature sensitivity of strain AS17. We find that the supD allele in this strain had lost its temperature sensitivity. The temperature sensitivity of the strain, in media of all osmolarity, results from the synthesis of a mutant DNA topoisomerase I that is itself temperature-sensitive. Nucleotide sequencing of the AS17 topA allele and studies of its expected cellular product show that the mutant enzyme is not as active as its wild-type parent even at 30 Â°C, a permissive temperature for the strain, and its activity relative to the wild-type enzyme is further reduced at 42 Â°C, a nonpermissive temperature. Our results thus implicate an indispensable role of DNA topoisomerase I in E. coli cells grown in media of any osmolarity."

Klee C. Calcium as Cellular Regulator. 1. Oxford University Press Inc., Oxford1999Google Scholar). Ca2+signaling involves a rapid rise in free intracellular Ca2+levels for brief periods of time, followed by a decrease and restoration of the low cytosolic resting Ca2+ levels. Among the different Ca2+ transporters present in the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles, the electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchanger plays a major and unique role in the regulation of cell [Ca2+] for two reasons: it can move Ca2+ across the membrane bidirectionally, depending on the net electrochemical driving force, and it has a very high turnover rate (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Although the Na+-Ca2+exchanger is expressed in most mammalian cell types, it is of especially high density in excitable tissues such as the heart, in smooth cells, and in the brain (2Blaustein M.P.

Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is an analog of weakly immunosuppressant cyclosporin D (CsD) (7Sadeg N. Pham-Huy C. Rucay P. Righenzi S. Halle-Pannenko O. Claude J.R. Bismuth H. Duc H.T. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1993; 15: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), results in a concentration-dependent inhibition of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity and a corresponding decrease in surface expression of the protein. The effects are probably posttranslational because no significant differences in the amount of total immunoreactive protein derived from the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger are detected between cells expressing the transporter without and with CsA treatment. Other immunosuppressive agents such as FK506 and rapamycin (8Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) had no effect on either transport activity or surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Similar results are found in cells expressing both the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), with which CsA and PSC833 directly interact and function as modulator (9Smith A.J. Mayer U. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells (ATCC 1573) were used to express the cloned (in pcDNA3.1) Na+-Ca2+ exchangersrbe-2/NCX1.5 (10Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), rhe-1/NCX1.1 (11Low W. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), their mutants, and the cloned MDR1 (kindly given by Dr. Y. Zhou). Preparation of amino-terminal FLAG-tagged RBE-2 (fn-rbe-2) has been described previously (12Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol.

To prepare the amino-terminal FLAG-tagged rat heart Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX1.1 (fn-rhe-1), an AgeI-Eco47III fragment was excised from rhe-1 (11Low W. Kasir J. Rahamimoff H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and subcloned intoAgeI-Eco47III-digested fn-rbe-2vector. The fidelity of the subcloning procedure has been verified by sequencing. Transfection was carried out with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Two Î¼g and 0.66 Î¼g of pDNA were used to transfect cells plated into 60-mm dishes or 1 well of a 12-well plate, respectively. CsA (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp, La Jolla, CA), FK506 (Alexis Corp.), CsD (a gift from Dr. Gilbert Burckhardt, University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy), PSC833 (a gift from Dr. S. Bates, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health), and rapamycin (a gift from Drug Repository, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health) were dissolved in Me2SO and added 3 h after transfection together with the 10% fetal calf serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplement to the transfected cells (Invitrogen). The experiments were repeated three to five times. Transport measurements were done in triplicate. In each experiment, the transport activity of rbe-2- orrhe-1-transfected cells with Me2SO treatment was taken as 100%, and the transport activities measured in the drug-treated cells were calculated in relative values. Some of the experiments were also repeated by using the VTF-7/HeLa cell expression system (14Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal.

In principle, transfected cells were preloaded with 0.16 m NaCl and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, using 25 Î¼mnystatin (Sigma). Cells were washed with the same buffered NaCl solution (without MgCl2) to remove nystatin. Transport was initiated by overlaying the cells with the same buffered Na+- or K+-containing solution, to which 25 Î¼m45Ca2+ was added. All solutions also contained 1 mm ouabain (Sigma). Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake was determined by subtracting the Ca2+ taken up in the absence of a Na+ gradient from that taken up in its presence. P-gp pump activity was determined as described in Ref. 17Rund D. Dagan M. Dalyot-Herman N. Kimchi-Sarfaty C. Schoenlein P.V. Gottesman M.M. Oppenheim A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. Transfected cells were equilibrated with a 150 ng/ml solution of rhodamine 123 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-5% fetal calf serum for 20 min at 37 Â°C. After washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the dye was allowed to efflux for 2 h at 37 Â°C. As a control for pump activity, the cells were preincubated with the P-gp inhibitor (reversing agent) verapamil (5 Î¼m; Sigma) for 30 min before and during both rhodamine 123 staining and the efflux phase of the assay. Immediately afterward, the cells were analyzed by FACSort flow cytometer using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cells expressing the extracellular (12Cook O. Low W.

As described previously, the FLAG epitope was introduced into the extracellular amino-terminal âtailâ of the protein after Gly8 (instead of Asn9, the single glycosylation site of the protein), and it was accessible to externally added antibody without any permeabilization. Introduction of the epitope had no effect on the functional expression of the protein (12Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,13Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), 105 cells were washed and resuspended in 200 Î¼l of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-5% fetal calf serum and 1 Î¼g of mouse M2 (anti-FLAG) monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or control mouse IgG1Îº antibody (BD PharMingen, San Jose, CA) for 30 min at 37 Â°C. As a secondary antibody, 1 Î¼g of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody IgG1Îº (BD PharMingen) was used. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and analyzed by FACS analysis (see above). Median value was determined using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson) histogram stat analysis for each curve. The average of two median fluorescence values (in arbitrary units) for similar curves from two independent experiments is presented under âResults.â For determination of the total amount of immunoreactive NCX1 protein, the cells were permeabilized before application of the primary antibody M2 or the control antibody using the IntraPrep permeabilization reagent (Immunotech, Marseille, France). To determine the surface expression of P-gp, MRK16 (a gift from Hoechst, Kawago City, Saitama, Japan), a monoclonal antibody against an external epitope of P-gp (20Germann U.A. Chambers T.C. Ambudkar S.V. Licht T. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1708-1716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), was used. 1 Î¼g of MRK16 or 5 Î¼g of an isotype control antibody (IgG2a) was added to the washed cells in 200 Î¼l of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated at 37 Â°C for 20 min. As a secondary antibody, 1 Î¼g of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2Îº (BD PharMingen) was used. HEK 293 cells were lysed with M-Per mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce), to which 1 mm dithiothreitol and the following protease inhibitors were added: aprotinin (Sigma), 17 Î¼g/ml; leupeptin (Sigma), 2 Î¼g/ml; pepstatin (Sigma), 2 Î¼g/ml; and AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) (Sigma), 1 mm. SDS-PAGE was carried out by standard procedures (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) using either 10% or 4â20% gradient precast polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000 for Western blot analysis: anti-cyclophilin A (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.), anti-FKBP59/HSP56 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.), anti-cyclophilin B (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), and anti-FKBP12 (Affinity BioReagents). Detection of the antigen-antibody complexes was done with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) using ECL reagents purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. or Pierce. NCX1 isoform-expressing HEK 293 cells were treated with or without CsA and analyzed similarly by Western blot. For analysis of total cell extracts, 30 Î¼g of cell protein derived from a single well of a 12-well plate was used. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 Î¼m), leupeptin (10 Î¼g/ml), and pepstatin (10 Î¼g/ml) were added to the cells before solubilization. To detect the level of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein AbO-8, a polyclonal antibody directed against a pentadecapeptide corresponding to amino acids 649â663 of the rat heart exchanger was used (12Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Preparation, testing, and purification of the antibodies were done as described previously (12Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Furman I. Cook O. Kasir J. Low W. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19120-19127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was used to detect antigen-antibody complexes with the Amersham Biosciences, Inc. ECL kit. To examine the effects of CsA on the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, we have transfected HEK 293 cells with fn-rbe-2 orfn-rhe-1, two rat isoforms of the NCX1 gene. The transfected cells were exposed to 2â20 Î¼m CsA or an equal volume of Me2SO (which never exceeded 1% of the assay volume), and Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake was determined 24 h after transfection, as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Fig. 1summarizes the results of these experiments. It can be seen that exposure of the cells expressing the rat heart exchanger RHE-1 (âª) or the rat brain exchanger RBE-2 (â) to CsA results in inhibition of Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake could be detected at 2 Î¼m CsA. Exposure of the cells expressing the transporter to â¥20 Î¼m CsA resulted in a decrease of transport activity to about 20% relative to that expressed in the absence of the drug. Higher concentrations of CsA could not be tested in transport experiments because at concentrations above 20 Î¼m, the numerous washes included in the experimental protocol led to excessive cell peeling from the adherent surfaces. CsA had no effect on the transport assay itself because addition of the drug to the solutions used for the assay (but not to the transporter-expressing cells) did not result in a decrease in the Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake (data not shown). To study the effects of CsA on the surface and total expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX1, HEK 293 cells were transfected with the cloned amino-terminal FLAG-tagged Na+-Ca2+ exchangers. Surface expression was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity using FACS analysis (for details, see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Cells were labeled with the monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody or the control IgG1Îº antibody as primary antibodies. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used as the secondary antibody. The total amount of immunoreactive Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein in transfected cells was analyzed in a similar manner, except that the cells were permeabilized prior to application of the primary antibody or the control antibody. Fig. 2, AâD, shows the surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger FN-RBE-2 without (Fig. 2A) and with application of 0.1 (Fig.2B), 10 (Fig. 2C), and 20 Î¼m (Fig.2D) CsA. It can be seen that the fluorescence of M2 antibody-labeled cells decreases in a concentration-dependent manner that parallels the decrease of transport activity (Fig. 1). The two population peaks shown in Fig.2, AâD, represent the nontransfected cells (left peak, lower level of fluorescence) and the transfected cells (right peak). Although the efficiency of transfection might vary somewhat from dish to dish, in this experiment it did not change significantly, and there is no change in the extent of left peak, the population of cells exhibiting a lower level of fluorescence (nontransfected cells). CsA treatment changed only the surface expression of the exchanger protein, which is demonstrated by the change in fluorescence of the right peak (the population of transfected cells). Similar results were also obtained when FN-RHE-1 was expressed in HEK 293 cells (data not shown). We have also examined the effect of CsA on the amount of total immunoreactive Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein. The total amount of immunoreactive protein detected in transfected cells did not change significantly when these cells were treated with 2â50 Î¼mCsA. Fig. 3 shows the total exchanger protein expression detected by AbO-8, a polyclonal antibody directed against a pentadecapeptide corresponding to amino acids 649â663 of the rat heart exchanger (12Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The same amount of protein (30 Î¼g) was loaded in each lane. All transfections were done in parallel.Lane A shows control, fn-rbe-2-transfected cells, and lanes BâF show transfected cells exposed to 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 Î¼m CsA, respectively. Similar results were obtained when FACS analysis was used to detect the total amount of exchanger protein. The control antibody curve reveals an average median fluorescence (in arbitrary units) of 27.52. The average median value for M2 binding is 243.71 arbitrary units, whereas treatment of the cells with 10 Î¼m CsA did not change significantly the median fluorescence value of M2 binding (229.79 arbitrary units). The inhibitory effects of CsA on the transport activity and surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger were not restricted to the HEK 293 expression system. Similar results were obtained when we expressed the cloned NCX1 gene in the recombinant vaccinia virus VTF-7/HeLa cell expression system (data not shown).Figure 3Western analysis of HEK 293 cells expressing the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein without and with exposure to CsA. Protein derived from cells expressing FN-RBE-2 (lane A) or FN-RBE-2 after exposure to 2 (lane B), 5 (lane C), 10 (lane D), 20 (lane E), and 50 Î¼m (lane F) CsA was separated by SDS-PAGE. 30 Î¼g of protein derived from a single well of a 12-well plate was loaded in each lane. The polyclonal antibody AbO-8 (see âExperimental Proceduresâ) was used for Western blot analysis. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used to detect antigen-antibody complexes by ECL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether the inhibitory effects of CsA on the Na+-Ca2+exchanger are linked to its immunosuppressive properties, we have determined the effect of the weakly immunosuppressive analogue, CsD, and the nonimmunosuppressant analogue of CsD, PSC833, on the transport activity and the surface and total expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. CsD, added to transfected HEK 293 cells at concentrations of 5â50 Î¼m, had no effect on Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake, on the surface expression, and on the total amount of immunoreactive exchanger protein of both FN-RBE-2 and FN-RHE-1 (data not shown). However, exposure of the transfected cells to PSC833 resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in transport activity and surface expression. Fig. 4 shows the effect of 3â10 Î¼m PSC833 on Na+ gradient Ca2+ uptake of the rat heart exchanger RHE-1 expressed in HEK 293 cells. The surface expression pattern in transfected cells exposed or not exposed to 10 Î¼m PSC833 paralleled the transport data: control antibody curve reveals an average median of 45.68 arbitrary units. Average median value for surface M2 binding is 436.15 arbitrary units, whereas treatment of the cells with 10 Î¼m PSC833 significantly changed the average median fluorescence value of M2 binding (193.39 arbitrary units). The corresponding amounts of total exchanger protein detected in permeabilized cells without and with exposure of the cells to 10 Î¼m PSC833 were similar: average median florescence values of M2 binding were 268.0 and 225.26 arbitrary units, respectively (average median florescence value of control antibody binding is 115.23 arbitrary units). In a manner similar to CsA, PSC833 inhibited both the transport activity and surface expression of the protein in a concentration-dependent manner. No significant effects were observed on the total amount of exchanger protein. Similar results were also obtained when the rat brain isoform NCX1.5 was expressed. To elucidate the cellular processes responsible for the effects of CsA on transport activity and surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, we exposed cells expressing the NCX1 or NCX1.5 gene products to FK506 (5â50 Î¼m) and to rapamycin (2â50 Î¼m). These drugs had no effect on the transport activity, surface expression, and total amount of exchanger protein expressed in transfected cells (data not shown). Similarly, exposure of transfected cells to rapamycin had no effect on Na+-dependent Ca2+uptake, surface expression, or total expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (data not shown). Because CsA and PSC833 are substrates of P-gp and are used as reversal agents to combat drug resistance in cancer cells (9Smith A.J. Mayer U. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine whether the effects of CsA and PSC833 on the transport activity and surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+exchanger persist when HEK 293 cells are also co-transfected with both the cloned fn-rbe-2 and MDR1 genes. According to MRK16 and M2 monoclonal antibody staining (Fig.5, B and C), a large majority of the transfected cells express both proteins. The transport activity of FN-RBE-2 and P-gp was determined in cells transfected separately with each transporter and in co-transfected cells, without and with CsA. Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in the absence and presence of 10 Î¼m CsA was similar in fn-rbe-2-transfected cells and in cells co-transfected with fn-rbe-2 andMDR1. The relative transport activity in cells exposed to 10 Î¼m CsA was 28.7% (S.D. = 3.92%) and 36.12% (S.D. = 5.88%), respectively. RBE-2 expression did not change the activity of P-gp (using rhodamine 123 dye) in the absence (Fig. 5A) or presence (data not shown) of CsA. MRK16 and M2 staining revealed the same pattern: the surface expression of P-gp was not changed by co-transfection of fn-rbe-2 with the MDR1 (Fig.5B). The surface expression of RBE-2 was similar in cells expressing this protein alone and in cells co-expressing this protein with P-gp. CsA inhibited the surface expression of RBE-2, regardless of whether RBE-2 was expressed alone or with P-gp (Fig.5C). MRK16 staining of P-glycoprotein-expressing cells was not altered by CsA treatment. The curve of MRK16 binding reveals a median fluorescence of 154.78 arbitrary units. Treatment of the cells with 10 Î¼m CsA did not significantly change the median fluorescence value of MRK16 binding (155.06 arbitrary units). We have also explored the possibility that application of CsA might correct the kinesis to the surface membrane of some ER-retained mutants of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in a manner similar to its effect on ER-retained maturation-impaired mutants of P-glycoprotein (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). FN-C13 (fn-rbe-2/F913âStop), a FLAG epitope-tagged carboxyl-terminal-truncated, surface expression-incompetent mutant of RBE-2 (13Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was expressed in HEK 293 cells (without and with CsA treatment). No transport activity was detected in whole HEK 293 cells transfected with FN-C13 without or with exposure of the transfected cells to 5â20 Î¼m CsA (data not shown). No surface expression of FN-C13 was detected in the transfected cells without or with 5â20 Î¼m CsA treatment (data not shown). The fluorescence intensity that was measured using control antibody overlapped the fluorescence intensity obtained by M2 binding to the cells that were not treated or treated with different concentrations of CsA, suggesting that the drug did not induce surface expression of this mutant protein. To assess whether the differences in sensitivity of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX1 expressed in HEK 293 cells to CsA and FK506 resulted from differences in expression pattern of the respective immunophilin targets, we carried out Western blot analysis of HEK 293 cell extracts using antibodies against cyclophilin A (CyPA18), cyclophilin B (CyPB21), FKBP12, and FKBP59. All the immunophilins tested were expressed in HEK 293 cells before and after transfection (with the plasmid vector or the clonedfn-rbe-2), without and with CsA treatment (data not shown). In this work, we have shown that CsA inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the transport activity and surface expression of the rat heart and rat brain isoforms of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX1 expressed in HEK 293 cells. CsA did not reduce the specific transport activity of the surface-expressed Na+-Ca2+ exchanger because addition of the drug to the assay rather than to the transfected cells did not have any effect on Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies of CsA-treated cells clearly demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of surface-expressed protein. Among the different drugs that we tested, only the nonimmunosuppressive PSC833 (23Sonneveld P. Marie J.P. Huisman C. Vekhoff A. Schoester M. Faussat A.M. van Kapel J. Groenewegen A. Charnick S.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4226-4233PubMed Google Scholar) mimicked the effects of CsA. The weakly immunosuppressive CsD (7Sadeg N. Pham-Huy C. Rucay P. Righenzi S. Halle-Pannenko O. Claude J.R. Bismuth H. Duc H.T. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1993; 15: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is chemically related to both CsA and PSC833 (6Lush R.M. Meadows B. Fojo A.T. Kalafsky G. Smith H.T. Bates S. Figg W.D. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the two macrolides, FK506 and rapamycin, had no detectable effect on transport activity and surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, although we exposed the NCX1-expressing cells to concentrations as high as 50 Î¼m. The effects of CsA and PSC833 on the surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger expressed transiently in HEK 293 cells are probably posttranslational and do not involve calcineurin-dependent transcriptional regulation (26Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, the total amount of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein expressed in CsA- and PSC833-treated cells was similar to the amount of immunoreactive exchanger protein detected in untreated cells. Second, surface expression was reduced by both the immunosuppressive CsA and the nonimmunosuppressive PSC833. Third, it was recently shown (27Li L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that calcineurin is not involved in developmental regulation of transcription of NCX1 and NCX3 gene products in cerebellar granule cells. Fourth, the concentrations of CsA that inhibit calcineurin-mediated transcriptional regulatory effects are in the nanomolar range (26Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar), whereas a micromolar range of CsA was required to inhibit transport activity and surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger.

Because both immunosuppressive CsA and nonimmunosuppressive PSC833 inhibit the surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX1 posttranslationally, the involvement of their cyclophilin targets in the folding of the exchanger protein is implied. We do not know at present whether this is mediated by inhibition of the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of cyclophilin A (cytosolic) or B (ER-resident) (8Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), inactivation of the chaperone-like activity of cyclophilin A or B (28Ivery M.T. Med. Res.

Each of these could provide a plausible explanation for the reduction of surface expression and transport activity of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX1. Surface expression reduction by immunosuppressive CsA but not SDZ-211-811, its nonimmunosuppressive analogue, was demonstrated for the homo-oligomeric acetylcholine receptor containing the Î±7 subunit and the homo-oligomeric 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes (33Helekar S.A.

The effect could be reversed by overexpression of exogenous rat brain cyclophilin but not by expression of cyclophilin bearing a mutation within the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase domain.

Because FKBP12 and FKBP59 are expressed in HEK 293 cells, the absence of these two target immunophilins is not responsible for the insensitivity of our system to this immunosuppressant. It is interesting that surface expression of Na+ channels in adrenal chromaffin cells was up-regulated by all three drugs (CsA, FK506, and rapamycin) (38Shiraishi S. Yanagita T. Kobayashi H.

Reduction of surface expression by CsA and PSC833 of the Na+-Ca2+exchanger NCX1, by the same or a different pathway, might have considerable effects on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis in view of the transporters' major role in the regulation of cell Ca2+ ion concentration. Based on the changing membrane potential values, the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is involved in both Ca2+ extrusion and Ca2+ influx (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Its reduced surface expression can lead to increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in resting cells. It can also result in reduced Ca2+ influx in above reversal potential-depolarized cells, which is of importance in the heart (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol.

Whether the actions of CsA and PSC833 are mediated by inhibition of the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of cyclophilin or by its chaperone-like activity, the surface expression of the three gene products might be affected by exposure of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger-expressing cells to CsA or PSC833. However, further research has to be done, both in heterologous expression systems and in cells endogenously expressing the Na+-Ca2+ exchangers, to elucidate the mechanism of action of CsA and PSC833 on modulation of cell surface expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein.

The possible biological implications of the phasing of RecA monomers in presynaptic DNA-protein cofilaments are discussed. single-stranded dimethyl sulfate adenosine 5â²-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) double-stranded RecA protein is the central component of homologous recombination in Escherichia coli. In the last few years a number of RecA protein analogues from different sources have been characterized. That these proteins exhibit rather similar properties suggests that the fundamental features of homologous recombination are common in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (for review, see Refs. 1Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 509-552Google Scholar and 2Bianco I.P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosc. 1998; 3: 570-603Google Scholar). In vitro, the first step of RecA-promoted strand exchange reaction is the formation of a RecA protein complex with single-stranded DNA (presynaptic complex). RecA protein monomers bind cooperatively, completely cover the DNA, and thus form a close-packed DNA-protein co-filament. The most widely accepted binding stoichiometry is that each RecA monomer interacts with 3 nucleotides of single-stranded (ss)1 DNA (3Takahashi M. Kubista M. Norden B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 137-147Google Scholar,4Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17050-17054Google Scholar). Thus, the repeat unit of the presynaptic complex should correspond to 3 nucleotides interacting with one RecA monomer. Earlier we demonstrated that when RecA protein binding is initiated on a fluorescent dye molecule attached to the 5â²-end of an oligonucleotide there is a modulation of the DMS reactivity of a guanine residue along the oligonucleotide with a period of 3 bases (5Volodin A.A. Smirnova H.A. Bocharova T.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 325-328Google Scholar). This result indicated that there was a strictly ordered (phased) arrangement of RecA monomers on the dye-tagged oligonucleotides. In the present study we have asked the question of whether natural DNA contains some features that can influence the positioning of RecA monomers. Homologous recombination is considered to proceed mainly in a sequence-independent manner. At the same time, however, it has been demonstrated that there are some preferred DNA binding and pairing sequences for RecA and the chi-site sequence is among these (6Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1890-1903Google Scholar). The chi-site is a recombination hot spot in E. coli (7Lam S.T. Stahl M.M. McMilin K.D. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1974; 77: 425-433Google Scholar) with the sequence -GCTGGTGG (8Smith G.R. Kunes S.M. Schultz D.W. Taylor A. Triman K.L. Cell. 1981; 24: 429-436Google Scholar) that contains two 3-base repeats that conform with the RecA protein-DNA binding stoichiometry and might provide a physical basis for the ordered arrangement of RecA monomers in RecA protein complexes with chi-containing DNA. For these reasons the chi-site sequence has been chosen in the present study as an example of a DNA sequence that may influence the positioning of RecA monomers along a DNA strand. The present study provides evidence that DNA sequences can influence the phasing of RecA monomers in presynaptic RecA-DNA complexes. That is, that natural DNAs can introduce some order in the arrangement of the RecA monomers in complexes with DNA participating in homologous recombination. The possible biological implications of this phenomenon are discussed. RecA protein was purified by the method of Cox et al. (18Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4676-4678Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by automated Î²-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite DNA synthesis on a 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). All oligonucleotides were purified by PAGE with a standard protocol (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed.

Radioactive label was introduced on the 5â²-end of an oligonucleotide with the use of polynucleotide kinase (Promega) or on the 3â²-end via the attachment of an additional nucleotide ([Î±-32P]ATP) with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.

RecA protein complexes with oligonucleotides were formed by incubating 15 Î¼m single-stranded oligonucleotides and 6.5 Î¼m protein in the presence of 0.25 mm ATPÎ³S in a buffer containing 20 mm of triethanolamine acetate (TEA-Ac) (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgAc, 5% glycerol at 37 Â°C for 30 min. The complexes formed were chilled on ice, and DMS was added to a final concentration of 0.4%. After 30 min at 0 Â°C the reaction was stopped by the addition of mercaptoethanol and SDS (to 0.2%) followed by ethanol precipitation. DNA cleavage reactions were performed at 95 Â°C by two successive incubations: 10 min in 10 mm TEA-Ac (pH 7.5) and 10 min in 0.1 mNaOH. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by visualization and quantitation in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The electrophoretic profiles were normalized to the signal amplitudes for unmodified oligonucleotides. The approach used was described earlier (5Volodin A.A. Smirnova H.A. Bocharova T.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 325-328Google Scholar) and is briefly outlined here. The oligonucleotides used for the formation of complexes with RecA protein contained a chi-site sequence at different locations and a DNA sequence (referred to as a âªcontrol sequenceâ«) located in the same position within the oligonucleotide. An example of the oligonucleotides and a general outline of the experimental approach is presented in Fig. 1. The control sequence contained four guanine bases (designated in Fig. 1Aby 1â4) conveniently modifiable with DMS. Whereas in ss-DNAÂ·RecA complexes the guanine bases react with DMS with the same efficiency as in free ss-DNA, the reactivity of guanine toward DMS is increased in RecA-double-stranded (ds) DNA complexes (5;9). Therefore, to apply the DNA chemical modification method, two shorter oligonucleotides complementary to different regions in the chi-site containing oligonucleotide were added after formation of RecAÂ·ss-oligonucleotide presynaptic complexes (Fig. 1B). One of these oligonucleotide annealed to the control sequence, another to the chi-site-containing region. This experimental design resulted in the formation of RecA protein ds-DNA complexes in these regions and allowed us to characterize the arrangement of RecA monomers in both of these regions. Fig. 2 presents the results of DMS modification of RecA protein complexes with 5â²-end-radiolabeled oligonucleotides (Table I, series I). The patterns of DMS modification in the control sequence region exhibit periodic changes that depend on the position of chi along the oligonucleotides. A comparison of the modification efficiency of the two neighboring G residues in the control sequences (G-2 and G-3) reveals changes that proceed as a result of the shift of the chi-site by one nucleotide (compare lanes 1 and 2; 2and 3; 3 and 4). That the pattern reverts after a shift of the chi-site by 3 nucleotides can be gleaned by comparing lanes 1 and 4. Thus, the modification pattern shows a repeat with a period of 3 nucleotides. Analysis of the relative reactivity of each of the other G residues in the control sequence confirms the presence of a 3-nucleotide periodicity in the modification pattern. According to their âªin phaseâ« location (3 nucleotides apart from each other), the G-1 and G-2 residues are always characterized by similar reactivity changes. On the other hand, the reactivity of G-4, in accordance with its âªout of phaseâ« location relative to the G-3, G-2, and G-1 residues does not correlate with the reactivity of any of these 3 residues, but also exhibits a periodic variation depending on the position of the chi-site (compare scans 1 and 4). As expected there is not a dependence of the modification pattern on the distance between the chi-site and the control sequence on naked duplex DNA and in the absence of RecA the modification patterns of the control sequence was the same for all the oligonucleotides (data not shown). The results presented demonstrate that in RecA protein complexes with these oligonucleotides RecA monomers tend to arrange in a phased manner depending on the position of chi in the oligonucleotide. This phenomenon is similar to the phasing of RecA on a fluorescent dye molecule located at the 5â²-end of an oligonucleotide described earlier (5Volodin A.A. Smirnova H.A. Bocharova T.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 325-328Google Scholar). An additional experiment was carried out where only the complementary oligonucleotide to the control sequence was added to the ss-DNAÂ·RecA complex (see scheme in Fig. 1B). The changes of the modification pattern of the control sequence observed were the same as when both complementary oligonucleotides were added (data not shown). This result indicates that the phasing of RecA monomers occurs when RecA binds to the chi sequence in ss-DNA. Similar modification patterns were obtained for the case of RecA complexes with 3â²-labeled oligonucleotides with a dephosphorylated 5â²-end (not shown). The above example demonstrated the capability of the chi-site to influence the phasing in the 5â²- to 3â²-end direction. To check that this influence expands in the opposite direction as well, another set of radiolabeled oligonucleotides was used (Table I, series II and III). These oligonucleotides contained chi in the central part of the oligonucleotide and control sequences near both oligonucleotide ends. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 the shift of the position of chi along the oligonucleotide induces changes of the modification patterns in both directions from chi (compare scans 2 and 3 in Fig. 3) and confirms the capability of chi to influence phasing in both directions. Fig. 3 shows that in the case of 3â²-labeled oligonucleotides with a dephosphorylated 5â²-end the characteristic changes in the modification pattern are to some extent greater than for the case of oligonucleotides with phosphorylated radiolabeled 5â²-ends. A possible explanation is that the 5â²-end phosphate acts as another phasing origin for RecA in competition with chi. An analysis of the modification patterns of the chi-site regions also reveals changes in the modification of the G residues in those regions that correlates with the position of the chi-site in the oligonucleotides. In this case also, the modification pattern reverts after a shift by 3 nucleotides (Fig. 3, compare profiles 1and 4). This last result also may be explained by the presence of some origin of RecA phasing other than the chi-site and that the shift of the chi-site relative to this origin induces changes in the chi-site pattern of modification. To locate this origin of phasing, a series of oligonucleotides with the same internal sequences but containing additional (or removed) nucleotides near the 5â²- or 3â²-ends were used. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, changing the oligonucleotide length by adding (or removing) nucleotides at the phosphorylated 5â²-end of the oligonucleotide resulted in corresponding changes both in the chi-site and the control sequence modification patterns whereas the introduction of an additional nucleotide to the 3â²-end had no effect (data not shown). This result demonstrates the influence of a phosphorylated 5â²-end on the phasing of RecA. Therefore, the modification patterns of the control sequences exhibit a dependence upon both the chi-site position and the changes of the oligonucleotides lengths by adding (or removing) nucleotides from the phosphorylated 5â²-end. These results may be explained by the presence in solution of a mixture of two kinds of complexes. In one the binding of RecA monomers has been initiated at chi and generates periodic changes in the modification pattern of the control sequence in the set of oligonucleotides of the same length (Figs. 2 and 3). In another kind of complexe the binding was initiated at the phosphorylated 5â²-end of the oligonucleotide (Fig. 4). These two modes of binding generate changes in both the control sequence and the chi-site modification patterns. The data presented demonstrate that a specific DNA sequence, in the present case the chi-site from E. coli, is able to influence the positioning of RecA monomers in recombinational protein-DNA filaments. The phasing occurs when the RecA protein interacts with ss-DNA; that is, when the presynaptic complex is formed and can be observed in both the 5â² and 3â² directions from the origin of phasing. If the RecA monomers have some preference to bind to a particular DNA sequence the cooperative binding of RecA will ensure that the ensuing closed-packed filament will tend to be phased with respect to this sequence. Given that each RecA monomer contains three different sites of binding for DNA nucleotides, the local environment of one of these sites within a RecA monomer is either more hydrophobic (10Johnsrud L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5314-5318Google Scholar) or alters the accessibility of guanines such that G residues at one of these sites is most easily modified. It is this differential reactivity of G residues to DMS in the DNA in a RecAÂ·DNA complex that allows us to observe the phasing of RecA monomers (Fig.5). That is, when a guanine is situated in one of these sites a stronger modification signal is observed (Fig.5, A, B, and D) and when guanines appear between these sites they exhibit a relatively low level of modification (Fig. 5C). The modification pattern reverts after the shift of the chi-site by 3 nucleotides (Fig. 5, Aand D) in agreement with the stoichiometry of RecA protein binding to ss-DNA. The exact structure of the DNA binding domain of RecA protein remains to be established. Unfortunately, there are no data that could resolve the different sites on RecA that interact with each of the 3 individual nucleotides bound to each monomer. As is evident from the variation of G-base reactivity toward DMS at the different sites in the RecA monomer, our data presented here and obtained previously (5Volodin A.A. Smirnova H.A. Bocharova T.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 325-328Google Scholar) show that individual nucleotides bind to distinct and distinguishable sites in each RecA monomer. In addition, that DNA sequences can influence the phasing of RecA implies the non-equivalence of the nucleotide binding sites and some base preference of the binding at each of the three sites. We do not suppose that the phasing of RecA is mediated exclusively by the chi-site sequence. Because the nucleotide binding centers of a RecA monomer differ in their affinity for different bases, thermodynamically favorable modes of RecA monomer arrangements (âphasingâ) should exist for RecA complexes on a wide range of non-uniform DNA sequences. Obviously, this phasing is more facile on sequences that exhibit a modulation of base sequence with a period of 3 nucleotides (for example, in regions of DNA with a strong codon bias). In preliminary experiments we have confirmed that a number of randomly chosen sequences can influence the phasing of RecA monomers to varying degrees (not shown). A detailed investigation of this question requires further study and would be more informative with a DNA modification agent that is not base-specific. In a bacterial cell RecA acts as a component of a rather complex protein machine (for review, see Ref. 11Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Google Scholar) and other components of the recombination/repair system may also influence the phasing of RecA. The physical non-equivalence of individual nucleotide binding sites in a RecA monomer raises the issue of the functional organization of recombinational protein-DNA complexes. The main function of RecA protein is to promote the recognition of homology between similar but not identical DNA molecules. Nucleotide bases bound at the 3 distinct sites of the RecA monomer may tolerate non-homology in a partner DNA quite differently, either before or during strand exchange. Such a triplet organization bears a striking resemblance to the structure of the protein coding regions in DNA, where the informational value of a nucleotide depends on its position inside a codon and, consequently, also exhibits a periodic variation with a period of 3 nucleotides. Additional studies are needed to answer the question of whether this is just a coincidence or a feature of functional importance in genetic processes promoted by RecA. We suggest a relationship between the phasing of RecA monomers with some functionally important features in DNA. For example, there are several facts about chi and the distribution (location) of G and T bases in coding regions of DNA that allow us to speculate about a mechanism by which the RecA monomers on ss-DNA can be phased with the protein coding frames of this DNA. Chi is not only a recombinational hotspot but is also one of the most overrepresented sequences inE. coli (12Blattner F.R. Plunkett 3rd, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Google Scholar) with an extremely strong tendency to be phased relative to the protein coding frame (13Colbert T. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 485-488Google Scholar). The 3 nucleotide periodicity in the arrangement of G and T bases is a property of the codon bias ofE. coli DNA (13Colbert T. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 485-488Google Scholar, 14Biaudet V. El Karoui M. Gruss A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 666-669Google Scholar) in general and particularly in the vicinity of chi (15Tracy R.B. Chedin F. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 205-206Google Scholar). The propensity of DNA sequences to influence the positioning of RecA demonstrated here together with the observations that both chi and the GT-islands of preferred pairing (6Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1890-1903Google Scholar) are in phase with open-reading frames allows us to suggest that in presynaptic complexes RecA monomers may be phased with respect to the protein coding frame. RecA phasing with respect to open-reading frames and the ability of RecA to significantly decrease the fidelity of heteroduplex formation (16Malkov V.A. Sastry L. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 168-177Google Scholar, 17Malkov V.A. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 317-330Google Scholar) compared with that of heteroduplex formation in the absence of protein might have an important role in permitting recombination between homologous but not identical protein encoding DNAs with different codon usage. If, for example, the phasing allows this âanti-proofreadingâ decrease in fidelity to be mostly at the third position in a codon, the wobble position could be more easily assimilated in genetic crosses. Such a decrease in fidelity in the third position of a codon could maximize the probability of exchanges between functionally active genes with different DNA sequences but encoding identical protein sequences as takes place, for example, in the process of horizontal gene transfer. This may not be the only possible role of the phasing of RecA monomers. Because of the plurality and complexity of the processes RecA protein participates in it is difficult to foresee all possible consequence of this phenomenon. Nevertheless, we suggest that the DNA sequence-dependent positioning of RecA monomers may be an important structural and functional feature of recombinational protein-DNA cofilaments. We thank Drs.
