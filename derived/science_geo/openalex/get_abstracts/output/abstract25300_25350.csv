https://openalex.org/W2418802570,"A technique called optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been developed for noninvasive cross-sectional imaging in biological systems. OCT uses low-coherence interferometry to produce a two-dimensional image of optical scattering from internal tissue microstructures in a way that is analogous to ultrasonic pulse-echo imaging. OCT has longitudinal and lateral spatial resolutions of a few micrometers and can detect reflected signals as small as approximately 10(-10) of the incident optical power. Tomographic imaging is demonstrated in vitro in the peripapillary area of the retina and in the coronary artery, two clinically relevant examples that are representative of transparent and turbid media, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2085836399,"Efficient synthetic methods required to assemble complex molecular arrays include reactions that are both selective (chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-) and economical in atom count (maximum number of atoms of reactants appearing in the products). Methods that involve simply combining two or more building blocks with any other reactant needed only catalytically constitute the highest degree of atom economy. Transition metal-catalyzed methods that are both selective and economical for formation of cyclic structures, of great interest for biological purposes, represent an important starting point for this long-term goal. The limited availability of raw materials, combined with environmental concerns, require the highlighting of these goals."
https://openalex.org/W2019818589,"A polyamide nucleic acid (PNA) was designed by detaching the deoxyribose phosphate backbone of DNA in a computer model and replacing it with an achiral polyamide backbone. On the basis of this model, oligomers consisting of thymine-linked aminoethylglycyl units were prepared. These oligomers recognize their complementary target in double-stranded DNA by strand displacement. The displacement is made possible by the extraordinarily high stability of the PNA-DNA hybrids. The results show that the backbone of DNA can be replaced by a polyamide, with the resulting oligomer retaining base-specific hybridization."
https://openalex.org/W2090971379,"The finding that astrocytes possess glutamate-sensitive ion channels hinted at a previously unrecognized signaling role for these cells. Now it is reported that cultured hippocampal astrocytes can respond to glutamate with a prompt and oscillatory elevation of cytoplasmic free calcium, visible through use of the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3. Two types of glutamate receptor--one preferring quisqualate and releasing calcium from intracellular stores and the other preferring kainate and promoting surface-membrane calcium influx--appear to be involved. Moreover, glutamate-induced increases in cytoplasmic free calcium frequently propagate as waves within the cytoplasm of individual astrocytes and between adjacent astrocytes in confluent cultures. These propagating waves of calcium suggest that networks of astrocytes may constitute a long-range signaling system within the brain."

Because bcl-2 can promote cell survival, we tested its impact in mice expressing an E mu-bcl-2 transgene within the T lymphoid compartment. The T cells showed remarkably sustained viability and some spontaneous differentiation in vitro. They also resisted killing by lymphotoxic agents. Although total T cell numbers and the rate of thymic involution were unaltered, the response to immunization was enhanced, consistent with reduced death of activated T cells. No T cells reactive with self-superantigens appeared in the lymph nodes, but an excess was found in the thymus. These observations, together with previous findings on B cells, suggest that modulated bcl-2 expression is a determinant of life and death in normal lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1969583788,"Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) dissociate into guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound alpha subunits and a complex of beta and gamma subunits after interaction with receptors. The GTP-alpha subunit complex activates appropriate effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase, retinal phosphodiesterase, phospholipase C, and ion channels. G protein beta gamma subunits have been found to have regulatory effects on certain types of adenylyl cyclase. In the presence of Gs alpha, the alpha subunit of the G protein that activates adenylyl cyclase, one form of adenylyl cyclase was inhibited by beta gamma, some forms were activated by beta gamma, and some forms were not affected by beta gamma. These interactions suggest mechanisms for communication between distinct signal-transducing pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2015037737,"Airway eosinophilia, epithelial desquamation, and hyperresponsiveness are characteristics of the airway inflammation underlying bronchial asthma. The contribution of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) to eosinophil migration and airway responsiveness was studied. ICAM-1 partially mediated eosinophil adhesion to endothelium in vitro and was upregulated on inflamed bronchial endothelium in vivo. ICAM-1 expression was also upregulated on inflamed airway epithelium in vitro and in vivo. In a primate model of asthma, a monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 attenuated airway eosinophilia and hyperresponsiveness. Thus, antagonism of ICAM-1 may provide a therapeutic approach to reducing airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and asthma symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2093423926,"Programmed cell death is an active process of self destruction that is important in both the development and maintenance of multicellular animals. The molecular mechanisms controlling activation or suppression of programmed cell death are largely unknown. Apoptosis, a morphologically and biochemically defined type of programmed cell death commonly seen in vertebrates, was found to be initiated during baculovirus replication in insect cells. A specific viral gene product, p35, was identified as being responsible for blocking the apoptotic response. Identification of the function of this gene will allow further definition of the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of programmed cell death and may identify the role of apoptosis in invertebrate viral defense systems."
https://openalex.org/W2053315601,"Inferior temporal (IT) cortex is critical for visual memory, but it is not known how IT neurons retain memories while new information is streaming into the visual system. Single neurons were therefore recorded from IT cortex of two rhesus monkeys performing tasks that required them to hold items in memory while concurrently viewing other items. The neuronal response to an incoming visual stimulus was attenuated if it matched a stimulus actively held in working memory, even when several other stimuli intervened. The neuronal response to novel stimuli declined as the stimuli became familiar to the animal. IT neurons appear to function as adaptive mnemonic ""filters"" that preferentially pass information about new, unexpected, or not recently seen stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1982582935,"The high degree of tubulin heterogeneity in neurons is controlled mainly at the posttranslational level. Several variants of alpha-tubulin can be posttranslationally labeled after incubation of cells with [3H]acetate or [3H]glutamate. Peptides carrying the radioactive moiety were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid analysis, Edman degradation sequencing, and mass spectrometric analysis of these peptides led to the characterization of a posttranslational modification consisting of the successive addition of glutamyl units on the gamma-carboxyl group of a glutamate residue (Glu445). This modification, localized within a region of alpha-tubulin that is important in the interactions of tubulin with microtubule-associated proteins and calcium, could play a role in regulating microtubule dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2008009726,"The binding of cytosolic coat proteins to organelles may regulate membrane structure and traffic. Evidence is presented that a small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein, the adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor (ARF), reversibly associates with the Golgi apparatus in an energy, GTP, and fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive manner similar to, but distinguishable from, the 110-kilodalton cytosolic coat protein beta-COP. Addition of beta gamma subunits of G proteins inhibited the association of both ARF and beta-COP with Golgi membranes that occurred upon incubation with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S). Thus, heterotrimeric G proteins may function to regulate the assembly of coat proteins onto the Golgi membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1538763799,"The multidrug transporter, initially identified as a multidrug efflux pump responsible for resistance of cultured cells to natural product cytotoxic drugs, is normally expressed on the apical membranes of excretory epithelial cells in the liver, kidney, and intestine. This localization suggests that the multidrug transporter may have a normal physiological role in transporting cytotoxic compounds or metabolites. In the liver, hepatectomy or treatment with chemical carcinogens increases expression of the MDR1 gene which encodes the multidrug transporter. To evaluate conditions which increase MDR1 gene expression, we have investigated the induction of the MDR1 gene by physical and chemical environmental insults in the renal adenocarcinoma cell line HTB-46. There are two strong heat shock consensus elements in the major MDR1 gene promoter. Exposure of HTB-46 cells to heat shock, sodium arsenite, or cadmium chloride led to a 7- to 8-fold increase in MDR1 mRNA levels. MDR1 RNA levels did not change following glucose starvation or treatment with 2-deoxyglucose and the calcium ionophore A23187, conditions which are known to activate the expression of another family of stress proteins, the glucose-regulated proteins. The levels of the multidrug transporter, P-glycoprotein, as measured by immunoprecipitation, were also increased after heat shock and sodium arsenite treatment. This increase in the level of the multidrug transporter in HTB-46 cells correlated with a transient increase in resistance to vinblastine following heat shock and arsenite treatment. These results suggest that the MDR1 gene is regulatable by environmental stress."

https://openalex.org/W2023506304,"A recombinant gene encoding human growth hormone (hGH) was stably introduced into cultured myoblasts with a retroviral vector. After injection of genetically engineered myoblasts into mouse muscle, hGH could be detected in serum for 3 months. The fate of injected myoblasts was assessed by coinfecting the cells with two retroviral vectors, one encoding hGH and the other encoding beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli. These results provide evidence that myoblasts, which can fuse into preexisting multinucleated myofibers that are vascularized and innervated, may be advantageous as vehicles for systemic delivery of recombinant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2023902482,"Bacterial colonization of the developing light organ of the squid Euprymna scolopes is shown to be highly specific, with the establishment of a successful association resulting only when the juvenile host is exposed to seawater containing one of a subset of Vibrio fischeri strains. Before a symbiotic infection the organ has elaborate epithelial structures covered with cilia and microvilli that are involved in the transfer of bacteria to the incipient symbiotic tissue. These structures regressed within days following infection; however, they were retained in uninfected animals, suggesting that the initiation of symbiosis influences, and is perhaps a prerequisite for, the normal developmental program of the juvenile host."
https://openalex.org/W2034511195,"The ability to stably deliver recombinant proteins to the systemic circulation would facilitate the treatment of a variety of acquired and inherited diseases. To explore the feasibility of the use of genetically engineered myoblasts as a recombinant protein delivery system, stable transfectants of the murine C2C12 myoblast cell line were produced that synthesize and secrete high levels of human growth hormone (hGH) in vitro. Mice injected with hGH-transfected myoblasts had significant levels of hGH in both muscle and serum that were stable for at least 3 weeks after injection. Histological examination of muscles injected with beta-galactosidase-expressing C2C12 myoblasts demonstrated that many of the injected cells had fused to form multinucleated myotubes. Thus, genetically engineered myoblasts can be used for the stable delivery of recombinant proteins into the circulation."

https://openalex.org/W2025640298,"Acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are members of a family of proteins that are broad-spectrum mitogens, have diverse hormone-like activities, and function in tumorigenesis. FGF's ability to raise the concentration of intracellular calcium ion suggests that FGF could induce the synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and consequently vasodilation. Systemic administration of FGF decreased arterial blood pressure. This effect was mediated by EDRF and by adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium ion channels. The hypotensive effect of FGF was segregated from its mitogenic activity by protein engineering. These results extend the range of FGF autocrine activities and potential therapeutic applications, emphasize the role of endothelium as an arterial blood pressure--regulating organ, and provide insight on the structural basis of FGF functions."
https://openalex.org/W2147599690,"The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine-threonine kinases has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of signaling cascades. One member of this family, eye-PKC, is expressed exclusively in the Drosophila visual system. The inaC (inactivation-no-afterpotential C) locus was shown to be the structural gene for eye-PKC. Analysis of the light response from inaC mutants showed that this kinase is required for the deactivation and rapid desensitization of the visual cascade. Light adaptation was also defective in inaC mutant flies. In flies carrying the retinal degeneration mutation rdgB, absence of eye-PKC suppressed photoreceptor cell degeneration. These results indicate that eye-PKC functions in the light-dependent regulation of the phototransduction cascade in Drosophila."

https://openalex.org/W1564338477,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is a major rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis; its product, malonyl-CoA, also contributes to the regulation of fatty acid oxidation and elongation. Using monospecific antibodies directed against rat liver ACC and N- and C-terminal antipeptide antibodies raised against predicted sequences of the cloned ACC of Mr 265,000, we have identified a unique biotin-containing cytosolic protein of molecular mass 280,000 daltons that is distinct from this 265,000-dalton protein. This protein is uniquely expressed in rat cardiac and skeletal muscle but is co-expressed with the 265,000-dalton protein in rat liver, mammary gland, and brown adipose tissue. In the fed rat, white adipose tissue contains only the 265,000-dalton protein. Like the 265,000-dalton protein, the 280,000-dalton protein is present predominantly in the cytosolic fraction of liver. In the liver, the content of both proteins is diminished on fasting and increases on fasting/refeeding with a high carbohydrate diet. In contrast, the cardiac and skeletal muscle 280,000-dalton protein content is unaltered by nutritional manipulation. Avidin-Sepharose isolates of citrate-dependent ACC from the heart reveal only the 280,000-dalton protein, while white adipose tissue isolates show only the 265,000 form. These species differ in the sensitivity to citrate activation and in the Km for acetyl-CoA. Antibodies reactive with the 280,000-dalton protein on immunoblotting precipitate ACC activity in heart isolates, while white adipose ACC is precipitated only by antibodies specific for the 265,000-dalton species. However, in ACC isolates where both proteins are present, a heteroisozyme complex can be detected both by immunoprecipitation and by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We conclude that the 280,000-dalton protein is an isozyme of ACC, distinct from the previously cloned 265,000-dalton species. Its presence in cardiac and skeletal muscle, where fatty acid synthesis rates are low, suggest that it might play alternative roles in these tissues such as regulation of fatty acid oxidation or microsomal fatty acid elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2094608143,"In the Drosophila female the product of the germline stem cell, the cystoblast, gives rise to 16 interconnected cystocytes. One of them differentiates into the oocyte, while the 15 others become polyploid nurse cells. Bic-D is required for the differentiation of an oocyte and hence for fertility. Recessive mutations in Bic-D block the oocyte-specific accumulation of its own and other RNAs. Based on its properties and distribution, the Bic-D protein appears to be a component of a cytoskeletal transport or anchoring system. Additional results suggest that the phosphorylation of the Bic-D protein is essential for its accumulation in the pro-oocyte and that this process leads to the gradual localization to the pro-oocyte of factors required for oocyte differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1967521125,"Current methods for sequence-specific cleavage of large segments of DNA are severely limited because of the paucity of possible cleavage sites. A method is described whereby any Eco RI site can be targeted for specific cleavage. The technique is based on the ability of RecA protein from Escherichia coli to pair an oligonucleotide to its homologous sequence in duplex DNA and to form a three-stranded complex. This complex is protected from Eco RI methylase; after methylation and RecA protein removal, Eco RI restriction enzyme cleavage was limited to the site previously protected from methylation. When pairs of oligonucleotides are used, a specific fragment can be cleaved out of genomes. The method was tested on lambda phage, Escherichia coli, and human DNA. Fragments exceeding 500 kilobases in length and yields exceeding 80 percent could be obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2091079122,DNA bending is essential for the assembly of multiprotein complexes that contact several DNA sequence elements. An approach based on phasing analysis was developed that allows determination of both the directed DNA bend angle and the orientation of DNA bending. This technique has been applied to the analysis of DNA bending by the transcription regulatory proteins Fos and Jun. Complexes that contained different combinations of full-length and truncated Fos and Jun induced DNA bends of different magnitudes and orientations. The DNA bends induced by the individual proteins were determined on the basis of a quantitative model for DNA bending by dimeric complexes. This information was used to visualize the consequences of DNA bending by Fos and Jun for the structures of Fos-Jun-DNA and Jun-DNA complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2051530551,"Molecular dynamics simulations in three dimensions of particles that self-assemble to form two-dimensional, membrane-like objects are presented. Anisotropic, multibody forces, chosen so as to mimic real interactions between amphiphilic molecules, generate a finite rigidity and compressibility of the assembled membranes, as well as a finite line tension at their free edges. This model and its generalizations can be used to study a large class of phenomena taking place in fluctuating membranes. For instance, both fluid and solid-like phases, separated by a phase transition, are obtained and some of the large-scale properties of these membranes studied. In particular, thermal undulations of quasi-spherical fluid vesicles are analyzed, in a manner similar to recent experiments in lipid systems."
https://openalex.org/W2096391223,"The peripheral cytoplasm (periplasm) of the Drosophila blastoderm embryo is subdivided into apical and basal compartments by a layer of nuclei. We have demonstrated three classes of periplasmic transcript localization: apical, basal, and unlocalized (apical and basal), each of which depends on 3′ sequences. We define 3′ apical localization signals within the even-skipped, fushi tarazu, and hairy pair-rule segmentation genes and the α 1-tubulin and bicoid genes. 3′ human α-globin sequences direct transcripts basally. Transcript destination depends on transcript structure, not on transcript stability or chromosomal location. Apical transcripts direct apical compartmentalization of cytoplasmic protein. We propose that apical localization of pair-rule transcripts restricts lateral protein diffusion, thereby allowing pair-rule proteins to define sharp boundaries and precise spatial domains."
https://openalex.org/W1507015967,"In order to refine further our structural model of the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase (Arai, H., Terres, G., Pink, S., and Forgac, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8796-8802), we have extended our structural analysis to identify peripheral and glycosylated subunits of the pump as well as to identify subunits which are in close proximity in the native (H+)-ATPase complex. Treatment of the purified, reconstituted (H+)-ATPase with 0.30 M KI in the presence or absence of ATP or MgATP results in the release of the 73-, 58-, 40-, 34-, and 33-kDa subunits, leaving behind the 100-, 38-, 19-, and 17-kDa subunits in the membrane. Because the former group of polypeptides is released from the membrane in the absence of detergent, they correspond to peripheral membrane proteins. To determine which subunits are in close proximity, cross-linking of the purified (H+)-ATPase was carried out using the cleavable, bifunctional amino reagent 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. These studies indicate that contact regions exist between the 73- and 58-kDa subunits as well as between the 17-kDa subunit and the 40-, 34-, and 33-kDa subunits. To test for glycosylation of the (H+)-ATPase, the detergent-solubilized complex was treated with neuraminidase followed by electrophoresis and blotting using a peanut lectin/horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Galactose-inhibitable staining of the 100-kDa subunit, together with affinity chromatography of the intact (H+)-ATPase on peanut lectin agarose, indicates that the 100-kDa subunit is glycosylated, most likely at a site exposed on the luminal side of the membrane. These results, together with those presented in the preceding paper (Adachi, I., Arai, H., Pimental, R., and Forgac, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 960-966), were used in the construction of a refined model of the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1573917252,"In this investigation, we have demonstrated that the renal brush-border membrane of Fischer 344 rats from the Japanese Charles River Inc. specifically lacks dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) activity, whereas the renal brush-border membrane of Fischer 344 rats from three different sources within the United States possesses normal levels of DPP IV activity. Comparison of the brush-border proteins between Charles River (U.S.A.) Fischer 344 rats (DPP IV positive) and Japanese Charles River Fischer 344 rats (DPP IV negative) revealed that a protein band (Mr = 100,000), apparently identical with DPP IV, was absent in the membranes from Japanese Charles River Fischer 344 rats. We examined the handling of radiolabeled beta-casomorphin fragment 1-5 (Tyr-Pro-[3H]Phe-Pro-Gly), a specific substrate for DPP IV, in renal brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from DPP IV-positive and DPP IV-negative rats. Although the membrane vesicles from DPP IV-positive rats were able to hydrolyze the pentapeptide to di- and tripeptides with the subsequent active transport of these products via the H+ gradient-dependent peptide transport system, the membrane vesicles from DPP IV-negative rats failed to hydrolyze the pentapeptide and hence lacked the ability to transport the radiolabel actively from the parent peptide. The H+ gradient-dependent glycyl-sarcosine uptake and the Na+ gradient-dependent proline uptake, however, were normal in DPP IV-negative rats. Urine analysis revealed that the DPP IV-negative rats excreted proline- and hydroxyproline-containing peptides in significantly increased amounts in their urine compared with control rats. Furthermore, following intravenous administration of Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-NH2, a peptide that is exclusively hydrolyzed by DPP IV, urinary excretion of the peptide in the intact form was many-fold greater in DPP IV-negative rats than in control rats. These data provide conclusive evidence for the obligatory role of DPP IV in the renal handling of proline (and hydroxyproline)-containing peptides."

https://openalex.org/W2007552023,"The RNA substrate-binding site of the Tetrahymena ribozyme is connected to the catalytic core by the joining region . Although is not conserved among group I introns, small insertions or deletions in this sequence have dramatic effects, enhancing the turnover number and sequence specificity of ribozymecatalyzed RNA cleavage. Measurements of rate constants for individual steps in the reaction have revealed the basis of these improvements. Ironically, the higher turnover and specificity both result from decreased affinity for RNA, rather than better cleavage. These results provide evidence that the nonconserved sequence positions the RNA substrate to optimize tertiary interactions and ensure cleavage at the position corresponding to the 5′ splice site. The wild-type RNA is well adapted to its biological function, and its limitations in multiple turnover can be corrected by mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1513295024,"We recently proposed a structural model for the ATP-dependent proton pump from clathrin-coated vesicles (Arai, H., Terres, G., Pink, S., and Forgac, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8796-8802). To test this model further, we have carried out additional structural analysis of the (H+)-ATPase in both the detergent-solubilized and reconstituted states in this and the following paper (Adachi, I., Puopolo, K., Marquez-Sterling, N., Arai, H., and Forgac, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 967-973). The orientation of the reconstituted proton pump was determined by analyzing the effect of detergent on ATP hydrolysis and by quantitating the extent of labeling of luminally oriented subunits using a membrane-impermeant reagent. Greater than 90% of the reconstituted (H+)-ATPase is oriented with the cytoplasmic surface facing outward. Treatment of the reconstituted (H+)-ATPase with trypsin results in rapid cleavage of the 100-, 73-, 58-, 38-, and 34-kDa subunits and slower cleavage of the 40- and 33-kDa subunits, consistent with our previous results indicating that all of these polypeptides have some portion of their mass exposed to the cytoplasmic surface. The 19- and 17-kDa subunits, by contrast, appear resistant to cleavage by trypsin in both the detergent-solubilized and reconstituted states, consistent with their being buried extensively in the hydrophobic phase of the bilayer. Treatment of the enzyme with trypsin under conditions in which the 100-, 73-, 58-, 38-, and 34-kDa subunits have been cleaved results in a species which is virtually inactive with respect to proton transport but retains 50% of the original ATPase activity, suggesting that proteolysis has resulted in uncoupling of these two activities. Cleavage of both the 73- and 58-kDa subunits by trypsin at a site 1-2 kDa from the amino terminus is inhibited in the presence of 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP, consistent with the suggestion that both the 73- and 58-kDa subunits may be nucleotide binding proteins."

Although the self-assembling protein pilin is the major structural component of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae pilus fiber, several other proteins co-purified with pilin through the repeated solubilization-reassociation steps of the biochemical purification. Pilin solubilized in the nondenaturing detergent n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside remained an aggregate of about 100 kDa at pH 9.5, but was reduced to a 40-kDa dimer at pH 10.5, suggesting that assembly involves electrostatic interactions of lysine, tyrosine, or other side chains with high pKa values. Pilin dimers and aggregates of higher molecular mass were partially stable even in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and beta-mercaptoethanol. Removal of pilus-associated proteins and stabilization of pilin multimers permitted the reproducible crystallization of pilin. Three-dimensional needle- and plate-shaped crystals of purified N. gonorrhoeae pilin (strain MS11 variant C30) grew from 36 to 40% polyethylene glycol 400, pH 8.0-9.0, in space group C222, with cell dimensions a = 126.4, b = 121.2, c = 26.7 A and Vm = 2.84 A3/dalton for one molecule per asymmetric unit. The best crystals diffracted to 2.4 A resolution using synchrotron radiation, were stable to x-ray damage, and appear suitable for determination of the atomic structure. This approach of stabilizing and crystallizing an intermediate assembly state may be useful for other fiber-forming proteins, which have previously not been successfully crystallized in forms that diffract to atomic resolution."

This interacting region, which by computational modeling defines a three-dimensional macromotif in the catalytic domain, was also recognized by glycoprotein C (gC), a factor X receptor expressed on herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected endothelial cells. Peptidyl mimicry of each loop inhibited factor X binding to Mac-1 and gC, blocked monocyte generation of thrombin, and prevented monocyte adhesion to HSV-infected endothelium.

https://openalex.org/W1509932721,"Rat tyrosine hydroxylase has been expressed at high levels in Spodoptera frugiperda cells using a baculovirus expression system. A cDNA containing the coding region for PC12 tyrosine hydroxylase was inserted into the unique EcoRI site of the transfer vector pLJC8 to yield the recombinant vector pLJC9. Spodoptera frugiperda cells were then co-infected with pLJC9 and wild type Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Recombinant virus particles containing the cDNA for tyrosine hydroxylase were selected by hybridization with authentic tyrosine hydroxylase cDNA. Three recombinant viruses were plaque-purified. All expressed a protein of Mr = 55,000 which reacted with antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase. Forty-eight h after infection of cells with recombinant virus, the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the cell lysate was 30-100 nmol of dihydroxyphenylalanine produced/min/mg, consistent with 5-10% of the cell protein being tyrosine hydroxylase. Purification from 2.1 g of cells gave 5.8 mg of enzyme with a specific activity of 1.7 mumol of dihydroxyphenylalanine/min/mg. The purified enzyme is a tetramer of identical subunits, containing one covalently bound phosphoryl residue and 0.1 iron atom/subunit. No carbohydrate was detectable. Steady state kinetic results with tetrahydrobiopterin as substrate are consistent with a sequential mechanism for binding of tyrosine and tetrahydrobiopterin. Substrate inhibition occurs at tyrosine concentrations above 50 microM. Steady state kinetic parameters at pH 6.5 are Vmax = 74 min-1, KBH4 = 21 microM, KTyr = 9.4 microM, and Ko2 less than or equal to 6 microM. The Vmax value shows a broad pH optimum around pH 7. The KBH4 value is pH-dependent, increasing from about 20 microM below pH 7 to about 100 microM above pH 8. The KTyr value is independent of pH between pH 6 and pH 8.5."
https://openalex.org/W1583373947,"Eleven enzymes were measured in individual fibers of soleus and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles from two flight and two control (synchronous) animals. There were five enzymes of glycogenolytic metabolism: phosphorylase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (group GLY); five of oxidative metabolism: citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacid CoA-transferase, and mitochondrial thiolase (group OX); and hexokinase, subserving both groups. Fiber size (dry weight per unit length) was reduced about 35% in both muscles. On a dry weight basis, hexokinase levels were increased 100% or more in flight fibers from both soleus and TA. Group OX enzymes increased 56-193% in TA without significant change in soleus. Group GLY enzymes increased an average of 28% in soleus fibers but underwent, if anything, a modest decrease (20%) in TA fibers. These changes in composition of TA fibers were those anticipated for a conversion of about half of the originally predominant fast glycolytic fibers into fast oxidative glycolytic fibers. Calculation on the basis of fiber length, rather than dry weight, gave an estimate of absolute enzyme changes: hexokinase was still calculated to have increased in both soleus and TA fibers, but only by 50 and 25%, respectively. Three of the OX enzymes were, on this basis, unchanged in TA fibers, but 3-ketoacid CoA-transferase and thiolase had still nearly doubled, whereas TA GLY enzymes had fallen about 40%. In soleus fibers, absolute levels of OX enzymes had decreased an average of 25% and GLY enzymes were marginally decreased."
https://openalex.org/W2123821905,"High relative mutability may be a common property of the surfaces of all or most proteins and may be exploited during evolution not only to alter molecular recognition but to modify catalytic functions as well. Conservative amino acid substitutions often can be expected to cause minimal structural alterations, but the properties of protein surfaces and the mechanisms of protein folding that accommodate length variation without loss of function are not understood. To begin to study these aspects of protein structure and folding, we have constructed short amino acid insertions in the Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase polypeptide by linker insertion mutagenesis of the phoA gene and have examined correlations between mutant protein function and position of the insertions relative to the x-ray map of wild type alkaline phosphatase determined by Wycoff and colleagues (Sowadski, J. M., Foster, B. A., and Wycoff, H. W. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 150, 245-272). Mutant protein enzymatic function was generally tolerant of insertions in exterior loops, but was inactivated by insertion within alpha-helical or beta-strand structural elements. We further demonstrate that these tolerant surface loops can serve as vehicles for high level expression and stabilization of larger foreign peptide sequences, using a 15-residue analogue of dynorphin as an example. Insertion of the dynorphin guest peptide probably caused only a local structural perturbation of the alkaline phosphatase carrier since the hybrid protein retained enzymatic activity, was exported efficiently to the periplasmic space, and could be purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a protocol developed for alkaline phosphatase itself. The gust peptide was recovered from one of these fusion proteins intact and in high yield by protease digestion in vitro and was then purified by cation-exchange chromatography to near homogeneity in a single step."
https://openalex.org/W2137857953,"Somatostatin receptors were solubilized from rat pancreatic membranes with the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonic acid (CHAPS). The binding of an iodinated somatostatin analog [125I-Tyr3]SMS to the soluble fraction was time-dependent, saturable, and reversible. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data indicated that the soluble extract contained a single class of somatostatin binding sites with a Kd of 0.3 nM and a Bmax of 210 fmol/mg. As observed with membrane-bound receptors, soluble binding receptors were sensitive to the GTP analog GTP gamma S indicating that they are functionally linked to a G protein. A molecular weight of about 400,000 was determined for soluble receptors under native conditions by gel filtration. In denaturing gel electrophoresis, photoaffinity labeling of soluble receptors identified a major protein of Mr = 100,000 and two minor proteins of Mr = 56,000 and 21,000. Isoelectric focusing of soluble receptors revealed that the somatostatin receptor is an acidic protein with pI 4.8. The soluble somatostatin receptor is a glycoprotein which can be specifically bound to the wheat germ agglutinin lectin and eluted by triacetyl-chitotriose."
https://openalex.org/W1602938658,"We have investigated the transport characteristics of L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-alanine in renal brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from Japan Fisher 344 rats. This particular rat strain genetically lacks dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Owing to the absence of this enzyme, the tripeptide was found to be completely resistant to hydrolysis by the renal brush-border membrane vesicles. Uptake of the tripeptide into these membrane vesicles in the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient was slightly greater than in the presence of a K+ gradient, but there was no evidence for active transport. On the contrary, uptake was very rapid in the presence of an inside-alkaline transmembrane pH gradient, and accumulation of the tripeptide inside the vesicles against a concentration gradient could be demonstrated under these conditions. The uptake was drastically reduced by dissipation of the pH gradient. The uptake was stimulated by an inside-negative membrane potential and inhibited by an inside-positive membrane potential. Moreover, the uptake was greater in voltage-clamped membrane vesicles than in control vesicles. Many di- and tripeptides inhibited this pH gradient-stimulated uptake of Phe-Pro-Ala. The apparent dissociation constant for the tripeptide was 48 microM. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the intravesicular content at the peak of the overshoot revealed that the tripeptide was transported across the membrane almost entirely in the intact form. These data provide the first direct evidence for the presence of an electrogenic tripeptide-proton symport in renal brush-border membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1524272431,"BALB/c mice were immunized with a synthetic co-factor of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, 6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin, conjugated to albumin. Hybridoma cell lines isolated from the immunized mice secreted monoclonal antibodies reacting specifically with the pterin molecule and monoclonal antibodies which were found to bind phenylalanine hydroxylase. Several lines of evidence were consistent with the anti-phenylalanine hydroxylase antibodies being anti-idiotype antibodies mimicking the pterin molecule and binding to the pterin binding site of phenylalanine hydroxylase. (a) An anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody, NS7, when reimmunized into mice produced anti-pterin antibodies consistent with NS7 being an internal image anti-idiotypic antibody. (b) NS7 antibody was prevented from binding to phenylalanine hydroxylase when a competitive inhibitor of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity, 6,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydropterin, was bound to phenylalanine hydroxylase. (c) NS7 antibody was shown to bind to a wide range of pterin-requiring enzymes: phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, dihydropteridine reductase, dihydrofolate reductase, and sepiapterin reductase. Thus the NS7 antibody has successfully mimicked a common portion of the pterin cofactors utilized by these enzymes and demonstrated structure homology in their pterin binding sites despite their diverse function and little amino acid sequence homology except among the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylases."
