https://openalex.org/W1982804269,"Aggressive fibromatosis (also called desmoid tumor) occurs as a sporadic lesion or as part of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, which is caused by germ line mutations in the Adenomatous polyposis Coli (APC) gene. APC is involved in the regulation of the cellular level of beta-catenin, which is a mediator in Wnt signaling. Mutational analysis of the beta-catenin and APC genes was performed in 42 sporadic aggressive fibromatoses. Nine tumors had mutations in APC, and 22 had a point mutation in beta-catenin at either codon 45 or codon 41 (producing a stabilized beta-catenin protein product). Immunohistochemistry showed an elevated beta-catenin protein level in all tumors, regardless of mutational status. Beta-catenin localized to the nucleus, and was not tyrosine phosphorylated in the six tumors in which this was tested. The demonstration of mutations in two mediators in the Wnt-APC-beta-catenin pathway implicates beta-catenin stabilization as the key factor in the pathogenesis of aggressive fibromatosis. This is the first demonstration of somatic beta-catenin mutations in a locally invasive, but non metastatic lesion composed of spindle cells, illustrating the importance of beta-catenin stabilization in a variety of cell types and neoplastic processes. Moreover, this tumor has one of the highest reported frequencies of beta-catenin mutations of any tumor type."
https://openalex.org/W2329681473,"The function of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD is regulated by phosphorylation of two sites, serine-112 (Ser-112) and serine-136 (Ser-136). Phosphorylation at either site results in loss of the ability of BAD to heterodimerize with the survival proteins BCL-XL or BCL-2. Phosphorylated BAD binds to 14-3-3 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm. It has been shown that phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-136 is mediated by the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt-1/PKB which is downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The signaling process leading to phophorylation of BAD at Ser-112 has not been identified. In this study, we show that phosphorylation of the two serine residues of BAD is differentially regulated. While Ser-136 phosphorylation is concordant with activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation does not correlate with Akt activation. Instead, we demonstrate that activated Ras and Raf, which are upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), stimulate selective phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Ser-112, but not Ser-136 requires activation of the MAPK pathway as the MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, blocks EGF-, as well as activated Ras- or Raf-mediated phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112. Therefore, the PI3K-Akt and Ras-MAPK pathways converge at BAD by mediating phosphorylation of distinct serine residues."
https://openalex.org/W2322217870,"ATR is a large, >300 kDa protein containing a carboxy-terminus kinase domain related to PI-3 kinase, and is homologous to the ATM gene product in human cells and the rad3/MEC1 proteins in yeast. These proteins, together with the DNA-PK, are part of a new family of PI-3 kinase related proteins. All members of this family play important roles in checkpoints which operate to permit cell survival following many forms of DNA damage. We have expressed ATR protein in HEK293 cells and purified the protein to near-homogeneity. We show that pure ATR is a protein kinase which is activated by circular single-stranded, double-stranded or linear DNA. Thus ATR is a new member of a sub-family of PIK related kinases, founded by the DNA-PK, which are activated in the presence of DNA. Unlike DNA-PK, ATR does not appear to require Ku proteins for its activation by DNA. We show directly that, like ATM and DNA-PK, ATR phosphorylates the genome surveillance protein p53 on serine 15, a site which is up-regulated in response to DNA damage. In addition, we find that ATR has a substrate specificity similar to, but unique from, the DNA-PK in vitro, suggesting that these proteins have overlapping but distinct functions in vivo. Finally, we find that the kinase activity of ATR in the presence and absence of DNA is suppressed by caffeine, a compound which is known to induce loss of checkpoint control. Our results are consistent with the notion that ATR plays a role in monitoring DNA structure and phosphorylation of proteins involved in the DNA damage response pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2316712853,"Several lines of evidence indicate that beta-catenin acquires oncogenic activity when its intracellular concentration increases as a result of either mutation in the beta-catenin gene itself or inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. In an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocellular carcinogenesis, we have studied the frequency of beta-catenin gene alterations in exon 3, a region known to represent a mutation hot spot, and its inappropriate protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 73 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). The results were correlated with different clinical and pathological data, particularly with the presence or not of an associated cirrhosis. Fourteen (19%) HCCs showed beta-catenin gene alterations with missense mutations in nine cases and interstitial deletions in five cases. These genetic alterations were present in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic groups. By contrast, we did not find any beta-catenin gene alterations in the nine fibromellar carcinomas we examined. Nuclear accumulation of the protein was observed in 18 of them (25%). Remarkably, these included ten of the 14 tumors harboring somatic mutations in the beta-catenin gene (P < 0.001). Our results indicate that accumulation of beta-catenin resulting from genetic mutations is a frequent event in non-fibrolamellar type hepatocellular carcinoma. The close association between increased beta-catenin protein stability and mutation indicates that immunohistochemistry may be a powerful method for the detection of the mutated protein in future clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2090786978,"Related Adhesion Focal Tyrosine Kinase (RAFTK; also known as Pyk2), is a member of the Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) subfamily and is activated by TNFα, UV light and increases in intracellular calcium levels. However, the function of RAFTK remains largely unknown. Our previous studies demonstrated that treatment with dexamethasone (Dex), ionizing radiation (IR), and anti-Fas mAb induces apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. In the present study, we examined the potential role of RAFTK during induction of apoptosis in human MM cells triggered by these three stimuli. Dex-induced apoptosis, in contrast to apoptosis triggered by anti-Fas mAb or IR, is associated with activation of RAFTK. Transient overexpression of RAFTK wild type (RAFTK WT) induces apoptosis, whereas transient overexpression of Kinase inactive RAFTK (RAFTK K-M) blocks Dex-induced apoptosis. In contrast, transient overexpression of RAFTK K-M has no effect on apoptosis triggered by IR or Fas. In Dex-resistant cells, Dex does not trigger either RAFTK activation or apoptosis. Finally, interleukin-6 (IL-6), a known survival factor for MM cells, inhibits both activation of RAFTK and apoptosis of MM.1S cells triggered by Dex. Our studies therefore demonstrate Dex-induced RAFTK-dependent, and IR or Fas induced RAFTK-independent apoptotic signaling cascades in MM cells."

https://openalex.org/W2323808050,"To investigate the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in apoptotic signaling induced by cytokine withdrawal, we expressed PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon individually in the 32D myeloid progenitor cells. The parental and PKC-delta- and PKC-epsilon-transfected 32D cells underwent apoptosis within 24 h in the absence of interleukin 3. In contrast, expression of PKC-alpha inhibited the onset of apoptosis as determined by genomic DNA fragmentation and flow cytometric analysis. Correlating with the inhibition of apoptosis, PKC-alpha transfectants exhibited increased activity of the endogenous Akt serine/threonine kinase. Furthermore, PKC-alpha, but not PKC-delta or -epsilon, specifically activated overexpressed Akt. PKC-alpha-induced Akt activity was partially dependent on phosphoinositol 3' kinase (PI 3'K) since a PI 3'K inhibitor was able to suppress PKC-alpha-induced Akt activation. Both basal and interleukin 3-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473 was enhanced in the PKC-alpha and Akt contransfectants. Coexpression of wild type Akt and PKC-alpha resulted in greater suppression of apoptosis than PKC-alpha expression alone. Together, our results demonstrate that suppression of apoptosis by PKC-alpha correlates with its ability of activating endogenous Akt. Furthermore, activation of overexpressed Akt by PKC-alpha is consistent with their synergistic effect on suppressing apoptosis, providing the strong evidence of cross talk between Akt and PKC-alpha."

https://openalex.org/W1976907369,"The telomere DNA polymerase (telomerase) and the tumor suppressor protein p53 are frequently associated with human cancers, and activation of telomerase and inactivation of p53 involved in cancer cell immortalization. In this report, we demonstrate a direct interaction of telomerase with p53 in the nuclear lysates of human breast cancer cells, and with recombinant human p53, by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation. On activity criteria, the interaction is between the carboxyl-terminal region of p53 and a region close to the amino-terminus of human telomerase-associated protein 1 (hTEP1). Incubation of recombinant p53 with nuclear telomerase extracts results in inhibition of telomerase activity, with the C-terminal region of p53 being essential for inhibition. This effect is not mediated by binding to telomerase substrate DNA, but requires the region near the N-terminus of hTEP1, in that a synthetic peptide derived from this region of hTEP1 similarly inhibits telomerase activity. Together, these in vitro interactions between telomerase and p53 suggest that the activity of telomerase may be regulated by p53, down-regulation of which in turn would favor up-regulation of telomerase activity in cancer cell development."
https://openalex.org/W2013247982,"Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) is a potent chemotactic factor and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a cortical actin-associated protein (cortactin). The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF-1 requires the tyrosine residues 421, 482 and 466, which are targeted by the protein tyrosine kinase Src in vitro. Furthermore, FGF-1 is unable to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin within the cells derived from Src knockout mice (Src-/-), indicating that Src is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF-1. Although Src-/- cells are able to undergo rapid proliferation, they are impaired to respond to FGF-1 for the shape change and cell migration. Morphological analysis further reveals that FGF-1 fails to induce the formation of polarized lamellipodia and the translocation of cortactin into the leading edge of Src-/- cells. Consistent with the mitogenic response to FGF-1, the lack of Src does not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of Snt (or Frs2), a FGF-1 early signaling protein that links to Ras. Therefore, our data support the notion that Src and cortactin participate in a FGF signal pathway for cell migration and shape change rather than mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2019617863,"The kidney is a target for toxicants including cisplatin and S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC), a metabolite of the environmental contaminant, trichloroethylene. Necrosis is well characterized in kidney cells, but pathways leading to apoptosis are less clear. Cysteine conjugates are useful toxicants because they induce either necrosis or apoptosis depending on chemical structure or antioxidant status. Herein, we show that in the renal epithelial cell line LLC-PK1, activation of caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/apopain) is crucial for apoptosis, but not necrosis. Apoptosis was blocked by zVAD.fmk, and partially by a cathepsin inhibitor. Caspase-3 activity and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was detected only during apoptosis. S-(1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine (TFEC), a metabolite of tetrafluoroethylene, kills cells only by necrosis, and did not activate caspases under any conditions. Apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 by cisplatin, but not DCVC, was prevented by bcl-2. Thus, caspase-3 activation by bcl-2-dependent and -independent mechanisms is a terminal event in chemical-apoptosis of renal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1973910854,"The BRCA-1 tumour supressor gene was identified on the basis of mutations which occur in familial breast cancer indicating that its inactivation can cause this disease. Although BRCA-1 does not appear to be mutated in sporadic breast cancer, its expression has been shown to be reduced in tumour material from such cases. We show here that mammary tumours which have reduced levels of BRCA-1 expression show enhanced expression of the Brn-3b POU family transcription factor at both the mRNA and protein levels. This elevated expression of Brn-3b is not found in normal mammary cells, benign tumours or in malignant tumour samples which do not exhibit reduced levels of BRCA-1. In contrast, no correlation was noted between BRCA-1 and expression of the related factor Brn-3a. Moreover, Brn-3b but not Brn-3a can strongly repress the BRCA-1 promoter approximately 20-fold in mammary tumour cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a transcription factor which regulates BRCA-1 expression. Thus, Brn-3b may play an important role in regulating expression of BRCA-1 in mammary tumours with enhanced expression of Brn-3b resulting in reduced BRCA-1 expression and thereby being potentially important in tumour development."
https://openalex.org/W1972679112,"BRCA1, a tumor suppressor protein implicated in hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer, is transcriptionally regulated in a proliferation-dependent manner. In this study, we demonstrate a substantial role for proteolysis in regulating the BRCA1 steady-state protein level in several cell lines. N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (ALLN), an inhibitor of the proteasome, calpain, and cathepsins, caused BRCA1 protein to accumulate in the nucleus of several human breast, prostate, and melanoma cell lines which express low or undetectable basal levels of BRCA1 protein, but not in cells with high basal expression of BRCA1. Protease inhibition did not increase BRCA1 synthesis, nor change its mRNA level, but it dramatically prolonged the protein's half-life. In contrast to ALLN, lactacystin and PS341, two specific proteasome inhibitors, as well as calpastatin peptide and PD150606, two selective calpain inhibitors, had no effect on BRCA1 stability, whereas ALLM, an effective calpain and cathepsin inhibitor but weak proteasome inhibitor, did stimulate accumulation of BRCA1. Moreover, three inhibitors of acidic cysteine proteases, chloroquine, ammonium chloride and bafilomycin, were as effective as ALLN. These results demonstrate that degradation by a cathepsin-like protease in fine balance with BRCA1 transcription is responsible for maintaining the low steady-state level of BRCA1 protein seen in many cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2323100652,"Cytokine response gene #6 (CR6), cloned from interleukin 2-stimulated T lymphocytes, is homologous to GADD45 and MyD118, genes which promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To determine how this gene family could possibly mediate both cell survival/proliferation and cell cycle arrest/death, transfectants were generated so that the genes could be expressed ectopically, independently from their normal inducing agents. In cycling retinoblastoma protein-negative (pRb-) cells, ectopic CR6 expression blocked G2/M transition, but did not prevent G1/S transition so that endoreduplication resulted. By comparison, when CR6, GADD45, and MyD118 genes were expressed ectopically in proliferating pRb+ cells, either G1/S or G2/M transition was effectively blocked, so that there was no endoreduplication. Consistent with these findings, in proliferating pRb-cells, ectopic expression of CR6 promoted the expression of both G1 and G2/M cyclins. By comparison, in pRb+ cells, the expression of G1 cyclins was increased, while expression of the mitotic cyclins was decreased. However, in pRb+ cells, cyclin-dependent kinase activities associated with both G1 and G2/M cyclins were decreased. Moreover, ectopic expression of all three genes resulted in the expression of the CKI, p21, both in pRb− and pRb+ cells. The physiologic induction of CR6 expression by IL2 in quiescent normal human T cells occurs transiently in the first half of G1, coordinately with the expression of p21. Therefore, this gene family regulates G1 and G2, and promotes either cell growth or arrest by a common mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2318375805,"AKXD recombinant inbred mice develop a variety of leukemias and lymphomas due to retrovirally mediated insertional activation of cellular proto-oncogenes. We describe a new retroviral insertion site that is the most frequent genetic alteration in AKXD B-cell leukemias. Multiple genes flank the site of viral insertion, but the expression of just two, Hex and mEg5, is significantly upregulated. Hex is a divergent homeobox gene that is transiently expressed in many hematopoietic lineages, suggesting an involvement in cellular differentiation. mEg5 is a member of the bim-C subfamily of kinesin related proteins that are necessary for spindle formation and stabilization during mitosis. Our data provide the first genetic evidence for the activation of these genes in leukemia, and suggest that unscheduled expression of Hex and mEg5 contributes to the development of B-cell leukemia. In addition, this work highlights the use of genomic approaches for the study of position effect mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2319602490,"We previously reported cloning the rLot1 gene, and its human homolog (hLOT1), through analysis of differential gene expression in normal and malignant rat ovarian surface epithelial cells. Both human and rat ovarian carcinoma cell lines exhibited lost or decreased expression of this gene. Interestingly, the LOT1 gene localized at band q25 of human chromosome 6 which is a frequent site for LOH in many solid tumors including ovarian cancer. In this report we have further characterized the potential role of LOT1 in malignant transformation and developed evidence that the gene is a novel target of growth factor signaling pathway. Assays using transient transfections showed that LOT1 is a nuclear protein and may act as a transcription factor. In vitro and in vivo studies involving ovarian cancer cell lines revealed that expression of LOT1 is directly associated with inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of morphological transformations. Additionally, we show that in normal rat ovarian surface epithelial cells Lot1 gene expression is responsive to growth factor stimulation. Its mRNA is strongly down-regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, namely EGF and TGF-alpha. Blocking the ligand-activated EGFR signal transduction pathway by the specific EGF receptor inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478, and the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, restores the normal level of Lot1 gene expression. It appears that the regulation of Lot1 gene is unique to these ligands, as well as the growth promoting agent TPA, since other factors either did not affect Lot1 expression, or the effect was modest and transient. Altogether, the results suggest that Lot1 expression is primarily mediated via EGF receptor or a related pathway and it may regulate the growth promoting signals as a zinc-finger motif containing nuclear transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W1981389215,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of receptors and their respective ligands play a major role in breast cancer progression and are the targets of new therapeutic approaches. Following immortalization with SV40 T antigen of normal human breast epithelial cells, a transformed variant cell line (NS2T2A1) was selected for its increased tumorigenicity in nude mice. This cell line was shown to have a higher expression of EGF receptors (EGFR) and amphiregulin (AR) when compared to their normal counterparts or less aggressive transformed cells. Dual staining of EGFR and AR was observed in 50 – 60% of NS2T2A1 cells, while 30 – 40% cells expressed AR only. To explore the potential tumorigenic role of AR, a 1.1 kb AR cDNA in an antisense orientation was transfected in NS2T2A1 cells. Three clones, selected by hygromycin B, expressed AR antisense RNA (AR AS1, AR AS2 and AR AS3 cell lines) in which AR protein expression was reduced (ranging from about 50 to <5%). The anchorage-independent growth of AR AS cell lines was reduced to levels ranging from 32.4 – 6.8% relative to the control cell line transfected with the vector alone. The clones expressing AR antisense RNA showed a reversion of the malignant phenotype when injected in nude mice, since a significant reduction of tumor intake was observed coincident with a significant tumor mass reduction (>96%). Moreover, intra-tumoral vascularization decreased significantly in tumors derived from AR AS cells (26.7, 70.7 and 50.4% of control). These in vitro and in vivo data reveal the oncogenic nature of AR in transformed breast epithelial cells and imply a role for AR in tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2323598111,"Bcl-2 is known to have dual antiproliferative and antiapoptotic roles. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in the mammary gland using a whey acidic protein (WAP) promoter-driven Bcl-2 transgene inhibits apoptosis in the mammary gland during pregnancy, lactation, and involution, and also counteracts apoptosis induced by overexpression of a mutant p53 transgene (WAP-p53 172 R-L). WAP-Bcl-2 mice and nontransgenic controls were treated with the carcinogen dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). Surprisingly, the nontransgenic mice developed mammary tumors with decreased latency. Tumors arising in WAP-Bcl-2 mice displayed substantially reduced levels of proliferation relative to those seen in nontransgenic mice (P < 0.015), perhaps resulting in the observed increase in tumor latency following carcinogen treatment. This WAP-Bcl-2 mouse tumor model reflects the situation seen in some human breast cancers overexpressing Bcl-2, where expression of Bcl-2 has been shown to correlate with a lower proliferative index in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2333843729,"Our previous genome-wide analysis of allelic loss for thymic lymphomas that were induced by gamma-irradiation in F1 hybrid mice between BALB/c and MSM strains suggested the centromeric region on chromosome 11 as a site harboring a tumor suppressor gene. Interestingly, to this region the mouse Ikaros gene was mapped which was postulated to participate in oncogenic process from the study of Ikaros knockout mice. Here we show fine allelic loss mapping in the vicinity of Ikaros in 191 lymphomas, indicating that the critical region of allelic loss was centered at the Ikaros locus. PCR analysis revealed that nine lymphomas failed to give PCR-amplification for either of two exon primer pairs, indicative of homozygous deletion. Six and five mutations were detected in the N-terminal zinc finger domain and the activation domain of Ikaros, respectively, and six of the eleven were frameshift or nonsense mutations that resulted in truncation of Ikaros protein. The results strongly suggest a direct role for Ikaros in development of mouse thymic lymphomas. This provides the experimental basis for further analysis of Ikaros mutations in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2036644596,"Transgenic flies in which ectopic expression of human p53 was targeted to the Drosophila eye imaginal disc were established. On sectioning of adult fly eyes which displayed a severe rough eye phenotype, most ommatidia were found to be fused and irregular shapes of rabdomeres were observed. In addition, many pigment cells were lost. In the developing eye imaginal disc, photoreceptor cell differentiation was initiated normally despite the ectopic expression of p53. However, expression of p53 inhibited cell cycle progression in eye imaginal disc cells and the S phase zone (the second mitotic wave) behind the morphogenetic furrow was almost completely abolished. Furthermore, expression of p53 induced extensive apoptosis of eye imaginal disc cells, and co-expression of baculovirus P35 in the eye imaginal disc suppressed the p53-induced rough eye phenotype. These results are consistent with the known functions of human p53 and indicate the existence of signaling systems with elements corresponding to human p53 in Drosophila eye imaginal disc cells. Genetic crosses of transgenic flies expressing p53 to a collection of Drosophila deficiency stocks allowed us to identify several genomic regions, deletions of which caused enhancement or suppression of the p53-induced rough eye phenotype. The transgenic flies established in this study should be useful to identify novel targets of p53 and its positive or negative regulators in Drosophila."

https://openalex.org/W2323137403,"Protein-protein interaction can play an important role in the control of several biological events including gene transcription, replication and cell proliferation. E2F-1 is a DNA-binding transcription factor which, upon interaction with its target DNA sequence, induces expression of several S phase specific genes allowing progression of the cell cycle. Evidently, the activity of this protein is modulated by its cellular partner, pRb, which in the hypophosphorylated form, binds to E2F-1 and inactivates its transcriptional ability. In this study, we have demonstrated that expression of a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA binding protein, Purα, in cells decreases the ability of E2F-1 to exert its transcriptional activity upon the responsive promoter derived from DHFR. Results from band shift experiments revealed that while Purα does not recognize the double-stranded DNA fragment containing the E2F-1 binding site, it has the ability to inhibit E2F-1 interaction with its target DNA sequence. Results from GST pull-down assays and the combined immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts revealed a direct association of E2F-1 with Purα in the absence of the DNA molecule containing the E2F-1 binding site. The association of Purα with E2F-1 may increase the stability of E2F-1, as a higher level of E2F-1 was detected in cells co-expressing Purα and E2F-1. The importance of these observations with respect to the role of Purα in the control of cell cycle progression is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2314888388,"We have previously reported that activated rac (V12rac) can bring about hypertransformation of ras-transformed epithelial cells, which can be suppressed by the dominant negative form of rac (N17rac). Starting with primary epithelial cells, a series of cell lines expressing wild type (WT) or mutated forms of ras or rac were generated and analysed for their adhesive function and expression and association of adherens junction (AJ) proteins. Normal, primary epithelial cells were self-adhesive and expressed AJs that were very stable. The expression of constitutively active ras resulted in a decrease in, but not loss of, cell-cell adhesion, with concomitantly decreased stability of AJ components. This was extremely exacerbated by the co-expression of constitutively activate rac, but was suppressed by dominant negative rac, which resulted in increased cell-cell adhesion and extremely stable AJs. alpha-catenin also failed to associate with E-cadherin-beta-catenin complexes in cells expressing V12rac. Expression of V12rac resulted in the loss of epithelial morphology. The extent of transformation of each cell type corresponded to the stability of the respective AJ complexes. Thus, rac seems to be involved in regulating the stability of AJs, which promote epithelial cell differentiation, and consequently, modulating tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2323702574,"The tumorigenic and metastatic properties of rat bladder carcinoma NBT-II cells transfected with a cDNA encoding the 24 kD nuclear isoform of human fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) were analysed and compared with those cells producing the 18 kD cytoplasmic isoform FGF-2. In transfected clones, 24 kD FGF-2 was found in the nucleus, and no FGF-2 was secreted. RT-PCR analysis showed no upregulation of FGF-2-specific receptor FGFR2c expression in these proliferating transfected cells. A shorter latency period for in vivo tumor formation and abundant spontaneous lung metastases were only seen if nuclear FGF-2-producing cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Intravenous injection of 24 kD FGF-2-producing cells led to extensive experimental lung metastases whereas injection of control NBT-II cells or 18 kD FGF-2-producing cells did not. As FGF-2-producing cells have no specific FGF-2 receptors, our results suggest that the 24 kD FGF-2 has nuclear targets, and activates metastatic property of carcinoma cells via a mechanism other than the conventional FGF receptor-mediated signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2330512677,"While p53 is dispensable for development, an excess of p53 has dramatic consequences on the embryogenesis and on the cell differentiation. In an attempt to analyse in vivo the effects of p53 activity, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the wild-type p53 under the control of the metallothionein I promoter. In the three transgenic lines established, exogenous p53 is expressed constitutively in the postmeiotic cells of transgenic males and two lines are subfertile. Transgenic males expressing the upper level of p53 produce few spermatozoa since the majority of developing spermatids undergo apoptosis. In the subfertile males exhibiting an intermediate amount of p53, teratozoospermia is obvious suggesting an altered terminal differentiation of postmeiotic cells. In contrast lower level of p53 does not lead the third line to sterility. These results suggest that the activity of p53 is dependent in vivo on the amount of p53 present within cells, as it has been already demonstrated in vitro."

We found that TPA treatment of HC11 cells induced a transient cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. Western blot analyses of the TPA treated cells provided evidence that the endogenous PKC alpha present in these cells mediated these effects. Indeed, derivatives of the HC11 cell line that inducibly overexpress an exogenous PKC alpha or ectopic PKC beta 1 exhibited more marked growth inhibition by TPA than control cells. Immunohistochemical staining of cells following treatment with TPA revealed selective translocation of PKC alpha into the nucleus, whereas PKC beta 1 remained in the cytoplasm. The transient arrest of HC11 cells following treatment with TPA was associated with marked induction of both p21cip1 mRNA and protein. This induction was exaggerated in the derivatives that overexpressed either PKC alpha or PKC beta 1. Therefore, in mouse mammary epithelial cells activation of the endogenous PKC alpha can transiently arrest cells in G0/G1 which may be due, at least in part, to induction of the transcription of p21cip1."
https://openalex.org/W2316700408,"In the Solt-Faber model DENA and 2-Acetaminofluorene (AAF) treatment combined with hepatectomy induces hepatocellular carcinoma in rats. In this model AAF blocks proliferation of hepatocytes, while oval cells restore liver mass. Here we studied the molecular mechanism involved in blocking AAF-dependent cell cycle progression of hepatocytes. AAF inhibits cell proliferation of hepatocytes shown by the lack of Cyclin E expression before the G1/S phase restriction point. Immunfluorescence studies revealed that Cyclin E positive signals were restricted to oval cells, while hepatocytes remained negative. Additionally, AAF treatment induces strong nuclear p53 expression which is associated with increased p21 mRNA levels. Inhibition of active Cyclin/CdK (cyclin dependent kinase) complexes is reflected in AAF-treated animals by decreased RB expression and phosphorylation. The decrease in RB expression and phosphorylation, which is essential in triggering DNA synthesis and Cyclin A expression, leads to a deficiency in transcriptionally active E2F complex formation after hepatectomy. Thus, two molecular explanations are evident to account for AAF-dependent cell cycle progression of hepatocytes in vivo: first, induction of p53 expression which leads to higher p21 mRNA levels, and second, a lack of Cyclin E expression at the G1/S phase restriction point after hepatectomy."

https://openalex.org/W2335323857,"The effects of Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) on breast cancer cell DNA synthesis are controversial. To elucidate the mechanisms by which FGF-2 stimulates or inhibits DNA synthesis, we analysed FGF-2 signaling pathways in breast cancer MCF-7 and MCF-7 cells overexpressing Ha-Ras (MCF-7ras). We found that FGF-2-induction of DNA synthesis correlates with Ras transient activation, FRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and low level of expression of p66Shc. In addition, Nck-associated proteins are highly tyrosine phosphorylated and JNK reaches a higher level of activation when FGF-2 triggers DNA synthesis. Interestingly upon FGF-2 treatment, JNK activation and DNA synthesis are dependent on Rac-1 activity. These results confirm that in MCF-7 cells, induction of DNA synthesis by FGF-2 requires a transient activation of the Ras/MAPK cascade and demonstrates for the first time that intact Rac-1 and Nck signaling networks are required."
https://openalex.org/W2091305335,"The Wilms' tumour suppressor protein WT1 contains a transcriptional regulatory domain that can either activate or repress transcription depending upon its cellular environment. The mechanistic basis for this dichotomy is unclear however. Here, we dissect the transcriptional regulatory domains of WT1. We find that a region within the domain of WT1 attributed to transcriptional repression is a potent suppressor of the activation domain at several promoters and in different cell types. In vitro transcription analysis suggests that the mechanism of suppression of the activation domain occurs at the level of transcription initiation. Furthermore we find that the WT1 suppression domain is able to inhibit a heterologous activation domain when fused in cis. Dissection of this domain resulted in the delineation of a 30 amino acid region that was sufficient to confer suppression of a transcriptional activation domain both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, we find that the WT1 transcriptional activation domain interacts with the general transcription factor TFIIB and that this interaction is not affected by the suppression domain. Taken together, these studies suggest that the suppression domain of WT1 interacts with a cosuppressor protein to mediate inhibition of the WT1 transcriptional activation domain."

https://openalex.org/W2330270782,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a potent and specific mitogen for epithelial cells, including the keratinocytes of the skin. We investigated the mechanisms of action of KGF by searching for genes which are regulated by this growth factor in cultured human keratinocytes. Using the differential display RT-PCR technology we identified the gene encoding adenylosuccinate lyase [EC 4.3.2.2] as a novel KGF-regulated gene. Adenylosuccinate lyase plays an important role in purine de novo synthesis. To gain further insight into the potential role of nucleotide biosynthesis in the mitogenic effect of KGF, we cloned cDNA fragments of the key regulatory enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism (adenylosuccinate synthetase [EC 6.3.4.4], phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase [EC 2.7.6.1], amidophosphoribosyl transferase [EC 2.4.2.14], hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase [EC 2.4.2.8] and the multifunctional protein CAD which includes the enzymatic activities of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II [EC 6.3.5.59], aspartate transcarbamylase [EC 2.1.3.2] and dihydroorotase [EC 3.5.2.3]). Expression of all of these enzymes was upregulated after treatment with KGF and also with epidermal growth factor (EGF), indicating that these mitogens stimulate nucleotide production by induction of these enzymes. To determine a possible in vivo correlation between the expression of KGF, EGF and the enzymes mentioned above, we analysed the expression of the enzymes during cutaneous wound repair, where high levels of these mitogens are present. Indeed, we found a strong mRNA expression of all of these enzymes in the EGF- and KGF-responsive keratinocytes of the hyperproliferative epithelium at the wound edge, indicating that their expression might also be regulated by growth factors during wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2332675818,"Mad proteins are basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP)-containing members of the myc oncoprotein network. They interact with the bHLH-ZIP protein max, compete for the same DNA binding sites as myc-max heterodimers and down-regulate myc-responsive genes. Using the bHLH-ZIP domain of mad1 as a yeast two-hybrid 'bait', we identified Mmip-2, a novel RING finger protein that interacts with all mad members, but weakly or not at all with c-myc, max or unrelated bHLH or bZIP proteins. The mad1-Mmip-2 interaction is mediated by the ZIP domain in the former protein and by at least two regions in the latter which do not include the RING finger. Mmip-2 can disrupt max-mad DNA binding and can reverse the suppressive effects of mad proteins on c-myc-responsive target genes and on c-myc + ras-mediated focus formation in fibroblasts. Tagging with spectral variants of green fluorescent protein showed that Mmip-2 and mad proteins reside in separate cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively. When co-expressed, however, the proteins interact and translocate to the cellular compartment occupied by the more abundant protein. These observations suggest a novel way by which Mmip-2 can modulate the transcriptional activity of myc oncoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2021550524,"Misexpression of the dorsal mesodermal patterning factor goosecoid on the ventral side of amphibian embryos results in inhibition of blood formation in early embryogenesis. To investigate the mechanism of this inhibition, we ectopically expressed goosecoid in erythroleukemia cells. While erythroid differentiation of these cells can be induced by activin, goosecoid expressing cells were unresponsive to activin. We demonstrate an in vitro interaction between the oncogene PU.1, an ets family transcription factor thought to play a role in erythropoiesis, and the goosecoid protein (GSC). Interaction with PU.1 was specific as GSC did not bind to the ets family members, Fli-1 or Ets-2. The ability of goosecoid expressing erythroleukemia cells to differentiate in response to activin was rescued by coexpression of the GSC-binding N-terminal portion of PU.1. The N-terminal portion of PU.1 was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-GSC antibodies as well. The N-terminal domain of PU.1 is the region recognized by the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a tumor suppressor gene presumably involved in erythroid differentiation. We show that GSC competitively inhibits binding of Rb to PU.1. Our data suggest that the suppression of blood formation by GSC could, at least in part, be mediated by binding to PU.1."
https://openalex.org/W2315885218,"The neu/erbB2 protooncogene is overexpressed in numerous human cancers and is mutationally activated in N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced rodent tumors of the Schwann cell lineage. We investigated whether expression of activated neu in Schwann cells is sufficient to initiate their immortalization and transformation. Clones of embryonic dorsal root ganglia cells infected with a retrovirus bearing activated neu (NID cells) were selected based on their expression of Schwann cell-specific markers. Compared to embryonic Schwann cells infected with a virus encoding empty vector, we found that NID cells have altered shapes and disorganized cytoskeletons, grow in the absence of growth factors required for normal Schwann cell survival and proliferation, and can be repeatedly passaged. Furthermore, NID cells are invasive in an in vitro matrix invasion assay and form metastatic tumors when injected into syngeneic animals. The neu-induced growth and invasive phenotypes could be reversed by drugs that inhibit Ras and Src activity. Interestingly, later stage Schwann cells infected with activated neu failed to become immortalized. These findings indicate that constitutive activation of erbB2 is sufficient to initiate the immortalization and transformation of immature Schwann cells, and support the notion that Schwann cells have particular developmental stages during which they are susceptible to immortalizing and transforming events."
https://openalex.org/W2312303591,"There are at least three distinct MAP kinase signaling modules in mammalian cells, distinguished by the family of kinases (Erk, SAPK/JNK, or p38) that is ultimately activated. Many input signals activate multiple MAP kinase cascades, and the mechanisms that control the specificity of signal output are not well understood. We show that SEK1/MKK4, a MAP kinase kinase proposed to activate SAPK/JNK, is a very potent inhibitor of p54 SAPK beta/JNK3 both in vitro and in vivo if present at equimolar or higher ratios. In contrast SEK can activate SAPK when present in substoichiometric amounts, but this activation is slow, consistent with the rate-limiting step in activation being the dissociation of an inactive SEK:SAPK complex. The N-terminal unique region of SEK is both necessary and partially sufficient for inhibition of SAPK, and is also necessary for activation of SAPK by SEK in vitro. We have also used the p38 MAP kinase and its activator MKK6 to examine the regulatory relationships among different kinases involved in stress responses. We show using purified kinases that inhibitory activity is specific for the combination of SEK and SAPK: SEK can activate but not inhibit p38, and MKK6 can activate but not inhibit SAPK beta and p38. These results reveal a potential mechanism for regulating stress-activated kinases, adding to a growing body of evidence suggesting that MAP kinases are controlled by relatively stable interactions with their activators."
