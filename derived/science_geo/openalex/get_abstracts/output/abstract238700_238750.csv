https://openalex.org/W2083920471,"It has been 30 years since the discovery that repeated electrical stimulation of neural pathways can lead to long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices. With its relevance to processes such as learning and memory, the technique has produced a vast literature on mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in animal models. To date, the most promising method for transferring these methods to humans is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive method of stimulating neural pathways in the brain of conscious subjects through the intact scalp. However, effects on synaptic plasticity reported are often weak, highly variable between individuals, and rarely last longer than 30 min. Here we describe a very rapid method of conditioning the human motor cortex using rTMS that produces a controllable, consistent, long-lasting, and powerful effect on motor cortex physiology and behavior after an application period of only 20-190 s."
https://openalex.org/W2060431825,"Maintenance of normal blood glucose levels depends on a complex interplay between the insulin responsiveness of skeletal muscle and liver and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells. Defects in the former are responsible for insulin resistance, and defects in the latter are responsible for progression to hyperglycemia. Emerging evidence supports the potentially unifying hypothesis that both of these prominent features of type 2 diabetes are caused by mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2070805715,"Gold octamers (Au 8 ) bound to oxygen-vacancy F-center defects on Mg(001) are the smallest clusters to catalyze the low-temperature oxidation of CO to CO 2 , whereas clusters deposited on close-to-perfect magnesia surfaces remain chemically inert. Charging of the supported clusters plays a key role in promoting their chemical activity. Infrared measurements of the stretch vibration of CO adsorbed on mass-selected gold octamers soft-landed on MgO(001) with coadsorbed O 2 show a red shift on an F-center–rich surface with respect to the perfect surface. The experiments agree with quantum ab initio calculations that predict that a red shift of the C–O vibration should arise via electron back-donation to the CO antibonding orbital."

https://openalex.org/W2035022202,"Within the vertebrate nervous system, the presence of many different lineages of neurons and glia complicates the molecular characterization of single neuronal populations. In order to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the specification and development of corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), we purified CSMN at distinct stages of development in vivo and compared their gene expression to two other pure populations of cortical projection neurons: callosal projection neurons and corticotectal projection neurons. We found genes that are potentially instructive for CSMN development, as well as genes that are excluded from CSMN and are restricted to other populations of neurons, even within the same cortical layer. Loss-of-function experiments in null mutant mice for Ctip2 (also known as Bcl11b), one of the newly characterized genes, demonstrate that it plays a critical role in the development of CSMN axonal projections to the spinal cord in vivo, confirming that we identified central genetic determinants of the CSMN population."
https://openalex.org/W2024992738,"In type 2 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas fail to produce enough insulin to meet the body's demand, in part because of an acquired decrease in beta-cell mass. In adults, pancreatic beta-cell mass is controlled by several mechanisms, including beta-cell replication, neogenesis, hypertrophy, and survival. Here, I discuss evidence supporting the notion that increased beta-cell apoptosis is an important factor contributing to beta-cell loss and the onset of type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a key signaling molecule that promotes beta-cell growth and survival, insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), is a member of a family of proteins whose inhibition contributes to the development of insulin resistance in the liver and other insulin-responsive tissues. Thus, the IRS-2 pathway appears to be a crucial participant in the tenuous balance between effective pancreatic beta-cell mass and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1965019847,"Recent evidence suggests a key role for the brain in the control of both body fat content and glucose metabolism. Neuronal systems that regulate energy intake, energy expenditure, and endogenous glucose production sense and respond to input from hormonal and nutrient-related signals that convey information regarding both body energy stores and current energy availability. In response to this input, adaptive changes occur that promote energy homeostasis and the maintenance of blood glucose levels in the normal range. Defects in this control system are implicated in the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2095471229,"Photosynthetic light harvesting in excess light is regulated by a process known as feedback deexcitation. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements on thylakoid membranes show selective formation of a carotenoid radical cation upon excitation of chlorophyll under conditions of maximum, steady-state feedback deexcitation. Studies on transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants confirmed that this carotenoid radical cation formation is correlated with feedback deexcitation and requires the presence of zeaxanthin, the specific carotenoid synthesized during high light exposure. These results indicate that energy transfer from chlorophyll molecules to a chlorophyllzeaxanthin heterodimer, which then undergoes charge separation, is the mechanism for excess energy dissipation during feedback deexcitation."
https://openalex.org/W2138553207,"In humans, the strong statistical association between fitness and survival suggests a link between impaired oxygen metabolism and disease. We hypothesized that artificial selection of rats based on low and high intrinsic exercise capacity would yield models that also contrast for disease risk. After 11 generations, rats with low aerobic capacity scored high on cardiovascular risk factors that constitute the metabolic syndrome. The decrease in aerobic capacity was associated with decreases in the amounts of transcription factors required for mitochondrial biogenesis and in the amounts of oxidative enzymes in skeletal muscle. Impairment of mitochondrial function may link reduced fitness to cardiovascular and metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W3096986715,"It has been suggested that enhanced anion concentrations at the liquid/vapor interface of airborne saline droplets are important to aerosol reactions in the atmosphere. We report ionic concentrations in the surface of such solutions. Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy operating at near ambient pressure, we have measured the composition of the liquid/vapor interface for deliquesced samples of potassium bromide and potassium iodide. In both cases, the surface composition of the saturated solution is enhanced in the halide anion compared with the bulk of the solution. The enhancement of anion concentration is more dramatic for the larger, more polarizable iodide anion. By varying photoelectron kinetic energies, we have obtained depth profiles of the liquid/vapor interface. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with classical molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative comparison between the experiments and the simulations indicates that the experimental results exhibit more interface enhancement than predicted theoretically."
https://openalex.org/W2130684278,"The epidemic of obesity-associated diabetes is a major crisis in modern societies, in which food is plentiful and exercise is optional. The biological basis of this problem has been explored from evolutionary and mechanistic perspectives. Evolutionary theories, focusing on the potential survival advantages of “thrifty” genes that are now maladaptive, are of great interest but are inherently speculative and difficult to prove. Mechanistic studies have revealed numerous fat-derived molecules and a link to inflammation that, together, are hypothesized to underlie the obesity-diabetes connection and thereby represent prospective targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2122967721,"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is central to reproduction in mammals. It acts through a G-protein-coupled receptor on the surface of target cells to stimulate testicular and ovarian functions. We present here the 2.9-A-resolution structure of a partially deglycosylated complex of human FSH bound to the extracellular hormone-binding domain of its receptor (FSHR(HB)). The hormone is bound in a hand-clasp fashion to an elongated, curved receptor. The buried interface of the complex is large (2,600 A2) and has a high charge density. Our analysis suggests that all glycoprotein hormones bind to their receptors in this mode and that binding specificity is mediated by key interaction sites involving both the common alpha- and hormone-specific beta-subunits. On binding, FSH undergoes a concerted conformational change that affects protruding loops implicated in receptor activation. The FSH-FSHR(HB) complexes form dimers in the crystal and at high concentrations in solution. Such dimers may participate in transmembrane signal transduction."

But 100 years on, the same experimental measurement that puzzled Einstein and his contemporaries is forcing us to question our understanding of how quantum matter transforms at ultra-low temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2126705913,"Cell lineage specification depends on both gene activation and gene silencing, and in the differentiation of T helper progenitors to Th1 or Th2 effector cells, this requires the action of two opposing transcription factors, T-bet and GATA-3. T-bet is essential for the development of Th1 cells, and GATA-3 performs an equivalent role in Th2 development. We report that T-bet represses Th2 lineage commitment through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between the two transcription factors that interferes with the binding of GATA-3 to its target DNA. These results provide a novel function for tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying alternate fates of a common progenitor cell."
https://openalex.org/W1618704100,"Chalcogenide aerogels based entirely on semiconducting II-VI or IV-VI frameworks have been prepared from a general strategy that involves oxidative aggregation of metal chalcogenide nanoparticle building blocks followed by supercritical solvent removal. The resultant materials are mesoporous, exhibit high surface areas, can be prepared as monoliths, and demonstrate the characteristic quantum-confined optical properties of their nanoparticle components. These materials can be synthesized from a variety of building blocks by chemical or photochemical oxidation, and the properties can be further tuned by heat treatment. Aerogel formation represents a powerful yet facile method for metal chalcogenide nanoparticle assembly and the creation of mesoporous semiconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2004788565,"Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are extracellular proteins localized to the chemosensory systems of most terrestrial species. OBPs are expressed by nonneuronal cells and secreted into the fluid bathing olfactory neuron dendrites. Several members have been shown to interact directly with odorants, but the significance of this is not clear. We show that the Drosophila OBP lush is completely devoid of evoked activity to the pheromone 11-cis vaccenyl acetate (VA), revealing that this binding protein is absolutely required for activation of pheromone-sensitive chemosensory neurons. lush mutants are also defective for pheromone-evoked behavior. Importantly, we identify a genetic interaction between lush and spontaneous activity in VA-sensitive neurons in the absence of pheromone. The defects in spontaneous activity and VA sensitivity are reversed by germline transformation with a lush transgene or by introducing recombinant LUSH protein into mutant sensilla. These studies directly link pheromone-induced behavior with OBP-dependent activation of a subset of olfactory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2078012795,"Phosphorite deposits in marine sediments are a long-term sink for an essential nutrient, phosphorus. Here we show that apatite abundance in sediments on the Namibian shelf correlates with the abundance and activity of the giant sulfur bacterium Thiomargarita namibiensis , which suggests that sulfur bacteria drive phosphogenesis. Sediments populated by Thiomargarita showed sharp peaks of pore water phosphate (≤300 micromolar) and massive phosphorite accumulations (≥50 grams of phosphorus per kilogram). Laboratory experiments revealed that under anoxic conditions, Thiomargarita released enough phosphate to account for the precipitation of hydroxyapatite observed in the environment."

https://openalex.org/W2070050569,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling generates subcellular asymmetry along an axis orthogonal to the epithelial apical-basal axis. Through a poorly understood mechanism, cell clones that have mutations in some PCP signaling components, including some, but not all, alleles of the receptor frizzled , cause polarity disruptions of neighboring wild-type cells, a phenomenon referred to as domineering nonautonomy. Here, a contact-dependent signaling hypothesis, derived from experimental results, is shown by reaction-diffusion, partial differential equation modeling and simulation to fully reproduce PCP phenotypes, including domineering nonautonomy, in the Drosophila wing. The sufficiency of this model and the experimental validation of model predictions reveal how specific protein-protein interactions produce autonomy or domineering nonautonomy."

https://openalex.org/W2091743333,"Evidence has accumulated recently that not only eukaryotes but also bacteria can have a cytoskeleton. We used cryo-electron tomography to study the three-dimensional structure of Spiroplasma melliferum cells in a close-to-native state at approximately 4-nanometer resolution. We showed that these cells possess two types of filaments arranged in three parallel ribbons underneath the cell membrane. These two filamentous structures are built of the fibril protein and possibly the actin-like protein MreB. On the basis of our structural data, we could model the motility modes of these cells and explain how helical Mollicutes can propel themselves by means of coordinated length changes of their cytoskeletal ribbons."
https://openalex.org/W2052407013,"Voltage-gated sodium channels with ""resurgent"" kinetics are specialized for high-frequency firing. The alpha subunits interact with a blocking protein that binds open channels upon depolarization and unbinds upon repolarization, producing resurgent sodium current. By limiting classical inactivation, the cycle of block and unblock shortens refractory periods. To characterize the blocker in Purkinje neurons, we briefly exposed inside-out patches to substrate-specific proteases. Trypsin and chymotrypsin each removed resurgent current, consistent with established roles for positively charged and hydrophobic/aromatic groups in blocking sodium channels. In Purkinje cells, the only known sodium channel-associated subunit that has a cytoplasmic sequence with several positive charges and clustered hydrophobic/aromatic residues is beta4 (KKLITFILKKTREK; beta4(154-167)). After enzymatic removal of block, beta4(154-167) fully reconstituted resurgent current, whereas scrambled or point-mutated peptides were ineffective. In CA3 pyramidal neurons, which lack beta4 and endogenous block, beta4(154-167) generated resurgent current. Thus, beta4 may be the endogenous open-channel blocker responsible for resurgent kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2086899901,"Territorial behavior is expected to buffer populations against short-term environmental perturbations, but we have found that group living in African lions causes a complex response to long-term ecological change. Despite numerous gradual changes in prey availability and vegetative cover, regional populations of Serengeti lions remained stable for 10- to 20-year periods and only shifted to new equilibria in sudden leaps. Although gradually improving environmental conditions provided sufficient resources to permit the subdivision of preexisting territories, regional lion populations did not expand until short-term conditions supplied enough prey to generate large cohorts of surviving young. The results of a simulation model show that the observed pattern of “saltatory equilibria” results from the lions' grouping behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2093866688,"Beryllium-10 surface exposure dating of offset moraines on one branch of the Karakorum Fault west of the Gar basin yields a long-term (140- to 20-thousand-year) right-lateral slip rate of approximately 10.7 +/- 0.7 millimeters per year. This rate is 10 times larger than that inferred from recent InSAR analyses ( approximately 1 +/- 3 millimeters per year) that span approximately 8 years and sample all branches of the fault. The difference in slip-rate determinations suggests that large rate fluctuations may exist over centennial or millennial time scales. Such fluctuations would be consistent with mechanical coupling between the seismogenic, brittle-creep, and ductile shear sections of faults that reach deep into the crust."

https://openalex.org/W2091844604,"Ring species, which consist of two reproductively isolated forms connected by a chain of intergrading populations, have often been described as examples of speciation despite gene flow between populations, but this has never been demonstrated. We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to study gene flow in greenish warblers ( Phylloscopus trochiloides ). These genetic markers show distinct differences between two reproductively isolated forms but gradual change through the ring connecting these forms. These findings provide the strongest evidence yet for “speciation by force of distance” in the face of ongoing gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W2000286622,"In contrast to most genomic DNA in mitotic cells, the promoter regions of some genes, such as the stress-inducible hsp70i gene that codes for a heat shock protein, remain uncompacted, a phenomenon called bookmarking. Here we show that hsp70i bookmarking is mediated by a transcription factor called HSF2, which binds this promoter in mitotic cells, recruits protein phosphatase 2A, and interacts with the CAP-G subunit of the condensin enzyme to promote efficient dephosphorylation and inactivation of condensin complexes in the vicinity, thereby preventing compaction at this site. Blocking HSF2-mediated bookmarking by HSF2 RNA interference decreases hsp70i induction and survival of stressed cells in the G 1 phase, which demonstrates the biological importance of gene bookmarking."

https://openalex.org/W2093215696,"Precision spectroscopy at ultraviolet and shorter wavelengths has been hindered by the poor access of narrow-band lasers to that spectral region. We demonstrate high-accuracy quantum interference metrology on atomic transitions with the use of an amplified train of phase-controlled pulses from a femtosecond frequency comb laser. The peak power of these pulses allows for efficient harmonic upconversion, paving the way for extension of frequency comb metrology in atoms and ions to the extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray spectral regions. A proof-of-principle experiment was performed on a deep-ultraviolet (2 x 212.55 nanometers) two-photon transition in krypton; relative to measurement with single nanosecond laser pulses, the accuracy of the absolute transition frequency and isotope shifts was improved by more than an order of magnitude."

https://openalex.org/W1981237421,"Astronomy is at times a science of unexpected discovery. When it is, and if we are lucky, new intellectual territories emerge to challenge our views of the cosmos. The recent indirect detections using high-precision Doppler spectroscopy of more than 100 giant planets orbiting more than 100 nearby stars is an example of such rare serendipity. What has been learned has shaken out preconceptions, for none of the planetary systems discovered so far is like our own. The key to unlocking a planet's chemical, structural, and evolutionary secrets, however, is the direct detection of the planet's light. Because there have been as yet no confirmed detections, a theoretical analysis of such a planet's atmosphere is necessary for guiding our search. Over 100 giant planets have been discovered in recent years, orbiting over 100 nearby stars. These extrasolar giant planets were revealed by high-precision Doppler spectroscopy, but until direct detection of light from these planets becomes possible, their chemical, structural and evolutionary secrets will stay secret. There have been no confirmed direct detections of extrasolar planets as yet. In an attempt to bring that eagerly awaited event a little closer, Adam Burrows presents a theoretical analysis of what the atmosphere on such a planet would be like. If observational astronomers know more about what they are looking for, it should be easier to find it. The cover (by Lynette Cook)is a notional evolutionary sequence of a giant planet from birth to the present, the last (smallest) phase represented by a Voyager image of Jupiter."
https://openalex.org/W2073656593,"Sexual mimicry among animals is widespread1,2, but does it impart a fertilization advantage in the widely accepted ‘sneak–guard’ model3 of sperm competition? Here we describe field results in which a dramatic facultative switch in sexual phenotype by sneaker-male cuttlefish leads to immediate fertilization success, even in the presence of the consort male. These results are surprising, given the high rate at which females reject copulation attempts by males, the strong mate-guarding behaviour of consort males, and the high level of sperm competition in this complex mating system4,5."

https://openalex.org/W2029259174,"Acquisition of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure is critical to the fabrication, assembly, and function of ion channels, yet the relationship between these biogenic events remains unclear. We now address this issue in voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv) for the T1 domain, an N-terminal Kv recognition domain that is responsible for subfamily-specific, efficient assembly of Kv subunits. This domain forms a 4-fold symmetric tetramer. We have identified residues along the axial T1-T1 interface that are critical for tertiary and quaternary structure, shown that mutations at one end of the axial T1 interface can perturb the crosslinking of an intersubunit cysteine pair at the other end, and demonstrated that tertiary folding and tetramerization of this Kv domain are coupled. A threshold level of tertiary folding is required for monomers to oligomerize. Coupling between tertiary and quaternary structure formation may be a common feature in the biogenesis of multimeric proteins."

In one method, we hyperpolarized the spin system by selectively capturing the transient spin order created by the statistical fluctuations. In a second method, we took a more active approach and rectified the spin fluctuations by applying real-time feedback to the entire spin ensemble. The created spin order can be stored in the laboratory frame for a period on the order of the longitudinal relaxation time of 30 seconds and then read out."
