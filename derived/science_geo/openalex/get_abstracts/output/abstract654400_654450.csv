https://openalex.org/W3034581902,"New technologies and analysis methods are enabling genomic structural variants (SVs) to be detected with ever-increasing accuracy, resolution and comprehensiveness. To help translate these methods to routine research and clinical practice, we developed a sequence-resolved benchmark set for identification of both false-negative and false-positive germline large insertions and deletions. To create this benchmark for a broadly consented son in a Personal Genome Project trio with broadly available cells and DNA, the Genome in a Bottle Consortium integrated 19 sequence-resolved variant calling methods from diverse technologies. The final benchmark set contains 12,745 isolated, sequence-resolved insertion (7,281) and deletion (5,464) calls ≥50 base pairs (bp). The Tier 1 benchmark regions, for which any extra calls are putative false positives, cover 2.51 Gbp and 5,262 insertions and 4,095 deletions supported by ≥1 diploid assembly. We demonstrate that the benchmark set reliably identifies false negatives and false positives in high-quality SV callsets from short-, linked- and long-read sequencing and optical mapping. Detection of structural variants in the human genome is facilitated by a benchmark set of large deletions and insertions."
https://openalex.org/W3034867886,"The design and optimization of biosynthetic pathways for industrially relevant, non-model organisms is challenging due to transformation idiosyncrasies, reduced numbers of validated genetic parts and a lack of high-throughput workflows. Here we describe a platform for in vitro prototyping and rapid optimization of biosynthetic enzymes (iPROBE) to accelerate this process. In iPROBE, cell lysates are enriched with biosynthetic enzymes by cell-free protein synthesis and then metabolic pathways are assembled in a mix-and-match fashion to assess pathway performance. We demonstrate iPROBE by screening 54 different cell-free pathways for 3-hydroxybutyrate production and optimizing a six-step butanol pathway across 205 permutations using data-driven design. Observing a strong correlation (r = 0.79) between cell-free and cellular performance, we then scaled up our highest-performing pathway, which improved in vivo 3-HB production in Clostridium by 20-fold to 14.63 ± 0.48 g l−1. We expect iPROBE to accelerate design–build–test cycles for industrial biotechnology. The iPROBE platform accelerates the design and optimization of engineered biosynthetic pathways using a combination of cell-free protein synthesis, in vitro pathway assembly and a scoring system to identify high-performing combinations."
https://openalex.org/W3035751258,"Current methods can illuminate the genome-wide activity of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases, but are not easily scalable to the throughput needed to fully understand the principles that govern Cas9 specificity. Here we describe 'circularization for high-throughput analysis of nuclease genome-wide effects by sequencing' (CHANGE-seq), a scalable, automatable tagmentation-based method for measuring the genome-wide activity of Cas9 in vitro. We applied CHANGE-seq to 110 single guide RNA targets across 13 therapeutically relevant loci in human primary T cells and identified 201,934 off-target sites, enabling the training of a machine learning model to predict off-target activity. Comparing matched genome-wide off-target, chromatin modification and accessibility, and transcriptional data, we found that cellular off-target activity was two to four times more likely to occur near active promoters, enhancers and transcribed regions. Finally, CHANGE-seq analysis of six targets across eight individual genomes revealed that human single-nucleotide variation had significant effects on activity at ~15.2% of off-target sites analyzed. CHANGE-seq is a simplified, sensitive and scalable approach to understanding the specificity of genome editors."

https://openalex.org/W3035268568,"The gut microbiome is a malleable microbial community that can remodel in response to various factors, including diet, and contribute to the development of several chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis. We devised an in vitro screening protocol of the mouse gut microbiome to discover molecules that can selectively modify bacterial growth. This approach was used to identify cyclic D,L-α-peptides that remodeled the Western diet (WD) gut microbiome toward the low-fat-diet microbiome state. Daily oral administration of the peptides in WD-fed LDLr-/- mice reduced plasma total cholesterol levels and atherosclerotic plaques. Depletion of the microbiome with antibiotics abrogated these effects. Peptide treatment reprogrammed the microbiome transcriptome, suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β), rebalanced levels of short-chain fatty acids and bile acids, improved gut barrier integrity and increased intestinal T regulatory cells. Directed chemical manipulation provides an additional tool for deciphering the chemical biology of the gut microbiome and might advance microbiome-targeted therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3035247457,"Microwave Ablation (MWA) is one of the most recent developments in the field of thermal therapy. This approach is an effective method for thermal tumor ablation by increasing the temperature above the normal physiological threshold to kill cancer cells with minimum side effects to surrounding organs due to rapid heat dispersive tissues. In the present study, the effects of the shape and size of the tumor on MWA are investigated. To obtain the temperature gradient, coupled bio-heat and electromagnetic equations are solved using a three-dimensional finite element method (FEM). To extract cellular response at different temperatures and times, the three-state mathematical model was employed to achieve the ablation zone size. Results show that treatment of larger tumors is more difficult than that of smaller ones. By doubling the diameter of the tumor, the percentage of dead cancer cells is reduced by 20%. For a spherical tumor smaller than 2 cm, applying 50 W input power compared to 25 W has no significant effects on treatment efficiency and only increases the risk of damage to adjacent tissues. However, for tumors larger than 2 cm, it can increase the ablation zone up to 21%. In the spherical and oblate tumors, the mean percentage of dead cells at 6 GHz is nearly 30% higher than that at 2.45GHz, but for prolate tumors, treatment efficacy is reduced by 10% at a higher frequency. Moreover, the distance between two slots in the coaxial double slot antenna is modified based on the best treatment of prolate tumors. The findings of this study can be used to choose the optimum frequency and the best antenna design according to the shape and size of the tumor."
https://openalex.org/W3035382269,"The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is important for reward processing and motivation. The anatomic organization of neurotransmitter-specific inputs to the VTA remains poorly resolved. In the present study, we mapped the major neurotransmitter projections to the VTA through cell-type-specific retrograde and anterograde tracing. We found that glutamatergic inputs arose from a variety of sources and displayed some connectivity biases toward specific VTA cell types. The sources of GABAergic projections were more widespread, displayed a high degree of differential innervation of subregions in the VTA and were largely biased toward synaptic contact with local GABA neurons. Inactivation of GABA release from the two major sources, locally derived versus distally derived, revealed distinct roles for these projections in behavioral regulation. Optogenetic manipulation of individual distal GABAergic inputs also revealed differential behavioral effects. These results demonstrate that GABAergic projections to the VTA are a major contributor to the regulation and diversification of the structure. Soden et al. use cell-type-specific retrograde tracing to identify neurotransmitter-specific inputs to the ventral tegmental area, uncovering an underappreciated number of GABAergic inputs with diverse innervation patterns and behavioral functions."
https://openalex.org/W3035437122,"Inversions play an important role in disease and evolution but are difficult to characterize because their breakpoints map to large repeats. We increased by sixfold the number (n = 1,069) of previously reported great ape inversions by using single-cell DNA template strand and long-read sequencing. We find that the X chromosome is most enriched (2.5-fold) for inversions, on the basis of its size and duplication content. There is an excess of differentially expressed primate genes near the breakpoints of large (>100 kilobases (kb)) inversions but not smaller events. We show that when great ape lineage-specific duplications emerge, they preferentially (approximately 75%) occur in an inverted orientation compared to that at their ancestral locus. We construct megabase-pair scale haplotypes for individual chromosomes and identify 23 genomic regions that have recurrently toggled between a direct and an inverted state over 15 million years. The direct orientation is most frequently the derived state for human polymorphisms that predispose to recurrent copy number variants associated with neurodevelopmental disease."
https://openalex.org/W2911341421,"The prevalence of osteopathic practitioners, their professional profile and features of their clinical practice, particularly where statutory regulation does not yet exist, are still significantly underreported. The Osteopathic Practitioners Estimates and RAtes (OPERA) project was developed as an European-based census dedicated to profiling the osteopathic profession across Europe. The present study aimed to describe the osteopathic practitioners and the profession in Italy. A voluntary, online based, closed-ended survey was distributed across Italy in the period between February and June 2017. An e-based campaign was set up to reach the Italian osteopathic professionals. Participants were asked to complete the forms by filling in the information regarding the demographics, working status and professional activities, education, consultation fees, patient complaints, treatment and management. The survey was completed by 4816 individuals. 196 people started the survey but did not finish, which corresponds to a 4% attrition rate. The majority of respondents were males (66.7%). The modal age group was 30–39 (40.0%). 73.8% of respondents had a previous academic degree, mainly in the fields of sports science (36.4%) and physiotherapy (25.3%). 25.6% declared not to have a previous academic degree. The majority of respondents declared to work alone (58.4%), while the remaining declared to work in association with other professionals. The osteopaths /citizens ratio was 8.0 osteopaths/100,000 citizens. The profile of osteopaths in Italy seems to be characterised by a self-employed young adult male working mostly as a sole practitioner, who has been trained as osteopath through a part-time curriculum and had a previous degree mostly in the fields of sports science or physiotherapy. These results provide important insights into the osteopathic profession in Italy. The varied professional educational backgrounds need to be considered with regard to the implementation of a professional licensing process and future pre-registration education in the country. The number of respondents is an estimate of the actual number of Italian osteopaths. Only the completion of the regulatory process and the creation of the mandatory official register will allow to know the number of Italy based osteopaths."
https://openalex.org/W3034784007,"Tyrosine is mainly degraded in the liver by a series of enzymatic reactions. Abnormal expression of the tyrosine catabolic enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) has been reported in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite this, aberration in tyrosine metabolism has not been investigated in cancer development. In this work, we conduct comprehensive cross-platform study to obtain foundation for discoveries of potential therapeutics and preventative biomarkers of HCC. We explore data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Oncomine and Kaplan Meier plotter (KM plotter) and performed integrated analyses to evaluate the clinical significance and prognostic values of the tyrosine catabolic genes in HCC. We find that five tyrosine catabolic enzymes are downregulated in HCC compared to normal liver at mRNA and protein level. Moreover, low expression of these enzymes correlates with poorer survival in patients with HCC. Notably, we identify pathways and upstream regulators that might involve in tyrosine catabolic reprogramming and further drive HCC development. In total, our results underscore tyrosine metabolism alteration in HCC and lay foundation for incorporating these pathway components in therapeutics and preventative strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3035719653,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (collectively, Indigenous Australian) women experience a higher burden of cervical cancer than other women. The National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) is failing to meet the needs of Indigenous Australian women, resulting in many women not regularly participating in cervical screening. However, one third of Indigenous Australian women do participate in cervical screening. The reasons that some women in this population commence and continue to screen remain unheard but could provide insights to support women who currently do not participate. We aimed to describe Indigenous Australian women’s experiences and views of participation in cervical screening by yarning (a culturally-appropriate interview technique) with 50 Indigenous Australian women aged 25–70 years who had completed cervical screening in the past five years, recruited via Primary Health Care Centres (PHCCs) from three jurisdictions. Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander women researchers conducted the interviews. Thematic analysis identified six themes: screening as a means of staying strong and in control; overcoming fears, shame, and negative experiences of screening; needing to talk openly about screening; the value of trusting relationships with screening providers; logistical barriers; and overcoming privacy concerns for women employed at PHCCs. Despite describing screening as shameful, invasive, and uncomfortable, women perceived it as a way of staying healthy and exerting control over their health. This ultimately supported their participation and a sense of empowerment. Women valued open discussion about screening and strong relationships with health providers. We identified logistical barriers and specific barriers faced by women employed at PHCCs. This study is strengthened by a research approach that centred Indigenous Australian women’s voices. Understanding the experiences of Indigenous Australian women who participate in screening will help screening providers support women to start and continue to screen regularly. Recommendations for practice are provided."
https://openalex.org/W3034935935,"Introduction Accompanying rapid urbanization in Bangladesh are inequities in health and healthcare which are most visibly manifested in slums or low-income settlements. This study examines socioeconomic, demographic and geographic patterns of self-reported chronic illness and healthcare seeking among adult slum dwellers in Bangladesh. Understanding these patterns is critical in designing more equitable urban health systems and in enabling the country’s goal of Universal Health Coverage by 2030. Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study compares survey data from slum settlements located in two urban sites in Bangladesh, Tongi and Sylhet. Reported chronic illness symptoms and associated healthcare-seeking strategies are compared, and the catastrophic impact of household healthcare expenditures are assessed. Results Significant differences in healthcare-seeking for chronic illness were apparent both within and between slum settlements related to sex, wealth score (PPI), and location. Women were more likely to use private clinics than men. Compared to poorer residents, those from wealthier households sought care to a greater extent in private clinics, while poorer households relied more on drug shops and public hospitals. Chronic symptoms also differed. A greater prevalence of musculoskeletal, respiratory, digestive and neurological symptoms was reported among those with lower PPIs. In both slum sites, reliance on the private healthcare market was widespread, but greater in industrialized Tongi. Tongi also experienced a higher probability of catastrophic expenditure than Sylhet. Conclusions Study results point to the value of understanding context-specific health-seeking patterns for chronic illness when designing delivery strategies to address the growing burden of NCDs in slum environments. Slums are complex social and geographic entities and cannot be generalized. Priority attention should be focused on developing chronic care services that meet the needs of the working poor in terms of proximity, opening hours, quality, and cost."
https://openalex.org/W3035094819,"Neurons represent spatial information in diverse reference frames, but it remains unclear whether neural reference frames change with task demands and whether these changes can account for behavior. In this study, we examined how neurons represent the direction of a moving object during self-motion, while monkeys switched, from trial to trial, between reporting object direction in head- and world-centered reference frames. Self-motion information is needed to compute object motion in world coordinates but should be ignored when judging object motion in head coordinates. Neural responses in the ventral intraparietal area are modulated by the task reference frame, such that population activity represents object direction in either reference frame. In contrast, responses in the lateral portion of the medial superior temporal area primarily represent object motion in head coordinates. Our findings demonstrate a neural representation of object motion that changes with task requirements. Sasaki et al. demonstrate that neurons in the macaque parietal cortex (ventral intraparietal area) flexibly represent object motion in either a head-centered or world-centered reference frame depending on the requirements of the task."
https://openalex.org/W4243624205,"Despite the growth of the osteopathic profession in Spain in the last few years, reliable information regarding professional profile and prevalence is still lacking. The Osteopathic Practitioners Estimates and RAtes (OPERA) project was developed as a European-based survey dedicated to profiling the osteopathic profession across Europe. The present study aims to describe the characteristics of osteopathic practitioners, their professional profile and the features of their clinical practice.A voluntary, validated online-based survey was distributed across Spain between January and May 2018. The survey, composed of 54 questions and 5 sections, was formally translated from English to Spanish and adapted from the original version. Because there is not a unique representative osteopathic professional body in Spain, a dedicated website was created for this study, and participation was encouraged through both specific agreements with national registers/associations and an e-based campaign.A total of 517 osteopaths participated in the study, of which 310 were male (60%). The majority of respondents were aged between 30-39 years (53%) and 98% had an academic degree, mainly in physiotherapy. Eighty-five per cent of the respondents completed a minimum of four-year part-time course in osteopathy. Eighty-nine per cent of the participants were self-employed. Fifty-eight per cent of them own their clinic, and 40% declared to work as sole practitioner. Thirty-one per cent see an average of 21 to 30 patients per week for 46-60 minutes each. The most commonly used diagnostic techniques are movement assessment, palpation of structures/position and assessment of tenderness and trigger points. Regarding treatment modalities, articulatory/mobilisation techniques followed by visceral techniques and progressive inhibition of neuromuscular structures is often to always used. The majority of patients estimated by the respondents sought osteopathic treatment for musculoskeletal problems mainly localised on the lumbar and cervical region. The majority of respondents manifest a robust professional identity and a collective desire to be regulated as a healthcare profession.This study represents the first published document to determine the characteristics of the osteopathic practitioners in Spain using large, national data. To date, it represents the most informative document related to the osteopathic community in Spain. It brings new information on where, how, and by whom osteopathy is practised in the country. The information provided could potentially influence the development of the profession in Spain."
https://openalex.org/W3034473968,"Renal fibrosis is common to all forms of progressive kidney disease. However, current therapies to limit renal fibrosis are largely ineffective. Phosphorylation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIPK) 3 has been recently suggested to be a key regulator of the pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which provides new insights into mechanisms of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the specific effect of RIPK3 on renal cortical fibrosis has not been fully understood. To study the function of RIPK3, both genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of RIPK3 (dabrafenib) were used in the study. Our studies identify that RIPK3 promotes renal fibrosis via the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a mouse model of folic acid-induced nephropathy. Both interventional strategies decreased the renal fibrotic response, and beneficial effects converged on the NLRP3 inflammasome. This study demonstrates a role for RIPK3 as the mediator of renal fibrosis via the upregulation of inflammasome activation. Dabrafenib, as an inhibitor of RIPK3, may be an effective treatment to limit the progression of the tubulointerstitial fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3034531680,"Traditionally in sporting tasks, expertise has been thought of as the attainment of near flawless technical abilities. While contemporary views have become more holistic in nature, in certain sporting domains it is still not clear what exactly encapsulates expertise. This study sought to further understand the crucial and defining characteristics of cricket batting; a complex and difficult perceptual-motor skill with minimal error tolerance and severe time constraints. Eight elite cricket batting coaches, who themselves were former international or state level batsmen, were interviewed to identify characteristics of cricket batting expertise. From this, a conceptual model was developed in relation to an expert within their performance environment. This model highlights several key factors experts possess beyond just technical proficiency, such as self-awareness of their technical and tactical strengths in relation to the situation of the game; self-regulatory behaviours to problem solve performance challenges in-game; and psychological strategies such as between-ball routines to manage cognitions and emotions. The conceptual model of batting expertise described in this paper is designed to introduce an order to how these various skills, possessed by an expert batter, interact within the performance environment to interpret expert performance."
https://openalex.org/W3035299462,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent suppressors of immune function and may play a key role in the development and progression of metastatic cancers. Aerobic exercise has been shown to have anticancer effects, yet the mechanisms behind this protection are largely unknown. Therefore, we examined the effects of physical activity on MDSC accumulation and function.Female BALB/c mice were assigned to one of two primary groups: sedentary tumor (SED+TUM) or wheel run tumor (WR+TUM). After 6 weeks of voluntary wheel running, all animals were randomly subdivided into 4 different timepoint groups; 16, 20, 24, and 28 days post-tumor injection. All mice were inoculated with 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells in the mammary fat pad and WR groups continued to run for the specified time post-injection. Spleen, blood, and tumor samples were analyzed using flow cytometry to assess proportions of MDSCs.Cells expressing MDSC biomarkers were detected in the spleen, blood, and tumor beginning at d16. However, since there was no evidence of immunosuppressive function until d28, we refer to them as immature myeloid cells (IMCs). Compared to SED+TUM, levels of IMCs in the spleen were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in WR+TUM at day 16 (33.0 ± 5.2%; 23.1 ± 10.2% of total cells, respectively) and day 20 (33.9 ± 8.1%; 24.3 ± 5.1% of total cells, respectively). Additionally, there were fewer circulating IMCs in WR+TUM at day 16 and MDSC levels were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the tumor at day 28 in WR+TUM. Additionally, a non-significant 62% and 26% reduction in metastatic lung nodules was observed at days 24 and 28, respectively. At day 28, MDSCs harvested from SED+TUM significantly suppressed CD3+CD4+ T cell proliferation (3.2 ± 1.3 proliferation index) while proliferation in WR+TUM MDSC co-cultures (5.1 ± 1.7 proliferation index) was not different from controls.These findings suggest that physical activity may delay the accumulation of immunosuppressive MDSCs providing a broader window of opportunity for interventions with immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W3035483169,"Background Surveying the scientific literature is an important part of early drug discovery; and with the ever-increasing amount of biomedical publications it is imperative to focus on the most interesting articles. Here we present a project that highlights new understanding (e.g. recently discovered modes of action) and identifies potential drug targets, via a novel, data-driven text mining approach to score type 2 diabetes (T2D) relevance. We focused on monitoring trends and jumps in T2D relevance to help us be timely informed of important breakthroughs. Methods We extracted over 7 million n-grams from PubMed abstracts and then clustered around 240,000 linked to T2D into almost 50,000 T2D relevant ‘semantic concepts’. To score papers, we weighted the concepts based on co-mentioning with core T2D proteins. A protein’s T2D relevance was determined by combining the scores of the papers mentioning it in the five preceding years. Each week all proteins were ranked according to their T2D relevance. Furthermore, the historical distribution of changes in rank from one week to the next was used to calculate the significance of a change in rank by T2D relevance for each protein. Results We show that T2D relevant papers, even those not mentioning T2D explicitly, were prioritised by relevant semantic concepts. Well known T2D proteins were therefore enriched among the top scoring proteins. Our ‘high jumpers’ identified important past developments in the apprehension of how certain key proteins relate to T2D, indicating that our method will make us aware of future breakthroughs. In summary, this project facilitated keeping up with current T2D research by repeatedly providing short lists of potential novel targets into our early drug discovery pipeline."
https://openalex.org/W3035446435,"There is substantial variation in the timing of significant reproductive life events such as menarche and first sexual intercourse. Life history theory explains this variation as an adaptive response to an individual’s environment and it is important to examine how traits within life history strategies affect each other. Here we applied Mendelian randomization (MR) methods to investigate whether there is a causal effect of variation in age at menarche and age at first sexual intercourse (markers or results of exposure to early life adversity) on outcomes related to reproduction, education and risky behaviour in UK Biobank (N = 114 883–181 255). Our results suggest that earlier age at menarche affects some traits that characterize life history strategies including earlier age at first and last birth, decreased educational attainment, and decreased age at leaving education (for example, we found evidence for a 0.26 year decrease in age at first birth per year decrease in age at menarche, 95% confidence interval: -0.34 to -0.17; p < 0.001). We find no clear evidence of effects of age at menarche on other outcomes, such as risk taking behaviour. Age at first sexual intercourse was also related to many life history outcomes, although there was evidence of horizontal pleiotropy which violates an assumption of MR and we therefore cannot infer causality from this analysis. Taken together, these results highlight how MR can be applied to test predictions of life history theory and to better understand determinants of health and social behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3034370210,"The beneficial effects of radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation for intermediate-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients are still controversial.To determine the impact of RAI therapy on disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients with intermediate-risk PTC, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 23107 intermediate-risk PTC patients who underwent primary thyroidectomy with or without RAI in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.RAI therapy was significantly associated with improved DSS (adjusted HR = 0.65, P = 0.017) in intermediate-risk PTC patients after multivariate adjusting for clinicopathological characteristics. However, subgroup analyses demonstrated that RAI ablation was only associated with improved DSS in patients with male gender (adjusted HR = 0.47, P = 0.005), age ≥ 45 years (adjusted HR = 0.34, P < 0.001) and tumor size > 20 mm (adjusted HR = 0.58, P = 0.007).RAI decision-making should be considered on an individual basis rather than ""one size fits all"" in intermediate-risk PTC patients; only patients with male gender, age ≥ 45 years, and tumor size > 20 mm may benefit from RAI therapy."

Bi-cruciate retaining (BCR) TKA is considered to show improved clinical function and kinematics. This survey aimed to (1) identify interest in and acceptance of BCR TKA surgery and (2) to capture the range of indications for BCR in the opinion of practicing knee surgeons. 346 surgeons with experience in TKA surgery completed a bi-lingual online survey. Demographics, arthroplasty experience as well as acceptance of and indications for BCR TKA were collected. 53 surgeons were experienced in BCR TKA and 225 would consider implanting it. A mean of 19.5% of TKA patients were considered eligible for BCR TKA. 56.3% were thought to have intact ACL at the time of TKA surgery. Surgeons were not likely to perform BCR TKA in patients with inflammatory arthritis, aged over 80, BMI above 34.9 kg/m2, a varus or valgus deformity of more than 10° and flexion contractures of more than 10°. There is strong interest among orthopedic surgeons to perform BCR TKA and the percentage of potentially eligible patients is high. Significant joint deformity is a limitation of BCR TKA, while age and high BMI are less relevant. BCR TKA experienced surgeons are less restrictive."
https://openalex.org/W3034303396,"The susceptibility of newly expressed proteins to digestion by gastrointestinal proteases (e.g., pepsin) has long been regarded as one of the important endpoints in the weight-of-evidence (WOE) approach to assess the allergenic risk of genetically modified (GM) crops. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has suggested that current digestion study protocols used for this assessment should be modified to more accurately reflect the diverse physiological conditions encountered in human populations and that the post-digestion analysis should include analytical methods to detect small peptide digestion products.The susceptibility of two allergens (beta-lactoglobin (β-Lg) and alpha-lactalbumin (α-La)) and two non-allergens (hemoglobin (Hb) and phosphofructokinase (PFK)) to proteolytic degradation was investigated under two pepsin digestion conditions (optimal pepsin digestion condition: pH 1.2, 10 U pepsin/μg test protein; sub-optimal pepsin digestion condition: pH 5.0, 1 U pepsin/10 mg test protein), followed by 34.5 U trypsin/mg test protein and 0.4 U chymotrypsin/mg test protein digestion in the absence or presence of bile salts. All samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in conjunction with Coomassie Blue staining and, in parallel, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detection. The results provide following insights: 1) LC-MS methodology does provide the detection of small peptides; 2) Peptides are detected in both allergens and non-allergens from all digestion conditions; 3) No clear differences among the peptides detected from allergen and non-allergens; 4) The differences observed in SDS-PAGE between the optimal and sub-optimal pepsin digestion conditions are expected and align with kinetics and properties of the specific enzymes; 5) The new methodology with new digestion conditions and LC-MS detection does not provide any differentiating information for prediction whether a protein is an allergen. The classic pepsin resistance assay remains the most useful assessment of the potential exposure of an intact newly expressed protein as part of product safety assessment within a WOE approach."
https://openalex.org/W3034639629,"There are approximately 1.2 million people currently living with spinal cord injury (SCI), with a majority of cases at the cervical level and half involving incomplete injuries. Yet, as most preclinical research has been focused on bilateral thoracic models, there remains a disconnect between bench and bedside that limits translational success. Here, we profile a clinically relevant model of unilateral cervical contusion injury in the mouse (30kD with 0, 2, 5, or 10 second dwell time). We demonstrate sustained behavioral deficits in performance on grip strength, cylinder reaching, horizontal ladderbeam and CatWalk automated gait analysis tasks. Beyond highlighting reliable parameters for injury assessment, we also explored the effect of mouse strain and age on injury outcome, including evaluation of constitutively immunodeficient mice relevant for neurotransplantation and cellular therapy testing. Comparison of C57Bl/6 and immunodeficient Rag2gamma(c)-/- as well as Agouti SCIDxRag2Gamma(c)-/- hybrid mouse strains revealed fine differences in post-injury ipsilateral grip strength as well as total number of rearings on the cylinder task. Differences in post-SCI contralateral forepaw duty cycle and regularity index as measured by CatWalk gait analysis between the two immunodeficient strains were also observed. Further, assessment of young (3–4 months old) and aging (16–17 months old) Rag2gamma(c)-/- mice identified age-related pre-injury differences in strength and rearing that were largely masked following cervical contusion injury; observations that may help interpret previous results in aged rodents as well as human clinical trials. Collectively, the work provides useful insight for experimental design and analysis of future pre-clinical studies in a translational unilateral cervical contusion injury model."
https://openalex.org/W3035057400,"Few studies examined the individual and conjoint associations of accelerometer-measured physical activity (PA) and sedentary times with the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among older adults.We evaluated 1,268 Framingham Offspring Study participants (mean age 69.2 years, 53.8% women) between 2011 and 2014. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.732 and/or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥25/35 μg/mg (men/women). We used multivariable logistic regression models to relate time spent being sedentary and active with the odds of CKD. We then performed compositional data analysis to estimate the change in the eGFR and UACR when a fixed proportion of time in one activity behavior (among the following: moderate to vigorous physical activity [MVPA], light intensity physical activity [LIPA], and sedentary) is reallocated to another activity behavior.Overall, 258 participants had prevalent CKD (20.4%; 120 women). Higher total PA ([MVPA+LIPA], adjusted-odds ratio [OR] per 30 minutes/day increase, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.96) and higher LIPA (OR per 30 minutes/day increase, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99) were associated with lower odds of CKD. Additionally, higher sedentary time (OR per 30 minutes/day increase, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.29) was associated with higher odds of CKD. Reallocating 5% of the time from LIPA to sedentary was associated with the largest predicted difference in eGFR (-1.06 ml/min/1.73m2). Reallocating 1% of time spent in MVPA to sedentary status predicted the largest difference in UACR (14.37 μg/mg).The findings suggest that increasing LIPA and maintaining MVPA at the expense of sedentary time may be associated with a lower risk of CKD in community-based older adults."

Transcripts were coded using team-based qualitative content analysis to identify key challenges and recommendations in opioid risk mitigation.Panelists provided insight into challenges across multiple levels of the U.S. health system, including the technical complexity of treating chronic pain, the fraught national climate around opioids, the need to integrate surveillance data across a fragmented U.S. health system, a lack of access to non-pharmacological options for chronic pain care, and difficulties in provider and patient communication. Participating experts identified recommendations for multi-level change efforts spanning policy, research, education, and the organization of healthcare delivery.Reducing opioid risk while ensuring safe and effective pain management, according to participating experts, is likely to require multi-level efforts spanning military, veteran, and civilian health systems. Efforts to implement risk mitigation strategies at the patient level should be accompanied by efforts to increase education for patients and providers, increase access to non-pharmacological pain care, and support use of existing clinical decision support, including state-level prescription drug monitoring programs."
https://openalex.org/W3034427229,"The Global Earth Overshoot Day, the date when all annually available natural resources are consumed, is set for July this year. For densely populated European countries like Germany or Switzerland, that specific day is due even earlier (May). To overcome such an unsustainable lifestyle, immediate actions are required, which includes substantial educational efforts. As the model of ""Sustainable Development"" is complex, appropriate pedagogical actions need to support cognitive learning, critical thinking and behavioural actions. Knowledge about individual conceptions in relation to the Environment, Nature and Ecological Footprints contributes to pre-conditions to succeed. To what extent present teaching methods influenced individual conceptions during the first UN-decade regarding those terms is illustrated by 464 Swiss-German university freshmen who participated in our paper-pencil test, which is based on four open questions. The term of Environment was perceived as the sum of biocentric, ecocentric and anthropocentric views. The participants often equated the term to Nature and associated it with positive feelings or emotions. Therefore, calm, joy and aesthetic appreciation were predominantly named. Regardless of the concept, humans were perceived as the Greatest Environmental Threat. In contrast, recommendations to reduce Environmental Footprints regarding mobility & transport, waste avoidance and consumption differ. Following a binary logistic regression analysis, the involvement of the Inclusion of Self Scale (INS) was used as an explanatory variable to detect patterns of those conceptions. Relating sustainable concepts, natural resources were frequently named exceeding saving water and energy or other association dealt with second-hand issues or regional/ seasonal usages. Such ideas are shaped by experiences and scientific expertise."
https://openalex.org/W3034631955,"Low-income cities that are subject to high population pressure and vulnerable to climate events often have a low capacity to continuously deliver safe drinking water. Here we reported the results of a 32-year survey on the temporal dynamics of drinking water quality indicators in the city of Antananarivo. We analyzed the long-term evolution of the quality of the water supplied and characterized the interactions between climatic conditions and the full-scale water supply system. A total of 25,467 water samples were collected every week at different points in the supplied drinking water system. Samples were analyzed for total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli (EC), intestinal Enterococci (IE), and Spores of Sulphite-Reducing Clostridia (SSRC). Nine-hundred-eighty-one samples that were identified as positive for one or more indicators were unevenly distributed over time. The breakpoint method identified four periods when the time series displayed changes in the level and profile of contamination (i) and the monthly pattern of contamination (ii), with more direct effects of rainfall on the quality of supplied drinking water. The modeling showed significantly different lags among indicators of bacteria occurrence after cumulative rainfall, which range from 4 to 8 weeks. Among the effects of low-income urbanization, a rapid demographic transition and the degradation of urban watersheds have gradually affected the quality of the water supplied and resulted in the more direct effects of rainfall events. We focused on the need to adopt an alternative perspective of drinking water and urban watersheds management."
https://openalex.org/W3034651528,"Mechanisms underlying the manifestation of relatives’ expressed emotion (EE) in the early stages of psychosis are still not properly understood. The present study aimed to examine whether relatives’ psychological distress and subjective appraisals of the illness predicted EE dimensions over-and-above patients’ poor clinical and functional status. Baseline patient-related variables and relatives attributes comprising criticism, emotional over-involvement (EOI), psychological distress, and illness attributions were assessed in 91 early psychosis patients and their respective relatives. Relatives were reassessed regarding EE dimensions at a 6-month follow-up. Relatives’ psychological distress and illness attributions predicted criticism and EOI over-and-above patients’ illness characteristics at both time points. Relatives’ increased levels of anxiety, attributions of blame toward the patients, an emotional negative representation about the disorder, and decreased levels of self-blame attributions predicted EE-criticism at baseline. Relatives’ anxiety and negative emotional representation of the disorder were the only significant predictors of EE-criticism at follow-up, whereas anxiety, attributions of control by the relative and an emotional negative representation about the disorder predicted EE-EOI both at baseline and follow-up assessments. Understanding the components that comprise and maintain EE attitudes should guide early psychosis caregivers in family interventions, enhancing proper management of psychological distress and reduction of negative appraisals about the illness. The prevention of high-EE attitudes over time in a sensitive period such as early psychosis might be critical in shaping the health of caregivers and the outcome of the affected relatives."
https://openalex.org/W3035075076,"Objectives Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has seen increasing use as a prostate cancer treatment in recent years and has proven medically effective in numerous contexts. The treatment, however, is associated with a host of side effects including depression. Managing the psychological wellbeing of prostate cancer patients is important for maximizing their survival outcomes. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate depressive symptomatology in patients with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared with that in patients who underwent prostatectomy and to explore the factors that affect depressive symptoms, which might occur during ADT. Methods One hundred and seven patients undergoing ADT (ADT group) and prostatectomy (Operation group) were enrolled. Adjustments were made for differences in characteristics between groups using a propensity score model with stabilized weights before treatment. Depressive symptoms between groups were compared using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before treatment and six months after treatment initiation. To identify factors affecting depressive symptoms during ADT, multivariate regression analysis was performed on the mean change in BDI score, age, body mass index, testosterone level, prostate-specific antigen level, the international index of erectile function (IIEF), and the Gleason score. Results The BDI score significantly increased in the ADT group compared to the operation group six months after treatment initiation (p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that before ADT, the BDI score was higher by 0.446 according to the IIEF. During ADT, the BDI score increased by 1.579 according to changes in BMI (p = 0.021) and decreased by 0.01 according to changes in testosterone levels (p = 0.034). Conclusion Depressive symptoms can be exacerbated in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT. Efforts are needed to diagnose and treat depression appropriately, especially if depressive symptoms change in ADT patients with a high IIEF score before ADT, or reduced testosterone levels or increased BMI during ADT."
https://openalex.org/W3035099895,"We previously showed that Month 13 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against dengue virus (DENV) correlated with vaccine efficacy (VE) of CYD-TDV against symptomatic, virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) in the CYD14 and CYD15 Phase 3 trials. While PRNT is the gold standard nAb assay, it is time-consuming and costly. We developed a next-generation high-throughput microneutralization (MN) assay and assessed its suitability for immune-correlates analyses and immuno-bridging applications. We analyzed MN and PRNT50 titers measured at baseline and Month 13 in a randomly sampled immunogenicity subset, and at Month 13 in nearly all VCD cases through Month 25. For each serotype, MN and PRNT50 titers showed high correlations, at both baseline and Month 13, with MN yielding a higher frequency of baseline-seronegatives. For both assays, Month 13 titer correlated inversely with VCD risk. Like PRNT50, high Month 13 MN titers were associated with high VE, and estimated VE increased with average Month 13 MN titer. We also studied each assay as a valid surrogate endpoint based on the Prentice criteria, which supported each assay as a valid surrogate for DENV-1 but only partially valid for DENV-2, -3, and -4. In addition, we applied Super-Learner to assess how well demographic, Month 13 MN, and/or Month 13 PRNT50 titers could predict Month 13-25 VCD outcome status; prediction was best when using demographic, MN, and PRNT50 information. We conclude that Month 13 MN titer performs comparably to Month 13 PRNT50 titer as a correlate of risk, correlate of vaccine efficacy, and surrogate endpoint. The MN assay could potentially be used to assess nAb titers in immunogenicity studies, immune-correlates studies, and immuno-bridging applications. Additional research would be needed for assessing the utility of MN titer in correlates analyses of other DENV endpoints and over longer follow-up periods."
https://openalex.org/W3035715235,"Nepal, like many other low-income countries, has a great burden of mental health issues but few resources to meet them. In addition, Nepal has endured several traumatic events in recent decades but the impact on mental health has not been studied in clinical settings. This study explores trauma-related psychiatric disorders and their correlates.100 patients with a history of trauma who visited the outpatient psychiatry clinic at a University hospital in Kathmandu were assessed. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview 2.1 (CIDI) was used to evaluate lifetime and current depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Current PTSD was evaluated using PSTD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C).The median number of lifetime traumatic events was two. Natural disaster was the most common trauma type (84%) compared to other types of trauma. Rape was reported as the most traumatizing. Current PTSD was found in 15%, depression in 33% and GAD in 38% of the patients. The lifetime rates were PTSD 83%, depression 45% and GAD 40%. There was high comorbidity between the disorders. The 31 to 45 years age group, above high school education level and trauma types other than earthquake were independently associated with current PTSD. Marital status and upper socioeconomic status (SES) compared to upper-middle SES were independently associated with lifetime PTSD. Both lifetime and current depression rates were independently associated with the upper SES compared to upper-middle SES. Place of living, education above high school and lower-middle SES were significantly associated with lifetime and current GAD.PTSD, depression and GAD were prevalent in a trauma exposed patient population visiting a psychiatric clinic in Nepal. High rates of comorbidities and several risk factors were identified. Our findings highlight the need for addressing trauma related disorders in clinical settings in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3035495021,"Despite a developing literature on urban streams, few studies have addressed the timing and mechanisms of urban-induced stream hydrogeomorphic adjustment on biotic assemblages. Here, we investigated the relationships between urbanization-driven annual changes in fluvial geomorphic characteristics and fish assemblages in 12 headwater streams in the Columbus Metropolitan Area (CMA), Ohio (USA) over 3–5 years. Multiple stream hydrogeomorphic characteristics changed over time including slope (0.1% decrease on average), discharge (39% decrease), and shear stress (29% decrease), some in concert with one another (e.g., slope and shear stress). Species-specific fish associations with hydrogeomorphic associations varied in nature and strength by year and thus were somewhat equivocal. At the assemblage level, we observed a negative relationship between D50 (median sediment particle size) and % tolerant individuals as well as a positive trend between incision ratio and % generalists over study years. Study reaches with higher total catchment imperviousness were associated with both finer median sediment size (R2 = 0.19) and lower assemblage diversity (R2 = 0.55). These results contribute to current understanding of the drivers of fish assemblages in urbanizing catchments, and point to urban-induced hydrogeomorphic alterations as one mechanism through which land-use changes influence in-channel characteristics important to aquatic biota."
https://openalex.org/W3034391894,"In this study, we focused on the seasonal variation of the determinants of territory size in the weakly electric fish Gymnotus omarorum. This species is a seasonal breeder that displays year-round territorial aggression. Female and male dyads exhibit indistinguishable non-breeding territorial agonistic behavior and body size is the only significant predictor of contest outcome. We conducted field surveys across seasons that included the identification of individual location, measurements of water physico-chemical variables, characterization of individual morphometric and physiological traits, and their correlation to spatial distribution. G. omarorum tolerates a wide range of dissolved oxygen concentration, and territory size correlated positively with dissolved oxygen in both seasons. In the non-breeding season, territory size was sexually monomorphic and correlated only with body size. In the breeding season, territory size no longer correlated with body size but differed between sexes: (i) the overall spatial arrangement was sexually biased, (ii) territory size depended on gonadal hormones in both sexes, which was expected for males, but not previously reported in females, (iii) female territory size showed a positive relationship with gonadal size, and (iv) females showed relatively larger territories than males. This study demonstrates seasonal changes in the determinants of territory size and thus contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the behavioral plasticity natural territorial behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3034620315,"Background Viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C, D and E) remains a public health problem in Peru, with a high disease burden. There are limited data on the prevalence of viral hepatitis at a national level, and none reported for over two decades. In this study, the prevalence rates of hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV), C (HCV), D (HDV) and E virus (HEV) infections in the Peruvian population were determined to provide updated baseline data that would help guide the development of strategies aimed at reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis in Peru. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based study in the 25 regions of Peru. The study included participants of both sexes, aged 15–69 years, who had lived for >6 months in a specific region of Peru. Serum samples were analyzed by ELISA for anti-HAV (IgG), anti-HBs ≥10 mUI/ml, anti-HCV, anti-HDV and anti-HEV (IgG) antibodies, and by chemiluminescence for the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies against the core HBV antigen (anti-HBc IgM and IgG). Results In a total of 5183 study participants, the prevalence rates of anti-HAV (IgG), HBsAg, total anti-HBc IgG, anti-HBs ≥10 mUI/ml, anti-HCV and anti-HEV (IgG) were 98.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 98.0–98.7), 0.4% (95% CI 0.21–0.55), 10.1% (95% CI 9.4–11.0), 60% (95% CI 58.5–61.2), 0.1% (95% CI 0.02–0.25), and 14% (95% CI 13.1–15.0%), respectively. The prevalence of anti-HDV among HBsAg carriers was 15% (3/20). Conclusions The prevalence of HAV and HEV in the population aged 15–69 years in Peru is high, while the prevalence of HBV and HDV has changed from intermediate to low endemicity level and the prevalence of HCV is low. These findings would prove useful in the development of new strategies aimed at reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis in Peru, with a view to ultimately eliminating these infections in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3035663718,"It is well-known that correction of blur can improve visual perception. However, it is unclear how the beneficial effect of correction is affected by the regions of correction and the spatial uncertainty introduced by the retinal stimulation. The purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to compare the impacts of blur correction between isoeccentric locations of the visual field; and second, to evaluate the effect of spatial cueing in each corrected location on performing a simple task. Five subjects were asked to complete a simple detection task of a small dark spot stimulus presented randomly at four cardinal retinal locations (eccentricity: 5°) under manipulation of attention via an exogenous cue. Both clear and blurred targets were randomly displayed across the visual field and viewed monocularly through a vision simulator, used to minimize peripheral ocular aberrations. Results confirmed the advantage of clear vs/ blurred images under spatial uncertainty. It was also found that the visual benefit from blur correction is unequal at isoeccentric locations, even for a simple detection task. While manipulation of attention in the presence of spatial uncertainty significantly modulated response time (RT) performance, no differential effect was observed for clear and blurred stimuli, suggesting that attention has only a small effect on the optical benefit for a simple detection task when the display is depleted (no distractor). Those observations highlight the importance of field performance asymmetries in optical interventions and may offer useful implications for the design of extrafoveal refractive correction. Further studies are needed to elucidate how the focus of attention interacts with the perceived gain of vision correction."
https://openalex.org/W3034239427,"As the Coronavirus contagion develops, it is increasingly important to understand the dynamics of the disease. Its severity is best described by two parameters: its ability to spread and its lethality. Here, we combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: the final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t0). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k and t0), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We were able to predict the CFR much closer to reality at all stages of the viral outbreak compared to traditional methods. This model can be used far more effectively than current models to estimate the CFR during an outbreak, allowing for better planning. The model can also help us better understand the impact of individual interventions on the CFR. With much better data collection and labeling, we should be able to improve our predictive power even further."
https://openalex.org/W3035054866,"There are differences in disease susceptibility to whirling disease (WD) among strains of rainbow trout. The North American strain Trout Lodge (TL) is highly susceptible, whereas the German Hofer (HO) strain is more resistant. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are key in inhibiting cytokine signaling. Their role in modulating the immune response against whirling disease is not completely clear. This study aimed at investigating the transcriptional response of SOCS1 and SOCS3 genes to Myxobolus cerebralis along with that of several upstream regulators and immune response genes. M. cerebralis induced the expression of SOCS1, the IL-6-dependent SOCS3, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the Treg associated transcription factor FOXP3 in TL fish at multiple time points, which likely caused a restricted STAT1 and STAT3 activity affecting the Th17/Treg17 balance. The expression of SOCS1 and the IL-6-dependent SOCS3 was induced constraining the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 in TL fish, thereby causing Th17/Treg17 imbalance and leaving the fish unable to establish a protective immune response against M. cerebralis or control inflammatory reactions increasing susceptibility to WD. Conversely, in HO fish, the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 was restrained, whereas the expression of STAT1 and IL-23-mediated STAT3 was induced potentially enabling more controlled immune responses, accelerating parasite clearance and elevating resistance. The induced expression of STAT1 and IL-23-mediated STAT3 likely maintained a successful Th17/Treg17 balance and enabled fish to promote effective immune responses favouring resistance against WD. The results provide insights into the role of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in regulating the activation and magnitude of host immunity in rainbow trout, which may help us understand the mechanisms that underlie the variation in resistance to WD."

The aim of this quantitative, cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between a teen’s capacity to mentalize and three attachment-related factors: parent-teen trust, parent-teen communication, and parent-teen alienation. Methods In an online survey, 82 (mainly) Australian adolescents (57 female; 23 male; 2 non-binary; mean age 17.09 years) completed: i) The Children’s Eyes Test, which measured mentalization; and ii) The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment-45, which measured trust, communication quality, and alienation. Results In teens’ relationships with both mothers and fathers, trust and communication quality were significantly positively correlated (p = .001) when controlling for age and gender. Both were significantly negatively correlated with alienation (p = .001) with control variables included. Capacity to mentalize did not correlate with trust, communication quality, or alienation in relationships with either mothers or fathers (p ≤ .05). Conclusions Possible reasons are proposed for why no relationship was found between mentalization and trust, communication quality, or alienation. Implications for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3035003913,"The emergence of the Upper Paleolithic and regional variability in early Upper Paleolithic industries are prominent topics in Paleolithic archaeology, with special relevance to the dispersal and differentiation of early modern human cultures across Eurasia. The so-called Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) has been considered a key element in the emergence of the Upper Paleolithic in northern Asia. Here, we examine the intra-assemblage variation in the collection from the 1963 excavation at Shuidonggou locality 1, a major IUP site in northern China. We combine technological and quantitative attribute analyses to investigate the variety of core reduction sequences and tool manufacture behaviors at the site. A range of core reduction sequences have been documented at Shuidonggou locality 1, including both simple core reduction and prepared core reduction yielding laminar (blade-like) products. The simple core reduction component may due to mixed non-IUP assemblages from different archaeological layers. Among the laminar core reduction sequences, the main strategy involves asymmetrical exploitation of the broad face of core blank, producing blades and elongate flakes, and resembling a recurrent Levallois blade method sensu lato. We compare Shuidonggou laminar blank production with that of IUP assemblages in the Siberian Altai, northern Mongolia, and the Transbaikal region. The comparison demonstrates a general consistency to the basic blank production in IUP assemblages across northern Asia, with some regional variation. The results suggest a multi-directional model of diffusion of the IUP in northeast Asia."
https://openalex.org/W3035535004,"Our purpose was to evaluate the concentrations of vitreous cytokines in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). We hypothesized that patients with macula on RRD have lower levels of cytokines compared to patients with macula off RRD and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Vitreous fluids were collected during 23G pars plana vitrectomy from 58 eyes of 58 patients. Indication for vitrectomy included macula off and macula on RRD, PVR, and idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM). A multiplex chemiluminescent immunoassay was performed to measure the concentrations of 48 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Levels of HGF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, and MIF were significantly higher in all groups of retinal detachment compared to ERM. Levels of CTACK, eotaxin, G-CSF, IP-10, MIG, SCF, SCGF-beta, SDF-1alpha were significantly higher in PVR compared to macula on RRD and ERM. Levels of IL-1ra, IL-5, IL-9, M-CSF, MIP-1alpha, and TRIAL were significantly higher in PVR compared to macula on RRD. Our results indicate that the position of macula lutea and the presence of PVR significantly influence vitreous cytokine expression. The detected proteins may serve as biomarkers to estimate the possibility of PVR formation and may help to invent personalized therapeutic strategies to slow down or prevent PVR."
https://openalex.org/W3034210918,"Although global longitudinal strain (GLS) measurements provide useful predictive information, measurement variability is still a major concern. We sought to determine whether fully automated GLS measurements could predict future cardiac events in patients with known or suspected heart failure (HF).GLS was measured using fully automated 2D speckle tracking analysis software (AutoStrain, TomTec) in 3,150 subjects who had undergone clinically indicated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) assays and echocardiographic examinations. Among 1,514 patients in the derivation cohort, optimal cut-off values of BNP and GLS for cardiac death (CD) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were determined using survival classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. The remaining 1,636 patients, comprising the validation cohort, were stratified into subgroups according to predefined cut-off values, and survival curves were compared.Survival CART analysis selected GLS with cut-off values of 6.2% and 14.0% for predicting CD. GLS of 6.9% and 13.9% and BNP of 83.2 pg/mL and 206.3 pg/mL were selected for predicting MACEs. For simplicity, we defined GLS of 7% and 14% and BNP of 100 pg/mL and 200 pg/mL as cut-off values. These cut-off values stratify high-risk patients in the validation cohort with known or suspected HF for both CD and MACEs.In addition to BNP, fully automated GLS measurements provide prognostic information for patients with known or suspected HF, and this approach facilitates clinical work flow."

High-throughput sequencing technologies are now providing opportunities to address this issue by aiding in the generation of molecular data for many understudied species of high conservation interest. Our overall goal of this study was to begin building the genomic resources to continue investigations and conservation of the Spot-Tailed Earless lizard. Here we leverage the power of high-throughput sequencing to generate the liver transcriptome for the Northern Spot-Tailed Earless Lizard (Holbrookia lacerata) and Southern Spot-Tailed Earless Lizard (Holbrookia subcaudalis), which have declined in abundance in the past decades, and their sister species, the Common Lesser Earless Lizard (Holbrookia maculata). Our efforts produced high quality and robust transcriptome assemblies validated by 1) quantifying the number of processed reads represented in the transcriptome assembly and 2) quantifying the number of highly conserved single-copy orthologs that are present in our transcript set using the BUSCO pipeline. We found 1,361 1-to-1 orthologs among the three Holbrookia species, Anolis carolinensis, and Sceloporus undulatus. We carried out dN/dS selection tests using a branch-sites model and identified a dozen genes that experienced positive selection in the Holbrookia lineage with functions in development, immunity, and metabolism. Our single-copy orthologous sequences additionally revealed significant pairwise sequence divergence (~.73%) between the Northern H. lacerata and Southern H. subcaudalis that further supports the recent elevation of the Southern Spot-Tailed Earless Lizard to full species."

We aim to investigate the association of the various hematologic markers, in particular NLR among others, with distant metastases, a common feature in pancreatic cancer.Clinical data from 355 pancreatic cancer patients managed at King Hussein Cancer Center (Amman-Jordan) have been reviewed. We examined the relationship between absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute eosinophilic count (AEC), absolute monocytic count (AMC), NLR, monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) with the presence of baseline distant metastases and OS. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was plotted to identify the NLR optimum cutoff value indicative of its association with distant metastases.On univariate and multivariate analyses patients whom on presentation had high NLR (≥3.3) showed more baseline distant metastases compared to patients with low NLR (<3.3), (p-value: <0.0001 and <0.0001, respectively). Patients with high baseline ANC (≥5500/μL), AMC (≥600/μL), MLR (≥0.3) had more baseline distant metastases in comparison to patients with lower values (p-value: 0.02, 0.001, and <0.0001, respectively). High ANC, NLR, MLR, and PLR and low ALC were associated with poorer OS, (p-value: <0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.04, and 0.01, respectively).This study presents additional evidence of the association of some of the hematologic markers; in particular ANC, NLR, AMC, and MLR, with baseline distant metastases and poor outcome in pancreatic cancer. Whether these immune phenomena can help in identifying patients at higher risk for the subsequent development of distant metastases is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W3034400048,"The most common methods for estimating the infiltration function are measurements through a double-ring infiltrometer (DRI) and empirical models. Infiltration data always exhibit different kinds of scatter, which affect the accuracy of the estimated infiltration function. This study presents a new methodology to calibrate the infiltration function. The suggested approach is based on combining the DRI method with the changes in the measured soil water content. Furrow irrigation experiments were conducted to estimate the infiltration function using different methods and to investigate the effect of data scatter on the reliability of the estimated infiltration function. Furrow elevations were observed, and for each irrigation event advance times, recession times, and inflow rates were observed. The infiltration depths were measured as a function of the change in the soil water content before and after irrigation event. Infiltration parameters were estimated using DRI treatment, empirical model (Kostiakov model), and suggested approach. Measured and simulated infiltration depths using the described methods were compared. The results show that the infiltration depths estimated using a DRI were lower than the observed infiltration depths, while the infiltration depths estimated using the empirical model were higher than the observed infiltration depths. The results indicate that the infiltration function estimated using the recommended approach was more accurate and reasonable than the infiltration function estimated using the DRI, and empirical (Kostiakov model) methods. In addition, the proposed approach can reduce the required measurements during the irrigation event, and can also reduce the potential scatter in the estimated infiltration function that results from soil variability and measurement errors."
https://openalex.org/W3035660184,"The reduced importance of intent when judging purity (vs. harm) violations is some of the strongest evidence for distinct moral modules or systems: moral pluralism. However, research has indicated that some supposed differences between purity and harm moral domains are due to the relative weirdness of purity vignettes. This weirdness might lead to a failure to attend to or correctly process relevant mental state information. Such attentional failures could offer an alternative explanation (to separate moral systems) for the reduced exculpatory value of innocent intentions for purity violations. We tested if the different role of intent in each domain was moderated by individual differences in attentional efficiency, as measured by the Attention Network Task. If attentional efficiency explains the reduced exculpatory value of innocent intentions in purity (vs. harm) violations, then we would expect those high (vs. low) in attentional efficiency not to show the reduced exculpatory effect of innocent intentions in the purity (vs. harm) domain. Consistent with moral pluralism, results revealed no such moderation. Findings are discussed in relation to various ways of testing domain-general and domain-specific accounts of the mental state × domain effect, so that we might better understand the architecture of our moral minds."
https://openalex.org/W3034675111,"Aims Robust evidence supports intensive glucose control in those with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes to reduce the risk of developing micro- and macrovascular complications. Data to support longitudinal glycaemic targets is lacking. We aimed to explore if longer duration of diabetes and greater age might reduce the impact of glycaemia on the risk of vascular complications. Research and design methods Data for adults age 20 years or more, was extracted from a clinical database of people with type 1 diabetes cared for at a London teaching hospital. The presence or absence of micro- and macro-vascular complications was recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using HbA1c as independent variable, diabetes duration and age as continuous variable and obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, low HDL cholesterol and hypertriglyceridaemia as categorical variables. Results Data from 495 patients was used. HbA1c above 60 mmol/mol (7.6%) was associated with increased microvascular complications in patients aged 20–44 years, independent of age and duration of diabetes. In older people with T1DM duration of diabetes was the major risk factor. Conclusions Our study suggests that increased age and greater duration of diabetes reduce the impact of glycaemia on the risk of vascular complications. Intensive blood glucose management in patients aged ≥45 years may have limited benefits in terms of reducing the risk of complications although this does not dismiss the benefits of good glycaemic control in older people with T1DM."
https://openalex.org/W3034747023,"Certified Nurse Specialists (CNS) are advanced practice nurses that often play a role in management. This study aims to investigate whether cooperation between CNSs in the position of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) head nurse and intensivists change the length of stay for ICU patients. A single centered retrospective cohort study design was followed. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine whether there is a difference in patients' length of ICU stay for two years before and after CNS as ICU head nurse and an intensivist started collaborating. The patients' diagnosis, age, gender, scheduled/emergency admission, surgical history, length of ICU stay, usage of ventilator, and details of ICU treatment were collected from the institution's electronic medical records. During the study period (April 2015 to March 2019), 3,135 patients were admitted to ICU, with 1,471 in the before collaboration group and 1,664 in the after-collaboration group. Collaboration between the CNS as head nurse and intensivists was significantly associated with shorter length of ICU stay (coefficient -0.03 [95% CI, -0.05-0.01], p < 0.001, t-statistic -3.29). Our main finding illustrates that in low-intensity ICUs, collaboration between CNSs as head nurses and intensivists may reduce patients' length of ICU stay."
https://openalex.org/W3034776843,"Developmental processes require strict regulation of proliferation, differentiation and patterning for the generation of final organ size. Aberrations in these fundamental events are critically important in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Salt inducible kinases (Siks) are evolutionarily conserved genes involved in diverse biological processes, including salt sensing, metabolism, muscle, cartilage and bone formation, but their role in development remains largely unknown. Recent findings implicate Siks in mitotic control, and in both tumor suppression and progression. Using a tumor model in the Drosophila eye, we show that perturbation of Sik function exacerbates tumor-like tissue overgrowth and metastasis. Furthermore, we show that both Drosophila Sik genes, Sik2 and Sik3, function in eye development processes. We propose that an important target of Siks may be the Notch signaling pathway, as we demonstrate genetic interaction between Siks and Notch pathway members. Finally, we investigate Sik expression in the developing retina and show that Sik2 is expressed in all photoreceptors, basal to cell junctions, while Sik3 appears to be expressed specifically in R3/R4 cells in the developing eye. Combined, our data suggest that Sik genes are important for eye tissue specification and growth, and that their dysregulation may contribute to tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W3035445258,"Dislocation in hindlimb tarsals are being observed at a low, but persistent frequency in group-housed adult male mice from C57BL/6N substrains. Clinical signs included a sudden onset of mild to severe unilateral or bilateral tarsal abduction, swelling, abnormal hindlimb morphology and lameness. Contraction of digits and gait abnormalities were noted in multiple cases. Radiographical and histological examination revealed caudal dislocation of the calcaneus and partial dislocation of the calcaneoquartal (calcaneus-tarsal bone IV) joint. The detection, frequency, and cause of this pathology in five large mouse production and phenotyping centres (MRC Harwell, UK; The Jackson Laboratory, USA; The Centre for Phenogenomics, Canada; German Mouse Clinic, Germany; Baylor College of Medicine, USA) are discussed."
