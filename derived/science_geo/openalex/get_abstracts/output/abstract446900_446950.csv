https://openalex.org/W2080641261,"Cancer control by adaptive immunity involves a number of defined death and clearance mechanisms. However, efficient inhibition of exponential cancer growth by T cells and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) requires additional undefined mechanisms that arrest cancer cell proliferation. Here we show that the combined action of the T-helper-1-cell cytokines IFN-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) directly induces permanent growth arrest in cancers. To safely separate senescence induced by tumour immunity from oncogene-induced senescence, we used a mouse model in which the Simian virus 40 large T antigen (Tag) expressed under the control of the rat insulin promoter creates tumours by attenuating p53- and Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When combined, IFN-γ and TNF drive Tag-expressing cancers into senescence by inducing permanent growth arrest in G1/G0, activation of p16INK4a (also known as CDKN2A), and downstream Rb hypophosphorylation at serine 795. This cytokine-induced senescence strictly requires STAT1 and TNFR1 (also known as TNFRSF1A) signalling in addition to p16INK4a. In vivo, Tag-specific T-helper 1 cells permanently arrest Tag-expressing cancers by inducing IFN-γ- and TNFR1-dependent senescence. Conversely, Tnfr1(-/-)Tag-expressing cancers resist cytokine-induced senescence and grow aggressively, even in TNFR1-expressing hosts. Finally, as IFN-γ and TNF induce senescence in numerous murine and human cancers, this may be a general mechanism for arresting cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2063661977,"For many traits, including susceptibility to common diseases in humans, causal loci uncovered by genetic mapping studies explain only a minority of the heritable contribution to trait variation. Multiple explanations for this ""missing heritability"" have been proposed. Here we use a large cross between two yeast strains to accurately estimate different sources of heritable variation for 46 quantitative traits and to detect underlying loci with high statistical power. We find that the detected loci explain nearly the entire additive contribution to heritable variation for the traits studied. We also show that the contribution to heritability of gene-gene interactions varies among traits, from near zero to 50%. Detected two-locus interactions explain only a minority of this contribution. These results substantially advance our understanding of the missing heritability problem and have important implications for future studies of complex and quantitative traits."
https://openalex.org/W1985538680,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2085532083,"Using nanopores to sequence biopolymers was proposed more than a decade ago. Recent advances in enzyme-based control of DNA translocation and in DNA nucleotide resolution using modified biological pores have satisfied two technical requirements of a functional nanopore DNA sequencing device. Nanopore sequencing of proteins was also envisioned. Although proteins have been shown to move through nanopores, a technique to unfold proteins for processive translocation has yet to be demonstrated. Here we describe controlled unfolding and translocation of proteins through the α-hemolysin (α-HL) pore using the AAA+ unfoldase ClpX. Sequence-dependent features of individual engineered proteins were detected during translocation. These results demonstrate that molecular motors can reproducibly drive proteins through a model nanopore--a feature required for protein sequence analysis using this single-molecule technology."
https://openalex.org/W2089928288,"William Carroll and colleagues report the identification of mutations in NT5C2, encoding cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II, which are specific for relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The mutations confer increased enzymatic activity and resistance to treatment with nucleoside analog therapies in vitro. Relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carries a poor prognosis, despite intensive retreatment, owing to intrinsic drug resistance1,2. The biological pathways that mediate resistance are unknown. Here, we report the transcriptome profiles of matched diagnosis and relapse bone marrow specimens from ten individuals with pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia using RNA sequencing. Transcriptome sequencing identified 20 newly acquired, novel nonsynonymous mutations not present at initial diagnosis, with 2 individuals harboring relapse-specific mutations in the same gene, NT5C2, encoding a 5′-nucleotidase. Full-exon sequencing of NT5C2 was completed in 61 further relapse specimens, identifying additional mutations in 5 cases. Enzymatic analysis of mutant proteins showed that base substitutions conferred increased enzymatic activity and resistance to treatment with nucleoside analog therapies. Clinically, all individuals who harbored NT5C2 mutations relapsed early, within 36 months of initial diagnosis (P = 0.03). These results suggest that mutations in NT5C2 are associated with the outgrowth of drug-resistant clones in ALL."

In contrast, the distant-acting gene regulatory sequences that are critical for orchestrating the spatial and temporal expression of genes in the developing and adult brain remain poorly defined despite evidence from large-scale human genetic studies demonstrating the contribution of regulatory sequences to a wide spectrum of human traits and disorders (Durbin et al., 2010Durbin R.M.

Unlike protein-coding genes, enhancers involved in specific biological processes are difficult to identify because they reside in the vast and poorly characterized noncoding portion of the genome and can be located hundreds of thousands of base pairs away from the promoters of the target genes that they regulate (Lettice et al., 2003Lettice L.A.

Genet. 2008; 40: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Visel et al., 2009aVisel A. Blow M.J. Li Z. Zhang T. Akiyama J.A. Holt A. Plajzer-Frick I. Shoukry M. Wright C. Chen F. et al.ChIP-seq accurately predicts tissue-specific activity of enhancers.Nature. 2009; 457: 854-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar) increased the efficiency of identifying enhancers. Importantly, ChIP-seq experiments that are performed directly on tissues can provide accurate predictions of the broad, general anatomical region in which an enhancer is active (Visel et al., 2009aVisel A. Blow M.J. Li Z. Zhang T. Akiyama J.A. Holt A. Plajzer-Frick I. Shoukry M. Wright C. Chen F. et al.ChIP-seq accurately predicts tissue-specific activity of enhancers.Nature. 2009; 457: 854-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the spatial resolution of these methods is limited, and detailed in vivo studies are required to precisely define the activity patterns of enhancers at high resolution. To address the need for an improved understanding of the cis-regulatory architecture and gene networks active during telencephalic development, we combined sequence conservation- and ChIP-seq-based enhancer prediction with large-scale histological activity analysis of human telencephalon enhancers in transgenic mice. We demonstrate how the high-resolution neuroanatomical annotation of enhancer activities can be used to develop computational sequence classifiers for enhancers active in different subregions of the telencephalon. We also directly compare the genome-wide enhancer architecture active in the mouse and human cortex using ChIP-seq from these tissues, and we provide examples of downstream applications for enhancers identified through this work. To generate a genome-wide set of forebrain enhancer candidate sequences, we collected forebrain tissue from embryonic day 11.5 (e11.5) mouse embryos and performed tissue-ChIP-seq using an antibody for the enhancer-associated protein p300. Results were analyzed alongside previously described data to increase sampling depth (see Extended Experimental Procedures, available online). Genome-wide enrichment analysis led to the identification of 4,425 noncoding regions genome wide that are distal from transcription start sites and significantly enriched in p300 binding in the e11.5 forebrain (Table S1A). Because p300 was previously shown to be associated with active tissue-specific enhancers (Blow et al., 2010Blow M.J. McCulley D.J. Li Z. Zhang T. Akiyama J.A. Holt A. Plajzer-Frick I. Shoukry M. Wright C. Chen F. et al.ChIP-Seq identification of weakly conserved heart enhancers.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar; Visel et al., 2009aVisel A. Blow M.J.

Chen F. et al.ChIP-seq accurately predicts tissue-specific activity of enhancers.Nature. 2009; 457: 854-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), these sequences were predicted to be distant-acting forebrain enhancers. As a complementary approach to identifying candidate enhancers, we also used extreme sequence conservation in conjunction with genomic location. Thus, we scrutinized sequences under extreme evolutionary constraint (Siepel et al., 2005Siepel A. Bejerano G. Pedersen J.S. Hinrichs A.S. Hou M. Rosenbloom K. Clawson H. Spieth J. Hillier L.W.

Ultraconservation identifies a small subset of extremely constrained developmental enhancers.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) in the genomic vicinity of 79 genes with a known role in forebrain development or function (Table S1B), and we identified 231 additional candidate forebrain enhancer sequences (Table S1C). Combined, these two data sets comprised a total of 4,656 noncoding sequence elements that we hypothesized to be enriched in forebrain enhancers. To validate candidate telencephalon enhancer sequences and define their in vivo activities in greater detail, we selected 329 elements predicted to be enhancers by conservation and/or ChIP-seq for experimental testing (Table S1D). Nearly all of these selected elements were located near genes with a known function in the forebrain (Table S1B). In order to focus on the most conserved core regulatory architecture of mammalian telencephalon development, only ChIP-seq peaks that were detectably conserved between the human and mouse genome were tested. Regardless of the identification method, all tested sequences showed evidence of significant evolutionary constraint (phastCons scores ranging from 415 to 931, median 798; Table S1D). The selected candidate enhancer sequences were amplified from human genomic DNA, cloned into an enhancer reporter vector (Hsp68-LacZ), and used to generate transgenic mice by pronuclear injection (see Experimental Procedures). Transgenic embryos were stained for reporter gene (LacZ) activity at e11.5, and reporter expression was annotated using established reproducibility criteria (Pennacchio et al., 2006Pennacchio L.A. Ahituv N. Moses A.M. Prabhakar S. Nobrega M.A. Shoukry M. Minovitsky S. Dubchak I. Holt A. Lewis K.D. et al.In vivo enhancer analysis of human conserved non-coding sequences.Nature. 2006; 444: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Only elements that drove expression in the forebrain in at least three embryos, each of them corresponding to an independent transgenic integration event, were considered as reproducible forebrain enhancers. In total, 105 of the 329 (32%) candidate sequences tested were reproducible forebrain enhancers at e11.5, of which 36 showed reproducible expression exclusively in the forebrain (Table S1D). For comparison, in previous transgenic assays of p300-binding sites in two different nonneuronal tissues, limb buds and the heart, only 4 of the 155 (2.6%) tested sequences had reproducible forebrain enhancer activity at e11.5 (Blow et al., 2010Blow M.J.

Chen F. et al.ChIP-seq accurately predicts tissue-specific activity of enhancers.Nature. 2009; 457: 854-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Enhancer candidate sequences that overlapped p300 ChIP-seq peaks were more enriched in verifiable in vivo forebrain enhancers than extremely conserved sequences that showed no evidence of p300 binding (58% compared to 23%, Table S1D). Selected examples of reproducible forebrain enhancers whose in vivo activity was confirmed in transgenic mice are shown in Figure 1, and whole-mount images for all validated enhancers are accessible online through the Vista Enhancer Browser (Visel et al., 2007Visel A. Minovitsky S. Dubchak I. Pennacchio L.A. VISTA Enhancer Browser—a database of tissue-specific human enhancers.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D88-D92Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). To define the precise spatial expression patterns of telencephalic enhancers active at e11.5, we performed high-resolution analysis on a set of 145 enhancers (Table S1E). These sequences were selected from the 105 forebrain enhancers discovered in the present study and from complementary sets of forebrain enhancers identified at whole-mount resolution in previous enhancer screens (Pennacchio et al., 2006Pennacchio L.A.

For each enhancer, a full set of contiguous coronal paraffin sections (average: 220 sections) was obtained. Full-resolution digital images of more than 32,000 sections are available through the Vista Enhancer Browser (Visel et al., 2007Visel A. Minovitsky S. Dubchak I. Pennacchio L.A.

See also Figure S1 and Tables S1A–S1D. In addition to the spatial activity patterns of all 145 enhancers studied at e11.5, we also examined the temporal activities of a subset of these enhancers at later prenatal stages of telencephalon development (Figures 2S, 3F, and 3G). These temporal comparisons showed that the spatial patterns of enhancer activity were largely constant. In two cases, enhancers active in subregions of the subpallium at e11.5 displayed characteristic features of subpallial cell populations (interneurons) that tangentially migrate to the pallium. At e13.5, these cells had just arrived in the ventrolateral pallium (hs692 and hs799), and by e15.5 they were in the dorsal pallium (hs799, arrowheads in Figures 3F and 3G). These results support the notion that enhancers regulate both spatial and temporal aspects of telencephalic gene expression in patterns consistent with the biology of these regions and cell types. To facilitate analysis by computational methods, we devised a standardized neuroanatomical annotation scheme for the e11.5 stage of telencephalon development (Figures 2A, 3C, and S1 and Table S1E). All telencephalon enhancer activity patterns examined in this study were annotated using this standardized annotation scheme, in some cases complemented by descriptions that further subdivide the standardized domains or are restricted to subsets of cells (Table S1E). The standardized annotations assigned to enhancers enable computational analysis of their activity patterns as well as a comparison to expression patterns of their presumptive target genes at this stage of development. To test whether the telencephalon enhancers examined at high resolution generally recapitulate the spatial expression patterns of their presumptive target genes, we compared their LacZ reporter activities to RNA in situ hybridization data. For example, the Arx gene is expressed in both subpallial and pallial regions, with increasing expression in pallial regions from e11.5 to e13.5 (Figure 4A). We found that there are at least four distant-acting telencephalic enhancers in this extended locus, two of which drive subpallial and two of which drive pallial expression, indicating that developmental Arx regulation is more complex than initially suggested (Colasante et al., 2008Colasante G. Collombat P. Raimondi V. Bonanomi D. Ferrai C. Maira M. Yoshikawa K. Mansouri A. Valtorta F. Rubenstein J.L. Broccoli V. Arx is a direct target of Dlx2 and thereby contributes to the tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10674-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, comparison of other genes with well-established roles in telencephalon development (Lef1, Wnt8b, Gsx2, Nr2f1) to nearby enhancers also revealed examples of spatially concordant enhancer activity and RNA expression (Figures 4B–4E). A recurring feature of these comparisons is the restriction of individual enhancer activities to subregions of the respective gene expression patterns, supporting the modular structure of telencephalic enhancer architecture. For instance, hs687 activity in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) matches Gsx2 RNA expression, whereas the latter is also expressed in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE); hs1172 activity in the pallium matches Nr2f1 RNA expression, whereas the gene is also expressed in the subpallium. To assess whether these illustrative examples are representative of a general congruence between enhancer activity patterns and the expression of nearby genes, we performed a quantitative correlation analysis across the available data set (see Extended Experimental Procedures for details). Overall, we found a highly significant correlation between the activity patterns of enhancers and telencephalic expression patterns of nearby annotated genes (p = 0.0003, Mann-Whitney test, Figure 4F). In addition to the high-resolution comparisons of enhancer and gene activity patterns, we also examined whether the genome-wide set of 4,425 forebrain enhancer candidate sequences identified by ChIP-seq from embryonic mouse forebrain tissue is associated with genes with known functions in the telencephalon.

These observations support on a genomic scale that the large set of forebrain candidate enhancers predicted by ChIP-seq in this study is enriched near genes that are involved in telencephalon development. A large set of telencephalon enhancers, analyzed at high spatial resolution and annotated to a standardized scheme, offers the possibility to examine sequence features that are associated with in vivo activity in different telencephalic subregions. To explore this regulatory code, we trained a random forest (RF) classifier (Breiman, 2001Breiman L. Random Forests.Mach.

Classification is based on the presence or absence of combinations of sequence motifs matching known transcription factor binding sites (Bryne et al., 2008Bryne J.C. Valen E. Tang M.H. Marstrand T.

The five most relevant motifs distinguishing the three classes of enhancers and their respective importance are shown in Figure 5B (for additional motifs, see Figure S2 and Table S1G). We did not observe any single motif that was sufficient to accurately discriminate between the different classes of enhancers, suggesting that only the combinatorial binding of multiple transcription factors determines the observed spatial regulatory activity. The majority of the most discriminatory motifs (at least 60% of the top 15 motifs characterizing enhancers active in each of the telencephalic subregions considered) correspond to predicted binding sites for homeodomain-containing transcription factors, consistent with the known critical role of these proteins in telencephalon development (Hébert and Fishell, 2008Hébert J.M.

Figure S3 summarizes the enrichment of the 15 most relevant motifs for enhancer activity in the three different telencephalic subregions considered. Despite possible ambiguities associated with computational transcription factor binding site predictions, the RF classifier accurately predicts ∼80% of the sequences (see Extended Experimental Procedures and Table S3). Sequence motifs with high quantitative importance for discriminating between different classes of telencephalon enhancers are overall more conserved in evolution compared to nonimportant motifs, supporting their functional relevance (Figure S4).Figure S2Relative Importance of Transcription Factor Binding Sites, Related to Figure 5Show full captionMost relevant binding site occurrence for the prediction of three different classes of forebrain enhancers.

https://openalex.org/W2014333453,"Effectors are essential virulence proteins produced by a broad range of parasites, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, protozoa, insects and nematodes. Upon entry into host cells, pathogen effectors manipulate specific physiological processes or signaling pathways to subvert host immunity. Most effectors, especially those of eukaryotic pathogens, remain functionally uncharacterized. Here, we show that two effectors from the oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae suppress RNA silencing in plants by inhibiting the biogenesis of small RNAs. Ectopic expression of these Phytophthora suppressors of RNA silencing enhances plant susceptibility to both a virus and Phytophthora, showing that some eukaryotic pathogens have evolved virulence proteins that target host RNA silencing processes to promote infection. These findings identify RNA silencing suppression as a common strategy used by pathogens across kingdoms to cause disease and are consistent with RNA silencing having key roles in host defense."

Hereditary deafness is often mediated by the improper development or degeneration of cochlear hair cells. Until now, it was not known whether such congenital failures could be mitigated by therapeutic intervention. Here we show that hearing and vestibular function can be rescued in a mouse model of human hereditary deafness. An antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was used to correct defective pre-mRNA splicing of transcripts from the USH1C gene with the c.216G>A mutation, which causes human Usher syndrome, the leading genetic cause of combined deafness and blindness. Treatment of neonatal mice with a single systemic dose of ASO partially corrects Ush1c c.216G>A splicing, increases protein expression, improves stereocilia organization in the cochlea, and rescues cochlear hair cells, vestibular function and low-frequency hearing in mice. These effects were sustained for several months, providing evidence that congenital deafness can be effectively overcome by treatment early in development to correct gene expression and demonstrating the therapeutic potential of ASOs in the treatment of deafness."
https://openalex.org/W2093215655,"John Chute and his colleagues show that the cytokine EGF protects mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells from radiation injury. EGF signaling in these cells inhibited cell death through repression of the proapoptotic protein PUMA. EGF administration rescued mice from death after total-body irradiation, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for radioprotection. The mechanisms that regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration after myelosuppressive injury are not well understood. We identified epidermal growth factor (EGF) to be highly enriched in the bone marrow serum of mice bearing deletion of Bak and Bax in TIE2-expressing cells in Tie2Cre; Bak1−/−; Baxflox/– mice. These mice showed radioprotection of the HSC pool and 100% survival after a lethal dose of total-body irradiation (TBI). Bone marrow HSCs from wild-type mice expressed functional EGF receptor (EGFR), and systemic administration of EGF promoted the recovery of the HSC pool in vivo and improved the survival of mice after TBI. Conversely, administration of erlotinib, an EGFR antagonist, decreased both HSC regeneration and the survival of mice after TBI. Mice with EGFR deficiency in VAV-expressing hematopoietic cells also had delayed recovery of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells after TBI. Mechanistically, EGF reduced radiation-induced apoptosis of HSCs and mediated this effect through repression of the proapoptotic protein PUMA. Our findings show that EGFR signaling regulates HSC regeneration after myelosuppressive injury."
https://openalex.org/W2046271059,"Collective cell movements contribute to development and metastasis. The small GTPase Rac is a key regulator of actin dynamics and cell migration but the mechanisms that restrict Rac activation and localization in a group of collectively migrating cells are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab11 regulate Rac activity and polarization during collective cell migration. We use photoactivatable forms of Rac to demonstrate that Rab11 acts on the entire group to ensure that Rac activity is properly restricted to the leading cell through regulation of cell-cell communication. In addition, we show that Rab11 binds to the actin cytoskeleton regulator Moesin and regulates its activation in vivo during migration. Accordingly, reducing the level of Moesin activity also affects cell-cell communication, whereas expressing active Moesin rescues loss of Rab11 function. Our model suggests that Rab11 controls the sensing of the relative levels of Rac activity in a group of cells, leading to the organization of individual cells in a coherent multicellular motile structure."

Overactive Cdc42 has been implicated in the pathology of cancers, immune diseases, and neuronal disorders. Therefore, Cdc42 inhibitors would be useful in probing molecular pathways and could have therapeutic potential. Previous inhibitors have lacked selectivity and trended toward toxicity. We report here the characterization of a Cdc42-selective guanine nucleotide binding lead inhibitor that was identified by high throughput screening. A second active analog was identified via structure-activity relationship studies. The compounds demonstrated excellent selectivity with no inhibition toward Rho and Rac in the same GTPase family. Biochemical characterization showed that the compounds act as noncompetitive allosteric inhibitors. When tested in cellular assays, the lead compound inhibited Cdc42-related filopodia formation and cell migration. The lead compound was also used to clarify the involvement of Cdc42 in the Sin Nombre virus internalization and the signaling pathway of integrin VLA-4. Together, these data present the characterization of a novel Cdc42-selective allosteric inhibitor and a related analog, the use of which will facilitate drug development targeting Cdc42-related diseases and molecular pathway studies that involve GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2157746013,"A stimulus predicting reinforcement can trigger emotional and cognitive responses. Here the authors report that neurons in the amygdala integrate spatial and motivational information, potentially for directing attention toward emotionally relevant stimuli. This suggests that the amygdala may be important for coordination of cognitive and emotional responses. A stimulus predicting reinforcement can trigger emotional responses, such as arousal, and cognitive ones, such as increased attention toward the stimulus. Neuroscientists have long appreciated that the amygdala mediates spatially nonspecific emotional responses, but it remains unclear whether the amygdala links motivational and spatial representations. To test whether amygdala neurons encode spatial and motivational information, we presented reward-predictive cues in different spatial configurations to monkeys and assessed how these cues influenced spatial attention. Cue configuration and predicted reward magnitude modulated amygdala neural activity in a coordinated fashion. Moreover, fluctuations in activity were correlated with trial-to-trial variability in spatial attention. Thus, the amygdala integrates spatial and motivational information, which may influence the spatial allocation of cognitive resources. These results suggest that amygdala dysfunction may contribute to deficits in cognitive processes normally coordinated with emotional responses, such as the directing of attention toward the location of emotionally relevant stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W1977148504,"VEGF-A expression in beta cells is critical for pancreatic development, formation of islet-specific vasculature, and Insulin secretion. However, two key questions remain. First, is VEGF-A release from beta cells coupled to VEGF-A production in beta cells? Second, how is the VEGF-A response by beta cells affected by metabolic signals? Here, we show that VEGF-A secretion, but not gene transcription, in either cultured islets or purified pancreatic beta cells, was significantly reduced early on during low glucose conditions. In vivo, a sustained hypoglycemia in mice was induced with Insulin pellets, resulting in a significant reduction in beta cell mass. This loss of beta cell mass could be significantly rescued with continuous delivery of exogenous VEGF-A, which had no effect on beta cell mass in normoglycemic mice. In addition, an increase in apoptotic endothelial cells during hypoglycemia preceded an increase in apoptotic beta cells. Both endothelial and beta cell apoptosis were prevented by exogenous VEGF-A, suggesting a possible causative relationship between reduced VEGF-A and the loss of islet vasculature and beta cells. Furthermore, in none of these experimental groups did beta cell proliferation and islet vessel density change, suggesting a tightly regulated balance between these two cellular compartments. The average islet size decreased in hypoglycemia, which was also prevented by exogenous VEGF-A. Taken together, our data suggest that VEGF-A release in beta cells is independent of VEGF-A synthesis. Beta cell mass can be regulated through modulated release of VEGF-A from beta cells based on physiological need."

To understand the mechanism of PglB, we have quantified sequon binding and glycosylation turnover in vitro using purified enzyme and fluorescently labeled, synthetic peptide substrates. Using fluorescence anisotropy, we determined a dissociation constant of 1.0 μm and a strict requirement for divalent metal ions for consensus (DQNAT) sequon binding. Using in-gel fluorescence detection, we quantified exceedingly low glycosylation rates that remained undetected using in vivo assays. We found that an alanine in the −2 sequon position, converting the bacterial sequon to a eukaryotic one, resulted in strongly lowered sequon binding, with in vitro turnover reduced 50,000-fold. A threonine is preferred over serine in the +2 sequon position, reflected by a 4-fold higher affinity and a 1.2-fold higher glycosylation rate.

Although the presence of an N-X-(S/T) sequon is essential, it is not sufficient to define a substrate for N-linked glycosylation. In fact, only two-thirds of all existing sequons in potential substrate proteins are modified with a glycan (13Petrescu A.J. Milac A.L. Petrescu S.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R.

In bacteria, a single-subunit OST termed PglB, which is homologous to the catalytic Stt3 subunit of eukaryotic OST, catalyzes the transfer of glycans onto acceptor proteins. The X-ray structure of the PglB protein from Campylobacter lari has helped identify the structural basis of sequon recognition (26Lizak C. Gerber S. Numao S. Aebi M. Locher K.P. X-ray structure of a bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.Nature. 2011; 474: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It was shown that the +2 Thr/Ser of the sequon is optimally positioned to allow specific hydrogen bonds to be formed with the WWD motif of PglB, which is strictly conserved in Stt3 homologues (18Wacker M.

The structure suggested van der Waals interactions as a possible explanation for the preference of Thr over Ser at the +2 position of the sequon. It also revealed a possible salt bridge between an arginine side chain on the surface of the enzyme and the negatively charged aspartate in the −2 position of the sequon, which may explain the observation that bacterial glycosylation sequons are extended ((D/E)-Z-N-X-(S/T), with X, Z ≠ P (27Kowarik M.

Nevertheless, glycosylation of non-canonical sites lacking either the interaction in the −2 position or the +2 position have been reported for the PglB enzyme in vivo (28Ielmini M.V. Feldman M.F.

To understand the catalytic mechanism of OST, quantitative in vitro assays and detailed structure-function analyses are essential. We exploited the stability and activity of detergent-solubilized C. lari PglB to determine sequon binding affinities and glycosylation rates. We chemically synthesized fluorescently labeled peptide substrates and purified milligram amounts of PglB enzyme, where we introduced mutations guided by the crystal structure. After developing highly sensitive assays, we quantified sequon binding using fluorescence anisotropy and determined glycosylation turnover rates even for highly disfavored mutant/peptide combinations. We were thus able to gain insight into (i) the influence of active site residues and divalent metal ions for sequon binding, (ii) the specificity of the Ser/Thr binding pocket, and (iii) bacteria-specific requirements of sequon recognition. Our quantitative assessment of peptide binding and catalysis provides insight into the natural selection of the N-X-(S/T) sequon in eukaryotes and the extended sequon in Bacteria. All reagents were purchased from Sigma, Fluka, Acros Organics, or Alfa Aesar. 5-Carboxyfluorescein was purchased either from Novabiochem (Switzerland) or OChem Incorporation (USA). The amino acid building blocks and Benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate were purchased from Advanced ChemTech (USA) or Novabiochem (Switzerland). Fmoc-protected TentaGel S RAM resin was purchased from Rapp Polymere (Germany). Mutations in the pglB gene of C. lari were generated by the QuikChange method on plasmid pSF2 (26Lizak C. Gerber S. Numao S. Aebi M. Locher K.P. X-ray structure of a bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.Nature. 2011; 474: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For the in vivo glycosylation assay pglB variants were subcloned into a pMLBAD plasmid (30Lefebre M.D. Valvano M.A. Construction and evaluation of plasmid vectors optimized for constitutive and regulated gene expression in Burkholderia cepacia complex isolates.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5956-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For in vitro glycosylation studies the two endogenous glycosylation sites were removed (N535Q and N556Q) to prevent autoglycosylation of PglB. The resulting construct was referred to as wild type construct and all subsequent mutations were based on this construct. Mutation of the DQNAT sequon within the 3D5 acceptor protein was performed by ligation of phosphorylated, double-stranded DNA of oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGCGGTGGTGGTGGTTCTGGTGGTGGTGCCCAGAACGCCA-3′ and 5′-CCGGTGGCGTTCTGGGCACCACCACCAGAACCACCACCACCG-3′ into the plasmid pCL21 (31Lizak C. Fan Y.Y. Weber T.C. Aebi M. N-Linked glycosylation of antibody fragments in Escherichia coli.Bioconjug. Chem. 2011; 22: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) digested with restriction enzymes NheI and AgeI. This resulted in plasmid pCL64 carrying an AQNAT acceptor site. All plasmids were validated by DNA sequencing. In vivo complementation analysis of PglB mutants was performed as described before (26Lizak C. Gerber S. Numao S. Aebi M. Locher K.P. X-ray structure of a bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.Nature. 2011; 474: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli SCM6 cells were transformed with three separate plasmids carrying: 1) the C. jejuni pglBmut cluster (containing an inactivated pglB gene) to generate LLO; 2) the glycosylation acceptor protein 3D5 containing a DQNAT or an AQNAT site; 3) C. lari PglB, wild type or mutants. Expression and glycosylation of 3D5 was monitored by SDS-PAGE of periplasmic cell extracts and visualized by mobility shift due to increased size in an immunoblot using anti-c-Myc antibody, or the reactivity of the glycoprotein in an anti-glycan immunoblot using hR6 antiserum. Overexpression and purification of PglB mutants was performed as previously described (26Lizak C. Gerber S. Numao S. Aebi M. Locher K.P. X-ray structure of a bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.Nature. 2011; 474: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Shortly, proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) Gold cells in a 30-liter fermenter or in 5-liter baffled flasks using Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) glycerol. Cells were grown to A600 of 10.0 (fermenter) or 3.0 (flasks) at 37 °C and induced with 0.1% (w/v) arabinose for 2 or 4 h, respectively. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were stored at −80 °C before membrane preparation. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. PglB was solubilized in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% (w/v) N-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (Anatrace) for 1 h. All purification buffers contained N-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. PglB was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow affinity column (Qiagen) and desalted into 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 3% (v/v) glycerol. Desalted protein was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) and, if needed, concentrated up to 26 mg/ml in a 100-kDa molecular mass cutoff Ultra-15 concentrator (Amicon, Millipore). The concentrated sample was re-analyzed by gel filtration and protein concentrations were determined by absorption at 280 nm of diluted samples using spectrophotometry. Peptide synthesis was initiated by loading TentaGel S RAM resin (500 mg, loading: 0.24 mmol g−1) in a 10-ml polypropylene syringe fitted with a polypropylene frit, a Teflon stopcock, and a stopper. The resin was swollen in DCM (6 ml, 20 min). After removal of the DCM, the Fmoc protecting group of the resin was removed by using a solution of 20% piperidine in NMP. Stirring of the reaction mixture at any given step was performed by attaching the closed syringes to a rotating axis. The completion of the reaction was checked using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid test. Removal of the Fmoc protecting group was performed by using a solution of 20% piperidine in NMP (6 ml, 2 × 10 min). After filtration, the resin was washed with NMP (2 × 6 ml), MeOH (2 × 6 ml), and DCM (2 × 6 ml). Coupling of amino acids was performed using Fmoc-protected amino acids (3 eq), Benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (3 eq), and N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (6 eq) in NMP (6 ml). The resin was stirred for 2 h before it was washed with NMP, MeOH, and DCM (2 × 6 ml each). Acetylation of the resin was performed after each amino acids coupling using a solution of acetic anhydride:DCM (1:1). Coupling of 5-carboxyfluorescein was performed by using 5-carboxyfluorescein (2 eq), HOBt (5 eq), and N,N′-Diisopropylcarbodiimide (5 eq) in NMP (6 ml). The resin was stirred overnight and protected from light using aluminum foil. The resin was washed with NMP, MeOH, and DCM (2 × 6 ml each). A solution of 20% piperidine in NMP (6 ml, 6 × 5 min) was added to the resin to remove the excess of free 5-carboxyfluorescein before the resin was finally washed with DCM (6 × 6 ml). After coupling of the fluorophore, the compounds were protected from light with aluminum foil at all times. TFA cleavage was performed by adding a solution of TFA/TIS/H2O (94:5:1, v/v/v) to the resin for 1 h (if the linear peptide contained a Cys, TFA/TIS/H2O/EDT (94/2.5/1.0/2.5, v/v/v/v) was used instead). The peptide was precipitated with tert-butyl methyl ether and dissolved in H2O/MeCN with 0.1% TFA mixture. Labeled acceptor peptides were purified by preparative RP-HPLC and obtained as TFA salts after lyophilization. Peptides were dissolved to 2–5 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide and the concentration of peptides was determined from a dilution in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, by absorbance at 495 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 79,000 m−1 cm−1. A detailed description for the synthesis of individual peptides can be found in the supplemental Methods. 70 μl of desalt buffer supplemented with 1 μm peptide substrate and 10 mm MnCl2 was titrated with concentrated PglB containing equal concentrations of peptide substrate and MnCl2. Anisotropy was measured with a Quantamaster QM-7/2003 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) in a T-format at 4 °C. Each concentration was measured 20 times for 1 s at 494 nm excitation and 521 nm emission wavelengths. Anisotropy was calculated using the equation, r=11⊥−11∥1⊥+21 and plotted against total protein concentration. Data were fitted in Prism (GraphPad Software) using the following equation for the 1:1 stoichiometry, Y=Sf−(Sf−Sb)×(Kd+x+1)−((Kd+x+1)2−4×x×1)2×12 or with Y=(Sf−(Sf−Sb1)×(Kd1+x+1)−((Kd1+x+1)2−4×x×1)(2×1))+(Sf−(Sf−Sb2)×(Kd2+x+1)−((Kd2+x+1)2−4×x×1)(2×1))3 for the mutant R375A, where a 2:1 stoichiometry yielded a higher R2 value. The protein solution from the cuvette was analyzed again by size exclusion chromatography after each anisotropy measurement to prove stability of the protein over the course of the experiment. Isolation of LLOs was performed as described before (32Kowarik M. Numao S. Feldman M.F. Schulz B.L. Callewaert N. Kiermaier E. Catrein I. Aebi M. N-Linked glycosylation of folded proteins by the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.Science. 2006; 314: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, LLOs were extracted from E. coli SCM6 cells carrying the Campylobacter jejuni pglBmut cluster (containing an inactivated pglB gene) by a mixture of chloroform:MeOH:H2O, 10:20:3. Extracts were dried in a rotavap and reconstituted in a buffer containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 (w/v). The concentration of reconstituted LLOs was determined by titrating various amounts of LLO against a constant amount of acceptor peptide in an in vitro glycosylation assay. In a reaction containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 3% glycerol (v/v), and 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 10% LLO extract (v/v, corresponding to 35 μm) and various amounts of PglB (1 nm to 25 μm) were mixed. The mixture was preincubated at 30 °C in a water bath for 5 min before the reaction was started by addition of fluorescently labeled acceptor peptide. Reactions were incubated in a water bath at 30 °C. Samples were taken at different time points and reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. Samples were diluted 200-fold prior to analysis by Tricine SDS-PAGE in minigels (8 × 8 cm) consisting of a 16% resolving gel with 6 m urea, a 10% spacer gel, and a 4% stacking gel (33Schägger H. Tricine-SDS-PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Fluorescent bands for peptide and glycopeptide were visualized by using a Typhoon Trio Plus imager (GE Healthcare) with excitation at 488 nm and a 526-nm SP emission filter. The amount of formed glycopeptide was determined from band intensities of fluorescence gel scans (ImageJ) where the sum of signals for glycosylated and non-glycosylated peptide for each lane was defined as 100%. For Michaelis-Menten kinetics, 1 nm PglB was incubated with various amounts of acceptor peptide (0.25–30 μm) for 10 min. Data were fitted in Prism (GraphPad Software) by nonlinear regression according to the Michaelis-Menten formula. For turnover rate determination, various amounts of PglB enzyme were incubated with 10 μm acceptor peptide. A total of 10 samples were taken in 3-min intervals and data were fitted by linear regression. For M2+ titration experiments, the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid eluate of purified PglB was supplemented with 0.5 mm EDTA, but no EDTA was added to the desalt buffer. 4 nm PglB enzyme was incubated with 10 μm acceptor peptide and various amounts of MnCl2 and MgCl2, respectively. Four samples were taken at the appropriate time intervals (3 to 25 min) so that the reaction was in the linear range. Data were fitted by linear regression to determine turnover rates. These rates were plotted against the M2+ concentration and data were fitted with a model for one metal binding site using the following equation.V=Vinitial +(Vmax−Vinitial )×( [Metal] [ Metal ]+Kd))4 Fig. 1 illustrates a hypothetical reaction mechanism based on previous biochemical studies and on the X-ray structure of C. lari PglB. The physical separation of acceptor peptide binding and catalytic sites suggested that sequon binding could be studied as a discrete, initial step of the reaction. We synthetically attached a fluorophore and a Gly-Ser linker to the N terminus, and a phenylalanine to the C terminus, of a consensus acceptor sequon DQNAT (the underlined N representing the glycosylated asparagine and the zero position of the sequon). The resulting peptide, 5-carboxyfluorescein-GSDQNATF-NH2 (the underlined region representing the sequon, Fig. 2A) was used both for binding and glycosylation studies. C. lari PglB was overexpressed and purified in detergent (n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) as described before (26Lizak C. Gerber S. Numao S. Aebi M. Locher K.P. X-ray structure of a bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.Nature. 2011; 474: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The purity of all PglB variants was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the monodispersity of the concentrated (>15 mg/ml) protein preparations was ascertained using analytical size exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 2Quantitative in vitro determination of sequon binding and catalysis.

Most organisms are “iron-philic” and accumulate high micromolar to nearly millimolar levels of iron to catalyze a variety biochemical processes (10Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V.

Iron accumulation is typically 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than manganese and, based on the Irving-Williams series, is predicted to bind preferentially to cellular ligands over manganese, placing manganese at an apparent disadvantage for co-factor selection in SODs. Nevertheless, Mn-SOD enzymes have evolved methods for avoiding iron and inserting manganese into the active site, a classic example being the mitochondrial manganese Sod2p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite the 50-fold abundance of mitochondrial iron over manganese, Sod2p captures manganese and is virtually impervious to iron inactivation except under rare cases of manganese starvation or with certain yeast mutants of mitochondrial iron overload (1Aguirre J.D.

The need to avoid iron may be obviated with SOD enzymes from the Lyme disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi. Elegant studies by Posey and Gherardini (15Posey J.E. Gherardini F.C. Lack of a role for iron in the Lyme disease pathogen.Science. 2000; 288: 1651-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) have shown that this spirochete fails to accumulate any appreciable iron and does not express any known iron-specific enzymes. The total lack of an iron requirement is advantageous to B. burgdorferi during infection when the host attempts to starve pathogens of iron (15Posey J.E. Gherardini F.C.

B. burgdorferi expresses a single SOD of the Fe/Mn family that is essential for virulence (18Esteve-Gassent M.D. Elliott N.L. Seshu J. sodA is essential for virulence of Borrelia burgdorferi in the murine model of Lyme disease.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 594-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on the apparent lack of cellular iron, B. burgdorferi SodA is proposed to bind manganese (18Esteve-Gassent M.D. Elliott N.L. Seshu J. sodA is essential for virulence of Borrelia burgdorferi in the murine model of Lyme disease.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 594-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), yet direct binding of manganese to B. burgdorferi SodA has not been demonstrated. Two independent studies have investigated the co-factor specificity of B. burgdorferi SodA based on differential H2O2 resistance (Mn-SOD enzymes should be resistant to peroxide), but the findings have been conflicting; one report (19Whitehouse C.A. Williams L.R. Austin F.E. Identification of superoxide dismutase activity in Borrelia burgdorferi.Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4865-4868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) concludes the SOD binds iron, whereas a more recent study by Troxell et al. (20Troxell B. Xu H. Yang X.F.

Chem. 2012; 287: 19284-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) concludes that B. burgdorferi SodA is a Mn-SOD. Furthermore, the implications for a SOD enzyme evolving in an iron-depleted cell have not been examined. Can a SOD enzyme that has only seen manganese still capture its co-factor in an iron-rich cellular environment? Here we investigate the activity and metal requirement for B. burgdorferi SodA expressed in its native host versus a heterologous iron-philic host, namely the bakers' yeast S. cerevisiae. We find that B. burgdorferi can accumulate remarkably high levels of manganese that are needed to support activity of its SodA. Using a metalloproteomic approach, we demonstrate that B. burgdorferi SodA exists as active Mn-SOD enzyme as well as inactive apoprotein but does not bind other metals. When expressed heterologously in the iron-philic host S. cerevisiae, B. burgdorferi SodA is only active when the yeast accumulates vast quantities of manganese that exceed total cellular iron, a condition analogous to the natural B. burgdorferi host. Unlike the homologous Mn-Sod enzymes from yeast and E. coli, B. burgdorferi SodA does not appear to have evolved with the capacity for capturing manganese in an iron-rich environment.

B. burgdorferi was typically grown in BSK medium (pH 7.6) supplemented with 6% (v/v) rabbit serum (Sigma) also containing 0.05 mg/ml rifampicin, 0.1 mg/ml phosphomycin, and 5 μg/ml amphotericin b (18Esteve-Gassent M.D. Elliott N.L.

BSK medium supplemented with synthetic Ex-cyte (Millipore) rather than rabbit serum was prepared precisely as described (15Posey J.E. Gherardini F.C. Lack of a role for iron in the Lyme disease pathogen.Science. 2000; 288: 1651-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). B. burgdorferi cultures were typically inoculated from frozen stocks at a density of 104 and grown at 34 °C (unless indicated otherwise) to a density of 107 to 108 cells/ml. Yeast strains were grown in an enriched YPD (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) at 30 °C, and E. coli was grown in BSK medium without antibiotics and at 37 °C. The pAN002 plasmid for expressing E. coli SodA in the mitochondria of yeast and under the yeast SOD2 promoter and terminator was described previously (14Naranuntarat A. Jensen L.T. Pazicni S. Penner-Hahn J.E. Culotta V.C. The interaction of mitochondrial iron with manganese superoxide dismutase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22633-22640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Plasmid pDA002 is a derivative of pAN002 in which the SodA coding region of E. coli was replaced with B. burgdorferi SodA. A DNA cassette was synthesized (Celtek Genes) consisting of the open reading frame of B. burgdorferi SodA that was codon-optimized for expression in yeast and engineered to contain flanking NdeI and BglII restriction sites at the start and stop codons, respectively. The cassette was inserted into the pGH vector (Celtek Genes), and following digestion with NdeI and BglII, the mobilized cassette was introduced into plasmid pAN002 digested with these same enzymes, replacing the E. coli SodA coding region with B. burgdorferi SodA. In the resultant plasmid, pDA002, B. burgdorferi SodA was fused in-frame to the mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS) of S. cerevisiae Sod2p and under the SOD2 gene promoter. Plasmid pSP002 for expressing B. burgdorferi SodA in the yeast cytosol was constructed by removing the MLS in plasmid pDA002. A NdeI site was introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis at the yeast SOD2 start site for translation. Digestion with NdeI and religation resulted in removal of the MLS. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. For preparation of B. burgdorferi cell lysates, cultures of B. burgdorferi were inoculated at a density of 104 cells/ml and grown to 3–8 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3200 × g at 4 °C and washed twice in PBS and twice in metal-free deionized water prior to resuspension in lysis buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.45% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Cells were lysed in a TissueLyser using 0.7-mm zirconium oxide beads (three cycles at 50 Hz for 3 min interspersed with 3 min on ice). Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To prepare lysates for native and denaturing gel analyses, 45-ml cultures were used and cells were lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer also containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. For large scale lysate preparations as required for multidimensional chromatography (see below), 600-ml cultures were used, and cells were lysed in 2.0 ml of buffer lacking glycerol. E. coli lysates for metal analysis were prepared as described above for B. burgdorferi, using E. coli grown in BSK medium at 37 °C to A600 ∼2.0. S. cerevisiae lysates were prepared from strains grown non-shaking for 20 h in YPD medium to a final A600 of ∼1.0–5.0. Cells were lysed by glass bead homogenization as described (23Gleason J.E. Corrigan D.J. Cox J.E. Reddi A.R. McGinnis L.A. Culotta V.C. Analysis of hypoxia and hypoxia-like states through metabolite profiling.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e24741Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except the lysis buffer also contained 10% (v/v) glycerol. In all cases, protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. For measurements of SOD protein and activity, lysates from S. cerevisiae or B. burgdorferi were partially enriched for SODs by heating at 42 °C for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. This treatment removes ∼30% of total cellular protein with no loss in activity or protein levels of Cu/Zn-SODs or the Mn-SodAs of B. burgdorferi or E. coli. SOD activity was carried by the native gel assay (14Naranuntarat A. Jensen L.T. Pazicni S. Penner-Hahn J.E. Culotta V.C. The interaction of mitochondrial iron with manganese superoxide dismutase.J.

Superoxide dismutase assays.Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Lysates from B. burgdorferi (2.5–25 μg of cellular protein) or from S. cerevisiae (50–75 μg) were subjected to native gel electrophoresis using 12% precast gels (Invitrogen) and staining with nitro blue tetrazolium as described (14Naranuntarat A. Jensen L.T. Pazicni S. Penner-Hahn J.E. Culotta V.C. The interaction of mitochondrial iron with manganese superoxide dismutase.J. Biol.

For in-gel inactivation of SODs by peroxide, gels were soaked in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.1, containing the designated concentrations of H2O2 for 1 h prior to rinsing in H2O and incubating in nitro blue tetrazolium staining solution. To specifically inactivate yeast Cu/Zn-Sod1p, 5 mm H2O2 was used. For immunoblot analyses, 0.5–10.0 μg of B. burgdorferi or 50–75 μg of S. cerevisiae lysate protein was subject to denaturing gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels, followed by transfer to membranes and hybridization to a mouse anti-SodA antibody (18Esteve-Gassent M.D. Elliott N.L.

Where indicated, S. cerevisiae blots were also probed with an anti-yeast Sod2p (14Naranuntarat A. Jensen L.T. Pazicni S. Penner-Hahn J.E. Culotta V.C.

For whole cell manganese analysis of B. burgdorferi by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), ∼109 cells grown and harvested as described above were washed twice in either PBS or TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) (results were identical with either PBS or TE), followed by dual washes in metal-free milliQ water. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 65–70% (v/v) nitric acid (Ultrex, high purity) and heated at 80 °C for 1 h. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 20,000 × g. Samples were diluted 1:14 (WT) or 1:2 (bmtA mutant) in metal-free milliQ H2O prior to analysis by graphite furnace AAS (Analyst 600, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). AAS measurements of manganese in soluble protein lysates used lysates from B. burgdorferi, S. cerevisiae, and E. coli prepared as described above. For iron and manganese analysis by Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), 109 to 1010 B. burgdorferi cells grown and harvested as above were washed twice in TE and once in metal-free milliQ water. As a blank control, the same volume of BSK medium incubated in parallel but with no cells was subjected to the identical centrifugation and washing treatments. The no cell control and B. burgdorferi pellet were heated in nitric acid and clarified by centrifugation as described above for AAS. Samples were diluted 1:30 in metal-free milliQ H2O and analyzed by ICP-MS (Agilent 7500ce; Johns Hopkins NIEHS Center Core Facility). Any elements detected in the blank control were subtracted from the B. burgdorferi sample. Under these conditions, there was no iron that could be detected above background in B. burgdorferi. ICP-MS analyses of whole yeast cells and E. coli were carried out in the same manner using 108 S. cerevisiae cells grown in YPD or 108 E. coli cells grown in BSK. Soluble B. burgdorferi lysates were diluted in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.8) and loaded onto an anion exchange column (1-ml HP HiTrap Q, GE Healthcare) at 0.5 ml/min. Proteins were eluted with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1 m sodium chloride Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.8) solutions. The 0.3 and 0.4 m NaCl elutions were concentrated using 3000 molecular weight cut-off spin columns (VIVASPIN 500, Sartorius Stedim Biotech) and then injected onto a size exclusion column (0.5 ml/min, 10 mm Tris buffer, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, TSKgel G3000SWXL, TOSOH Bioscience) with fractions collected each minute. Aliquots of each eluted fraction were prepared for proteomic and ICP-MS mass spectrometry analyses. Proteomic samples were digested with trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Promega Corp.). For elemental analysis by ICP-MS, each fraction aliquot was diluted 1:4 into 5% (v/v) nitric acid containing 1 ppb Indium as an internal standard. ICP-MS analysis was performed on a Thermo Element 2 with an Aridus spray chamber (CETAC Technologies) with external calibration by plasma standards (SPEX CertiPrep Ltd.) and correction for matrix effects by Indium normalization. LC/MS samples were concentrated onto a peptide cap trap and rinsed with 150 μl of 0.1% formic acid and 5% acetonitrile (v/v) in water, before gradient elution through a reversed phase Magic C18 AQ column (0.1 × 150 mm, 3-μm particle size, 200-Å pore size, Michrom Bioresources Inc.) on an Advance HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources Inc.) at a flow rate of 500 nl/min. The chromatography consisted of a gradient from 5% buffer A to 95% buffer B for 80 min, where A was 0.1% formic acid in water and B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. An LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Inc.) was used with an Advance CaptiveSpray source (Michrom Bioresources Inc.). The LTQ spectrometer was set to perform MS/MS on the top five ions using data-dependent settings, and ions were monitored over a range of 400–2000 m/z. Protein identifications were conducted using SEQUEST (Bioworks version 3.3, Thermo Inc.) using filters of ΔCN >0.1, >30% ions, Xcorr versus charge state of 1.9, 2.4, 2.9 for +1, +2, and +3 charges, respectively, and peptide probability of <1e−3. Protein identifications and relative protein abundances in each fraction (as normalized spectral counts) were also determined using Scaffold using protein and peptide probability settings of 99.9 and 95% and two tryptic peptides, respectively (Proteome Software version 3.5.1). B. burgdorferi can be cultured outside the host in the laboratory using a serum-rich “BSK” growth medium. In these conditions, B. burgdorferi is seen to express a single SodA superoxide dismutase whose activity can be detected by a native gel assay (Fig. 1A) (18Esteve-Gassent M.D. Elliott N.L.

To test whether SodA expression was dependent on serum factors, we replaced the 6% rabbit serum with Ex-cyte, a synthetic substitute (15Posey J.E. Gherardini F.C. Lack of a role for iron in the Lyme disease pathogen.Science. 2000; 288: 1651-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1A, there is no change in SodA protein levels or enzymatic activity in cells cultured with synthetic Ex-cyte supplements, indicating that activity is not dependent on serum protein factors. We also examined effects of variations in growth conditions that have been reported to mimic the environment of the tick host, namely growth at pH 7.6 and 23 °C and at pH 6.7 and 37 °C, to simulate the unfed and post-blood meal conditions, respectively (25Karna S.L. Sanjuan E. Esteve-Gassent M.D. Miller C.L. Maruskova M. Seshu J. CsrA modulates levels of lipoproteins and key regulators of gene expression critical for pathogenic mechanisms of Borrelia burgdorferi.Infect. Immun. 2011; 79: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1B, B. burgdorferi SodA protein levels and activity are maximal under the laboratory conditions thought to best simulate the post-blood meal state. Based on the virtual absence of iron in B. burgdorferi, SodA is most likely a manganese enzyme, and this notion has been supported by recent studies examining peroxide resistance of the SOD (20Troxell B. Xu H. Yang X.F. Borrelia burgdorferi, a pathogen that lacks iron, encodes manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase essential for resistance to streptonigrin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19284-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1C, B. burgdorferi SodA follows the H2O2 resistance of the mitochondrial Mn-Sod2p of bakers' yeast (Fig. 1C, far right panel). However, peroxide resistance is not definitive proof of manganese binding because Fe-SOD enzymes can also be characterized as somewhat peroxide-resistant. As seen in Fig. 1C, both Fe- and Mn-SODs retain activity with millimolar levels of H2O2 that inactivate Cu/Zn-Sod1p. Hence, more direct methods of metal analysis are required. To this end, we carried out a metalloproteomic approach (26Yannone S.M. Hartung S. Menon A.L. Adams M.W. Tainer J.A. Metals in biology. Defining metalloproteomes.Curr. Opin.

https://openalex.org/W2018109768,"The Mus musculus myosin-18A gene is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms, α and β, with reported roles in Golgi localization, in maintenance of cytoskeleton, and as receptors for immunological surfactant proteins. Both myosin-18A isoforms feature a myosin motor domain, a single predicted IQ motif, and a long coiled-coil reminiscent of myosin-2. The myosin-18Aα isoform, additionally, has an N-terminal PDZ domain. Recombinant heavy meromyosin- and subfragment-1 (S1)-like constructs for both myosin-18Aα and -18β species were purified from the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system. These constructs bound both essential and regulatory light chains, indicating an additional noncanonical light chain binding site in the neck. Myosin-18Aα-S1 and -18Aβ-S1 molecules bound actin weakly with Kd values of 4.9 and 54 μm, respectively. The actin binding data could be modeled by assuming an equilibrium between two myosin conformations, a competent and an incompetent form to bind actin. Actin binding was unchanged by presence of nucleotide. Both myosin-18A isoforms bound N-methylanthraniloyl-nucleotides, but the rate of ATP hydrolysis was very slow (<0.002 s(-1)) and not significantly enhanced by actin. Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain had no effect on ATP hydrolysis, and neither did the addition of tropomyosin or of GOLPH3, a myosin-18A binding partner. Electron microscopy of myosin-18A-S1 showed that the lever is strongly angled with respect to the long axis of the motor domain, suggesting a pre-power stroke conformation regardless of the presence of ATP. These data lead us to conclude that myosin-18A does not operate as a traditional molecular motor in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1983568365,"Constitutive heterochromatin (HC) is important for maintaining chromosome stability, but also delays the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSB repair in complex mammalian genomes involves a fast phase (2–6 h) in which most of the breaks are rapidly repaired, and a slow phase (up to 24 h) in which the remaining damages in HC are repaired. We found that p53 deficiency delays the slow-phase DNA repair after ionizing irradiation. p53 deficiency prevents downregulation of histone H3K9 trimethylation at the pericentric HC after DNA damage. Moreover, p53 directly induces expression of the H3K9 demethylase Jumonji domain 2 family demethylase (JMJD2b) through promoter binding. The p53 activation also indirectly downregulates expression of the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1. Depletion of JMJD2b or sustained expression of SUV39H1 delays the repair of HC DNA and reduces clonogenic survival after ionizing irradiation. The results suggest that by regulating JMJD2b and SUV39H1 expression, p53 not only controls transcription but also promotes HC relaxation to accelerate a rate-limiting step in the repair of complex genomes."

Here we further dissected the PLP1 knock-out phenotype, the mechanism of PLP1 pore formation, and the role of each domain by genetic complementation. We found that PLP1 is sufficient for membrane disruption and has a conserved mechanism of pore formation through target membrane binding and oligomerization to form large, multimeric membrane-embedded complexes. The highly conserved, central MACPF domain and the β-sheet-rich C-terminal domain were required for activity. Loss of the unique N-terminal extension reduced lytic activity and led to a delay in rapid egress, but did not significantly decrease virulence, suggesting that small amounts of lytic activity are sufficient for pathogenesis.

The Toxoplasma lytic cycle occurs through multiple rounds of cell entry, replication, and egress. Whereas molecular mechanisms of cell entry are well characterized, those governing cell exit are largely unknown (19Carruthers V. Boothroyd J.C. Pulling together: an integrated model of Toxoplasma cell invasion.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 20Lavine M.D. Arrizabalaga G. Invasion and egress by the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii: potential targets for the development of new antiparasitic drugs.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The discovery that a micronemal protein, PLP1, is required for rapid egress revealed that the parasite produces specific factors for cell exit. PLP1 is a lytic protein with a unique postreplicative function in niche escape rather than a prereplicative function to access a replication site as seen for the pore-forming proteins of the aforementioned pathogens. This and other studies (21Lourido S. Tang K. Sibley L.D.

Biochem. 2008; 47: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) support an emerging hypothesis of egress as an event the parasite actively regulates instead of a strictly passive process occurring upon exceeding a critical capacity. PLP1-deficient parasites failed to egress rapidly from the parasitophorous vacuole after calcium ionophore treatment, which induces microneme secretion and motility (24Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mobilization of intracellular calcium stimulates microneme discharge in Toxoplasma gondii.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 25Endo T. Sethi K.K.

Additionally, whereas wild-type parasites effectively permeabilized the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), PLP1-deficient parasites retained an intact surrounding membrane (7Kafsack B.F. Pena J.D. Coppens I. Ravindran S. Boothroyd J.C. Carruthers V.B. Rapid membrane disruption by a perforin-like protein facilitates parasite exit from host cells.Science. 2009; 323: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These results suggested that PLP1 functions during egress by disrupting the PVM, which allows parasites to cross this physical barrier rapidly. PLP1-knock-out parasites were also noted to have an invasion defect; however, the contribution of PLP1 to invasion remained unknown. Recent work on pore-forming proteins has demonstrated conservation of structure between the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) and membrane attack complex/perforin family (MACPF) proteins (26Rosado C.J.

Friend or foe: the same fold for attack and defense.Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 51-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The pore-forming protein is secreted as a soluble monomer and binds a receptor on the target cell membrane. Following membrane binding, monomers oligomerize into ring-like structures and undergo a structural rearrangement to create a lesion in the target membrane (31Tweten R.K. Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, a family of versatile pore-forming toxins.Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6199-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 32Dunstone M.A. Tweten R.K.

Biol. 2012; 22: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas many pore-forming proteins, such as perforin and LLO, are sufficient for membrane damage, others, such as the membrane attack complex, require assembly of multiple proteins in a specific order (33Müller-Eberhard H.J. Transmembrane channel-formation by five complement proteins.Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1985; 50: 235-246PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to identify whether PLP1 is sufficient for membrane damage or requires other parasite or host factors. Predicted MACPF domains are found in genomes of diverse organisms and are associated with a wide variety of adjacent domains. Only a few MACPF-associated domains, however, have been characterized. PLP1 has a highly conserved central MACPF domain, responsible for oligomerization and membrane permeabilization in other MACPF domain-containing proteins. PLP1 also has unique N- and C-terminal extensions. The C-terminal domain is predicted to be β-sheet-rich, a general feature that is conserved among C-terminal domains of other pore-forming proteins (6Rosado C.J. Kondos S. Bull T.E. Kuiper M.J. Law R.H. Buckle A.M. Voskoboinik I. Bird P.I. Trapani J.A. Whisstock J.C. Dunstone M.A. The MACPF/CDC family of pore-forming toxins.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The position and structural features of the PLP1 C-terminal domain implicate it in membrane binding, but its role has not been addressed previously. The PLP1 N-terminal domain sequence contains no conserved domains and is found only in Toxoplasma and the related Neospora sequences. It may be more distantly related to the N-terminal extensions seen on some of the Plasmodium MACPF proteins (34Kafsack B.F. Carruthers V.B. Apicomplexan perforin-like proteins.Commun. Integr. Biol. 2010; 3: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). N-terminal domains in other MACPF proteins include a low density lipoprotein receptor A domain and thrombospondin type I domains in several complement proteins (35Scibek J.J. Plumb M.E. Sodetz J.M.

Here we investigated the contribution of PLP1 to cell invasion, PLP1 sufficiency for membrane damage, the general mechanism of membrane attack and the role of each domain of PLP1 in membrane damage. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines. The animal protocol was approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals (Animal Welfare Assurance A3114–01, protocol 09482). All efforts were made to minimize pain and suffering. Parasites were maintained in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The parent strain RHΔku80Δhxg (42Huynh M.H. Carruthers V.B. Tagging of endogenous genes in a Toxoplasma gondii strain lacking Ku80.Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) is derived from the commonly used, virulent RH strain (43Sabin A. Toxoplasmic encephalitis in children.JAMA. 1941; 116: 801-807Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The genetically modified strains used in this study are described in other sections of the text. Parasites were inoculated at a high (∼300 μl) or low (∼50 μl) passage in T25 flasks of HFF. Following 2-day growth, parasites in high passage flasks had egressed, whereas parasites in low passage flasks remained intracellular. Egressed parasites were filter-purified in Endo buffer (44.7 mm K2SO4, 106 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Tris-H2SO4 (pH 8.2), 5 mm glucose, 3.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) (44Endo T. Tokuda H. Yagita K. Koyama T. Effects of extracellular potassium on acid release and motility initiation in Toxoplasma gondii.J. Protozool. 1987; 34: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and a red-green invasion assay was performed as previously described (45Huynh M.H. Rabenau K.E. Harper J.M. Beatty W.L. Sibley L.D. Carruthers V.B. Rapid invasion of host cells by Toxoplasma requires secretion of the MIC2-M2AP adhesive protein complex.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2082-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Low passage flasks were washed twice with room temperature Endo buffer, scraped, and syringe-passed prior to filter purification in Endo buffer and subsequent invasion assay. Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (45Huynh M.H. Rabenau K.E. Harper J.M. Beatty W.L. Sibley L.D. Carruthers V.B. Rapid invasion of host cells by Toxoplasma requires secretion of the MIC2-M2AP adhesive protein complex.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2082-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and 15 fields of view (total magnification, ×400) per strain were examined on a Zeiss Axio inverted microscope for attached and invaded parasites. Graphs depict the average ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Parasites were inoculated into HFFs in an 8-well chamber slide and incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 30 h. Wells were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and egress was tested by adding 120 μl/well of vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide or 2 μm A23187 in egress assay buffer (Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES) and incubated for 2 min in a 37 °C water bath. Egress was stopped by addition of 2× fixative (8% formaldehyde in 2× PBS). Immunofluorescence was performed to stain parasites with antibodies to surface antigen 1 and the parasitophorous vacuole membrane with antibodies to dense granule protein 7. At least 10 fields of view (magnification, ×400) per condition were imaged on a Zeiss Axio inverted microscope, and a minimum of 100 vacuoles, with 4 or more parasites per vacuole, was scored as occupied or unoccupied. Graphs depict the average ± S.D. of three independent experiments. PLP1 was genetically ablated in the RHΔku80Δhxg strain using the same approach described previously (7Kafsack B.F. Pena J.D. Coppens I. Ravindran S. Boothroyd J.C. Carruthers V.B. Rapid membrane disruption by a perforin-like protein facilitates parasite exit from host cells.Science. 2009; 323: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The PLP1 complementation vector was constructed by replacing the 5′ and 3′ flanks of the microneme protein 2 (MIC2)-associated protein (M2AP) complementation vector with PLP1 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions amplified from genomic DNA (45Huynh M.H. Rabenau K.E. Harper J.M. Beatty W.L. Sibley L.D. Carruthers V.B. Rapid invasion of host cells by Toxoplasma requires secretion of the MIC2-M2AP adhesive protein complex.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2082-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The PLP1 signal anchor, amplified from cDNA, restriction enzyme cloning sites, and the epitope tag, were generated by fusion PCR and cloned into the vector by restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. PLP1 domain boundaries were based on computational predictions of the conserved MACPF domain, delineating the protein into a central MACPF domain and an N- and C-terminal domain (7Kafsack B.F. Pena J.D. Coppens I. Ravindran S. Boothroyd J.C. Carruthers V.B. Rapid membrane disruption by a perforin-like protein facilitates parasite exit from host cells.Science. 2009; 323: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). PLP1 domain-deleted constructs were PCR amplified from cDNA and cloned into the complementation vector by restriction enzyme digest and ligation. The RHΔku80Δhxg, RHΔku80Δplp1 strains were transfected with 50 μg of the dsRed expression plasmid (46Pepper M. Dzierszinski F. Wilson E. Tait E. Fang Q. Yarovinsky F. Laufer T.M. Roos D. Hunter C.A. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are activated by Toxoplasma gondii to present antigen and produce cytokines.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), linearized within the tub promoter, and cloned by limiting dilution. DsRed strains were maintained with chloramphenicol selection. The PLP1 complementation vector was digested within the 5′ and 3′ flanks and transfected into the RHΔku80Δplp1dsRed strain and maintained under 340 μg/ml 6-thioxanthine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10 mm HEPES/1% dialyzed FBS and cloned by limiting dilution. Clones were confirmed by PCR of genomic DNA and by immunoblotting. PLP1 sequences were PCR amplified from cDNA and cloned into the pET15b expression vector by restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. The expression vector was transformed into BL21 codon + Escherichia coli. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at OD 0.4–0.6 at room temperature for 4–10 h and confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting. Soluble constructs (PLP1 Nterm and Cterm) were purified by nickel affinity column purification. Insoluble constructs (mature recombinant PLP1, recombinant MACPF domain) were isolated by extracting inclusion bodies as described by the manufacturer (Novagen). Briefly, inclusion bodies were denatured with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, allowed to bind to the column for 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight, washed, and eluted with nondenaturing buffers. All recombinant protein samples were buffer-exchanged into 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Recombinant M2AP was generated as described previously (47Rabenau K.E. Sohrabi A. Tripathy A. Reitter C. Ajioka J.W. Tomley F.M. Carruthers V.B. TgM2AP participates in Toxoplasma gondii invasion of host cells and is tightly associated with the adhesive protein TgMIC2.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The recombinant LLO expression vector was a kind gift from Mary O'Riordan (48Glomski I.J. Gedde M.M. Tsang A.W. Swanson J.A. Portnoy D.A. The Listeria monocytogenes hemolysin has an acidic pH optimum to compartmentalize activity and prevent damage to infected host cells.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). LLO was expressed and purified in the same manner as mature recombinant PLP1. Recombinant PLP1 was used to generate antibodies in mice as described previously with 50 μg of recombinant protein per injection (49Laliberté J. Carruthers V.B. Toxoplasma gondii toxolysin 4 is an extensively processed putative metalloproteinase secreted from micronemes.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2011; 177: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in rabbits by a commercial service (Cocalico). Recombinant N- and C-terminal domains were used to affinity-purify domain-specific antibodies from rabbit sera using an amino-link kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Specificity and approximately optimal dilutions were determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Lytic activity on host cells was tested by incubating HFFs in an 8-well chamber slide with 100 nm recombinant protein (M2AP, PLP1, or LLO) in egress assay buffer/12.5 μg/ml propidium iodide/10 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, washed twice with warm PBS, and fixed with formaldehyde. Immunofluorescence was performed for PLP1, and nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Hemolysis was tested by incubating washed sheep red blood cells at 2% final hematocrit in PBS with varying concentrations of recombinant protein. Red blood cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Supernatant was collected and absorbance at 540 nm read in a 96-well plate reader. The assay was performed with triplicate wells, normalized to 1% Triton X-100 lysis. Membrane flotation was performed on host cell debris isolated from fully egressed cultures. Parasites were separated from host cell debris by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was collected and centrifuged again. The second supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 1 h in a Thermo Scientific Sorvall WX Ultra Series centrifuge. The high speed pellet (HSP) was washed once by resuspension in PBS and centrifugation as in the previous step. A sucrose density gradient was applied to the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 750 μl of 85% sucrose and overlaid with 3 ml of 65% sucrose and 1 ml of 10% sucrose. Sucrose solutions were prepared in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Sucrose gradient samples were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C in a Thermo Scientific Sorvall WX Ultra Series centrifuge. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected from the top of the gradient and applied to SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed for PLP1, dense granule protein 4, or microneme protein 5. Membrane flotation of recombinant N- and C-terminal domains was accomplished by preparing red blood cell ghosts as previously described (50Bjerrum P.J. Hemoglobin-depleted human erythrocyte ghosts: characterization of morphology and transport functions.J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 48: 43-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 20 μm (final concentration) recombinant protein was mixed with or without 2 × 107 red blood cell ghosts in 100 μl of PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. A sucrose density gradient was applied by mix"
https://openalex.org/W2047608940,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are important regulators of cellular responses to many extracellular stimuli. Typically, eukaryotic cells have several parallel MAPK pathways, which allow the integration of signals from different stimuli. One of these, the p38 MAPK pathway, has been conserved from yeast to mammals, in which there are four family members: p38a (MAPK14), p38b (MAPK11), p38d (MAPK13), and p38g (MAPK12). Most of what has been published on p38 MAPK signaling refers to p38a, which is ubiquitously expressed at high levels in most cell types. In contrast, p38b seems to be normally expressed at lower levels. The other two family members have more restricted tis-sue expression patterns. Activation of p38a is induced by most stress stimuli, including UV light, oxidative stress, and heat or osmotic shock, but also when cells are exposed to cytokines, chemokines, hormones, or growth factors. Taken together, it appears that p38a signaling helps cells to adequately respond to changing environmental conditions.The extracellular stimuli usually lead to the activation of MAPKs via a cascade of phosphorylation events that involves at least two other kinases acting sequentially. MAP2Ks directly phosphorylate the activation loop of p38a on Thr and Tyr residues, leading to a conformational change that results in kinase activation. The three MAP2Ks that are known to activate p38a are, in turn, activated by phosphorylation on two conserved residues catalyzed by ten MAP3Ks. Upstream in the pathway, there is more diversity, and the acti-vation of different MAP3Ks involves mechanisms like phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or protein-protein interaction, which facilitate integration of a wide range of signals. There is also evidence for the activation of p38a in particular cases by a noncanonical mechanism based on autophosphorylation, independently of MAP2Ks. Once p38a becomes activated, it can phosphorylate many substrates on Ser or Thr residues. This schematic depicts upstream regulators leading to p38a activation and the myriad downstream targets of p38a."
https://openalex.org/W2090235590,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are cell surface receptors that initiate signal cascades in response to ligand stimulation. Abnormal expression and dysregulated intracellular trafficking of RTKs have been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis. Recent evidence shows that these cell surface receptors translocate from cell surface to different cellular compartments, including the Golgi, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nucleus, to regulate physiological and pathological functions. Although some trafficking mechanisms have been resolved, the mechanism of intracellular trafficking from cell surface to the Golgi is not yet completely understood. Here we report a mechanism of Golgi translocation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in which EGF-induced EGFR travels to the Golgi via microtubule-dependent movement by interacting with dynein and fuses with the Golgi through syntaxin 6-mediated membrane fusion. We also demonstrate that the microtubule- and syntaxin 6-mediated Golgi translocation of EGFR is necessary for its consequent nuclear translocation and nuclear functions. Thus, together with previous studies, the microtubule- and syntaxin 6-mediated trafficking pathway from cell surface to the Golgi, ER and the nucleus defines a comprehensive trafficking route for EGFR to travel from cell surface to the Golgi and the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2008442812,"Recent studies have emphasized the role of the dioxin receptor (AhR) in maintaining cell morphology, adhesion, and migration. These novel AhR functions depend on the cell phenotype, and although AhR expression maintains mesenchymal fibroblasts migration, it inhibits keratinocytes motility. These observations prompted us to investigate whether AhR modulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). For this, we have used primary AhR(+/+) and AhR(-/-) keratinocytes and NMuMG cells engineered to knock down AhR levels (sh-AhR) or to express a constitutively active receptor (CA-AhR). Both AhR(-/-) keratinocytes and sh-AhR NMuMG cells had increased migration, reduced levels of epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers Snail, Slug/Snai2, vimentin, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin. Consistently, AhR(+/+) and CA-AhR NMuMG cells had reduced migration and enhanced expression of epithelial markers. AhR activation by the agonist FICZ (6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole) inhibited NMuMG migration, whereas the antagonist α-naphthoflavone induced migration as did AhR knockdown. Exogenous TGFβ exacerbated the promigratory mesenchymal phenotype in both AhR-expressing and AhR-depleted cells, although the effects on the latter were more pronounced. Rescuing AhR expression in sh-AhR cells reduced Snail and Slug/Snai2 levels and cell migration and restored E-cadherin levels. Interference of AhR in human HaCaT cells further supported its role in EMT. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays showed that AhR associates in common protein complexes with E-cadherin and β-catenin, suggesting the implication of AhR in cell-cell adhesion. Thus, basal or TGFβ-induced AhR down-modulation could be relevant in the acquisition of a motile EMT phenotype in both normal and transformed epithelial cells."

We showed that enforced expression of Foxo3a inhibits cardiomyocyte apoptosis, whereas knockdown of endogenous Foxo3a sensitizes cardiomyocytes to undergo apoptosis. The apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is a potent anti-apoptotic protein. Here, we demonstrate that it attenuates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and inhibits calcium elevations in the cytoplasm and mitochondria provoked by oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, Foxo3a is shown to maintain cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis through ARC. We observed that Foxo3a knock-out mice exhibited enlarged myocardial infarction sizes upon ischemia/reperfusion, and ARC transgenic mice demonstrated reduced myocardial infarction and balanced calcium levels in mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, we showed that Foxo3a activates ARC expression by directly binding to its promoter. This study reveals that Foxo3a maintains calcium homeostasis and inhibits cardiac apoptosis through trans-activation of the ARC promoter. These findings provided novel evidence that Foxo3a and ARC constitute an anti-apoptotic pathway that regulates calcium homeostasis in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2053270567,"Disturbance of homeostasis at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes stress to cells that in turn triggers an adaptive signaling pathway termed unfolded protein response for the purpose of restoring normal cellular physiology or initiating signaling events leading to apoptosis. Identification of those genes that are involved in the unfolded protein response-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway would be valuable toward elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the relationship between ER stress and apoptosis. We initiated a genetic screen by using the retroviral insertion mutation system to search for genes whose inactivation confers resistance to apoptosis induction by staurosporine. Using this approach, RING finger protein 13 (RNF13) was identified. Interestingly, RNF13 is highly enriched in ER. RNF13 knockdown cells are resistant to apoptosis and JNK activation triggered by ER stress. Conversely, overexpression of RNF13 induces JNK activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis. The RING and transmembrane domains of RNF13 are both required for its effects on JNK activation and apoptosis. Moreover, systematic analysis of the involvement of individual signaling components in the ER stress pathway using knockdown approach reveals that RNF13 acts upstream of the IRE1α-TRAF2 signaling axis for JNK activation and apoptosis. Finally, RNF13 co-immunoprecipitates with IRE1α, and the intact RING domain is also required for mediating its interaction. Together, our data support a model that RNF13 is a critical mediator for facilitating ER stress-induced apoptosis through the activation of the IRE1α-TRAF2-JNK signaling pathway."

Cdc45 activates the Mcm2-7 helicase. We report here that Cdc45 from budding yeast binds tightly to long (≥ 40 nucleotides) genomic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and that 60mer ssDNA specifically disrupts the interaction between Cdc45 and Mcm2-7. We identified a mutant of Cdc45 that does not bind to ssDNA. When this mutant of cdc45 is expressed in budding yeast cells exposed to hydroxyurea, cell growth is severely inhibited, and excess RPA accumulates at or near an origin.

When the DNA polymerases are induced to stall by hydroxyurea or other agents, roughly 100 base pairs of DNA are unwound by the replication fork helicase ahead of the polymerase, even in the absence of a DNA damage response (27Labib K.

Thus, polymerase stalling is coupled with helicase stalling in eukaryotic cells in a manner that does not depend upon the DNA damage response. However, thus far, little is understood about how DNA polymerase stalling is directly coordinated with DNA helicase inhibition. We report here that Cdc45 binds tightly and directly to yeast genomic ssDNA sequences. We also report that ssDNA specifically disrupts the interaction between Cdc45 and Mcm2-7, suggesting a mechanism to inhibit replication fork helicase activity. The C terminus of Cdc45 is responsible for the ssDNA-binding activity, and we identified a mutant of Cdc45 (Cdc45-M268) that does not bind to ssDNA. The Cdc45-M268 mutant exhibits wild-type binding to Sld3, Mcm2-7, and GINS. When the cdc45-m268 mutant is expressed in budding yeast cells, cell growth is severely inhibited in the presence of hydroxyurea or methyl methanesulfonate. cdc45-m268 cells exposed to hydroxyurea also exhibit increased RPA accumulation near an origin. ChIP data suggest that upon exposure to hydroxyurea, the cdc45-m268 mutant cells have helicase movement uncoupled from polymerase movement. These data suggest that Cdc45-ssDNA interaction is important for stalling the helicase during replication stress. Proteins were purified as described (14Bruck I. Kaplan D.

The degron strain was transformed with the pRS415 plasmid (low copy) containing a wild-type or mutant copy of cdc45 under control of its native promoter. Allelic replacement was performed as described (36Lundblad V. Hartzog G. Moqtaderi Z. Manipulation of Cloned Yeast DNA.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2001; (Chapter 13, Unit 13.10)Google Scholar). The wild-type or mutant CDC45 gene and native promoter were PCR-amplified from linearized pRS415 containing wild-type or mutant CDC45 to include a Leu marker and 5′ and 3′ sequences to allow for homologous recombination into the CDC45 locus. This PCR fragment was then used to transform a haploid -Leu strain (BY4741). Transformants were selected on complete supplement mixture-Leu medium. The GST pull-down reactions were performed as described (37Bruck I. Kanter D.M. Kaplan D.L.

GST pull-down reactions were performed in a volume of 100 μl and contained GST-tagged protein (GST-Cdc45, GST-Sld3, or GST-Mcm2-7) in GST-binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA) and varying amounts of radiolabeled DNA or protein as described in each figure. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following incubation, reactions were added to 40 μl of prepared glutathione-Sepharose and mixed gently. Binding of GST-tagged protein to the beads was performed for 20 min with gentle mixing every few minutes. When the binding was complete, the beads were allowed to settle, the supernatant was removed, and the glutathione beads were washed twice with 0.5 ml GST-binding buffer. After the last wash, 30 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer was added to each reaction, and the samples were boiled for 10 min. Samples (20 μl) were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Notwithstanding the evolutionary time that has passed since the initial endosymbiotic event, mitochondria have retained many hallmarks of their eubacterial origin. Recent studies have indicated that during perturbations of normal homeostasis, such as following acute trauma leading to massive necrosis and release of mitochondria, the immune system might mistake symbiont for enemy and initiate an inappropriate immune response. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading microbial pathogens, and as such is the primary suspect in the recognition of mitochondria-derived danger-associated molecular patterns and initiation of an aberrant response. Conversely, innate immune mechanisms are also central to noninflammatory clearance of innocuous agents. Here we investigated the role of a central humoral component of innate immunity, the lectin pathway of complement, in recognition of mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. We found that the soluble pattern recognition molecules, mannan-binding lectin (MBL), L-ficolin, and M-ficolin, were able to recognize mitochondria. Furthermore, MBL in complex with MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2) was able to activate the lectin pathway and deposit C4 onto mitochondria, suggesting that these molecules are involved either in homeostatic clearance of mitochondria or in induction of untoward inflammatory reactions. We found that following mitochondrial challenge, C3 was consumed in vivo in the absence of overt inflammation, indicating a potential role of complement in noninflammatory clearance of mitochondria. Thus, we report here the first indication of involvement of the lectin pathway in mitochondrial immune handling.

Thus, we report here the first indication of involvement of the lectin pathway in mitochondrial immune handling. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of our cells. They arose more than 1.5 billion years ago by the engulfment of an α-proteobacterium by an archaeon forming an endosymbiotic relationship and giving rise to the ancestor of all eukaryotic cells (1Dyall S.D. Brown M.T. Johnson P.J. Ancient invasions: from endosymbionts to organelles.Science. 2004; 304: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the evolutionary time that has passed since this event, mitochondria have retained many hallmarks of their eubacterial origin, including a circular, albeit heavily reduced, genome, unique tRNA and ribosomal entities, and a double membrane. This has led to the suggestion that during perturbations of normal homeostasis, such as following acute trauma leading to massive necrosis and release of mitochondria, the immune system might mistake symbiont for enemy and initiate an inappropriate immune response (2Zhang Q. Raoof M. Chen Y. Sumi Y. Sursal T. Junger W. Brohi K. Itagaki K. Hauser C.J. Circulating mitochondrial DAMPs cause inflammatory responses to injury.Nature. 2010; 464: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading microbial pathogens, and as such would be the primary suspect in the recognition of mitochondria-derived danger-associated molecular patterns and initiation of an aberrant response. Conversely, innate immune mechanisms are also central to noninflammatory clearance of innocuous agents. A primary component of the innate immune system is complement, a proteolytic cascade system in serum comprising three pathways of activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway (3Ricklin D. Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D. Complement: a key system for immune surveillance and homeostasis.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). The lectin pathway is, in evolutionary terms, the oldest of the three (4Dodds A.W. Which came first, the lectin/classical pathway or the alternative pathway of complement?.Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 340-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is governed by the pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) 2The abbreviations used are: PRMpattern recognition moleculeMBLmannan-binding lectinrMBLrecombinant MBLMASPMBL-associated serine proteaseMApMBL-associated proteinDKOdouble knock-out(s)TOMM22translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 22 homologMPOmyeloperoxidaseRAG2recombination activating gene 2HSAhuman serum albuminCVFcobra venom factorANOVAanalysis of varianceCpG5-cytosine-phosphoguanineFMTflow mannitol. mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and the three ficolins (H-, L-, and M-ficolin), which recognize carbohydrate and acetylated patterns, respectively. MBL and ficolins form large homo-oligomers that circulate in complex with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP-1, -2, and -3) as well as small nonenzymatic MBL-associated proteins (MAp19 and MAp44) (5Degn S.E.

MASP-2 is the protease responsible for cleaving complement components C4 and C2, forming the C3 convertase of the lectin pathway, C4b2a (6Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W.

Complement is an important inducer of inflammatory responses toward microorganisms. Genetically determined deficiency of MBL, the most common primary immunodeficiency, may lead to recurrent infections when other redundant arms of the immune system are suppressed (10Neth O. Hann I.

However, as any other immune mechanism, the lectin pathway of complement is a double-edged sword, and bystander damage or aberrant responses initiated by the lectin pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune responses. Thus, deficiency of MBL or inhibition of MASP-2 prevents ischemia reperfusion injuries (16Schwaeble W.J. Lynch N.J. Clark J.E. Marber M. Samani N.J. Ali Y.M. Dudler T. Parent B. Lhotta K. Wallis R. Farrar C.A. Sacks S. Lee H. Zhang M. Iwaki D. Takahashi M. Fujita T. Tedford C.E. Stover C.M. Targeting of mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 confers protection from myocardial and gastrointestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7523-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and a high level of MBL leads to excess cardiovascular complications and earlier death in type 1 diabetes patients (17Hansen T.K.

Association between mannose-binding lectin and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes.Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1570-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Complement also plays an important role in the resolution of inflammation by promoting the safe clearance of apoptotic cells and immune complexes through the cooperative action of its soluble PRMs, opsonins, and receptors (18Flierman R. Daha M.R. The clearance of apoptotic cells by complement.Immunobiology. 2007; 212: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Trouw L.A. Blom A.M. Gasque P. Role of complement and complement regulators in the removal of apoptotic cells.Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and deficiencies in complement components may promote autoimmune conditions (20Degn S.E. Jensenius J.C. Thiel S. Disease-causing mutations in genes of the complement system.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011; 88: 689-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Human H- and L-ficolin have been reported to bind apoptotic cells and to activate complement (21Kuraya M. Ming Z. Liu X. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Specific binding of L-ficolin and H-ficolin to apoptotic cells leads to complement activation.Immunobiology. 2005; 209: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas mouse ficolin B (orthologue of human M-ficolin) was recently reported to bind both apoptotic and necrotic cells (22Schmid M. Hunold K. Weber-Steffens D. Männel D.N. Ficolin-B marks apoptotic and necrotic cells.Immunobiology. 2012; 217: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), indicating that ficolins may play a role in the removal of damaged host cells and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Importantly, massive activation and depletion of complement has been observed following traumatic injury (23Burk A.M. Martin M. Flierl M.A. Rittirsch D. Helm M. Lampl L. Bruckner U. Stahl G.L. Blom A.M. Perl M. Gebhard F. Huber-Lang M. Early complementopathy after multiple injuries in humans.Shock. 2012; 37: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the lectin pathway might play an important role in immune handling of released mitochondria, either as a homeostatic mechanism promoting mitochondrial clearance or through the initiation of untoward inflammatory responses. To examine our hypothesis, we analyzed the role of the lectin pathway in recognition of mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo studies were conducted in MBL double knock-out (DKO) mice, MBL/RAG2 triple knock-outs, ficolin A knock-out mice, and ficolin B knock-out mice. Although humans have one functional MBL gene (MBL2) and a pseudogene (MBL1), both mouse orthologues (MBL-C and MBL-A, respectively) are functional (24Hansen S. Thiel S. Willis A. Holmskov U. Jensenius J.C. Purification and characterization of two mannan-binding lectins from mouse serum.J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2610-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), necessitating the use of double knock-outs. Conversely, the mouse orthologue of human H-ficolin is a pseudogene, whereas human L- and M-ficolin correspond to mouse ficolin A and ficolin B, respectively (25Endo Y. Liu Y. Kanno K. Takahashi M. Matsushita M. Fujita T.

Purification of mitochondria from liver was carried out essentially as described by Pallotti and Lenaz (26Pallotti F. Lenaz G. Isolation and subfractionation of mitochondria from animal cells and tissue culture lines.Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the purification of mitochondria from rat liver. All steps were performed on ice. Briefly, 1–3 livers were harvested from mice or rats, transferred to mannitol buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and mechanically disrupted. Large pieces were pelleted by gravity for 1 min, and the supernatant was homogenized using 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was recovered and recentrifuged at 17,500 × g for 3 min. The pellet was washed twice with 10 ml of mannitol buffer, centrifuging first 3 min and then 5 min at 17,500 × g. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in fresh mannitol buffer using 10 ml of buffer/7 g of liver. Purified mitochondria were always used fresh, except for immunoblotting, where samples were stored at −80 °C until use. For immunoblotting, samples were prediluted with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to give equal load volumes, and samples were added to 1/4 volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3% (w/v) SDS, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue, pH 6.7) and then loaded onto a Criterion TGX 4–15% gel (Bio-Rad). The gel was run in Tris/glycine buffer before being semidry blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS and then incubated with rabbit anti-Hsp60 (kindly provided by Svend Birkelund) diluted 1/1,000 in primary buffer (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS/T), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg of human serum albumin (HSA; CSL Behring)/ml, and 100 μg of normal human IgG (Beriglobin, CSL Behring)/ml). The membrane was washed, incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (P0448, DAKO) in secondary buffer (TBS/T, no azide, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg of human IgG/ml), and washed again before being developed with SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce). Blots were also developed directly with HRP-conjugated anti-β-actin (A3854, Sigma) in secondary buffer. Images were taken using a charge-coupled device camera (LAS-3000; Fuji) and analyzed with the Image Analysis Software supplied with the camera. Flow cytometry analyses of mitochondrial preparations were performed on a FACSAria III (four-laser) at the FACS core facility at the Faculty of Health Sciences, Aarhus University. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (M7512) (kindly provided by Thomas Corydon) or MitoTracker Deep Red FM (M22426) (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes), as well as mouse monoclonal anti-TOMM22 antibody (1C9 2, ab57523, Abcam). Mitochondrial preparations were resuspended and diluted in TBS as indicated, then added to the wells of FluoroNunc microtiter plates (Nunc), 100 μl/well, and incubated 2 h at 4 °C.

The wells were washed as before, and Eu3+-labeled streptavidin in TBS, 0.1% HSA, 25 μm EDTA was added to the wells. After incubating for 1 h at room temperature, the wells were again washed as before and developed by the addition of enhancement buffer (0.57% v/v acetic acid, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100, 1% w/v polyethylene glycol 6000, 15 μm 2-naphthoyltrifluoroacetone, 50 μm tri-(n-octyl)phosphine oxide, pH 3.2, with potassium hydrogen phthalate) followed by measurement of time-resolved fluorescence on a Victor3 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Purified mitochondria were diluted 1/8 in either TBS, 0.1% HSA, 5 mm CaCl2 or TBS, 0.1% HSA, 10 mm EDTA, and recombinant MBL (rMBL (27Jensenius J.C. Jensen P.H. McGuire K. Larsen J.L. Thiel S.

The samples were incubated 2 h at 4 °C end-over-end. Mitochondria were pelleted at 17,500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C, and the supernatant was retrieved. MBL remaining in the supernatant was measured by incubation of 5-fold diluted supernatant in anti-MBL antibody (131-1, 5 μg/ml)-coated microtiter wells followed by 3× wash and development with Eu3+-labeled anti-MBL antibody (131-1, 0.5 μg/ml). Mitochondria, coated onto microtiter wells as before, were treated enzymatically with 10-fold dilution series of various enzymes for 1 or 3 h, as follows: sialidase (Sigma) starting from 1.8 units/ml PBS, pH 6.0; N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) starting from 10 units/ml PBS, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA; trypsin (Gibco) starting from 0.25% (w/v) in PBS, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA; proteinase K (Qiagen) starting from 60 milli-arbitrary units/ml TBS, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2. MBL binding assays were conducted as above, using 0.2 and 1.0 μg rMBL/ml. To analyze the ability of MBL to bind mitochondria in the presence of serum, 10-fold dilution series of rMBL were prepared in 10-fold dilution series of serum, in either TBS, 0.1% HSA, 5 mm CaCl2 or TBS, 0.1% HSA, 10 mm EDTA. The preparations were incubated in wells coated with mitochondria, and MBL binding was analyzed as before. Microtiter wells were coated with mannan, 10 μg/ml coating buffer, or purified mitochondria diluted 1/100 or 1/1,000 in TBS, 2 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed thrice with TBS, 0.1% (w/v) HSA, incubating 30 min with the final wash to block residual binding sites. A 5-fold dilution series of rMBL starting from 1,000 ng/ml TBS, 0.1% HSA, 5 mm CaCl2 or TBS, 0.1% HSA, 5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm mannose, was added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed thrice with TBS, 0.1% HSA, and then we added either in-house biotinylated anti-MBL (131-1) at 1 μg/ml TBS, 0.1% HSA, 5 mm CaCl2 or rMASP-2 at 200 or 50 ng/ml TBS, 0.1% HSA, 5 mm CaCl2. After a 1.5-h incubation at 4 °C, wells were washed as before. Wells were directly developed for MBL by the addition of Eu3+-streptavidin in TBS, 0.1% HSA, 25 μm EDTA, incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, a final wash 3×, and the addition of enhancement buffer. In parallel, the wells that received MASP-2 were assayed for C4 deposition as activated MASP-2 will cleave C4 and the resulting C4b fragments bind covalently to the proteins coated on the surface of the wells. This was tested by the addition of purified C4, 2 μg/ml B1 buffer (4 mm barbital, 145 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and incubation for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After washing thrice as before, in-house biotinylated monoclonal anti-C4b antibody (162-02, BioPorto) was added to wells, at 0.5 μg/ml TBS, 0.1% HSA, 5 mm CaCl2. The wells were incubated 1.5 h at 4 °C, washed thrice as before, and then Eu3+-streptavidin was added, and the wells were developed as before. Microtiter wells were coated with mannan or mitochondria, blocked, and washed as before. The wells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a 2-fold dilution series of a human serum pool, starting from 1/5 in TBS, 0.1% HSA, containing either 5 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA. The wells were washed three times with TBS, 0.1% HSA, 5 mm CaCl2 and then incubated with in-house biotinylated anti-human C3c, 0.5 μg/ml TBS, 0.1% HSA, 5 mm CaCl2, and developed with europium-labeled streptavidin as before. Samples for flow analysis were prepared in flow mannitol (FMT) buffer (mannitol buffer containing 0.5% HSA and 5 mm CaCl2). Mitochondrial preparations were diluted 10-fold in FMT buffer, then we added MBL, H-, L-, or M-ficolin to 10 μg/ml final concentration in 100 μl of buffer and incubated 30 min at 4 °C. The mitochondria were washed twice by resuspending in 2 ml of FMT buffer and centrifuging 3,000 × g for 5 min before being resuspended in 100 μl of FMT buffer, and then primary antibody was added at 10 μg/ml final concentration. After incubating 30 min at 4 °C, the mitochondria were washed as before, and phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary anti-mouse immunoglobulins (DAKO R0439) were added. After a final incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, samples were washed as before, resuspended in 500 μl of FMT buffer, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. An initial titration of purified mitochondria was performed. Twelve C57BL/6JBomTac mice (Taconic, Denmark) older than 9 weeks of age were divided into groups of three and injected intravenously in the tail vein with purified mouse mitochondria corresponding to 0.05, 0.25, 1.25, or 6.25% of the total mitochondrial content in one mouse liver. No effect was seen following observation for 24 h. For the subsequent experiments, injection volumes were chosen to correspond to ∼7.5 or 15% of total liver mitochondrial content. Mice were weighed before and after injections, e.g. 2 days before, at time of injection, and at termination of the experiment, 2, 3, or 24 h after. Similarly, serum was taken at various time points before and after injection. As a control for inflammation, LPS was injected intraperitoneally at 120 μg/mouse. The mouse strains used were Mbl1−/−, Mbl2−/− DKO (B6.129S4-Mbl1tm1Kata Mbl2tm1Kata), MBL DKO crossed with RAG2−/− (B6.129S6-RAG2tm1Fwa) in our animal facility to yield triple knock-outs, Fcna knock-outs (B6.129-Fcnatm1Tefu), and Fcnb knock-outs (B6.129-Fcnbtm1Tefu). 10-fold serial titrations of a preparation of CVF (kindly provided by Edzard Spillner (32Kölln J. Braren I. Bredehorst R. Spillner E. Purification of native and recombinant cobra venom factor using thiophilic adsorption chromatography.Protein Pept. Lett. 2007; 14: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar)) were injected into WT mice. The mice were monitored for toxicity reactions, and 2 h following injections, blood was drawn and assayed for remaining C3 deposition capacity. Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with zymosan (Sigma), 20 μg/ml coating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6) and then blocked with TBS containing 1 mg/ml HSA. After being washed with TBS/T 20 thrice, the wells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with serum samples diluted in B1 buffer. Wells were washed thrice with TBS/T/Ca2+, then incubated with rat-anti-mouse C3 (Connex, D-82152) 0.5 μg/ml TBS/T/Ca2+. The wells were washed as before and incubated with biotinylated anti-rat immunoglobulin (Dako, E0468) 0.5 μg/ml TBS/T/Ca2+ and then developed as described above. A dilution (1/10,000) of the CVF preparation was chosen, which provided a marked but incomplete reduction in remaining C3 deposition capacity in the absence of overt toxicity. Mice were pretreated with this dose of CVF or vehicle alone 24 and 2 h prior to challenge with mitochondria or sham. Two hours following challenge, blood was drawn for IL-6 (below) and C3 deposition analysis (as above). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was measured in lung tissue from mice injected with mitochondria using a commercial MPO assay kit (Hbt mouse MPO ELISA test kit, Hycult Biotechnology), according to the manufacturer's instructions. IL-6 was measured in serum using the mouse IL-6 DuoSet ELISA kit (DY406, R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mice were sacrificed, and the lungs were fixed in a 10% formaldehyde solution. Standard histological preparation of the lung tissue was performed, including paraffin embedding and subsequent H&E staining of 6–8-μm-thick paraffin sections. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5, as indicated. Mitochondria were purified from mouse or rat livers according to a well established method based on homogenization, mechanical cell lysis, and differential centrifugation (26Pallotti F. Lenaz G. Isolation and subfractionation of mitochondria from animal cells and tissue culture lines.Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the mitochondrial preparations, they were analyzed by immunoblotting and by flow cytometry. The Western blots of the mitochondria were developed either with rabbit anti-human Hsp60, cross-reactive with mouse Hspd1 (97% amino ac"
https://openalex.org/W1976691320,"Pancreatic cancer remains as one of the most deadly cancers with few treatment options at late stages and little information about how it develops through earlier stages. Activating mutation of the Kras gene has been implicated in, but is not sufficient for, tumorigenesis. In mouse models of pancreatic cancer, loss of tumor suppressor genes in conjunction with Kras mutation leads to gradual stochastic acquisition of neoplastic precursors and carcinomas, whereas many cells remain phenotypically unaltered in younger mice. Here, we demonstrate that two oncogenic events, mutation of Kras and production of the growth factor heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), are sufficient for rapid and complete neoplastic transformation of the exocrine pancreas. We found that macrophages are the major source of HB-EGF production in pancreatic cancer tissue samples, and that macrophages are present in high density and in close association with human pancreatic cancer lesions. In a mouse model, high macrophage density was observed at the earliest stages of neoplastic transformation. The consequence of elevated HB-EGF signaling was investigated without the confounding effects of other macrophage-produced factors via transgenic overexpression of the active form of HB-EGF. In this model, HB-EGF was sufficient to promote Kras-initiated tumorigenesis, inducing rapid and complete neoplastic transformation of the entire exocrine pancreas shortly after birth. HB-EGF overexpression and Kras(G12D) together, but neither alone, increased proliferation with increased cyclinD1 and decreased Cdkn2a/2d (p16/p19(Ink4A/Arf)). These findings establish the importance of oncogenic synergy in cancer initiation and promotion, and establish a molecular link between inflammation and the earliest stages of tumor induction."
https://openalex.org/W2144570730,"Previously, we observed significant increases in spinal 12-lipoxygenase (LOX) metabolites, in particular, hepoxilins, which contribute to peripheral inflammation-induced tactile allodynia. However, the enzymatic sources of hepoxilin synthase (HXS) activity in rats remain elusive. Therefore, we overexpressed each of the 6 rat 12/15-LOX enzymes in HEK-293T cells and measured by LC-MS/MS the formation of HXB3, 12-HETE, 8-HETE, and 15-HETE from arachidonic acid (AA) at baseline and in the presence of LOX inhibitors (NDGA, AA-861, CDC, baicalein, and PD146176) vs. vehicle-treated and mock-transfected controls. We detected the following primary intrinsic activities: 12-LOX (Alox12, Alox15), 15-LOX (Alox15b), and HXS (Alox12, Alox15). Similar to human and mouse orthologs, proteins encoded by rat Alox12b and Alox12e possessed minimal 12-LOX activity with AA as substrate, while eLOX3 (encoded by Aloxe3) exhibited HXS without 12-LOX activity when coexpressed with Alox12b or supplemented with 12-HpETE. CDC potently inhibited HXS and 12-LOX activity in vitro (relative IC50s: CDC, ~0.5 and 0.8 μM, respectively) and carrageenan-evoked tactile allodynia in vivo. Notably, peripheral inflammation significantly increased spinal eLOX3; intrathecal pretreatment with either siRNA targeting Aloxe3 or an eLOX3-selective antibody attenuated the associated allodynia. These findings implicate spinal eLOX3-mediated hepoxilin synthesis in inflammatory hyperesthesia and underscore the importance of developing more selective 12-LOX/HXS inhibitors.—Gregus, A.

https://openalex.org/W1994411109,"E-cadherin is a cell–cell adhesion molecule that acts as a suppressor of cancer cell invasion and its expression is downregulated in many advanced, poorly differentiated, human cancers. In this study, we found that the expression of DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1) tumor-suppressor gene in metastatic prostate carcinoma (PCA) cells increased the expression of E-cadherin and resulted in an elevated rate of cell–cell aggregation as measured by aggregation assay. DLC1-mediated increase in E-cadherin expression was not dependent on α-catenin, a DLC1-binding protein associated with E-cadherin, and/or cellular density. The increase of E-cadherin expression occurred at mRNA level and relied on DLC1 RhoGAP function, leading to suppression of high level of RhoA-GTP and RhoC-GTP activity in metastatic PCA cells. Application of Rho/ROCK inhibitors produced the same effect as introduction of DLC1. Knocking down of RhoA produced a moderate increase in E-cadherin whereas knocking down of RhoC resulted in a significant increase of E-cadherin. Downregulation of E-cadherin caused by constitutively active RhoAV14 and RhoCV14 could not be reversed by expression of DLC1 in DLC1-negative cell line. DLC1-mediated suppression of metastatic PCA cells invasion was comparable with the one associated with ectopic E-cadherin expression, or caused by suppression of Rho pathway either by Rho/ROCK inhibitors, or by shRNA repression. This study demonstrates that DLC1 expression positively regulates E-cadherin and suppresses highly metastatic PCA cell invasion by modulating Rho pathway, which appears as a feasible therapeutic target in cancers with high activity of RhoGTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2026437259,"Integrin-based adhesions promote cell survival as well as cell motility and invasion. We show here that the adhesion regulatory protein supervillin increases cell survival by decreasing levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and downstream target genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of a new splice form of supervillin (isoform 4) or both isoforms 1 and 4 increases the amount of p53 and cell death, whereas p53 levels decrease after overexpression of either supervillin isoform. Cellular responses to DNA damage induced by etoposide or doxorubicin include down-regulation of endogenous supervillin coincident with increases in p53. In DNA-damaged supervillin knockdown cells, p53 knockdown or inhibition partially rescues the loss of cell metabolic activity, a measure of cell proliferation. Knockdown of the p53 deubiquitinating enzyme USP7/HAUSP also reverses the supervillin phenotype, blocking the increase in p53 levels seen after supervillin knockdown and accentuating the decrease in p53 levels triggered by supervillin overexpression. Conversely, supervillin overexpression decreases the association of USP7 and p53 and attenuates USP7-mediated p53 deubiquitination. USP7 binds directly to the supervillin N terminus and can deubiquitinate and stabilize supervillin. Supervillin also is stabilized by derivatization with the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO1. These results show that supervillin regulates cell survival through control of p53 levels and suggest that supervillin and its interaction partners at sites of cell-substrate adhesion constitute a locus for cross-talk between survival signaling and cell motility pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2019364060,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation depends on a linear binding motif found in all MAPK kinases (MKK). In addition, the PB1 (Phox and Bem1) domain of MKK5 is required for extracellular signal regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) activation. We present the crystal structure of ERK5 in complex with an MKK5 construct comprised of the PB1 domain and the linear binding motif. We show that ERK5 has distinct protein-protein interaction surfaces compared with ERK2, which is the closest ERK5 paralog. The two MAPKs have characteristically different physiological functions and their distinct protein-protein interaction surface topography enables them to bind different sets of activators and substrates. Structural and biochemical characterization revealed that the MKK5 PB1 domain cooperates with the MAPK binding linear motif to achieve substrate specific binding, and it also enables co-recruitment of the upstream activating enzyme and the downstream substrate into one signaling competent complex. Studies on present day MAPKs and MKKs hint on the way protein kinase networks may evolve. In particular, they suggest how paralogous enzymes with similar catalytic properties could acquire novel signaling roles by merely changing the way they make physical links to other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2037094536,"Activation of Na+,HCO3− cotransport in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributes to intracellular pH (pHi) control during artery contraction, but the signaling pathways involved have been unknown. We investigated whether physical and functional interactions between the Na+,HCO3− cotransporter NBCn1 (slc4a7) and the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin exist and play a role for pHi control in VSMCs. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that splice cassette II from the N terminus of NBCn1 interacts with calcineurin Aβ. When cassette II was truncated or mutated to disrupt the putative calcineurin binding motif PTVVIH, the interaction was abolished. Native NBCn1 and calcineurin Aβ co-immunoprecipitated from A7r5 rat VSMCs. A peptide (acetyl-DDIPTVVIH-amide), which mimics the putative calcineurin binding motif, inhibited the co-immunoprecipitation whereas a mutated peptide (acetyl-DDIATAVAA-amide) did not. Na+,HCO3− cotransport activity was investigated in VSMCs of mesenteric arteries after an NH4+ prepulse. During depolarization with 50 mm extracellular K+ to raise intracellular [Ca2+], Na+,HCO3− cotransport activity was inhibited 20–30% by calcineurin inhibitors (FK506 and cyclosporine A). FK506 did not affect Na+,HCO3− cotransport activity in VSMCs when cytosolic [Ca2+] was lowered by buffering, nor did it disrupt binding between NBCn1 and calcineurin Aβ. FK506 augmented the intracellular acidification of VSMCs during norepinephrine-induced artery contractions. No physical or functional interactions between calcineurin Aβ and the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 were observed in VSMCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate a physical interaction between calcineurin Aβ and cassette II of NBCn1.

https://openalex.org/W2053928010,"Hypothyroidism has been associated with significantly elevated risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although the precise underlying mechanisms remain unknown at present. Thyroid hormone (T3) and its receptor (TR) are involved in metabolism and growth. Endoglin is a T3/TR candidate target gene identified from our previous studies. Here, we demonstrated that T3 positively regulates endoglin mRNA and protein levels, both in vitro and in vivo. The thyroid hormone response elements of endoglin were identified at positions −2114/−2004 and −2032/−1973 of the promoter region using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Endoglin was downregulated in the subgroups of HCC patients and significantly associated with histology grade (negative association, P=0.001), and this expression level was significantly associated with TRα1 in these HCC patients. Our results clearly indicate that p21 is involved in T3-mediated suppression of cell proliferation. Knock down of endoglin expression in HCC cells facilitated p21 polyubiquitination and promoted cell proliferation in the presence of T3. The data collectively suggest that T3/TR signaling suppresses cell proliferation by upregulating endoglin, in turn, affecting p21 stability. The results indicate that endoglin has a suppressor role to inhibit cell proliferation in HCC cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2139238186,"The arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) can suppress induction of type I interferon (IFN). This anti-IFN activity is thought to be shared by all arenaviruses with the exception of Tacaribe virus (TCRV). To identify the TCRV NP amino acid residues that prevent its IFN-countering ability, we created a series of NP chimeras between residues of TCRV NP and Pichinde virus (PICV) NP, an arenavirus NP with potent anti-IFN function. Chimera NP analysis revealed that a minimal four amino acid stretch derived from PICV NP could impart efficient anti-IFN activity to TCRV NP. Strikingly, the TCRV NP gene cloned and sequenced from viral stocks obtained through National Institutes of Health Biodefense and Emerging Infections (BEI) resources deviated from the reference sequence at this particular four-amino acid region, GPPT (GenBank KC329849) versus DLQL (GenBank NC004293), respectively at residues 389-392. When efficiently expressed in cells through codon-optimization, TCRV NP containing the GPPT residues rescued the antagonistic IFN function. Consistent with cell expression results, TCRV infection did not stimulate an IFNβ response early in infection in multiple cells types (e.g. A549, P388D1), and IRF-3 was not translocated to the nucleus in TCRV-infected A549 cells. Collectively, these data suggest that certain TCRV strain variants contain the important NP amino acids necessary for anti-IFN activity."
https://openalex.org/W2007395260,"Reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization and can lead to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides. Among the various oxidized bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine seems to be the most critical during the transfer of genetic information because it can pair with both cytosine and adenine. During the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, GMP is formed first, and it is converted to GDP by guanylate kinase. This enzyme hardly acts on an oxidized form of GMP (8-oxo-GMP) formed by the oxidation of GMP or by the cleavage of 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP by MutT protein. Although the formation of 8-oxo-GDP from 8-oxo-GMP is thus prevented, 8-oxo-GDP itself may be produced by the oxidation of GDP by reactive oxygen species. The 8-oxo-GDP thus formed can be converted to 8-oxo-GTP because nucleoside-diphosphate kinase and adenylate kinase, both of which catalyze the conversion of GDP to GTP, do not discriminate 8-oxo-GDP from normal GDP. The 8-oxo-GTP produced in this way and by the oxidation of GTP can be used for RNA synthesis. This misincorporation is prevented by MutT protein, which has the potential to cleave 8-oxo-GTP as well as 8-oxo-GDP to 8-oxo-GMP. When (14)C-labeled 8-oxo-GTP was applied to CaCl2-permeabilized cells of a mutT(-) mutant strain, it could be incorporated into RNA at 4% of the rate for GTP. Escherichia coli cells appear to possess mechanisms to prevent misincorporation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine into RNA."

The glycoside hydrolase (GH) module of agarase is known to be responsible for its catalytic activity. However, variations in the composition of the GH module and its effects on enzymatic functions have been minimally elucidated. The agaG4 gene, cloned from the genome of the agarolytic Flammeovirga strain MY04, encodes a 503-amino acid protein, AgaG4. Compared with elucidated agarases, AgaG4 contains an extra peptide (Asn246–Gly302) within its GH module. Heterologously expressed AgaG4 (recombinant AgaG4; rAgaG4) was determined to be an endo-type β-agarase. The protein degraded agarose into neoagarotetraose and neoagarohexaose at a final molar ratio of 1.5:1. Neoagarooctaose was the smallest substrate for rAgaG4, whereas neoagarotetraose was the minimal degradation product. Removing the extra fragment from the GH module led to the inability of the mutant (rAgaG4-T57) to degrade neoagarooctaose, and the final degradation products of agarose by the truncated protein were neoagarotetraose, neoagarohexaose, and neoagarooctaose at a final molar ratio of 2.7:2.8:1. The optimal temperature for agarose degradation also decreased to 40 °C for this mutant. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that tyrosine 276 within the extra fragment was a candidate active site residue for the enzymatic activity. Site-swapping experiments of Tyr276 to 19 various other amino acids demonstrated that the characteristics of this residue were crucial for the AgaG4 degradation of agarose and the cleavage pattern of substrate.

The biological functions of the latter proteins are diverse and include the regulation of the biophysical properties of the ion channel, its connection to signaling pathways and the control of its cell surface expression. There is recent evidence that native hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel complexes (HCN1–4) also contain accessory subunits, among which TRIP8b (tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein) has been most extensively studied. Here, we identify KCTD3, a so far uncharacterized member of the potassium channel tetramerization-domain containing (KCTD) protein family as an HCN3-interacting protein. KCTD3 is widely expressed in brain and some non-neuronal tissues and colocalizes with HCN3 in specific regions of the brain including hypothalamus. Within the HCN channel family, KCTD3 specifically binds to HCN3 and leads to a profound up-regulation of cell surface expression and current density of this channel. HCN3 can also functionally interact with TRIP8b; however, we found no evidence for channel complexes containing both TRIP8b and KCTD3. The C terminus of HCN3 is crucially required for functional interaction with KCTD3. Replacement of the cytosolic C terminus of HCN2 by the corresponding domain of HCN3 renders HCN2 sensitive to regulation by KCTD3. The C-terminal-half of KCTD3 is sufficient for binding to HCN3. However, the complete protein including the N-terminal tetramerization domain is needed for HCN3 current up-regulation.

However, the exact physiological role of most of these proteins is less well understood than that of TRIP8b. So far, accessory proteins have been only studied for HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4.

Recent analysis of HCN3 knock-out mice has revealed that the channel is involved in shaping the ventricular action potential waveform (33Fenske S. Mader R. Scharr A. Paparizos C. Cao-Ehlker X. Michalakis S. Shaltiel L. Weidinger M. Stieber J. Feil S. Feil R. Hofmann F. Wahl-Schott C. Biel M. HCN3 Contributes to the Ventricular Action Potential Waveform in the Murine Heart.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The role of HCN3 in neurons is still unknown. In general, analysis of HCN3 current has been hampered by the rather low current density obtained upon expression of this protein in heterologous systems. A possible explanation for the low expression could be the lack of accessory or regulatory subunits that are needed for proper HCN3 expression and function. To address this important issue we performed in the present study a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins specifically interacting with HCN3 in mouse brain. We chose the C terminus of the HCN3 channel as bait because the corresponding domain of other HCN channels has been shown to serve as a hub for scaffolding proteins and channel regulators including TRIP8b. As a result of our study we identify and functionally characterize KCTD3, a novel member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD)-containing protein family (37Stogios P.J. Downs G.S. Jauhal J.J. Nandra S.K. Privé G.G. Sequence and structural analysis of BTB domain proteins.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that within the HCN channel family KCTD3 selectively binds to HCN3 and, thereby, increases cell surface expression and current density of this channel. The cytoplasmic tail of HCN3 was amplified in PCR using pcDNA3-HCN3 (Dr. Biel, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München) as template and subcloned into BamHI and SalI sites of pSos vector (CytoTrap XR, Stratagene). Mouse brain cDNA library (CytoTrap XR premade library, Stratagene) was amplified and purified as described in Stratagene's instruction manual. Full-length KCTD3 and TRIP8bA4 cDNAs were amplified from mouse brain cDNA reversely transcribed from total RNA (Thermoscript, Invitrogen) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1B at KpnI/EcoRI sites. pcDNA3.1B contains a Myc tag sequence at the 3′-end of the multiple restriction enzyme site. KCTD3-myc and TRIP8bA4-myc were amplified using pcDNA3.1B-KCTD3 and -TRIP8bA4 as templates and subcloned into XhoI/BglI and XbaI/SpeI sites of LV-CMV-IRES-eGFP (34Mistrík P. Mader R. Michalakis S.

For the truncated version of KCTD3, KCTD3N-myc (aa 1–87) and KCTD3C-myc (aa 88–815) were PCR amplified and subcloned into LV-CMV-IRES-eGFP via XhoI/BamHI and XhoI/BglII restriction sites, respectively. To generate mCherry-tagged TRIP8bA4, mCherry was PCR amplified and subcloned into LV-CMV-TRIP8bA4-IRES-eGFP via XhoI/SalI restriction sites to replace eGFP. Bicistronic LV-CMV-IRES-eGFP and LV-CMV-IRES-mCherry vectors were used in patch clamping and cell surface experiments to identify transfected cells via fluorescence. The generation of the stable mammalian expression cell line of HCN3 by Flp recombinase-mediated integration (Invitrogen) was described (33Fenske S. Mader R. Scharr A. Paparizos C. Cao-Ehlker X.

To construct pcDNA5/FRT-HCN3-HA, Infusion system (Clontech) was used to insert a hemagglutinin (HA) sequence (ISAYGITYPYDVPDYA) into the extracellular loop S3 to S4 of HCN3 (inframe between aa E193 and P194) using following primers: forward: 5′-GGA ATA ACA TAC CCA TAC GAC GTC CCA GAC TAC GCT CCA CGA CTA GAT GCT GAG GTC-3′, reverse: 5′-GTA TGG GTA TGTTAT TCC GTA TGC TGA TAT CTC CAG CTC CAC CAC TAG GAA. To generate HCN C-terminal chimeric channels, the N terminus and transmembrane segments of HCN2 (aa 1–442) was fused to the C terminus of HCN3 (aa 353–779) to construct pcDNA3-HCN2-C3, and vice versa for pcDNA3-HCN3-C2 (aa 1–352 of HCN3 fused to aa 443–863 of HCN2). In detail, for the pcDNA3-HCN2-C3 construct, pcDNA3-HCN2 and pcDNA3-HCN3 were digested with HindIII/PflMI and the N terminus and transmembrane segments of HCN2 were subcloned into pcDNA3-HCN3. To generate the pcDNA3-HCN3-C2 chimera, HCN2 C terminus was isolated out of pcDNA3-HCN2 by PflMI/NotI digestion and subcloned into pcDNA3-HCN3 to replace HCN3 C terminus. For pcDNA3-HCN2-C3Δ, a fragment corresponding to aa 353–556 of HCN3 C terminus was amplified and subcloned into PflMI/NotI sits of pcDNA3-HCN2. HEK293 cells, HCN3 stable, and HCN3-HA stable cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Biochrom AG) at 37 °C and 10% CO2. HCN3 stable and HCN3-HA stable cell lines were maintained in 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roth). For immunoprecipitation and biotinylation, cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method and for immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological experiments the FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche) was applied. For the comparison of the murine KCTD members, the protein sequence of the 21 known KCTD family members was aligned using DNAman software. An additional protein Shkbp1 was also included for being known to be closely related to KCTD3 (38Borinstein S.C. Hyatt M.A. Sykes V.W. Straub R.E. Lipkowitz S. Boulter J. Bogler O.

Currents were measured at room temperature from HEK293 cells stably expressing one of the four murine HCN channel types of HCN channels using the whole cell voltage-clamp technique. The coexpression of KCTD3 and TRIP8b was monitored by visualizing fluorescence (eGFP for KCTD3 and mCherry for TRIP8b). The extracellular solution was composed of (mm): 110 NaCl, 30 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. The intracellular solution contained (in mm): 130 KCl, 10 NaCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 3 Mg-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP, pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH. Data were acquired at 10 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp10.2 (Molecular Devices). Voltage clamp data were analyzed off-line by using Clampfit10.2 and Origin6.1. Steady-state activation curves for HCN3 were determined by hyperpolarizing voltage steps from −140 mV to −30 mV in 10 mV increments from a holding potential of −40 mV for 3.6 s (pulse interval 20 s) followed by a step to −140 mV for 0.5 s. Currents measured immediately after the final step to −140 mV were normalized by the maximal current (Imax) and plotted as a function of the preceding membrane potential. Data were fitted with the Boltzmann function as described (40Zong X. Krause S. Chen C.C. Krüger J. Gruner C. Cao-Ehlker X. Fenske S. Wahl-Schott C. Biel M.

The voltage protocol used for determination of current density comprised voltage steps of 1.8 s (HCN1 and HCN2, pulse interval 10 s) or 3.6 s (HCN3 and HCN4, pulse interval 20 s) from a holding potential of −40 mV to test potentials ranging from −140 mV to −40 mV in 10-mV increments. The current density was determined by dividing the current at the end of the respective test pulse (pA) by cell capacitance (pF). Activation time constants (τa) were determined by monoexponential function fitting the current evoked during hyperpolarizing voltage pulses to −140 mV from a holding potential of −40 mV. Deactivation time constants (τd) were determined at −40 mV following a prepulse of −140 mV by fit with a monoexponential function. In situ hybridization was performed as describe before (41Moosmang S. Stieber J. Zong X. Biel M. Hofmann F. Ludwig A.

https://openalex.org/W1964014127,"Replacement of a specific amino acid residue in a protein with nonnatural analogues is highly challenging because of their cellular toxicity. We demonstrate for the first time the replacement of all arginine (Arg) residues in a protein with canavanine (Can), a toxic Arg analogue. All Arg residues in the 5-base specific (UACAU) mRNA interferase from Bacillus subtilis (MazF-bs(arg)) were replaced with Can by using the single-protein production system in Escherichia coli. The resulting MazF-bs(can) gained a 6-base recognition sequence, UACAUA, for RNA cleavage instead of the 5-base sequence, UACAU, for MazF-bs(arg). Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that all Arg residues were replaced with Can. The present system offers a novel approach to create new functional proteins by replacing a specific amino acid in a protein with its analogues."
https://openalex.org/W2090347939,"Intratumoral heterogeneity within individual breast tumors is a well-known phenomenon that may contribute to drug resistance. This heterogeneity is dependent on several factors, such as types of oncogenic drivers and tumor precursor cells. The purpose of our study was to engineer a mouse mammary tumor model with intratumoral heterogeneity by using defined genetic perturbations. To achieve this, we used mice with knockout (–/–) of Ink4a/Arf, a tumor suppressor locus; these mice are known to be susceptible to non-mammary tumors such as fibrosarcoma. To induce mammary tumors, we retrovirally introduced an oncogene, HRAS(G12V), into Ink4a/Arf−/− mammary cells in vitro, and those cells were inoculated into syngeneic mice mammary fat pads. We observed 100% tumorigenesis. The tumors formed were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2. Further, they had pathological features similar to those of human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (for example, pushing borders, central necrosis). The tumors were found to be heterogeneous and included two subpopulations: CD49f− quiescent cells and CD49f+cells. Contrary to our expectation, CD49f− quiescent cells had high tumor-initiating potential and CD49f+cells had relatively low tumor-initiating potential. Gene expression analysis revealed that CD49f− quiescent cells overexpressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-driving genes, reminiscent of tumor-initiating cells and claudin-low breast cancer. Our animal model with intratumoral heterogeneity, derived from defined genetic perturbations, allows us to test novel molecular targeted drugs in a setting that mimics the intratumoral heterogeneity of human TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2062728478,"AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels ubiquitous in the vertebrate central nervous system, where they mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission and act as molecular determinants of memory formation and learning. Together with detailed analyses of individual AMPAR domains, structural studies of full-length AMPARs by electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography have provided important insights into channel assembly and function. However, the correlation between the structure and functional states of the channel remains ambiguous particularly because these functional states can be assessed only with the receptor bound within an intact lipid bilayer. To provide a basis for investigating AMPAR structure in a membrane environment, we developed an optimized reconstitution protocol using a receptor whose structure has previously been characterized by electron microscopy. Single-channel recordings of reconstituted homomeric GluA2flop receptors recapitulate key electrophysiological parameters of the channels expressed in native cellular membranes. Atomic force microscopy studies of the reconstituted samples provide high-resolution images of membrane-embedded full-length AMPARs at densities comparable to those in postsynaptic membranes. The data demonstrate the effect of protein density on conformational flexibility and dimensions of the receptors and provide the first structural characterization of functional membrane-embedded AMPARs, thus laying the foundation for correlated structure-function analyses of the predominant mediators of excitatory synaptic signals in the brain.
