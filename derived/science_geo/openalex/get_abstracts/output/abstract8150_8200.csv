https://openalex.org/W4253186968,A simple method has been developed to support human tumor stem cell colony growth in soft agar. The technique appears suitable for culture of a variety of neoplasms of differing histopathology. Tumor stem cell colonies arising from different types of cancer have differing growth characteristics and colony morphology. This bioassay should be suitable for clinical studies of effects of anticancer drugs or irradiation on human tumor stem cells.

This reduced initiation rate is due to inhibition of the binding of Methionyl-tRNAf to native 40S ribosomal subunits and is caused by a macromolecular inhibitor which is activated under these conditions. This paper shows that the inhibitors activated in these two situations appear to be different entities, but that in both cases, the inhibitor has an associated protein kinase activity which is highly selective for the small subunit of eIF-2, the initiation factor which catalyzes binding of Methionyl-tRNAf to 40S subunits. We present several lines of evidence in support of the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of eIF-2 by these kinases is the basis of the control of initiation in lysates incubated under these conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1584133579,"A soluble ribonuclease inhibitor from the human placenta has been purified 4000-fold by a combination of ion exchange and affinity chromatography. The inhibitor has been isolated in 45% yield (about 2 mg/placenta) as a protein that is homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. In common with the inhibitors of pancreatic ribonuclease from other tissues that have been studied earlier, the placental inhibitor is an acidic protein of molecular weight near 50,000; it forms a 1:1 complex with bovine pancreatic RNase A and is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the pancreatic enzyme, with a Ki of 3 X 10(-10) M. The amino acid composition of the protein has been determined. The protein contains 30 half-cystine plus cysteine residues determined as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation. At pH 8.6 the nondenatured protein alkylated with iodoacetic acid in the presence of free thiol has 8 free sulfhydryl groups. The inhibitor is irreversibly inactivated by sulfhydryl reagents and also by removal of free thiol from solutions of the protein. Inactivation by sulfhydryl reagents causes the dissociation of the RNase - inhibitor complex into active RNase and inactive inhibitor."

Cultured RCS rat pigment epithelium rarely ingests outer segment material, although the cells extend cellular processes around fragments of either type. Both normal and RCS pigment epithelium phagocytize polystyrene spheres. This demonstrates that RCS rat pigment epithelial cells contain a defect in the mechanism for phagocytizing outer segments."

In order to examine this possible bias, women's perceptions of their cycle phase were separated experimentally from actual cycle phase. Women who were led to believe that they were premenstrual reported experiencing a significantly higher degree of several physical symptoms, such as water retention, than did women who were led to believe they were intermenstrual. Thus, because of these psychosocial influences on symptom reports, it seems necessary to reexamine previous conclusions regarding the magnitude of menstrual-related changes as well as their physiological basis."

https://openalex.org/W2087422533,"Me3-psoralen (4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen) undergoes a photochemical reaction with DNA, resulting in the formation of covalent monoadducts and interstrand cross-links. DNA was photoreacted with 3H-me3-psoralen inside mouse liver nuclei to the extent of one covalently bound me3-psoralen molecule per 114 or per 246 base pairs (bp) on the average. The photoreacted nuclei were digested with micrococcal nuclease, which is known to degrade the DNA preferentially between nucleosomes (subunits of chromatin containing approximately 200 bp of DNA). The digestion of nuclei with micrococcal nuclease produced DNA fragments of the same molecular weights whether or not the nuclei had been reacted with me3-psoralen. The rate of acid solubilization of covalently bound 3H-me3-psoralen was much greater than that of the bulk DNA when the digestion was performed in nuclei, even though me3-psoralen-containing regions of DNA were digested more slowly in control experiments with deproteinized DNA. At the digestion limit, when 45% of the DNA had been degraded to acid solubility, 92% of the 3H-me3-psoralen had been released from chromatin by micrococcal nuclease. Throughout the nuclease digestion, the me3-psoralen was found to be covalently bound to DNA fragments with the molecular weights previously characterized for micrococcal nuclease digestion products. We conclude that the major site of me3-psoralen reaction in nuclei is with the DNA most susceptible to micrococcal nuclease—that is, with the DNA between nucleosomes. Because me3-psoralen cross-links can be located in DNA by electron microscopy, this probe provides a possible method for determining the in vivo location of chromosomal proteins along high molecular weight DNA, such as a transcription unit."

https://openalex.org/W1978042972,"We have studied sequence organization in the nontranscribed spacer regions of four cloned fragments of Xenopus laevis ribosomal DNA. Each clone contains a spacer of different length. The distribution of cleavage sites for several restriction endonucleases have been investigated in these spacers. We conclude that much of each spacer is comprised of highly repeated sequences and thus resembles simple sequence satellite DNAs. Superimposed on short repeating sequences there are levels of higher order repeating elements. Restriction endonucleases that have many sites in the spacers like Hae III and Hpa II digest most parts of the spacers of all four clones into a similar set of repetitive fragments. Most of these fragments have sizes that are multiples of about 15 bp, suggesting the derivation of the spacer from an ancestral 15 bp unit. Restriction enzymes that recognize fewer sites like Bam HI and Sma I allow the conclusion that the spacers are subdivided into three distinguishable regions. Region A is immediately adjacent to the 28S end of the gene near the transcription termination site, is 500 bp long and is conserved among the four clones examined. Adjacent is region B, which has multiple sites for Sma I. Region B varies slightly in length from 1000–1200 bp among the four clones. The remaining region D has few Sma I sites and varies from 890–3800 bp in length. In long spacers, region D has a higher order repeating unit as recognized by Bam HI and Sma I. Although regions B and D may have arisen from the same ancestral 15 bp repeat, the sequences in these regions have since diverged due to an apparent barrier at the B-D boundary."

This structure contains, on the average, 51+/-5% alpha-helix and no substantial beta-sheet conformation. It is proposed that the protein core of the nu body has a high alpha-helix content."
https://openalex.org/W1667850646,"Optimum K+ concentration for protein synthesis in four eukaryotic cell-free systems is obtained with 70 to 80 mM added KCl or with 110 to 150 mM added K(OAc). The different K+ optima are due to inhibition of protein synthesis by Cl- at concentrations higher than those present in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Initiation of protein synthesis is severely inhibited with 150 mM added KCl. This inhibition results from an impairment of mRNA binding to ribosomes. The binding of initiator Met-tRNAt, however, is only slightly inhibited by 150 mM KCl."

https://openalex.org/W1564001150,"CHI-CHING CHEN AND JORAM HELLER From the Jules Stein Eye Institute, UCLA Sch.001 of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90024 Isolated pigment epithelial cells from bovine eyes were shown to be capable of taking up retinol and retinoic acid. The uptake was dependent on the ligands being presented to the cells as complexes with serum retinol-binding protein. Neither free retinol nor retinol or retinoic acid presented as serum albumin complexes were taken up by the pigment epithelial cells. The transport of retinal and retinoic acid was a relatively rapid, temperature-dependent process. The uptake of retinol and retinoic acid was accompanied by dissociation of the ligand retinal-binding protein complex, with the ligand being taken up by the cells while the cariier protein remained outside the cell. Retinol which was taken up by the pigment epithelial cells was found in the cytosol as retinal. About a third of the transported retinol was found to be bound to a high molecu- lar weight protein (>1.5 x 10”) while the rest was found as free retinol. These results were similar to those previously obtained by the direct addition of retinol to pigment epithe- lial cytosol (Heller, J. (197Q.I. Biol. Chem. 251, 2952). The retinoic acid which was taken up by the pigment epithelial cells was found as retinal-like material, partly bound to a high molecular weight cytosol protein and partly free. This retinol-like material was not retinol since it was not incor- porated into rhodopsin in ciao. Fresh leucocytes and red cells from either human or bovine blood did not show an3 uptake of either retinol or retinoic acid when presented to the cells as their respective serum retinol-binding protein complexes."

Increases in aggressive behavior were observed in rats with experimentally induced epileptic foci in temporal lobe structures but not in control rats or those with foci in the caudate."
https://openalex.org/W2048950531,"Cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNA with the characteristics of sequestered mRNA exists in the unfertilized sea urchin egg. Following egg activation, the amount of poly(A) doubles, but total RNA content stays constant. Chromatography of the RNA on poly(U)-Sepharose shows that the amount of RNA that bears a poly(A) tract increases slightly (approximately 20-30%) during the 2 hr after fertilization. When a cDNA transcript of the poly(A)+ mRNA from 2 hr zygotes is reacted against poly(A)+ RNA from either eggs or zygotes, the kinetics of reassociation of the two preparations seem identical; hence the RNA sequences bearing poly(A) are the same in eggs and zygotes. Measurement of the length of the poly(A) tract in eggs and zygotes shows an increase in number average length from about 45 bases to 60 bases. Measurement of tract length of poly(A) in two cell zygotes by adenosine/AMP ratios of radioactive RNA shows that the poly(A) tract of the zygote is solely accounted for radioactive RNA, indicating extensive turnover of the poly(A). It is concluded that the poly(A) tract in these cells is subject to both lengthening and shortening, with the former predominating in this instance. the increase in poly(A) does not involve polyadenylation of different sequences, but is due to an increase in the number of polyadenylated sequences and the length of the poly(A) tracts that they bear."
https://openalex.org/W1530141639,"A beta-galactoside-specific lectin, capable of agglutinating trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes, was isolated from 13-day-old embryonic chick thigh muscle and purified 1000-fold by affinity chromatography on asialofetuin/Sepharose and Sephadex G-100. A quantitative hemagglutinin assay based on the disappearance of single erythrocytes in a Coulter electronic particle counter was devised to measure lectin activity at different steps of purification. The molecular weight of the lectin was determined by gel filtration to be approximately 31,000, whereas polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate gave a value of approximately 15,000, suggesting that the lectin is a dimer. The lectin is unstable below pH 5, and it requires the presence of dithiothreitol for the retention of maximal activity. The major portion of this lectin is membrane-bound; only 50% of the activity present in the muscle homogenate could be isolated in soluble form by extraction of muscle acetone powder with a buffer of high ionic strength. In view of the lack of a calcium requirement for its activity, the role of this lectin in myoblast fusion, a calcium-dependent phenomenon, is not clear."

https://openalex.org/W2110815253,"A number of conditional lethal mutants of CHO cells that are defective in protein synthesis have been characterized with respect to their biochemical lesions. A defective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase appears to be the basis of each mutant phenotype. In each strain, the specific activity in vitro of the synthetase cognate for one of the following amino acids was substantially reduced: arginine, asparagine, glutamine, histidine or methionine. One mutant, Arg-1, gave no detectable arginyl-tRNA synthetase activity, suggesting that it contains an altered enzyme that is unstable in vitro. Most of the mutants correspondingly exhibited impaired aminoacylation in vivo under nonpermissive conditions. However, two mutants, Arg-1 and His-1, appeared to have normal levels of acylated tRNA under the nonpermissive conditions which inhibited protein synthesis to approximately 50% and 10%, respectively. The expression of each mutant's phenotype, measured by rates of protein synthesis or growth, was a function of temperature and/or the concentration of amino acid cognate for the synthetase found to be deficient in vitro. The properties of these mutants make them applicable to diverse problems related to translation in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1541647579,"Conditions were determined for measuring growth hormone synthesis by a clonal strain of rat pituitary cells grown in suspension culture. Incubation of the cells with [3H]leucine in either continuous labeling or pulse-chase experiments showed that secretion of newly synthesized growth hormone commences only after a lag of about 15 min. The pulse-chase experiments also demonstrated that there is no detectable degradation by the cells of growth hormone. Thus growth hormone synthesis could be measured, in the absence of complications arising either from secretion or degradation of growth hormone, by incubating the cells with [3H]leucine for 10 min. Exposure of cells grown under the usual culture conditions to dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) led to an average stimulation of specific growth hormone synthesis (growth hormone synthesis/total cytoplasmic protein synthesis) of only 2.6-fold. However, two other growth conditions were found in which dexamethasone routinely yielded a 5- to 15-fold stimulation of specific growth hormone synthesis. One of these conditions, involving substitution of 10% fetal calf serum for the normal serum supplement, was employed in subsequent experiments. A stimulation of specific growth hormone synthesis could be observed at 10(-9) M dexamethasone, and the maximum stimulation was observed at dexamethasone concentrations of about 10(-8) to 10(-7) M. There was a lag of about 6 h before a stimulation by dexamethasone of specific growth hormone synthesis was detected. Thereafter, the stimulation increased in a nearly linear fashion until maximum stimulation was reached at about 48 h."
https://openalex.org/W2008974945,"The Xenopus oocyte can be used to study the nature and specificity of the translational and post-translational systems of a normal living cell. We describe experiments combining messenger RNA microinjection and subcellular fractionation. Total Xenopus liver RNA directs the synthesis of albumin and vitellogenin contained within membrane vesicles; similarly, guinea pig mammary gland mRNA codes for membrane-bound protease-resistant milk proteins. In contrast, iodinated albumin protein injected into oocytes remains in the supernatant fraction, as does globin made on mRNA. The information encoded in the albumin messenger is therefore sufficient to specify synthesis of a membrane-bound product; moreover, this highly efficient coupled translation-processing system may be of use in the study of the transfer of newly made proteins across membranes. A significant proportion (up to 20%) of newly made oocyte proteins enter a light membrane fraction, and many remain there. We speculate that these vesicles represent part of an important storage system."

https://openalex.org/W1984536444,"At various times following injection of either 3H-GTP or 32PO4 into full-grown (stage 6) Xenopus laevis oocytes, RNA has been extracted and fractionated on polyacrylamide gels. Based on size, base composition and incorporation data, we have defined the kinetics of synthesis and accumulation of ribosomal RNA (40S, 28S, 18S), heterogeneous RNA of high molecular weight (>40S) and heterogeneous RNA migrating with molecular weights of from 4S to 40S. Nuclear isolations have been performed to determine the cellular distribution of these classes of RNA as a function of time. Evidence is presented which shows that stage 6 oocytes synthesize RNA which by virtue of its size, base composition, rapid turnover and nuclear location is equivalent to the heterogeneous nuclear RNA observed in somatic cells. In addition, the data suggest synthesis of a class of nuclear RNA with a half-life of several hours. A small fraction (5%) of the nuclear RNA is stable, enters the cytoplasm and may represent RNA added to the stockpile of maternal transcripts known to be present in stage 6 oocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1602259218,"Enzymatic activities capable of degrading double-stranded RNA have been solubilized from whole 9-day-old chick embryos and separated by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose into two classes, designated nucleases DI and DII. Nuclease DI exhibits an absolute requirement for Mn2+ in the range of 5 to 10 mM. Monovalent cations, including K+, Na+, and NH4+, are inhibitory. The molecular weight of DI is 60,000 to 62,500 as estimated from sedimentation in sucrose density gradients. Following gradient fractionation, nuclease DI possesses the ability to degrade several substrates exhibiting a 250-fold preference for poly(rC) as compared to poly(rC)-poly(rG). The activity responsible for degrading double-stranded RNA functions as an endonuclease generating oligonucleotides with 5'-phosphate termini. Nuclease DII requires both monovalent and divalent cations. Optimal degradation of poly[r(A-U)] is seen at 75 to 100 mM salt and 0.5 to 1.0 mM MgCl2 or MnCl2. The molecular weight estimated from sucrose gradient sedimentation is in the range of 38,000 to 40,000. Nuclease DII acts endonucleolytically producing oligonucleotides terminating in 5'-phosphates. During the isolation and characterization of nucleases DI and DII, a third activity was detected which degrades single-stranded RNA substrates but which, in the presence of either DII or RNase H, significantly enhances the degradation of poly[r(A-U)] or poly(rA)-poly(dT) substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1971495757,"A system for excess DNA hybridization of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV)-specific RNA from infected mouse cells with M-MuLV cDNA immobilized on nitrocellulose filters was developed. In the presence of unlabeled heterologous rabbit liver RNA, 0.3-0.5% of labeled, infected cell nuclear RNA bound to the filters, while 0.05% or less of nuclear RNA from uninfected cells bound. Sedimentation analysis of pulse-labeled nuclear RNA was performed, and hybridization across sucrose gradients indicated that the major pulse-labeled, virus-specific RNA was 38S, similar or identical in sedimentation to the virion subunit RNA. A minor component of pulse-labeled, virus-specific RNA larger than 38S, was detected (40-60S), but kinetic experiments indicated that it was not an obligate precursor to 38S virus-specific RNA. Simultaneous analysis of steady state and pulse-labeled, virus-specific nuclear RNA across sucrose gradients indicated that the 38S virus-specific RNA was not detectably different from the steady state ""35S"" nuclear RNA previously identified. More detailed resolution on agarose gels also showed no difference. Thus the primary transcript of M-MuLV-specific RNA appears to be 38S, the same size as stable cellular virus-specific RNA, and no evidence for a higher molecular weight precursor was found."

A product was isolated and identified to be the result of a fusion of a delta4-imidazoline ring to the pyrimidine ring of deoxyguanosine at the N-1 and 2-NH2 positions. Following reaction and dialysis, the DNA was hydrolyzed enzymatically to nucleosides. The structural assignment of the product was based on comparison of the elution volume from a Sephadex G-10 column, the ultraviolet spectra at various conditions of pH, and the thin layer chromatographic properties with respect to an authentic sample. The formation of the extended ring system with DNA-derived guanosine may be related to the mode of carcinogenic action of this difunctional alkylating agent."

Catalytic hydrogenation of dolichyl phosphate-[14C]mannose, synthesized by the retina of the embryonic chick was examined using different solvents and catalysts. When performed in chloroform:methanol (2:1), extensive cleavage to water-soluble radioactive material occurred due to hydrolysis caused by the reaction medium, even when buffered with tributylamine. When other solvents were used, considerable adsorption of radio-activity to the catalyst, in addition to variable amounts of hydrolysis, was encountered. Thus, the method is encumbered with artifact and extreme variability depending upon the reaction conditions employed, rendering it less than reliable for the purpose for which it was intended."
