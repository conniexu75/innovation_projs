https://openalex.org/W1607957872,"Abstract A hypotensive peptide, designated neurotensin, has been discovered and isolated in pure form from acid-acetone extracts of bovine hypothalami by column chromatography and paper electrophoresis. The results of amino acid analyses of material recovered after paper electrophoresis at pH 3.5, 6.5, and 8.9 and chromatographic analyses of the dansylated material indicate that the peptide isolated by this procedure is homogenous. Its amino acid composition and apparent molecular weight estimated by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 indicate that neurotensin is a tridecapeptide composed of Lys, Arg2, Asx, Glx2, Pro2, Ileu, Leu2, Tyr2. Neurotensin lacks a free NH2-terminus; however, it possesses a free COOH terminus which can be acted upon by carboxypeptidase A. Neurotensin induces hypotension in the rat and can stimulate the contraction of guinea pig ileum and rat uterus; however, it produces relaxation of the rat duodenum. These pharmacological properties classify it as a kinin, yet its chemical composition distinguishes it from any known peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1992687142,"The destruction of ascending noradreniergic pathways by bilateral microinjections of 6-hydroxydopamnine made laterally to the pedunculus cerebellaris superior completely abolished the in vitro synthesis of [(3)H]norepinephrine from L-[(3)H]tyrosine in slices and in synaptosomes of the rat cortex. However, normal [(3)H]dopamine synthesis could still be observed in both cortical preparations from animals with lesions. These results provide the first biochemical support for the existence of dopaminergic terminals independent of noradrenergic terminals in the rat cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2030802624,"Muscle carnitine palmityltransferase activity, measured by three different methods, was very low (0 to 20 percent of controls) in a patient with a familial syndrome of recurrent myoglobinuria. Long-chain fatty acyl CoA synthetase activity was normal; acetylcarnitine transferase activity was decreased by 40 percent, and carnitine content was 1.7 times higher than the mean control value. Utilization of palmitate by isolated mitochondria was more impaired than utilization of palmitylcarnitine, suggesting a more severe defect of carnitine palmityltransferase I than transferase II. Thus, myoglobinuria may be due to a genetic defect of lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle."

Both the urination frequency and the pattern in which urine was deposited on the filter paper depended upon social rank. Dominant males vigorously marked their entire cage floor, whereas subordinate males typically voided urine in only two to four pools in the corners of their cages."

The DNA product is complementary to a homogeneous sequence specific for ovalbumin. The amount of ovalbumin sequence in hen oviduct and hen liver DNA was measured by hybridization experiments and found to be 2 copies per diploid genome in both tissues, indicating that there is no selective amplification of ovalbumin genes in the tissue specialized for obalbumin synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1527790448,"Abstract A crude β-hexosaminidase fraction prepared by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation of human liver extract or urine was found to convert Tay-Sachs ganglioside, GalNAcβ1 → 4(NANα2 → 3)Galβ1 → 4Glc → ceramide (Gm2) into NANα2 → 3Galβ1 → 4 Glc → ceramide (Gm3). After separation of hexosaminidase A and B by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, only freshly prepared β-hexosaminidase A hydrolyzed Gm2 although both forms were still active toward p-nitrophenyl-β-d-N-acetylglucosaminide. A heat-stable, nondialyzable preparation obtained from the crude β-hexosaminidase fraction of human liver was found to stimulate the hydrolysis of Gm2 by β-hexosaminidase A but not B isolated from both sources. Upon aging, β-hexosaminidase A would only hydrolyze Gm2 in the presence of the heat-stable preparation. Extensive purification as well as aging tended to reduce the capacity of β-hexosaminidase A to hydrolyze Gm2 even in the presence of the heat-stable preparation. Our results explain why β-hexosaminidase A has been previously reported by other investigators to hydrolyze Gm2 only with great difficulty. Our results also relate the inordinate storage of Gm2 to the absence of β-hexosaminidase A in the classical form of Tay-Sachs disease."

Such a well-defined visual area in elasmobranch telencephalon further challenges classical formulations of forebrain evolution. Moreover, its ipsilateral representation confirms recent evidence for a crossed thalamotelencephalic visual projection."

Specific activities of other glycosyltransferases of the pathway ceramide to monosialo-ganglioside are unchanged or elevated so that the ganglioside GM(1) accumulates and higher gangliosides are depressed. These findings with a solid tumor are critical to an involvement of gangliosides in the cell-surface changes of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1503889702,"Abstract For carp hemoglobin in the presence of 0.7 and 7 mm inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) at 20° in the pH range below pH 6.2 and 6.4, respectively, oxygen binding is noncooperative. The absence of heme-heme interaction is indicated by a value of 0.75 for the Hill parameter n. The oxygen affinity and the oxygen dissociation rate, k, are pH- and phosphate-independent and are those of carp hemolysate below pH 5.6. Above pH 6.2 and 6.4, oxygen binding to the IHP-bound hemoglobin is cooperative and affected by changes in pH and organic phosphate conditions. The extent of heme-heme interaction is pH-dependent as indicated by an increase and subsequent decrease of the value of the Hill parameter n as pH is raised. Addition of 0.7 and 7 mm IHP to stripped carp hemoglobin has nearly the same effect on all aspects of ligand binding, affinity, kinetics, and cooperativity, as decreasing the pH of stripped hemoglobin by 1.6 and 1.8 pH units, respectively. In the case of CO binding, above pH 5.7, 0.7 mm IHP has nearly the same effect as decreasing the pH of stripped hemoglobin by 1.6 pH units. Below pH 5.7, CO affinity increases with decrease in pH. This acid Bohr effect is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the value of n. However, this is apparently not simply a reversal of the alkaline Bohr effect because the kinetic basis for the affinity change is very different."

https://openalex.org/W1488810436,"Abstract The kinetics and equilibrium of binding of the chromophoric sugar derivative p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside to concanavalin A at pH 6.95 have been studied. The association rate constant for the chromophoric sugar-concanavalin A complex is 8 x 104 m-1 s-1 and the dissociation rate constant is 4 s-1 at 20°. The dissociation constant measured directly by difference spectroscopy at 316 nm is 4.09 ± 0.62 x 10-5 m compared to 5 x 10-5 m calculated from the kinetic constants. The equilibrium results are approximately the same as those reported earlier by Hassing and Goldstein ((1970) Eur. J. Biochem. 16, 549). The results are consistent with a simple association-dissociation scheme with independent sugar binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W1554455709,"Abstract High potential iron-sulfur protein isolated from both autotrophically and heterotrophically grown cells of Chromatium vinosum strain D was found to contain a single 85-amino acid residue polypeptide chain which is covalently linked to the iron-sulfur cluster via 4 residues of cysteine. The molecular weight of the protein, including the 4 atoms of iron and acid labile sulfur, is 9,254. The iron-sulfur complex must be removed from the protein before complete digestion by proteolytic enzymes like trypsin, chymotrypsin, or thermolysin can be attained. Digestion of the holoprotein by these enzymes leads to large peptides which contain the central portion of the sequence and comprise 35 to 45 residues, depending on the enzyme used, as well as residual iron presumably attached to the cysteines in positions 43, 45, 63, and 77. Both ends of the protein are readily accessible to exopeptidases and can be degraded substantially. Cysteines 43 and 45 and the single histidyl residue in position 42 are in a configuration reminiscent of that found at the heme attachment site of c-type cytochromes. The complete amino acid sequence of Chromatium high potential iron-sulfur protein was deduced from analyses of peptides obtained by proteolytic digestion of the apoprotein, the tryptic and chymotryptic core peptides, and of the two large peptides produced by chemical fragmentation of the apoprotein with BrCN. The first 18 residues of the protein were determined by stepwise Edman degradation. This approach was also applied to the core peptides and to both BrCN fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1598792174,"Abstract Protamine sulfate fractionation of crude extracts of Pseudomonas sp. (Shaw strain MA), containing malate ATP lyase activity, results in the separation of this activity into two protein components. The first component, identified as a malate thiokinase, has been purified to near homogeneity. The enzyme contains succinate thiokinase activity equal to that of malate thiokinase activity; however, this activity is distinct from succinate thiokinase itself. The second component of the malate ATP lyase reaction is a malyl coenzyme A lyase. This reversible reaction is specific for S-malyl-CoA. The equilibrium constant of this latter reaction is ∼3 x 10-3 m. Mixing together malate thiokinase and malyl-CoA lyase results in the reconstitution of the originally observed malate ATP lyase reaction."

Even with repetitive stimulus flashes the rhodopsin did not bleach; after each flash the spectral intermediates decayed rapidly to the initial thermally stable state. The pigment returns to the stable state in a time comparable with the duration of the late receptor potential.

The molecular weight of cystathionase, by two methods, is 1.60 x 105, the apparent Km for l-α,β-diaminopropionate is 1 mm and the Km for the potent competitive inhibitor, β-cyano-l-alanine, is approximately 0.2 µm against either l-homoserine or l-α,β-diaminopropionate as substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1598595607,"Abstract A procedure is described for the partial purification (up to 200-fold) of an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase from goat colostrum. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine to glycoprotein acceptors containing terminal mannose residues. The most effective substrate was α1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) from which terminal sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine residues were enzymatically removed. The transferase was inactive with a wide range of low molecular weight acceptors. It exhibited a broad pH optimum, between pH 6.1 and 8.2, required divalent cations for activity (Mn2+ being more effective than Mg2+), and gave Km values for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and the modified orosomucoid of 0.8 mm and 2 to 4 mm, respectively. The enzyme was detected in a variety of rat tissues. The mode of action of the transferase and its relationship to the formation of glycoproteins are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1540748012,"Abstract N-Methylglutamate synthetase, an FMN-containing enzyme, catalyzes the reversible formation of N-methyl-l-glutamate from methylamine and l-glutamate (methylamine + l-glutamate ⇌ N-methyl-l-glutamate + ammonia). The reaction follows a Ping Pong Bi Bi kinetic pattern consistent with a double displacement mechanism involving a glutaryl enzyme intermediate. An active glutaryl enzyme can be isolated by incubating enzyme with [14C]glutamate or N-[glutaryl-14C]methylglutamate but not from N-[methyl-14C]-methylglutamate. Formation of this intermediate involves the incorporation of 2 moles of glutamate and the reduction of 2 moles of FMN per mole of enzyme. Likewise the removal of the glutaryl moiety by methylamine or ammonia occurs with the stoichiometric oxidation of FMN. The rate of flaxin reduction by a fixed level of glutamate or N-methylglutamate is 5 to 9 times faster than the over-all reaction, while flavin reoxidation by methylamine or ammonia is 0.5 to 1.0 times the rate of the corresponding over-all reaction. Incorporation or subsequent removal by methylamine, of the glutaryl moiety into the enzyme also occurs at rates approximately equal to that of the corresponding over-all reactions. These results are consistent with a double displacement mechanism utilizing the cyclic reduction-oxidation of FMN for oxidative catalysis."

No tumours were observed in control animals receiving either saccharin or MNU alone. Since submitting this report, concern has been expressed at the United States Food and Drugs Administration meeting, May 17, that impurities in saccharin, particularly O-toluene sulphonamide, could be responsible for the bladder tumours observed in saccharin feeding studies at the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF)2,3."
https://openalex.org/W1600815153,"Bovine testicular β-galactosidase catalyzed the enzymatic transfer of galactose residues from appropriate β-galactosides to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to yield nucleotide disaccharides. The disaccharide portion of the nucleotides was a mixture of isomers of O-β-galactopyranosyl-(1→6, 1→3, and 1→4)-N-acetylglucosamine in ratios approximating 1:8:9, respectively. Nucleotide disaccharides were also obtained when UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and UDP-glucose served as acceptors for β-galactosyl residues. Synthesis of a family of nucleotide trisaccharides, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-(β,1→6; β,1→3; and β,1→4)-galactose-N-acetylneuraminic acid, was achieved when goat colostrum sialyltransferase was incubated with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-[3H]galactose and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid. The results of the present studies suggest a pathway for the enzymatic synthesis of the UDP-disaccharides and UDP-trisaccharides found in milk and colostrum. The preparation of tritium-labeled UDP-disaccharides and 14C-labeled UDP-trisaccharides as well as conditions for the resolution of nucleotide mono-, di-, and trisaccharides on gel filtration columns are described."

https://openalex.org/W72056564,"Abstract Evidence is presented to show that rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes contain a significant component of completed α-globin which is still attached to tRNA (α-globyl-tRNA). Additional data are presented to show that contamination by labeled supernatant hemoglobin or labeled α-globin from the free α-globin pool present in reticulocytes is not a significant factor in these results. Some 4.6% of the nascent α-globin chains are present as α-globin-tRNA, instead of 0.71% as predicted on the basis of the assumption that the size distribution of nascent globin chains is uniform. On the other hand β-globyl-tRNA comprises 0.69% of the nascent β-globin chains. This value coincides closely with the predicted value for nascent β-globin chains uniformly distributed in size along the polysome. Further evidence is presented to show that both α-globyl-tRNA and β-globyl-tRNA exhibit the kinetic properties expected for normal intermediates of soluble hemoglobin biosynthesis following inhibition of the initiation of protein synthesis by pactamycin."

https://openalex.org/W1490960873,"Abstract Satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA directs the ribosomal binding of methionyl-, alanyl-, and lysyl-tRNA when incubated under the appropriate conditions in the in vitro wheat embryo amino acid incorporating system. The products of the various binding reactions have been identified as methionyl-tRNA, methionyl-alanyl-tRNA, and methionyl-alanyl-lysyl-tRNA. This sequence corresponds to the known NH2-terminal sequence of the satellite tobacco necrosis virus coat protein thereby establishing the accurate initiation and translation of at least the three initial codons of the translated portion of the viral RNA. Methionyl-tRNA binding requires, in addition to ATP and GTP, the presence of the two initiation factors C and D, and occurs readily at 1.3 mm Mg2+. Alanyl-tRNA binding is obtained only when the system is supplemented with phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and elongation factor 1 and when the Mg2+ concentration is raised to 3.6 mm. These latter conditions also allow an additional increment of methionyl-tRNA to be bound to ribosomes. The amount of extra methionyl-tRNA bound is equal to the alanyl-tRNA bound under these conditions and to the methionyl-tRNA bound in the original initiation reaction. Chlortetracycline completely inhibits binding of alanyl-tRNA as well as the extra increment of methionyl-tRNA. It is, however, without effect on the initial binding of methionyl-tRNA. Binding of lysyl-tRNA to ribosomes occurs only upon further supplementation with elongation factor 2. These observations provide further evidence that factors C and D are initiation factors; that elongation factor 1 functions in dipeptide synthesis and that elongation factor 2 is required only for tripeptide formation. The ability to bind the extra increment of methionyl-tRNA under conditions of dipeptidyl tRNA synthesis suggests the existence of a third ribosomal binding site specific for methionyl-tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1582885195,"Abstract HeLa cells incubated as stationary cultures in the presence of low concentrations of prednisolone (11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione) have a reduced capacity to grow beyond the stage of confluence and usually do not form several layers of cell growth. This effect of the hormone analog seems to be associated with the accumulation of sialopeptides, normally released into the medium, at the cell periphery. Two such sialopeptide fractions have been isolated from the supernatant medium from cultures of the S3G strain of HeLa cells. Treatment of plasma membrane preparations with supernatant fluid from high speed centrifugation resulted in the release of sialopeptides that had an elution pattern from Dowex-formate columns similar to the elution pattern of the sialopeptides released into the medium by intact HeLa cultures. This proteolytic activity was markedly reduced in preparations from HeLa cells grown in the presence of 4.1 x 10-5 m prednisolone. The results give further support to the idea that surface glycopeptides are involved in the control of growth in cultures of epithelioid cells of neoplastic origin. They offer a possibility for studying such changes through hormonal manipulation of cell cultures."

https://openalex.org/W1487953054,"Abstract Human hemoglobin (αNOβ), in which α chains were liganded with nitric oxide and β chains were unliganded, showed a characteristic spectrum in the Soret region. Its absorption was significantly reduced compared with the averaged absorption of α-NO and β. On the other hand, a complex of (αNOβ) with haptoglobin did not show such a characteristic spectrum. It was concluded, therefore, that there are some subunit interactions in (αNOβ) and that they are lost when (αNOβ) is bound to haptoglobin. Reaction of (αNOβ) with haptoglobin was followed spectrophotometrically, and it was found that the rate of reaction of (αNOβ) with haptoglobin was markedly different from that of fully liganded or fully unliganded hemoglobin with haptoglobin. (αNOβ) seems to be in a different conformational state from both fully liganded or fully unliganded hemoglobin."
