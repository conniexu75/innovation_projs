https://openalex.org/W1504354683,"Virgin soybean trypsin inhibitor has 1 NH2-terminal aspartic acid or asparagine residue and no COOH-terminal residues that can be released by carboxypeptidase B. Upon incubation with 1 mole % of trypsin for 24 hours at pH 3.75, virgin inhibitor is converted to a modified inhibitor which has 2 NH2 terminals aspartic acid or asparagine and isoleucine. Approximately 1 mole of arginine is released from it by the action of carboxypeptidase B. Reduction and carboxymethylation of virgin inhibitor leads to formation of one major fragment as judged by Sephadex chromatography; the same treatment of modified inhibitor leads to formation of two fragments. The sum of the amino acid compositions of these two fragments accurately corresponds to the amino acid composition of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The smaller fragment is composed of approximately 64 amino acids and has NH2-terminal aspartic acid or asparagine residue and a COOH-terminal arginine residue. It is concluded that the modification reaction consists of conversion of single chain inhibitor to two chains held by a single disulfide bond by tryptic cleavage of a single Arg-Ile bond located approximately between residues 64 and 65. Evidence is also presented that modification of chicken ovomucoid consists of conversion of single chain to two chain protein by cleavage of a single Arg-Ala bond. The fragments may be held by a disulfide bond or bonds. Compilation of considerable amount of evidence obtained by others suggests that part of the reactive site of many, or possibly all, naturally occurring trypsin inhibitors consists of a trypsin-accessible Arg-X or Lys-X bond contained within a disulfide loop."
https://openalex.org/W1500064513,"Abstract The changes in the activities of a number of enzymes, representing various metabolic activities, in pyridine nucleotides, in levels of deoxyribo- and ribonucleic acid, and in numbers of nuclei in mammary glands removed from rats at various stages of pregnancy and lactation have been documented. The onset of lactation is accompanied by a rapid 3- to 4-fold increase in numbers of nuclei and in DNA levels, followed by a rapid increase in the activities of all the enzymes investigated. The increases in enzyme activities which occur during the first 3 days of lactation appear to be of a pattern similar to that of the tissue after 15 days of lactation, indicating that the newly formed cells acquire an enzymatic complement characteristic of fully lactating tissue very soon after their formation. It is suggested that the apparent preferential increases, during lactation, in the activities of enzymes directly associated with the synthesis of milk components are due to the fact that their activities are very low in nonsecretory tissue and that a significant proportion of the enzymes extracted from mammary tissue during early lactation arises from nonsecretory tissue. Under these conditions enzyme activities present in high levels in nonsecretory tissue would not increase dramatically during lactation."
https://openalex.org/W1984572952,"Kinins are naturally occurring vasoactive polypeptides thought to be mediators of acute inflammatory responses. Kinins are released from a plasma protein substrate by glass-activated plasma enzymes (kallikreins) or by isolated intact granulocytes. Cortisol in concentrations of 2.5 × 10-6 to 2.5 × 10-5M prevented the release of active kinin from substrate by granulocytes or contact with glass. Deoxycorticosterone, progesterone, and etiocholanolone in comparable concentrations were significantly less effective in preventing kinin release. Plasma obtained from patients receiving prednisone released no kinin after activation by glass and less kinin than control plasma when exposed to granulocytes. Cortisol also partially inhibited the release of kinin by purified urinary kallikrein. Certain adrenocorticosteroids may exert their anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the release of plasma kinins. Steroids may act in part by preventing interaction between the activated kallikrein and its substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1567517185,"Abstract The mediated uptake of lysine by the Ehrlich cell shows a heterogeneity in its accessibility to inhibition by other amino acids: a portion of about 60% that can be eliminated by the presence of phenylalanine in excess; a minor portion that can be eliminated by various neutral amino acids, although not by phenylalanine; and another minor saturable portion that cannot be inhibited by neutral amino acids. The latter component shows a doubling of its rate on the removal of the sodium ion from the medium. The described heterogeneity of lysine transport might be explained in either of two ways. First, one might propose three independent transport-mediating systems for lysine, none of them identical with any serving for the neutral amino acids. Alternatively, the leucine-preferring and lysine-preferring receptor sites may lie on a common transport-mediating system, the phenomena of partial inhibition of lysine transport by neutral amino acids and of neutral amino acid transport by lysine arising from the handicap that filling of one of the sites presents to the operation of the other. A parallelism in the loss of countertransport by leucine and lysine on treatment with dinitrofluorobenzene indicates at least a common feature if not a common step for two of the processes concerned. The entry of α-N-methyl-l-lysine, which was unreactive with the above transport agencies, showed a first order rate constant of 0.003 min-1, providing a maximal value for entry by simple diffusion. At least two of these three components contribute to the uptake of α,γ-diaminobutyric acid, but its intense uptake at high concentration (and that of its lower homologue) is produced by an atypical use of the usual alanine-preferring (A) system. Possible bases for that atypical operation of the A system are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2085386424,"Malathion was found to be metabolized quickly by a soil fungus, Trichoderma viride, and a bacterium, Pseudomonas sp., which were originally found in soils from northern Ohio that had been sprayed heavily with insecticides. Results of a survey of the breakdown capabilities of 16 variants of T. viride revealed that certain colonies from this species had a very marked ability to breakdown malathion through the action of a carboxylesterase(s). The enzymes can be made soluble by preparing the acetone powder suspension."

Precautions were taken to avoid confusion of other shock effects with retrograde amnesia. A temporal gradient of elec- troconvulsive shock-produced retrograde amnesia, extending up to at least 1 hour, for a well-discriminated stimulus, was demonstrated in mice in a one-trial learning passive avoidance situation."
https://openalex.org/W1507367739,"Abstract Two enzymes are responsible for the cleavage of pregnane side chains. A steroid-inducible oxygenase, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine trinucleotide and molecular oxygen, catalyzes the conversion of progesterone into testosterone acetate. The latter ester is then hydrolyzed by an esterase to yield testosterone. The oxygenase has been partially purified and separated from the esterase. Evidence is herein presented to show that these two enzymes are also responsible for the degradation of pregnane side chains in 17α-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, deoxy-corticosterone, pregna-4,16-diene-3,20-dione and 16α,17α-oxidopregn-4-ene-3,20-dione."
https://openalex.org/W1493332704,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of Neurospora crassa cytochrome c has been determined. The molecule consists of a single polypeptide chain containing 107 residues. The NH2-terminal residue is glycine, and the COOH-terminal residue is alanine. There are 39 amino acid differences between the cytochromes of N. crassa and those of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas there are 43 amino acid differences between the cytochromes c of Neurospora and human heart. For all of the presently known cytochromes c, the number of amino acids which occupy the same position is reduced to 39. N. crassa cytochrome c has only 2 histidine residues in positions 18 and 33, whereas tuna fish cytochrome has 2 histidine residues in positions 18 and 26. It is suggested that the histidine residue in position 18 contributes the fifth ligand to the heme iron, and that the sixth ligand in cytochrome c is not formed with histidine or with another nitrogenous group, but with an unknown ligand."

https://openalex.org/W1979675643,"The effect of intracerebral injections of the anticholinesterase drug diisopropyl fluorophosphate in rats was to produce good recall of an otherwise almost forgotten habit learned 28 days before. The same injections produced temporary amnesia for the same habit, otherwise well remembered, learned 14 days before. The injections had no ef fect on the memory of the same habit when it was only partly learned 14 days before. The results support the hy pothesis that the physiological basis of memory lies in an increase, and for getting in a decrease, in synaptic con ductance."

https://openalex.org/W1549605553,"Abstract The ability of several catalytically inactive derivatives of α-chymotrypsin and trypsin to react with naturally occurring protein inhibitors was studied. Two types of inactive derivatives were used: (a) modified seryl derivatives of chymotrypsin, tosyl-chymotrypsin, and anhydro-chymotrypsin prepared by base elimination of the tosyl group; (b) modified histidyl derivatives, the derivative of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and chymotrypsin and the derivative of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone and trypsin. The inhibitors were several ovomucoids from different avian species and inhibitors from beans and potato. The formation of the complexes was established by competitive enzymatic assays and by electrophoresis in gel. Tosyl-chymotrypsin did not form a complex with an inhibitor of chymotrypsin but the anhydro-chymotrypsin did form a complex. The inactive histidyl derivatives of both chymotrypsin and trypsin formed complexes with several inhibitors of chymotrypsin and trypsin, respectively. The rate of interaction of anhydro-chymotrypsin with inhibitors was similar to that of native chymotrypsin, while the rates of the histidyl derivatives of chymotrypsin and trypsin were slower. The naturally occurring protein inhibitors were found to serve as useful tools for studying the effects of chemical modifications on the tertiary structure of proteolytic enzymes. Catalytic activity of the enzymes was not essential for the formation of complexes. As evidenced by the formation of complexes, specific substitutions of the catalytic histidyl residues of both chymotrypsin and trypsin do not greatly affect their tertiary structures. Substitution on the catalytic seryl residue of chymotrypsin changes the tertiary structure or causes steric effects, while modification of the seryl residues by base elimination of the tosyl group does not result in any gross structural changes."

Enzymatic activity in all three areas of brain was at its lowest during the diestrus phase of the estrous cycle and progressively increased to its highest during estrus. Throughout the estrous cycle the greatest activity of monoamine oxidase was found in the hypothalamus, as compared with the other brain areas. The significance of the activity is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2014573370,"The relationship between protein synthesis and mitosis was studied in Physarum polycephalum, a plasmodial slime mold whose nuclear divisions are synchronous. Results of studies with actidione (cycloheximide), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, indicated that the essential structural proteins for mitosis and nuclear reconstruction were completed prior to the dissolution of the nucleolus in prophase. Proteins that determine the duration of the transition from metaphase to nuclear reconstruction were synthesized from late prophase to prometaphase. It is proposed that these proteins are concerned with the transformation of chemical energy into the mechanical work of mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W2053832794,"Protein synthesis in fertilized sea urchin eggs, or in 12,000g supernatants derived from them, increased linearly during the period preceding prophase of the first mitotic cycle, dropped during metaphase and anaphase, and increased again after telophase. Similar results were observed for whole cells incubated in the presence of colchicine. These changes in the rate of protein synthesis during the mitotic cycle may be regulated at the translational level."

https://openalex.org/W1491180728,"Abstract The Ehrlich ascites tumor cell shows three modes of uptake of 14C-benzylamine: an instantaneous binding, quickly reversed by washing the cell; a rapid, saturable uptake process; and a slower, apparently nonsaturable uptake process. Both the latter appear to involve predominantly if not exclusively the neutral, unprotonated form of the amine. This feature of the mediated process shows that the structure with which the amino group presumably must react is unlike the structure serving a similar role in the uptake of such amino acids as glycine, serine, and α-aminoisobutyric acid by the Ehrlich cell. Various hydrocarbon groups—branched, unbranched, and aromatic—contribute to reactivity of amines with the transport system for benzylamine, just as has been observed for the uptake of amino acids by the so-called leucine-preferring system. In this case also, the structure with which the amino group associates itself in transport is unlike those serving for amino acid transport systems in the tolerance that it shows to N-methylation of the amino group. The transport process for benzylamine appears to be similar to previously studied systems participating in the uptake of catecholamines by various tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1545121633,"Abstract In contrast to the deoxycytidylate deaminase from animal tissues, the deaminase induced by T2r+ infection of Escherichia coli does not deaminate 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidylate. The depletion of this essential T-even phage deoxyribonucleic acid precursor is thus prevented. Although there is an apparent difference in substrate specificity between these deoxycytidylate deaminases, their ability to regulate the formation of deoxyuridylate by feedback control is quite similar."
https://openalex.org/W1664965482,"The glucogenic behavior of butyrate in ruminants has been reported frequently, but the metabolic nature of this anomalous relationship has remained obscure. To test the possibility that the metabolism of butyrate affects gluconeogenesis, lactating cows were given intravenous injections of tracer amounts of pyruvate-2-14C and, in parallel experiments, of pyruvate-2-14C plus substrate amounts of sodium butyrate (0.7 mm per kg of body weight). When butyrate was injected, less 14C appeared in respired CO2 and more 14C in plasma glucose. The intramolecular labeling pattern in glutamate also changed with butyrate injection, with the result that more of the 14C was located in carbon derived from oxalacetate compared to carbon derived from acetyl-CoA. These results indicate that butyrate metabolism affects gluconeogenesis by sparing pyruvate oxidation, thereby conserving a glucogenic precursor, and, in addition, by enhancing the conversion of pyruvate to oxalacetate."

The 4-valine-oxytocin possesses 140 units per mg of oxytocic activity and 240 units per mg of avian vasodepressor activity. The 1-deamino-4-valine-oxytocin, in which the free amino group on the half-cystine residue in position 1 of 4-valine-oxytocin is replaced by hydrogen, is a highly potent compound, possessing approximately 350 units of oxytocic activity and 800 units of avian vasodepressor activity per mg."

https://openalex.org/W1979434220,"THE specific change in the chromosome complement reported by Gustavsson and Rockborn1 in three cases of overt leukaemia in cattle is extremely interesting, but care should be taken in identifying the chromosome changes with the neoplastic condition. This may not have been the intention of the authors, but it is an important distinction for the following reasons; (1) We have studied the chromosomes in more than twenty cases of lymphosarcoma (lymphatic leukaemia) in cattle, nine of which have been reported2, and in only two cases, one described by us2 and the other by Basrur et al.3, have similar chromosomal changes been observed; namely, an additional submetacentric chromosome and a minute chromosome in place of one of the small acrocentric chromosomes. (2) In the three cases reported by Gustavsson and Rock- born, all the mitoses from the peripheral blood leucocyte cultures showed the same chromosomal change. This would be unusual if the chromosomal change was associated with the neoplasia, because in our experience, even when chromosomal changes occur in the peripheral blood leucocytes of cattle with lymphosarcoma, a number of cells with apparently normal karyotypes are always present in cultures to which phytohaemagglutinin has been added. (3) The finding of the same chromosomal change in cells from the bone marrow and kidney of the foetus of one of the cows and in peripheral blood leucocytes of the three cows would seem to offer further evidence that the chromosomal change was generalized and not confined to the cells of the lymphatic system or associated with the neoplastic condition. Chromosomal analyses of other cells from the cows, for example, bone marrow cells and fibroblasts, in addition to the peripheral blood leucocytes, would have helped to throw light on the significance of the change in the chromosome complement and on the possibility that it may have been inherited."
https://openalex.org/W2078809650,"The amount of DNA isolated from germinal vesicles of Rana pipiens oocytes is similar to that isolated from whole unfertilized eggs, and this suggests that oocyte nuclei are the source of much of the DNA obtained from whole eggs. Fluorometric determinations of the isolated DNA show the presence of 0.004 microgram of DNA equivalents per germinal vesicle. Similar values were obtained by estimations from comparisons of the cesium chloride density-gradient profiles of sample DNA and a known amount of reference DNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The buoyant density of DNA prepared from isolated germinal vesicles is the same as that of frog-liver DNA, 1.706 grams per cubic centimeter, as determined by equilibrium sedimentation in a cesium chloride density gradient."

The protected polypeptide intermediate for this compound, prepared by the stepwise p-nitrophenyl ester method, was converted by the action of sodium in liquid ammonia into the disulfhydryl intermediate from which the analogue was obtained by oxidation with potassium ferricyanide. It was subsequently isolated either by countercurrent distribution or by partition chromatography on Sephadex, and was obtained in crystalline form from an aqueous solution. Deamino-4-decarboxamido-oxytocin possesses approximately ⅖ of the avian vasodepressor activity, ⅙ of the oxytocic activity, and ⅗ of the milk-ejecting activity of oxytocin. These potencies are considerably higher than the corresponding potencies of 4-decarboxamido-oxytocin. The deamino analogue has extremely low antidiuretic activity and no detectable pressor activity."

The role of testosterone in the genetic male rat has been examined by the method of castration during infancy2,3. The findings have shown that deprivation of endogenous testosterone within 3 days of birth is followed by the differentiation of a cyclic female type of hypothalamus as seen by the presence of corpora lutea in ovarian transplants made during adult life. Castration more than 3 days after birth does not prevent the differentiation of the male type of hypothalamus, for ovaries grafted into animals so treated contained no corpora lutea in adulthood. These and other investigations4 raised the possibility that the findings would be different if the transplantation and examination of the ovaries were carried out in the immature animal."
