https://openalex.org/W2033860973,"The uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC proteins of Escherichia coli were purified from strains that greatly overproduce these proteins. Using the purified proteins, the UVRABC nuclease was reconstituted in vitro. The reconstituted enzyme acted specifically on DNA damaged with UV, cis-platinum, and psoralen plus near UV. When UV-irradiated DNA was used as substrate, the enzyme made two cuts on the damaged DNA strand, one on each side of the damaged region. The enzyme hydrolyzed the eighth phosphodiester bond on the 5' side of pyrimidine dimers. On the 3' side of pyrimidine dimers, the UVRABC nuclease cut the fourth or the fifth phosphodiester bond 3' to pyrimidine dimers. The oligonucleotide with the damaged bases that is generated by these two cuts was released during treatment with the enzyme. We have also obtained evidence suggesting that the enzyme acts by the same mechanism on PydC photoproducts which are thought to be of primary importance in UV-induced mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2040960801,"The htpR gene of E. coli encodes a positive regulator of the heat-shock response. We have fused the htpR gene to the inducible PL promoter of phage lambda. Overproduction of HtpR following a temperature upshift resulted in the overexpression of heat-shock proteins. We describe the purification and initial in vitro characterization of the factor controlling expression of heat-shock genes. The factor was the 32 kd htpR gene product. In vitro, a mixture of HtpR and core RNA polymerase initiated transcription at heat-shock promoters. The sigma factor encoded by rpoD was not required for this reaction. Therefore, HtpR is a sigma factor that promotes transcription initiation at heat-shock promoters. We propose that htpR be renamed rpoH and that the gene product be called sigma-32."
https://openalex.org/W2129334025,"We describe a remarkably conserved nucleotide sequence, the many copies of which may occupy up to 1% of the genomes of E. coli and S. typhimurium. This sequence, the REP (repetitive extragenic palindromic) sequence, is about 35 nucleotides long, includes an inverted repeat, and can occur singly or in multiple adjacent copies. A possible role for the REP sequences in regulation of gene expression has been thoroughly investigated. While the REP sequences do not appear to modulate differential gene expression within an operon, they can affect the expression of both upstream and downstream genes to a small extent, probably by affecting the rate of mRNA degradation. Possible roles for the REP sequence in mRNA degradation, chromosome structure, and recombination are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2148881591,"A DNA fragment from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was identified by its homology to a chicken beta-tubulin cDNA and cloned. The fragment was shown to be unique in the yeast genome and to contain the gene for yeast beta-tubulin, since it can complement a benomyl-resistant conditional-lethal mutation. A smaller subfragment, when used to direct integration of a plasmid to the benomyl resistance locus in a diploid cell, disrupted one of the beta-tubulin genes and concomitantly created a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that the single beta-tubulin gene of yeast has an essential function. Determination of the nucleotide sequence reveals extensive amino acid sequence homology (more than 70%) between yeast and chicken brain beta-tubulins."
https://openalex.org/W2094267240,"Using an E. coli expression-vector system we have efficiently produced, purified, and characterized the full-length, nonfused, protooncogenic and oncogenic (T-24) forms of the human H-ras gene product. These purified ras proteins have been introduced by microinjection into a variety of somatic cells in an effort to examine their function. Within several hours after injection of the oncogenic form of the human H-ras protein into quiescent cells, we observe dramatic morphological changes followed by transient proliferation of the cells. In contrast, microinjection of the normal, protooncogenic form of the ras protein at the same level appears to have only little effect on the cells. Additional experiments indicate that the effect of the ras protein requires entry into the cells, is temporary, is inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D, and is seen only in established cell lines. This experimental approach demonstrates that the bacterially derived and purified human H-ras proteins retain their ability to function when put back into mammalian cells and furthermore, provides a novel assay for transformation induced in established cells by the human H-ras oncogene protein."
https://openalex.org/W1586360287,"Isolated human neutrophilic leukocytes were stimulated to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to secrete cytoplasmic granule components including myeloperoxidase into the medium. Myeloperoxidase catalyzed the oxidation of chloride (Cl-) by H2O2 to yield hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which reacted with endogenous nitrogen compounds to yield derivatives containing nitrogen-chlorine (N-Cl) bonds. Compounds available for reaction with HOCl were ammonia (NH+4), taurine, alpha-amino acids, and granule proteins and peptides that were released into the medium. A portion of the N-Cl derivatives formed under these conditions accumulated in the extracellular medium. These long lived oxidizing agents were characterized as hydrophilic, low molecular weight, mono-N-chloramine (RNHCl) derivatives based on their absorption spectrum, ability to oxidize 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid and to chlorinate ammonia (NH+4), and behavior upon ultrafiltration, gel chromatography, and extraction with organic solvents. The RNHCl derivatives were of low toxicity, but reacted with NH+4 to yield the lipophilic oxidizing agent monochloramine (NH2Cl). Therefore, the addition of NH+4 conferred bactericidal, cytotoxic, and cytolytic activities on the RNHCl derivatives. The results indicate that taurine and other neutrophil amines protect neutrophils and other cells against oxidative attack by acting as a trap for HOCl and by competing with endogenous NH+4 for reaction with HOCl. However, the RNHCl derivatives act as a reserve of oxidizing equivalents that is converted to a toxic form when an increase in NH+4 concentration favors formation of NH2Cl."
https://openalex.org/W2051657790,"Maturation-promoting factor (MPF) is a partially purified M-phase-specific activity that induces meiosis in frog oocytes and is detectable in mitotic lysates from cells of wide phylogenetic origins. We show here that without protein synthesis, addition and removal of MPF can drive the mitotic cycle in frog eggs, including nuclear membrane breakdown and reformation, chromosome condensation and decondensation, and suppression and initiation of DNA replication on endogenous DNA and on injected plasmid templates. We have also studied M-phase arrest induced by injection of unfertilized egg cytoplasm and show that this arrest blocks an endogenous cytoplasmic cell-cycle oscillator and causes the stabilization of MPF activity. The oscillator can be restarted by injection of Ca++, which causes chromosome decondensation, reinitiation of DNA replication, and loss of MPF activity. We have looked in more detail at how DNA replication responds to the level of MPF and show that the effects are on the chromatin template and not the replication machinery. These results suggest that in Xenopus embryos cell-cycle events of the nucleus, including DNA replication and mitosis, are controlled by the level of MPF activity, which is driven by or may be part of an autonomous cell-cycle oscillator. The way in which a more complicated somatic cell cycle may arise from the simple embryonic cell cycle is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1622528294,"The sulfonylurea herbicide sulfometuron methyl inhibits the growth of several bacterial species. In the presence of L-valine, sulfometuron methyl inhibits Salmonella typhimurium, this inhibition can be reversed by L-isoleucine. Reversal of growth retardation by L-isoleucine, accumulation of guanosine 5'-diphosphate 3'-diphosphate (magic spot), and relA mutant hypersensitivity suggest sulfometuron methyl interference with branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. Growth inhibition of S. typhimurium is mediated by sulfometuron methyl's inhibition of acetolactate synthase, the first common enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway. Sulfometuron methyl exhibits slow-binding inhibition of acetolactate synthase isozyme II from S. typhimurium with an initial Ki of 660 +/- 60 nM and a final, steady-state Ki of 65 +/- 25 nM. Inhibition of acetolactate synthase by sulfometuron methyl is substantially more rapid (10 times) in the presence of pyruvate with a maximal first-order rate constant for conversion from initial to final steady-state inhibition of 0.25 +/- 0.07 min-1 (minimal half-time of 2.8 min). Mutants of S. typhimurium able to grow in the presence of sulfometuron methyl were obtained. They have acetolactate synthase activity that is insensitive to sulfometuron methyl because of mutations in or near ilvG, the structural gene for acetolactate synthase isozyme II."

https://openalex.org/W2048500913,"The mating type locus with two alleles (MATa and MATα) determines cell type in yeast by activating and repressing sets of cell-type-specific genes. The two genes at MATα, α1 and α2, are transcribed divergently from a central promoter region. Deletions in this intergenic region have been used to map DNA sequences involved in the transcription and regulation of the MATα genes. A single promoter region, essential for transcription of both α1 and α2, is found in the region between α1 and α2. Deletions removing the α1 or α2 TATA box are still transcribed but the transcripts fail to initiate properly. A separate regulatory region is also found between α1 and α2. Deletions of this region lead to the constitutive expression of these genes. These regulatory mutants synthesize α1 mRNA in diploids, but this is not sufficient to activate the α-specific genes."

https://openalex.org/W2128083349,"Accessibility of nascent chains of periplasmic proteins to externally added proteinase K was used as the criterion for translocation of polypeptides across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli during the process of export. It is concluded for maltose-binding protein and ribose-binding protein that nascent chains carrying the signal sequence are not accessible to the proteinase while chains that have been matured span the membrane and are degraded. Translocation of polypeptides is a late event relative to extent of elongation, occurring only after maltosebinding protein has reached molecular weight 33,000 (80% of its entire length) and after ribosebinding protein has been fully elongated (molecular weight 29,000). The data presented here are inconsistent with postulated mechanisms of export requiring a strict coupling of translocation to elongation of nascent polypeptide chains. In contrast, the data support the idea that entire domains of polypeptides are transferred after their synthesis. This is the case whether the translocation of a protein is initiated post-translationally or begins before synthesis of the entire protein is completed."
https://openalex.org/W2069485016,"Scrapie-associated fibrils, first observed in brains of scrapie-infected mice, were also observed in scrapie-infected hamsters and monkeys, in humans with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and in kuru-infected monkeys. These fibrils were not found in a comprehensive series of control brains from humans and animals affected with central nervous system disorders resulting in histopathologies, ultrastructural features, or disease symptoms similar to those of scrapie, kuru, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These fibrils are also found in preclinical scrapie and in the spleens of scrapie-infected mice; they are a specific marker for the ""unconventional"" slow virus diseases, and may be the etiological agent."

Both active human HPRT-protein and chronic HPRT-virus production were detected in hematopoietic tissue of the mice, showing transfer of the gene. These results indicate the possible use of retroviruses for somatic cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1490487466,"The branch point of the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate shunt has been characterized in the intact organism by a multidimensional approach. Theory and methodology have been developed to determine velocities for the net flow of carbon through the major steps in acetate metabolism in Escherichia coli. Rates were assigned based on the 13C NMR spectrum of intracellular glutamate, measured rates of substrate incorporation into end products, the constituent composition of E. coli, and a series of conservation equations which described the system at steady state. The in vivo fluxes through the branch point of the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles were compared to rates calculated from the kinetic constants of the branch point enzymes and the intracellular concentrations of their substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2002044386,"The rpoD gene encoding the sigma subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase is cotranscribed with rpsU and dnaG, encoding ribosomal protein S21 and DNA primase, respectively. After temperature upshift, a heat shock promoter (Phs) located within dnaG is transiently induced, causing increased transcription of rpoD. The extent of induction is sufficient to account for the heat shock response of sigma synthesis. The initiation site of this promoter was located about 360 bp upstream of rpoD by promoter cloning and S1 nuclease mapping. Plasmid deletions generated with Bal 31 nuclease show that the DNA sequence CTGCCACCC in the -44 to -36 region of this promoter is necessary for its heat shock activity. Heat induction of transcription from Phs is under the control of HtpR, a positive regulator of the heat shock response."

https://openalex.org/W2155262441,"Candida yeasts rapidly form peroxisomes of simple function and composition when grown on methanol. Because the induction is both massive and rapid, this system may be useful for a detailed dissection of peroxisomal biogenesis. We report procedures to express peroxisomal proteins in cells and spheroplasts of Candida boidinii to stabilize peroxisomes in a lysate of spheroplasts and to obtain an enriched peroxisomal fraction. With these techniques we have been able to study the assembly of alcohol oxidase, a homo-octomeric flavoprotein, into the organelle in vivo. The primary translation product of alcohol oxidase comigrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the mature subunit. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that the newly synthesized monomer of alcohol oxidase has a half-life of about 20 min in intact cells and 13 min in spheroplasts before conversion to octomer. The monomer first appears in a high speed supernatant of a lysate of spheroplasts and then chases into a purified peroxisomal fraction before or during its octomerization. There is no detectable intermediary organelle involved in this process."

https://openalex.org/W1602075505,"The transport activity of the lactose carrier of Escherichia coli has been reconstituted in proteoliposomes composed of different phospholipids. The maximal activity was observed with the natural E. coli lipid as well as mixtures containing phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylcholine or mixtures of phosphatidylcholine with phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or cardiolipin showed low activity. The lactose carrier reconstituted with amino phospholipids of increasing degrees of methylation (dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, dioleoylmonomethylphosphatidylethanolamine, dioleoyldimethylphosphatidylethanolamine, and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine) revealed a progressive decrease in both counterflow and proton motive force-driven lactose uptake activities. Trinitrophenylation of phosphatidylethanolamine in the E. coli proteoliposomes resulted in a marked reduction in lactose carrier activity. Partial restitution of transport activity was obtained by detergent extraction of the carrier from these inactive proteoliposomes and reconstitution of the carrier into proteoliposomes containing normal E. coli lipid. These results suggest that the amino group of the amino phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine) is required for the full function of the lactose carrier from E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1609122418,"N-linked oligosaccharides have been examined on glycoproteins accumulated in yeast mutants that are blocked at successive stages in the secretory pathway, and in a new mutant, gls1-1, deficient in removal of glucose from N-linked core oligosaccharides, but not blocked in secretion. Oligosaccharides on invertase, a secreted protein, and carboxypeptidase Y, a vacuolar protein, are matured normally in the gls1 mutant but retain three glucoses/carbohydrate chain. The gls1 mutation is recessive and extracts of mutant cells are inactive in release of labeled glucose from core oligosaccharides. The mutant thus lacks glucosidase I activity but could also be deficient in the other core oligosaccharide glucosidase. When transport from the endoplasmic reticulum is blocked in sec18, N-linked oligosaccharides accumulate with a size corresponding to Man8GlcNAc2 when the normal GLS1 allele is present, and Glc3Man8GlcNAc2 in the gls1 mutant. From this we infer that all glucose units are removed prior to glycoprotein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2034060700,"The transforming gene, v-mos, of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (M-MuSV) encodes a 37,000-dalton phosphoprotein, p37mos. Since the biochemical function of this protein is unknown, we have determined the subcellular location of p37mos in M-MuSV 124-transformed cells. Using two different methods of cell lysis and fractionation, we found that newly synthesized as well as mature p37mos is a soluble cytoplasmic protein. In agreement with these results, immunofluorescent staining of cells acutely infected with M-MuSV 124, using an antiserum directed against a synthetic v-mos peptide, produced a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern. Gel filtration experiments and glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis suggest that the bulk of p37mos exists as a monomer and is not involved in a specific association with other cellular proteins. These properties of p37mos are different from those of other characterized retroviral transforming proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1570213855,"The thioredoxin gene (trxA) from Escherichia coli K12 has been cloned on a 3-kilobase pair PvuII fragment in a derivative of pBR325 (pBHK8). Thioredoxin protein production was amplified 150-200-fold in a strain containing pBHK8 (SK3981), with the greatest increase/cell observed after cultures reached stationary phase. A simple purification procedure, involving DEAE and AcA-54 column chromatography, yielded homogeneous protein with approximately 70% yield. The high amplification of thioredoxin in these cells (i.e. 10(6) copies/cell representing 40% of total cell protein) approaches the maximum yields seen in genetically constructed cloning vehicles (Bernard, H.U., and Helinski, D.R. (1980) in Genetic Engineering (Setlow, J. K., and Hollaender, A., eds) Vol. 2, pp. 133-167, Plenum Press, New York). This tremendous overproduction of thioredoxin protein is attributed to the high plasmid copy number observed in SK3981 (1700/cell). These results suggest a role for thioredoxin in plasmid DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1597786818,"A body of previous work has shown that when Escherichia coli tRNAVal1 is placed in the P site of E. coli ribosomes and irradiated, the 5'-anticodon base of this tRNA, 5-carboxymethoxyuridine, is cross-linked to C-1400 of the 16 S rRNA. By tagging the carboxyl group of the cross-linked tRNA residue with a 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) group attached via a 9 A spacer, it has been possible to directly visualize this cross-linking site by immunoelectron microscopy. The DNP group was attached by addition of ethylenediamine to the carboxyl group, followed by condensation of the newly formed free amino group with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of N-2,4-dinitrophenyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid. When reacted with anti-DNP antibody, this modification brings the surface of the antibody to within 9 A of the pyrimidine ring which was cross-linked. Neither codon-dependent binding nor cross-linking were materially affected by the tRNA modification. The tRNA-ribosome adduct formed a stable complex with anti-DNP antibody only when 50-30 S subunit association was prevented. Electron microscopic examination of the immune complexes showed that greater than 95% of those detected had the antibody localized deep in the cleft which separates the head and neck of the 30 S from the large protrusion. Since this is the site of cross-linking of the anticodon of tRNA, we conclude that this region on the 30 S subunit corresponds to the decoding site."
https://openalex.org/W1992408677,"tRNA precursor molecules that contain the CCA sequence found at the 3' termini of all mature tRNAs are cleaved in vitro more readily by M1 RNA, the catalytic subunit of E. coli RNAase P, than precursors that lack this sequence. The sensitivity to the CCA sequence is not apparent when precursors are cleaved by the reconstituted RNAase P holoenzyme that contains both M1 RNA and the protein subunit. These results have been obtained with monomeric precursor molecules encoded by the E. coli and human chromosomes and with three dimeric precursor molecules encoded by the bacteriophage T4 genome. The data are in agreement with previous results concerning T4 tRNA biosynthesis in vivo and show that the CCA sequence is important for the processing of precursors to tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1520607277,"Diaminopimelic acid epimerase was purified from Escherichia coli. The enzyme is a monomer of Mr = 34,000. Diaminopimelic acid epimerase is not a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme: there is no evidence for pyridoxal phosphate in the ultraviolet spectrum of the purified enzyme, and the epimerase is not inactivated by carbonyl reagents such as hydroxylamine and sodium borohydride. Exchange of the alpha-protons of the substrates, DL- and LL-diaminopimelic acid, with solvent accompanies epimerization; and exchange of 3H from solvent into diaminopimelic acid gives 3H primarily (80-90%) in the product isomer, regardless of whether the DL- or LL-isomer is substrate. From these results it is concluded that the epimerase utilizes a two-base mechanism for proton translocation. In these major aspects of its mechanism, diaminopimelic acid epimerase resembles proline racemase. It is argued that the relative values of the isotope fractionation factors for the two proton acceptor sites on the enzyme can be estimated from the isotope effects for the DL- and LL-isomers of diaminopimelic acid. The observed difference in the isotope effects predicts that one, but not both, of the proton acceptor sites is a thiol, and it is demonstrated that diaminopimelic acid epimerase has a single thiol which is necessary for activity and which reacts with iodoacetamide."
https://openalex.org/W2047557186,"Immunofluorescence microscopy shows that cultured skeletal and cardiac muscle cells of chicken embryos exhibit the same stainabilities with antibodies against skeletal and cardiac troponin components as do those in embryos. Muscle cells of each type cultured with motor or sympathetic nerves or in medium containing the nerve extract exhibit the same reactivities as do those in adult animals. Cardiac muscle cells incubated in the nerve-conditioned medium also change the form of troponin components to the adult type. It appears that the differentiation of individual muscle fibers to specific types is induced by nerves, and especially by the neurohumoral effect."
https://openalex.org/W2055067693,"Previous studies have shown that ribosomal protein L4 specifically inhibits the expression of its own operon, the 11-gene S10 operon. To elucidate the mechanism for this regulation, we have examined the effect of protein L4 on transcription of the S10 operon. Hybridization and gel electrophoresis studies indicate that in the presence of excess L4 only RNA molecules about 140 bases long are transcribed from the S10 operon. These short RNA molecules contain the leader, but not structural gene, sequences. Our results suggest that protein L4 stimulates premature termination (attenuation) of transcription about 30 bases upstream from the start of the first structural gene of the S10 operon. The attenuation appears to be independent of the regulation of translation of the operon. We suggest that attenuation of transcription plays a primary role in the autogenous regulation of the S10 operon."
https://openalex.org/W2016970512,"Revertants have been obtained from six mutants of the box9 cluster, which are supposed to be defective in RNA splicing as a result of alterations in a splice signal sequence. This sequence is in the 5' part of intron 4 of the cob gene, 330 to 340 bp downstream from the 5' splice site. Sequencing reveals that reversion to splicing competence is achieved by restoration of the wild-type box9 sequence; by creation of novel box9 sequences; and by introduction of a second site or suppressor mutation (sup-) compensating for the effect of the primary box9- mutation. The sup- mutation alters a sequence in intron 4,293 bp upstream from the box9- primary mutation. The box9 sequence and this upstream sequence can base pair to form an intramolecular hybrid in intron RNA in which box9- and sup- are compensatory base pair exchanges (G----A and C----U, respectively). Thus intramolecular hybrid structures of intron RNA are essential for RNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1492096837,"The binding of crotonase (enoyl-CoA hydratase), beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, beta-ketothiolase, succinyl-CoA transferase, and carnitine acetyltransferase to inner mitochondrial membranes, mitoplasts, intact mitochondria, erythrocyte membranes, and phosphatidylcholine liposomes was studied. Succinyl-CoA transferase does not bind to any of these membranes. Carnitine acetyltransferase, on the other hand, binds to all of these membranes. The enzymes of fatty acid beta-oxidation, thiolase, crotonase, and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bind to inner membrane, but not to liposomes. The binding shows a moderate dependence on ionic strength (2-200 mM) and pH (6.5-8). These data indicate the possibility of an organization of the enzymes of fatty acid beta-oxidation on the inner mitochondrial membrane, but do not support the idea of an organization of the enzymes of ketone body catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1601327546,"During export of the outer membrane lipoprotein across the cytoplasmic membrane, the signal peptide of the lipoprotein undergoes two successive proteolytic attacks, cleavage of the signal peptide by signal peptidase and digestion of the cleaved signal peptide by an enzyme called signal peptide peptidase(s) (Hussain, M., Ichihara, S., and Mizushima, S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5177-5182; Hussain, M., Ozawa, Y., Ichihara, S., and Mizushima, S. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 129, 233-239). Here we report that protease IV, a cytoplasmic membrane protease, exhibits the signal peptide peptidase activity. The signal peptide peptidase activity was cofractionated with protease IV throughout the entire process of purification of the latter enzyme. Only the signal peptide was digested by the peptidase among membrane proteins. Both the signal peptide peptidase activity and the protease IV activity were inhibited to similar degrees by antipain, leupeptin, chymostatin, and elastatinal that are known to inhibit the signal peptide peptidase activity in the cell envelope. From these results we conclude that protease IV is the signal peptide peptidase that is responsible for signal peptide digestion in the cytoplasmic membrane. The peptidase attacked the signal peptide only after its release from the precursor protein."
https://openalex.org/W2052723840,"The transplantation antigens H-2K, H-2D and H-2L are developmentally regulated, highly polymorphic cell surface proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility gene complex (MHC). First detectable on the early embryo, they are subsequently expressed on most somatic cells of the adult mouse in association with the protein beta2-microglobulin (beta 2 M; ref. 5). Cultured F embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells can be induced to differentiate along alternative pathways to form either parietal or visceral9 extra-embryonic endoderm, each concomitant with a change in morphology and pattern of gene expression. Previous reports have demonstrated an increased level of transplantation antigens in differentiated F9 EC cells, but the cell types expressing them were not defined. Here we show that the level of MHC H-2Kb and beta 2 M transcripts is increased during both pathways of this differentiation. Expression of a foreign MHC H-2Kbm1 gene was found to be regulated in a similar manner when the gene was introduced into EC cells. In contrast, an introduced rabbit beta-globin gene was not regulated but expressed constitutively."
https://openalex.org/W1588959431,"Murine B and T lymphocytes each contain a protein kinase activity that catalyzes the phosphorylation of both endogenous and exogenous substrates on tyrosine residues. In B lymphocytes, endogenous substrates of 56,000 and 60,000 daltons are found in the particulate fraction. Peptide mapping experiments indicate that these two substrates are closely related but are distinct from the major 58,000-dalton tyrosine protein kinase substrate found in T lymphocytes. To determine if the same kinase is active in both B and T lymphocytes, their substrate specificities were compared using two exogenously added substrates: angiotensin I and the cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte band 3 protein. LSTRA, a lymphoma cell line that expresses elevated levels of the T lymphocyte kinase (Casnellie, J. E., Harrison, M. L., Hellstrom, K. E., and Krebs, E. G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10738-10742), was used as a source of this enzyme. Kinetic analyses indicate that angiotensin I serves as a better substrate for the LSTRA kinase than for the B cell enzyme. Band 3, however, is preferentially phosphorylated by the B cell kinase. These results indicate that B and T lymphocytes express distinct tyrosine protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W124535975,"Insulin receptor, partially purified from human placenta by chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin, was shown, by means of double probe labeling, to bind only one molecule of insulin with a high affinity. In the double probe labeling protocol used, 125I-insulin (probe 1) was affinity cross-linked to its receptor in the presence of an excess of unlabeled N epsilon B29-biotinylinsulin (probe 2). The ability of succinylavidin to bind to receptor-linked probe 2 and alter the electrophoretic mobility of the cross-linked complex (during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate) was used to determine the amount of receptor which was cross-linked to both probes relative to that which was cross-linked to only probe 1. The fraction of receptor bound to two molecules of insulin prior to cross-linking was estimated from the cross-linking efficiency and the yield of receptor cross-linked to both probes relative to the yield of receptor cross-linked only to probe 1. The low fraction of receptor bound to both probes in the presence of high concentrations of probe 2 indicated that the affinity of the receptor for a second molecule of insulin was approximately 100 times less than that for the first and that in the range of insulin concentrations (less than 20 nM) usually used to determine the stoichiometry for the interaction between receptor and insulin, more than 80% of the receptor molecules should be bound to only one molecule of insulin. This knowledge of how insulin receptor interacts with insulin was shown to be important for proper determination of receptor purity, interpretation of curvilinear Scatchard plots, and interpretation of the insulin-enhanced rate of dissociation of receptor-bound insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1983845176,"Mutations in four nuclear genes, karl cdc4, 28, and 37, block or impair nuclear fusion during conjugation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations in all four genes are recessive for the caryogamy defect; in matings between diploid cells both of which are heterozygous for any one of the four mutations (−/ + × −/+), caryogamy occurs with normal proficiency. However, mutations in all four genes are “nuclear dominant”; that is, both parent nuclei must contribute one wild-type allele of each gene for successful caryogamy. In order to discriminate between two possible models to explain nuclear dominance, we have examined the caryogamy proficiency of mutant nuclei after they had passed through a heterocaryotic cytoplasm. The karl, cdc28, and cdc37 caryogamy defects are all phenotypically suppressed in this experiment (cdc4 could not be tested). We conclude from our results that the KAR1, CDC28, and CDC37 gene products can diffuse between nuclei in a heterocaryon and that they probably perform their function for caryogamy prior to cell fusion. One simple model consistent with the roles of CDC28 and CDC37 in mitosis as well as in caryogamy is that these gene products are structural components of the nucleus that must be built into it during one cell cycle in order to permit successful caryogamy at the next G1."

Since SFFF separations are based on simple physical phenomena related to first principles, molecular weight (or particle sizes) can be determined without calibration standards. SFFF is a gentle technique suited for fractionating biomolecules. Studies with the fragile lambda DNA (molecular weight, 33 X 10(6] and smaller supercoiled plasmids have shown that these materials are not altered during SFFF separation; molecular weights and conformation remain unchanged, and biological activity is not reduced. Recoveries of nucleic acids approach 100 percent. Typically, components with about 20 percent difference in mass can be separated essentially to baseline if required. Fractionation time is usually independent of molecular weight, and separations often can be carried out within an hour."

Polysaccharide antigens of this galactose epimeraseless genetic derivative strain were hot phenol-water extracted from cells grown with (+gal) and without (-gal) galactose. Ultracentrifugation of the aqueous layer from (+gal) cells resulted in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pellet having core-linked S. typhi O-antigen but no core-linked form I antigen; the LPS from (-gal) cells lacked O-antigen. The form I antigen, obtained from the supernatant, was purified by alcohol precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. Unlinked form I and S. typhi O-polysaccharide antigens, both present in the (+gal) supernatant, were further separated by gel filtration. Chemical analyses revealed the 5076-1C form I antigen to be a polymer (Mr = 14,000-20,000) having O-disaccharide repeating units comprised of 2-acetamido-4-amino-2, 4,6-trideoxy-D-galactose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-L-altruronic acid. Unlike parental S. sonnei form I LPS, the 5076-1C form I antigen lacked core lipid A, had low phosphorus content, and migrated in polyacrylamide gels with lower relative mobility. In contrast to current concepts of LPS assembly, these data indicate that 5076-1C form I antigen is transported to the cell surface without covalent linkage to core lipid A, and exists as a polymerized, antigenic surface entity."
https://openalex.org/W201545774,"We have previously shown that Bacillus licheniformis prepenicillinase is modified and processed to form membrane-bound penicillinase in Escherichia coli which contains N-acylglyceride-cysteine27 at the NH2 terminus. In the present study, we have constructed, by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis, two mutant penicillinase genes in which the modification site (the 27th cysteine residue in prepenicillinase) is either converted into serine (penPSer27) or is deleted along with the preceding four residues (Ala23 to Cys27, delta penP2327). The modification, processing, and subcellular localization of these two mutant penicillinases in E. coli cells were studied. Our results indicate that the delta penP2327 deletion mutant prepenicillinase is largely metabolically inert and the unmodified and uncleaved form is associated with the membrane fraction; a small fraction (about 7-9%) appears to contain glyceride-modified prepenicillinase (presumably at the Cys-21 position) which is not cleaved. In contrast, the Cys-27 in equilibrium Ser-27 point mutant prepenicillinase is processed into two forms which contain Asn-29 and Ser-35 at their NH2 termini, respectively, and the bulk of the processed penicillinase appears to be located in the peri-plasm. These results are discussed in terms of the substrate specificities of signal peptidases in E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W1609524818,"The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of either pig heart or Escherichia coli catalyzes a NAD- and CoASH-dependent oxidation of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate which is stereoselective toward the L-isomer of this hydroxyketo acid. L-Malyl-CoA is the product of the reaction; the evidence includes observing (a) a steady increase in absorbance at 230 nm during the oxidation of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, (b) a positive response of oxidation reaction mixtures to neutral hydroxylamine, (c) loss of the two foregoing results concomitant with release of thiol-reacting material and the formation of free malate when reaction mixtures are heated, (d) formation of a hydroxamate which has chromatographic mobilities identical to that of chemically synthesized malate hydroxamate, (e) enzymatic formation of a radioactive product from 14C-labeled 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate which co-migrates with chemically synthesized malyl-CoA, and (f) hydrolysis of the product by citrate synthase, an enzyme absolutely specific for citryl-CoA and L-malyl-CoA. A 1:1:1 stoichiometric relationship exists between the amount of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate oxidized, NAD reduced, and malate (or malyl-CoA) formed. Results from studies in which either 14C-labeled 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, pyruvate, or glyoxylate is incubated with mixtures of purified enzymes or extracts of E. coli support the suggestion that the aldolase which preferentially catalyzes formation of L-2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate from pyruvate plus glyoxylate in E. coli is coupled with the oxidative decarboxylation of this substrate, as reported here, and other enzymes in a multistep pyruvate-catalyzed cyclic oxidation of glyoxylate."
https://openalex.org/W1493720102,"Fusion of phospholipid vesicles with photosynthetic chromatophores from Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides was induced by freezing and thawing. After sucrose density gradient sedimentation, bands containing closed vesicles characterized by different phospholipid to reaction center molar ratios could be isolated and analyzed morphologically and functionally by means of electron microscopy and fast spectroscopy, respectively. Analogously to data reported for phospholipid-enriched mitochondrial inner membranes (Schneider, H., Lemasters, J. J., and Hackenbrock, C. R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10793), the rate of photosynthetic electron transfer in phospholipid-enriched chromatophores decreased with increasing distance between integral membrane complexes. A fast cyclic electron transfer could be restored when the concentration of the ubiquinone pool within the lipid bilayer was reconstituted by additions of exogenous ubiquinone. These results suggest that cyclic electron transfer between reaction center and ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase complexes in phospholipid-enriched chromatophores is limited by the lateral diffusion of the quinone molecules in the membrane plane. The observation that dilution of the quinone pool in the lipid bilayer affects the rate of photosynthetic electron transport contrasts with previously reported data which indicated that up to 80% of the quinone pool can be removed without altering the kinetic parameters of the overall process. These conflicting results can be reconciled by a model which assumes that the relative orientation of the protein complexes, possibly controlled by protein-protein interactions within the lipid bilayer, plays a key role in the effectiveness of the molecular collisions. According to a diffusion-limited mechanism, this would lead to a fast electron transfer during the photosynthetic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1559151621,"Kinetic isotope effects (V/K) were measured with AMP nucleosidases isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii, from a Vmax mutant enzyme of A. vinelandii and from Escherichia coli. Specifically labeled AMP substrates were used to measure 3H secondary and 14C primary kinetic isotope effects on the N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis of AMP in the presence and absence of the allosteric activator, MgATP. Use of the three enzymes, variable MgATP concentration, a poor substrate (dAMP), and variable pH has allowed determination of the isotope effects over a 5000-fold range in the catalytic turnover number. The primary kinetic isotope effects were 1.025 +/- 0.004 and 1.041 +/- 0.006 for the native A. vinelandii enzyme and mutant enzyme, respectively, and were independent of MgATP concentration. The E. coli AMP nucleosidase had a primary isotope effect of 1.019 +/- 0.003 which was also independent of MgATP concentration. The secondary kinetic isotope effect decreased from 1.066 +/- 0.003 to 1.045 +/- 0.002 for the native enzyme from A. vinelandii as the concentration of MgATP increased from 0 to 500 microM. The secondary isotope effect of the mutant enzyme remained constant at 1.088 +/- 0.005 as the MgATP concentration increased from 0 to 500 microM. The secondary isotope effect of the E. coli enzyme showed a similar pattern to that of the native enzyme, decreasing from 1.087 +/- 0.003 to 1.050 +/- 0.003 as the enzyme was saturated with MgATP at a constant concentration of AMP. Saturation with AMP in the absence of MgATP gave similar results and suggested that AMP can cause the allosteric transition. Both the primary and secondary isotope effects for the native enzyme from A. vinelandii remained constant as the pH was varied in the absence of MgATP. Secondary isotope effects with a poor substrate, dAMP, were 1.08 for both the mutant and wild type enzymes from A. vinelandii in the presence of allosteric activator. In the native enzyme, this isotope effect was independent of MgATP concentration. The relative insensitivity in the magnitude of observed isotope effects to pH, allosteric activator, the mutant enzyme, and a poor substrate (dAMP) indicate that intrinsic isotope effects are being expressed. The data are interpreted in terms of a single rate-limiting transition state for hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond, although other mechanisms cannot be eliminated. Using this model, the transition states of the native A. vinelandii and E. coli enzymes exhibit properties of both dissociative and associative mechanisms but become more associative as the allosteric activator becomes saturating.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W2923667469,"Translational initiation factor-3 (IF-3) was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy as a function of pH and temperature and following chemical modifications. Spin-lattice relaxation times for individual resonances and bands were also measured. Several resonances were assigned to different amino acid residues by different criteria. Among these are the CH3-N of the N-terminal methionine which appears free, mobile, and very sensitive to the modification of several physicochemical parameters as well as the 3,5 and 2,6 protons of the three tyrosines (two of which play a role in the function of IF-3) which were found to be located in different magnetic environments. Two of these residues appear to be close to each other and in the vicinity of a slow reacting arginine within the tertiary structure of the factor. The properties and the titration behavior of the imidazole proton resonances suggest that the single His residue is partially buried in the protein structure. Characteristic of the IF-3 spectrum also is the presence of an abundant subset of Arg delta-CH2, Lys epsilon-CH2, and CH3 protons displaying clear cut upfield perturbations. These are probably due to the coming together of two or more apolar fronts which possibly arise from distant parts of the molecule and result in the close proximity between aromatic rings and aliphatic side chains. The IF-3 spectrum also includes several distinct methyl resonances significantly shifted upfield by aromatic ring currents. Overall, the characteristics of the spectrum, its relative insensitivity to temperature and ionic strength, and the existence of extensive cross-relaxation phenomena indicate that IF-3 has a highly folded tertiary structure with abundant hydrophobic regions. In spite of some heterogeneity in the distribution of the side chain environments, no indication was found for the existence of distinct domains or, at least, of extensive regions with higher mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2057372546,"We describe the isolation and characterization of two unusual amber suppressor forms of T4 tRNALeu. The sequences of the suppressor tRNAs can be described as hybrids of wild-type tRNALeu and suppressor tRNAGln molecules: the chain lengths and majority of the nucleotide residues corresponded to tRNALeu, but CUA anticodons flanked by 2-14 residues were identical to tRNAGln. The uncertainty as to the exact number of flanking residues correlated with tRNAGln is due to the similarity of the two tRNA sequences in this region. No evidence was found for changes in other T4 tRNAs. We propose that genes for the hybrid tRNAs were produced by mispairing of DNAs at anticodon segments of tRNALeu and tRNAGln with a double crossover flanking those segments."
https://openalex.org/W1561826091,"The heat of binding of rabbit skeletal myosin subfragment 1 (myosin-S1) and heavy meromyosin (HMM) to F-actin has been measured by batch calorimetry. Proton release measurements in unbuffered solutions indicate that less than 0.1 mol of protons is absorbed or released per mol of myosin head bound to actin. Hence, the measured heats are approximately equal to the enthalpy of myosin-S1 and HMM binding to actin. The enthalpy of binding of myosin-S1 to actin was +22 +/- 3 and +27 +/- 5 kJ/mol of myosin-S1 in two series of experiments at 12 degrees C and +26 +/- 5 kJ/mol of myosin-S1 at 0 degrees C, indicating that delta Cp for this reaction in the range of 0-12 degrees C is small (-80 J/mol/K). The enthalpy of binding of HMM to actin at 12 degrees C was found to be +26 +/- 1 kJ/mol of myosin head. The enthalpies determined here and the equilibrium constants obtained from the literature for measurements at 20 degrees C under identical solvent conditions were used to estimate the entropy of the association of myosin S1 and HMM with F-actin: +235 J/mol/K for myosin-S1 and +190 J/mol of myosin head/K for HMM. Thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of myosin-S1 with actin and ADP or AMP-PNP can be evaluated using the enthalpy of association of myosin-S1 with actin determined here, together with literature values for the equilibrium constants and enthalpies of binding of these nucleotides to myosin-S1. The calculated enthalpies of binding of ADP or AMP-PNP to actomyosin-S1 are small and negative."

Starvation for a required amino acid or treatment with cycloheximide blocks protein synthesis in both parental and mutant strains, while the synthesis of total RNA is inhibited by 72% in A364A and 23% in SY15 cells. In the absence of protein synthesis, the transcription of 37S primary precursor to rRNA is not inhibited in the SY15 mutant, and the rRNA transcripts are correctly processed, although at a reduced rate, and are almost free of ribosomal proteins. The relaxed phenotype in yeast is accompanied by alteration in the regulation of rRNA biosynthesis at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels."
https://openalex.org/W1815197352,"The effect of compactin on hormonally induced lipogenesis and protein synthesis was studied in vitro in explants of mammary gland from mid-pregnant rabbits. Compactin blocks mevalonate synthesis by the specific inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and in this system, culture with 10 microM compactin for 24, 48, and 72 h inhibited incorporation of [1-14C]acetate (but not [2-14C]mevalonate) into sterol by 98, 95, and 86%, respectively. Removal of compactin prior to assay rapidly reversed this effect and was associated with increased tissue 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. Fatty acid synthesis (measured by incorporation of [1-14C]acetate or [4,5-3H]leucine) and protein synthesis (measured by incorporation of [4,5-3H]leucine) were both inhibited by around 50% after culture with compactin. This inhibition was not rapidly reversed by removal of compactin prior to assay, but it was prevented by inclusion of 1 mM mevalonolactone in the culture medium. After removal of compactin and continued culture in its absence for 24 h with hormones, the normal tissue capacity for fatty acid and protein synthesis was restored, indicating no permanent cell damage. The results suggest a specific requirement for mevalonate (or derived products) for the hormonal maintenance of the increased fatty acid and protein synthesis characteristic of the development of the mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W1613842698,"Adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (ATP gamma S) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of Escherichia coli succinyl-CoA synthetase. This inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP and GTP (Ki values of 0.8 and 0.7 microM, respectively) and mixed with respect to CoA and succinate. ATP gamma S previously had been shown to be a weak substrate of the enzyme, probably because of the relatively sluggish reactivity of the thiophosphoryl enzyme intermediate (Wolodko, W. T., Brownie, E. R., O'Connor, M. D., and Bridger, W. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14116-14119). In our work, reaction of thiophosphoryl enzyme with ADP was greatly stimulated by succinyl-CoA, an observation that is consistent with the concept of alternating-sites cooperativity. Thiophosphoryl group release did not appear to be accompanied by other-site phosphorylation, in contrast to ATP stimulation of thiophosphoryl group release in the presence of succinate and CoA (Wolodko et al., see above). In addition, ADP did not appear to be required in the latter reaction."
