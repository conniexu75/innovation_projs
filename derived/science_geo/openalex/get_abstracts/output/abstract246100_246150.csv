https://openalex.org/W2063517113,"“Spintronics,” in which both the spin and charge of electrons are used for logic and memory operations, promises an alternate route to traditional semiconductor electronics. A complete logic architecture can be constructed, which uses planar magnetic wires that are less than a micrometer in width. Logical NOT, logical AND, signal fan-out, and signal cross-over elements each have a simple geometric design, and they can be integrated together into one circuit. An additional element for data input allows information to be written to domain-wall logic circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1975830725,"Atomic force microscopes and optical tweezers are widely used to probe the mechanical properties of individual molecules and molecular interactions, by exerting mechanical forces that induce transitions such as unfolding or dissociation. These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects-features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin. Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin and an RNA three-helix junction. The resultant work distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure."
https://openalex.org/W2146019686,"Colloidal suspensions are widely used to study processes such as melting, freezing and glass transitions. This is because they display the same phase behaviour as atoms or molecules, with the nano- to micrometre size of the colloidal particles making it possible to observe them directly in real space. Another attractive feature is that different types of colloidal interactions, such as long-range repulsive, short-range attractive, hard-sphere-like and dipolar, can be realized and give rise to equilibrium phases. However, spherically symmetric, long-range attractions (that is, ionic interactions) have so far always resulted in irreversible colloidal aggregation. Here we show that the electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged particles can be tuned such that large ionic colloidal crystals form readily, with our theory and simulations confirming the stability of these structures. We find that in contrast to atomic systems, the stoichiometry of our colloidal crystals is not dictated by charge neutrality; this allows us to obtain a remarkable diversity of new binary structures. An external electric field melts the crystals, confirming that the constituent particles are indeed oppositely charged. Colloidal model systems can thus be used to study the phase behaviour of ionic species. We also expect that our approach to controlling opposite-charge interactions will facilitate the production of binary crystals of micrometre-sized particles, which could find use as advanced materials for photonic applications."

https://openalex.org/W2052891002,"The calculation time for the energy of atoms and molecules scales exponentially with system size on a classical computer but polynomially using quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that such algorithms can be applied to problems of chemical interest using modest numbers of quantum bits. Calculations of the water and lithium hydride molecular ground-state energies have been carried out on a quantum computer simulator using a recursive phase-estimation algorithm. The recursive algorithm reduces the number of quantum bits required for the readout register from about 20 to 4. Mappings of the molecular wave function to the quantum bits are described. An adiabatic method for the preparation of a good approximate ground-state wave function is described and demonstrated for a stretched hydrogen molecule. The number of quantum bits required scales linearly with the number of basis functions, and the number of gates required grows polynomially with the number of quantum bits."
https://openalex.org/W2030072508,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are characterized by abnormal protein deposits, often with large amyloid fibrils. However, questions have arisen as to whether such fibrils or smaller subfibrillar oligomers are the prime causes of disease. Abnormal deposits in TSEs are rich in PrP(res), a protease-resistant form of the PrP protein with the ability to convert the normal, protease-sensitive form of the protein (PrP(sen)) into PrP(res) (ref. 3). TSEs can be transmitted between organisms by an enigmatic agent (prion) that contains PrP(res) (refs 4 and 5). To evaluate systematically the relationship between infectivity, converting activity and the size of various PrP(res)-containing aggregates, PrP(res) was partially disaggregated, fractionated by size and analysed by light scattering and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Our analyses revealed that with respect to PrP content, infectivity and converting activity peaked markedly in 17-27-nm (300-600 kDa) particles, whereas these activities were substantially lower in large fibrils and virtually absent in oligomers of < or =5 PrP molecules. These results suggest that non-fibrillar particles, with masses equivalent to 14-28 PrP molecules, are the most efficient initiators of TSE disease."
https://openalex.org/W2045023774,"A previously unknown rigid helical structure of zinc oxide consisting of a superlattice-structured nanobelt was formed spontaneously in a vapor-solid growth process. Starting from a single-crystal stiff nanoribbon dominated by the c -plane polar surfaces, an abrupt structural transformation into the superlattice-structured nanobelt led to the formation of a uniform nanohelix due to a rigid lattice rotation or twisting. The nanohelix was made of two types of alternating and periodically distributed long crystal stripes, which were oriented with their c axes perpendicular to each other. The nanohelix terminated by transforming into a single-crystal nanobelt dominated by nonpolar ( \batchmode \documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amsmath} \pagestyle{empty} \begin{document} \(01{\bar{1}}0\) \end{document} ) surfaces. The nanohelix could be manipulated, and its elastic properties were measured, which suggests possible uses in electromechanically coupled sensors, transducers, and resonators."

The comet's outer layer is composed of 1- to 100-micrometer fine particles with negligible strength (&lt;65 pascals). Local gravitational field and average nucleus density (600 kilograms per cubic meter) are estimated from ejecta fallback. Initial ejecta were hot (&gt;1000 kelvins). A large increase in organic material occurred during and after the event, with smaller changes in carbon dioxide relative to water. On approach, the spacecraft observed frequent natural outbursts, a mean radius of 3.0 Â± 0.1 kilometers, smooth and rough terrain, scarps, and impact craters. A thermal map indicates a surface in equilibrium with sunlight."
https://openalex.org/W2145228467,"The gene Microcephalin (MCPH1) regulates brain size and has evolved under strong positive selection in the human evolutionary lineage. We show that one genetic variant of Microcephalin in modern humans, which arose approximately 37,000 years ago, increased in frequency too rapidly to be compatible with neutral drift. This indicates that it has spread under strong positive selection, although the exact nature of the selection is unknown. The finding that an important brain gene has continued to evolve adaptively in anatomically modern humans suggests the ongoing evolutionary plasticity of the human brain. It also makes Microcephalin an attractive candidate locus for studying the genetics of human variation in brain-related phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2045691818,"As liquids crystallize into solids on cooling, spins in magnets generally form periodic order. However, three decades ago, it was theoretically proposed that spins on a triangular lattice form a liquidlike disordered state at low temperatures. Whether or not a spin liquid is stabilized by geometrical frustration has remained an active point of inquiry ever since. Our thermodynamic and neutron measurements on NiGa 2 S 4 , a rare example of a two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet, demonstrate that geometrical frustration stabilizes a low-temperature spin-disordered state with coherence beyond the two-spin correlation length. Spin liquid formation may be an origin of such behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2062092251,"The gene ASPM ( abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated ) is a specific regulator of brain size, and its evolution in the lineage leading to Homo sapiens was driven by strong positive selection. Here, we show that one genetic variant of ASPM in humans arose merely about 5800 years ago and has since swept to high frequency under strong positive selection. These findings, especially the remarkably young age of the positively selected variant, suggest that the human brain is still undergoing rapid adaptive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2053009244,"Hepatitis C infection causes a state of chronic oxidative stress, which may contribute to fibrosis and carcinogenesis in the liver. Previous studies have shown that expression of the HCV core protein in hepatoma cells depolarized mitochondria and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, but the mechanisms of these effects are unknown. In this study we examined the properties of liver mitochondria from transgenic mice expressing HCV core protein, and from normal liver mitochondria incubated with recombinant core protein. Liver mitochondria from transgenic mice expressing the HCV proteins core, E1 and E2 demonstrated oxidation of the glutathione pool and a decrease in NADPH content. In addition, there was reduced activity of electron transport complex I, and increased ROS production from complex I substrates. There were no abnormalities observed in complex II or complex III function. Incubation of control mitochondria in vitro with recombinant core protein also caused glutathione oxidation, selective complex I inhibition, and increased ROS production. Proteinase K digestion of either transgenic mitochondria or control mitochondria incubated with core protein showed that core protein associates strongly with mitochondria, remains associated with the outer membrane, and is not taken up across the outer membrane. Core protein also increased Ca2+ uptake into isolated mitochondria. These results suggest that interaction of core protein with mitochondria and subsequent oxidation of the glutathione pool and complex I inhibition may be an important cause of the oxidative stress seen in chronic hepatitis C.

Despite this evidence, it is not known whether HCV core protein has a direct functional effect on mitochondria and whether this accounts for its ability to increase ROS. To clarify these questions, we investigated the interaction of HCV core protein with mitochondria in transgenic mice and by direct interaction of recombinant core protein with isolated mitochondria.HCV protein expression caused an increase in mitochondrial ROS production, an oxidation of the mitochondrial glutathione pool, inhibition of electron transport, and an increase in ROS production by mitochondrial electron transport complex I. Direct incubation of isolated mitochondria with HCV core protein resulted in an increase of Ca2+ influx and ROS production and reproduced glutathione oxidation and the reduction in complex I function. These results suggest that direct interaction of core protein with mitochondria is an important cause of the oxidative stress seen in chronic hepatitis C.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration of Transgenic Mice—The transgene, pAlbSVPA-HCV-S, containing the structural genes (core, E1, E2, and p7, nucleotides 342–2771) of hepatitis C virus genotype 1b, strain N, under the control of the murine albumin promoter/enhancer was described in detail by Lerat et al. (26Lerat H. Honda M. Beard M.R. Loesch K. Sun J. Yang Y. Okuda M. Gosert R. Xiao S.Y. Weinman S.A. Lemon S.M. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 352-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This construct was injected into 1-cell F2 zygotes of C57BL/6J × C3H/HeJ mice. Fourteen transgene-positive pups were obtained, out of 121 live births, as screened by polymerase chain reaction, using two pairs of primers spanning the promoter to the core gene for one pair and the E2 gene for the other pair. Positive results were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Each of these transgenic founder mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J. One transgenic line, designated SL-139 was selected for subsequent experiments. Female HCV transgenic mice were used at 5–7 months of age and age matched non transgenic littermates were used as controls. All animal procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Liver samples were collected from transgenic mice of the first backcross (N1) generation, following carbon dioxide euthanasia. RNA was extracted from the liver using TRIzol (Sigma). Contaminating DNA was removed by brief treatment with DNase, which was removed by phenol/chloroform extraction. Reverse transcription was performed using Omniscript (Qiagen, Valencia CA), followed by PCR amplification of the E2 region using RedTaq (Sigma) according to manufacturers' protocols. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels.Determination of Intrahepatic Core Protein Concentration—SL-139 mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and liver protein was extracted in cold RPMI 1640. Quantity of HCV core protein was determined with an HCV core ELISA kit (trak-C™, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ). Briefly, samples were mixed with a pretreatment buffer containing detergents and incubated at 56 °C for 30 min. A set of six standards, supplied by the manufacturer, which contained 100, 50, 15, 5, 1.5, and 0 pg/ml of HCV core antigen, was prepared. Standards, pretreated samples, and controls were transferred to a microwell plate coated with capturing monoclonal antibodies against HCV core protein, and incubated at 25 °C for 60 min. After washing, monoclonal antibody F(ab′)2 fragments conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were added and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. After a final wash step, wells were incubated in the dark with substrate for 30 min. To stop color development, sulfuric acid was added, and absorbance was measured with a microwell plate reader at a wavelength of 490 nm with a reference wavelength of 620 nm. The concentration of HCV core antigen in each sample was determined from the standard curve.Isolation of Mitochondria—Liver mitochondria were isolated by a modification of the method of Johnson and Hardy (27Martin E.J. Racz W.J. Forkert P.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Rolo A.P. Oliveira P.J. Seica R. Santos M.S. Moreno A.J. Palmeira C.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 182: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 29Johonson D. Lardy H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 94-96Crossref Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). In brief, liver (400 mg) was minced on ice and transferred (10% w/v) to isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4). The sample was gently homogenized by 3–4 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer and loose fitting pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was retained, whereas the pellet was washed with isolation buffer and centrifuged again. The combined supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 7800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain a crude mitochondria pellet. The mitochondria pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer (without EGTA and BSA) and centrifuged again at 7800 × g for 10 min. An aliquot was removed for determination of protein concentration by the Bio-Rad assay kit, using bovine serum albumin as the standard.Determination of Glutathione Content—Liver tissue samples (50–75 mg) and mitochondrial samples (2 mg) were sonicated using a Branson Sonifer 450 (VWR Scientific Products, West Chester PA) for 15 s at power setting 3 in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The concentration of reduced GSH was measured by the thioester method using the GSH-400 kit (Oxis International Inc., Portland, OR). Total glutathione content of samples was measured by the glutathione reductase-DTNB recycling assay (30Anderson M.E. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. Part A. 1989: 339-365Google Scholar) using a commercial kit (GSH-412, Oxis International).To measure the effect of recombinant core protein (amino acids 1–179, kindly provided by S. Watowich) on mitochondrial glutathione, freshly isolated mitochondria were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min with or without core protein. Proteins were precipitated and thiols stabilized by subsequent addition of sulfosalicylic acid to a final concentration of 5%. To confirm that decreases in reduced GSH measured by the thioester method were indeed a result of oxidation, parallel mitochondrial samples were either further oxidized by exposure to 0.2 mm tBOOH for 5 min, or reduced by freeze-thaw followed by incubation with glutathione reductase (4.1 units/ml) and NADPH (1 mm) for 5 min at 25 °C. Following reduction, samples were precipitated with sulfosalicylic acid and processed as described. Control experiments showed that this tBOOH treatment fully oxidized the glutathione pool under these conditions and it was used to determine the background value for the assay.NADPH and Glutathione Reductase Measurement—NADPH was measured in isolated mouse liver mitochondria by the method described by Zhang et al. (31Zhang Z. Yu J. Stanton R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial pellets were suspended in 0.1 m Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to remove membrane debris and obtain clear supernatant. Absorbance at 340 nm was determined in untreated supernatants (A1), and after specific oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ with glutathione reductase and GSSG (A2). A1 – A2 represented the amount of NADPH in the sample (31Zhang Z. Yu J. Stanton R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Glutathione reductase (GR) activity was measured as the rate of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm caused by the oxidation of NADPH (GR assay kit, Sigma). A reaction with assay buffer instead of mitochondrial sample was run as a blank.Measurement of Oxygen Consumption—Oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria was measured at 25 °C using a model 782 oxygen meter system and model 1302 Microcathode oxygen electrode (Strathkelvin, Glasgow, UK). Mitochondrial pellet (1–1.5 mg/ml) was added to the 1-ml sample chamber filled with respiration buffer (130 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KH2PO4, 0.05 mm EDTA, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and allowed to equilibrate with magnetic stirring. Complex I-supported state 4 respiration was initiated by addition of 5 mm glutamate and 5 mm malate to the sample chamber. Subsequent addition of 100 nmol of ADP initiated complex I-supported state 3 respiration. After returning to state 4 respiration, maximum oxygen consumption (uncoupled respiration) was measured by adding 5 μm carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP). Similarly, complex II-supported state 3 and 4 respiration was measured using 5 mm succinate.Effects of tBOOH and HCV Core Protein on Mitochondrial Respiration—Isolated hepatic mitochondria were incubated with 100 μm tBOOH and/or 1, 10, or 100 ng of recombinant HCV core protein per mg of mitochondrial protein at 25 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of the mitochondrial suspension were added to the sample chamber for analysis of rates of oxygen consumption. P:O ratio and FCCP-induced consumption rates were calculated as described by Estabrook (32Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1888) Google Scholar).Measurement of Complex I and III Activity—Enzyme activity assays were performed at 25 °C by previously established methods (33Jarreta D. Orus J. Barrientos A. Miro O. Roig E. Heras M. Moraes C.T. Cardellach F. Casademont J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 34Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Submitochondrial particles (SMPs) were prepared from mitochondria by incubation for 3 min at 37 °C followed by sonication in a microcentrifuge tube immersed in ice water. Submitochondrial particles were pelleted at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and 50 μg were used for each assay. In some instances SMPs were reduced by incubation with dithiothreitol (100 μm) for 10 min at 0 °C. Complex I activity (NADH-decylubiquinone oxidoreductase) was measured as the initial (5 min) rate of decrease of A340 using the acceptor 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-n-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DB 80 μm) and 200 μm NADH as the donor in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.24 mm KCN, and 0.4 μm antimycin A. Complex III activity (ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase) was measured at 550 nm using 40 μm oxidized cytochrome c as the acceptor and 80 μm decylubiquinol as the donor in 10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.8), 1 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm EDTA, in the presence of 0.24 mm KCN, 4 μm rotenone, 0.2 mm ATP for 2 min. The addition of 1 μm antimycin A allowed us to distinguish between the reduction of cytochrome c catalyzed by complex III and the nonenzymatic reduction of cytochrome c by the reduced quinine. Extinction coefficients were 6200 liters/mol·cm for NADH and 2.11 × 104 liters/mol·cm for oxidized cytochrome c.Measurement of ROS Production in Mitochondria—Mitochondrial ROS production was determined with the oxidation sensitive fluorogenic precursor dihydrodichlorocarboxyfluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, Molecular Probes) (35Young T.A.

Briefly, each well of a 96-well microtiter plate was filled with respiration buffer containing 1 μm DCFDA and 0.5 mg/ml of mitochondrial particles (final volume, 0.2 ml). The reaction was started by addition of 5 mm glutamate or 5 mm succinate and then incubated at 30 °C in a shaker for 30–60 min. Fluorescence was measured with a CytoFluorII fluorescence plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) at excitation of 485 nm and emission of 530 nm. Some experiments included inhibitors, 5 μm FCCP, 1 μm rotenone, or 10 μm BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes). In some experiments mitochondria from control mice were incubated for 5 min with HCV core protein. For Ca2+-induced ROS production, the mitochondrial suspension was first exposed to 125 μm Ca2+ for 30 min on ice.Measurement of Mitochondrial Ca2+—For Ca2+ determination, mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the mitochondrial Ca2+ indicator Rhod-2 AM (4 μm, Molecular Probes), washed twice in 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm K-Hepes buffer, and diluted to a final concentration of 0.33 mg of protein/ml in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium succinate, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 μm potassium EGTA, 2 μm rotenone, and 1 μg/ml oligomycin, pH 7.2. The mitochondria were exposed to further treatment with or without exogenous HCV core protein (10 ng/mg protein) on ice for 5 min, and FCCP (5 μm) on ice for 30 min as indicated. Mitochondrial suspensions were subsequently exposed to 125 μm Ca2+ containing respiration buffer for 30 min on ice. The red fluorescence of Rhod-2 was measured in 96-well plates in a CytoFluorII fluorescence plate reader at excitation 530 nm and emission 590 nm.Western Blotting—Samples were lysed in 625 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Mitochondria and liver lysates were centrifuged at 7900 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants (30 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse monoclonal antibody to human hepatitis C virus core protein (1:450, Anogen, Mississauga, ON), rabbit polyclonal anti-Tom20 antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (1:2000, R&D System, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), mouse monoclonal IgG anti-complex III core 2 subunit antibody (1:5000, Affinity Molecular Probes, Inc.) or mouse monoclonal antimitochondrial heat shock protein 70 antibody (1:2000, affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO). The membranes were washed, incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, and detected with the ECLplus chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).Assessment of Core Protein Localization by Proteolysis—Isolated mitochondria from transgenic liver were incubated in respiration buffer with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubation, protease activity was inhibited by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 2 μm, followed by incubating on ice for an additional 10 min. Then 10 μg of the mitochondrial suspension was subjected to Western blotting without centrifugation. 1% Triton X-100 was used in some experiments to disrupt the mitochondrial membranes.Statistics—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used for statistical analyses. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSCharacteristics of HCV Transgenic Mice—We developed a new transgenic mouse model to study the effects of viral proteins on native liver mitochondria. Lerat et al. (26Lerat H. Honda M. Beard M.R. Loesch K. Sun J. Yang Y. Okuda M. Gosert R. Xiao S.Y. Weinman S.A. Lemon S.M.

Transgene RNA expression in the liver of this lineage is detectable by RT-PCR, and Northern blot analysis, but protein expression was not detectable by immunoblotting and thus is lower than that typically seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C (36Lau J.Y. Krawczynski K. Negro F. Gonzalez-Peralta R.P. J. Hepatol. 1996; 24: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same construct (Fig. 1A), we derived five transgenic lines that expressed HCV RNA, as demonstrated by RT-PCR, three of which expressed the HCV core protein detectable by immunoblotting. Northern blot analysis shows that these mouse lines produced two HCV-specific RNA transcripts, 3.4 and 4.2 kb (Fig. 1B). The spleen was the only other organ that was positive by RT-PCR, at a relatively reduced level (data not shown). One of the three lines, designated as SL-139 was backcrossed to C57BL/6J, and the offspring were used in all experiments reported here. Core protein concentration determined by ELISA in liver extracts was 0.59 ± 0.23 pg core/μg liver protein (mean ± S.D.).Presence of Core Protein in Transgenic Mitochondria—To test for expression of HCV core protein in the mitochondria, Western blot analysis was performed on crude mitochondria from transgenic and control livers (Fig. 2A). As previously reported, HCV core protein was present in the mitochondrial pellet (9Okuda M. Li K. Beard M.R. Showalter L.A. Scholle F. Lemon S.M. Weinman S.A.

Core protein relative abundance was greater in mitochondria than in whole liver homogenate (Fig. 2A) and comparison to recombinant core (amino acids 1–179) standards suggested that p21 is similar in size to core 1–179. Content of core protein was on the order of 2–5 ng core/mg mitochondrial protein (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2HCV core protein expression in transgenic mouse liver and mitochondria. Immunoblot demonstration of HCV core protein expression in liver mitochondria. CON, control mice; TgM, transgenic mice; L, liver lysate; M, mitochondrial lysate. A, each lane was loaded with 100 μg of either total lysate or mitochondrial protein. Two forms of core protein were detected in transgenic but not control samples. HCV core protein in mitochondria was ∼4-fold more abundant in mitochondria than in liver lysate. B, purified HCV core protein (1–179) was added to control mitochondrial lysate (10 ng or 5 ng/mg mitochondrial protein) and compared with two separate mitochondrial lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Oxidant Status of Transgenic Mitochondria—To determine if SL-139 mice have altered oxidative status of their mitochondria we measured total hepatic and mitochondrial content of reduced (GSH) and total (GSH + GSSG) glutathione. There was no significant difference in whole liver total glutathione between control and transgenic mice (36.6 ± 1.9 versus 32.7 ± 3.4 nmol/mg protein), ∼97% of the whole liver glutathione pool was in the reduced form, and there was no effect of HCV transgene expression on the proportion of reduced versus total glutathione (Fig. 3, A and B). Liver mitochondrial total glutathione was 8.2 ± 1.2 nmol/mg protein in control animals and was not different in transgenic animals (Fig. 3C). However, mitochondrial reduced GSH content was significantly decreased in transgenics (Fig. 3D, p < 0.01) demonstrating a baseline oxidation of the mitochondrial glutathione pool in these animals.FIGURE 3Glutathione content in HCV transgenic mouse liver. Glutathione content was measured in freshly isolated whole liver homogenate (A and B) or mitochondrial fractions (C and D) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) was expressed as GSH equivalents (A and C). Reduced glutathione (GSH only) is shown in B and D. Values in transgenic liver samples were compare"
https://openalex.org/W2168755153,"We report a 2000-year Antarctic ice-core record of stable carbon isotope measurements in atmospheric methane (δ 13 CH 4 ). Large δ 13 CH 4 variations indicate that the methane budget varied unexpectedly during the late preindustrial Holocene (circa 0 to 1700 A.D.). During the first thousand years (0 to 1000 A.D.), δ 13 CH 4 was at least 2 per mil enriched compared to expected values, and during the following 700 years, an about 2 per mil depletion occurred. Our modeled methane source partitioning implies that biomass burning emissions were high from 0 to 1000 A.D. but reduced by almost ∼40% over the next 700 years. We suggest that both human activities and natural climate change influenced preindustrial biomass burning emissions and that these emissions have been previously understated in late preindustrial Holocene methane budget research."

https://openalex.org/W2005624911,"Magnetotelluric and seismic data, collected during the MELT experiment at the southern East Pacific Rise1,2, constrain the distribution of melt beneath this mid-ocean-ridge spreading centre and also the evolution of the oceanic lithosphere during its early cooling history. Here we focus on structures imaged at distances ∼100 to 350 km east of the ridge crest, corresponding to seafloor ages of ∼1.3 to 4.5 million years (Myr), where the seismic and electrical conductivity structure is nearly constant and independent of age. Beginning at a depth of about 60 km, we image a large increase in electrical conductivity and a change from isotropic to transversely anisotropic electrical structure, with higher conductivity in the direction of fast propagation for seismic waves. Conductive cooling models predict structure that increases in depth with age, extending to about 30 km at 4.5 Myr ago. We infer, however, that the structure of young oceanic plates is instead controlled by a decrease in water content above a depth of 60 km induced by the melting process beneath the spreading centre3."

However, the nature of thiol-dependent regulation has not been established. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a dithiol/disulfide oxidoreductase chaperone of the thioredoxin superfamily involved in protein processing and translocation. We postulated that PDI regulates NAD(P)H oxidase activity of rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Western blotting confirmed robust PDI expression and shift to membrane fraction after incubation with angiotensin II (AII, 100 nm, 6 h). In VSMC membrane fraction, PDI antagonism with bacitracin, scrambled RNase, or neutralizing antibody led to 26-83% inhibition (p < 0.05) of oxidase activity. AII incubation led to significant increase in oxidase activity, accompanied by a 6-fold increase in PDI refolding isomerase activity. AII-induced NAD(P)H oxidase activation was inhibited by 57-71% with antisense oligonucleotide against PDI (PDIasODN). Dihydroethidium fluorescence showed decreased superoxide generation due to PDIasODN. Confocal microscopy showed co-localization between PDI and the oxidase subunits p22phox, Nox1, and Nox4.

Most studies (reviewed in Refs. 3Lassègue B. Clempus R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R277-R297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and 4Brandes R.P. Kreuzer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) have focused on issues related to subunit structure, undermining other aspects. We have previously shown that specific thiol oxidants/alkylators inhibit vascular NAD(P)H oxidase activity in a way that does not correlate with their induced decrease in intracellular glutathione levels (5Janiszewski M. Pedro M.A. Scheffer R.C.H. van Asseldonk J.-T. H. Souza L.C. da Luz P.L. Augusto O. Laurindo F.R. M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence further suggests that oxidase activity is redox-regulated (4Brandes R.P. Kreuzer J. Cardiovasc.

These data point to the existence of yet unidentified redox-sensitive domains such as reactive thiol groups within the oxidase complex milieu. Accordingly, although thiols are key redox-signaling effectors, kinetics of spontaneous thioldisulfide exchange, based solely on cell redox status, may be too slow to account for efficient target enzyme regulation (8Arrigo A.-P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 9Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A.

Biol. 1999; 10: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In turn, thiol oxidoreductases catalyze thiol reactions up to 104 times faster and may therefore have an important signaling role, as shown, e.g. for the reductase thioredoxin (8Arrigo A.-P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 11Yamawaki H. Haendeler J. Berk B. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that thiol oxidoreductases act as regulators of vascular NAD(P)H oxidase. We focused into the thioredoxin superfamily enzyme protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), given its abundance, multiple biological effects, versatile redox behavior, and known interaction with other proteins (10Noiva R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Biochim. Biophys.

PDI is mainly located at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, where it assists in redox protein folding, which involves both oxidation and multiple intramolecular thiol-disulfide exchanges, i.e. isomerase, activities. Such properties stem from its structural configuration, which consists of five modules ordered as a-b-b′-a′-c, in which a is a thioredoxin domain bearing the redox-active WCGHCK motif, b a thioredoxin structural fold without the redox motif, possibly related to peptide recognition (12Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 13Clissold P.M. Bicknell R.

Several PDI analogues have been described, indicating that PDI is part of a larger protein family variably displaying thiol oxidoreductase, chaperone, and isomerase properties (8Arrigo A.-P.

Despite bearing the C-terminal ER retention sequence KDEL, PDI displays active intracellular traffic to the cell surface, where it likely acts as a reductase due to the high local reducing potential (10Noiva R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Biochim. Biophys.

In particular, PDI is a major catalyst of trans-nitrosation reactions mediating nitric oxide internalization from extracellular S-nitrosothiols (21Zai A. Rudd M.A. Scribner A.W. Loscalzo J. J. Clin.

In the present study, we addressed the hypothesis that PDI interacts functionally and spatially with vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) NAD(P)H oxidase and that such interaction affects redox-dependent consequences of AII exposure.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Membrane Fraction Preparation—Rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from a previously established selection-immortalized line (23Buonassissi V.

Membrane homogenates were prepared as described previously (24Laurindo F.R.M. Souza H.P. Pedro M.P. Janiszewski M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 432-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was assessed by Bradford method. NADPH oxidase activity was assessed as described before (24Laurindo F.R.M. Souza H.P. Pedro M.P. Janiszewski M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 432-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Antisense Oligonucleotides—Confluent (∼80%) VSMCs were transfected with PDI antisense (PDIasODN) or a scrambled control (ScrODN) oligonucleotide as described (21Zai A. Rudd M.A. Scribner A.W. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Antisense (5′-GGAGCGAGACTCCGAACAACACGGTA-3′) and ScrODNs (5′-GATGGCACAAGCCTCAGAGCGACGG-3′) were from Sequitur, Inc. VSMCs were incubated with 20 nm ODN in SuperFect™ (reagent (Qiagen, 1:50, v/v) in fetal bovine serum-containing culture medium. Transfection dynamics was monitored with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled ODN. After a 4-h incubation, cells were gently washed and maintained in F-12 medium.Fusion Nox-GFP Constructs—Determination of a putative direct PDI interaction with Nox1 or Nox4 is complicated by their low expression levels and by lack of good specific antibodies. To ameliorate these problems, we used plasmid constructs coding for fusion proteins of Nox subunits with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), a variant of green fluorescent protein, transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection). This strategy allows direct observation of tagged proteins and their detection through anti-GFP antibody (from Roche Applied Science). Details of this procedure and several validation experiments were described previously (25Ambasta R.K. Kumar P. Griendling K.K. Schmidt H.H. Busse R. Brandes R.P. J. Biol.

Briefly, plasmids coding for full-length Nox1, Nox4, or Nox2 were tagged with YFP at the C-terminal end and transfected into HEK293 cells (10 μg of plasmid DNA for 10-cm culture dishes at ∼90% confluence) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed 24 h after transfection.PDI Inhibitors—Known PDI inhibitors used in our study at previously validated concentrations were bacitracin (500 μm), scbRNase (RNase with scrambled disulfide bonds, 100 μg/ml, from Sigma), a competitive substrate, or the neutralizing monoclonal PDI antibody RL90 (1:100, Affinity Bioreagents) (26Orlandi P.A.

Enzyme activity was started by 300 μm NAD(P)H in the absence or presence of PDI inhibitors. Incubation medium was then transferred to a flat quartz cell, and spectra were cumulatively recorded (8 scans) at room temperature using a Bruker EMX 300 spectrometer with conditions: microwave power, 40 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; time constant, 200 ms; scan rate, 0.1 G/s; gain, 3.2 × 106. DMPO-OH spin adduct was quantified assessing the central peak height as a linear function of a standard (38 μm) concentration of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (Tempol).Superoxide Measurement in Intact VSMCs—Confluent (∼80%) VSMCs grown on glass slides were transfected with PDIasODN or ScrODN as described above. Control or AII-stimulated cells (100 nm for 6 h) were incubated with dihydroethidium (DHE, 5 μm) for 30 min at room temperature and imaged by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200, Zeiss), with exposure intensity adjusted relative to baseline VSMCs (30Miller Jr., F.J.

RNA hydrolysis rate was monitored spectrophotometrically (GeneQuantPro™) at 260 nm. Bovine liver PDI (Sigma) was used as positive control.Confocal Microscopy—Confluent (∼70%) VSMCs were grown on collagen-coated glass slides, transfected or not with PDIasODN or ScrODNs as described above, and incubated in the absence or presence of AII (100 nm, 12 h). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde solution (4%), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated overnight with antibody against PDI (1:250, Affinity Bioreagents), p22phox (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Nox4 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Nox1 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunodetection was performed with Alexa Fluor (1:250, Invitrogen)-, Rhodamine-, or fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)-conjugated secondary antibodies and co-localization studies were carried out using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope LSM 510 META in multitracking mode.Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Cells were lysed in Nonidet lysis buffer containing Tris/HCl (pH 7.4, 20 mm), NaCl (150 mm), Na4P2O7 (10 mm), okadaic acid (10 nm), Na3VO4 (2 mm), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (44 μg/ml), and Nonidet, P40 (1% v/v), left on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000g/10 min. Protein concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/μl, and immunoprecipitation (IP) was carried out by using 500 μg of homogenate protein. Following preclearing with protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), in the absence or presence of nonspecific IgG, proteins were precipitated using an anti-PDI antibody (1.2 μg, for VSMCs, mouse monoclonal from Affinity Bioreagents RL90; for HEK293 cells, rabbit polyclonal, Stressgen). Pre-clearings and post-IP supernatants were loaded on separate gels to confirm specificity of the bands in the immunoprecipitation and to ascertain identical amounts of protein in the IP. Immunoprecipitates were heated (95 °C, 10 min), run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then blotted onto nitrocellulose. Proteins were detected with following antibodies: Nox1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Nox4 (rabbit polyclonal antibody 4014, kindly provided by Prof. Dr. J. Pfeilschifter, Klinikum der J. W. Goethe Universität, Frankfurt), and p22phox (mouse monoclonal antibody 449, kindly provided by Dr. D. Roos, Sanquin Research at CLB, Amsterdam University). Blots were revealed by chemiluminescence.Akt Phosphorylation—VSMCs (∼80% confluence) transfected with PDIasODN or ScrODNs as described were maintained in fetal bovine serum-containing medium for 12 h, made quiescent by further incubation in F-12 medium with 0.1% calf serum for 12 h, and then stimulated with AII at 37 °C in serum-free F-12 for 2-30 min (33Ushio-Fukai M.

VSMCs were trypsin-lysed in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The homogenate was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and Akt phosphorylation was assessed with monoclonal phospho-Akt (Ser-473) or total Akt antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000). Densitometry was performed with Scion Image Program.Statistical Analysis—Data are mean ± S.E. Comparisons among groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance plus Student-Newman-Keuls test, at 0.05 significance level.RESULTSPDI Expression in VSMCs—Western blotting analysis showed robust PDI expression in VSMCs visualized as a 55-kDda band. VSMC incubation with AII (100 nm, 6 h) did not alter total PDI expression. However, AII led to a significant shift in PDI location toward the membrane fraction (Fig. 1).PDI Inhibition in VSMCs Membrane Fraction Decreases NAD(P)H Oxidase Activity—To assess functional dependence of NAD(P)H oxidase activity on PDI, NADPH-driven superoxide generation was assessed by EPR spectroscopy in VSMC membrane fraction incubated after its separation with known PDI inhibitors (Fig. 2). Membrane fraction alone produced no detectable signals. With NADPH, there was formation of the typical 1:2:2:1 DMPO-OH signal with splitting constants aN = 1.49 mT and aH = 1.49 mT. Adduct yields were inhibited with (polyethylene glycol) superoxide dismutase by 63%. Superoxide levels were estimated as 125.0 ± 16.8 nmol/mg of protein (34Souza H.P. Liu X. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Laurindo F.R.M. Zweier J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H466-H474Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Importantly, NADPH oxidase activity was significantly dependent on PDI, as shown by 51-83% decrease in adduct signals after homogenate incubation with bacitracin, a pharmacological antagonist of PDI oxidoreductase activity (26Orlandi P.A.

Transfection efficiency was confirmed by average 32% decrease in PDI protein expression at Western analysis (not shown), diminished PDI RNase refolding activity (Fig. 4) and lower PDI fluorescent immunodetection (Fig. 5). Marked cellular effects due to similar rates of PDI protein decrease with antisense ODNs were reported previously (15Jiang X.M. Fitzgerald M. Grant C.M. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). PDIasODN did not decrease p22phox expression (Fig. 5).FIGURE 4Marked increase in PDI refolding isomerase activity in VSMCs membrane fraction after exposure to AII. Absorbance decay at basal level was 1.00 ± 0.13 × 10-3 units/min-1. Baseline and particularly AII-stimulated PDI activity were inhibited by bacitracin or PDIasODN, but not ScrODN. VSMCs were preincubated with Scr or PDIasODN (see “Materials and Methods”) and then stimulated with AII for 6 h (n = 6; *, p < 0.05 versus respective baseline; #, p < 0.05 versus ScrODN-transfected VSMCs).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Representative confocal laser scanning microscopy images of VSMCs incubated in the absence (A, C, and E) or presence (B and D) of 100 nm AII for 12 h.

In contrast, PDIasODN markedly impaired oxidase activity in the same conditions by an average 71% both at baseline and after AII (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, as seen in Fig. 3B, DHE-derived fluorescent signals were increased by AII in control VSMCs or after ScrODN transfection. Such increase was completely inhibited by (polyethylene glycol) superoxide dismutase (25 units/ml, not shown). PDIasODN transfection markedly inhibited AII-induced superoxide production in VSMCs.FIGURE 3A, inhibitory effects of PDIasODN transfection in baseline or AII-stimulated NAD(P)H oxidase activity measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence (n = 4; *, p < 0. 05 versus baseline; #, p < 0.05 versus ScrODN-transfected VSMCs).

https://openalex.org/W2145682260,"On 4 July 2005, many observatories around the world and in space observed the collision of Deep Impact with comet 9P/Tempel 1 or its aftermath. This was an unprecedented coordinated observational campaign. These data show that (i) there was new material after impact that was compositionally different from that seen before impact; (ii) the ratio of dust mass to gas mass in the ejecta was much larger than before impact; (iii) the new activity did not last more than a few days, and by 9 July the comet's behavior was indistinguishable from its pre-impact behavior; and (iv) there were interesting transient phenomena that may be correlated with cratering physics."

Deletion of TRPM7 in DT40 B-lymphocytes causes growth arrest, Mg2+ deficiency, and cell death within 24–48 h. Amazingly, in analogy to TRPM6-deficient patients who can live a normal life if provided with a Mg2+-rich diet, TRPM7-deficient DT40 B-lymphocytes show wild type cell growth if supplied with 5–10 mm Mg2+ concentrations in their extracellular medium. Here we have investigated the functional relationship between TRPM6 and TRPM7. We show that TRPM7 deficiency in DT40 cells cannot be complemented by heterologously expressed TRPM6. Nevertheless, both channels can influence each other's biological activity. Our data demonstrate that TRPM6 requires TRPM7 for surface expression in HEK-293 cells and also that TRPM6 is capable of cross-phosphorylating TRPM7 as assessed using a phosphothreonine-specific antibody but not vice versa. TRPM6 and TRPM7 coexpression studies in DT40 B-cells indicate that TRPM6 can modulate TRPM7 function. In conclusion, although TRPM6 and TRPM7 are closely related and deficiency in either one of these molecules severely affects Mg2+ homeostasis regulation, TRPM6 and TRPM7 do not appear to be functionally redundant but rather two unique and essential components of vertebrate ion homeostasis regulation.

Both channels show the unique functional duality of being ion channels and kinases, since they include an active Thr/Ser kinase at their C terminus, which belongs to the atypical family of eukaryotic α-kinases (11Ryazanov A.G.

Genomic studies revealed the existence of six α-kinases in mammals, including TRPM6 and TRPM7. These kinases show no sequence homology to conventional protein kinases. Structural analyses of the TRPM7 kinase domain revealed similarities to the fold of protein kinase A family members (13Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol.

The life-long oral administration of high doses of magnesium is sufficient to ensure a complete relief of the clinical symptoms. Although the pathophysiology of HSH is largely unknown, several studies indicate a primary defect in intestinal Mg2+ transport (17Milla P.J. Aggett P.J. Wolff O.H. Harries J.T.

Recent biophysical analyses by one group have shown striking parallels between gating mechanisms and ion selectivity profiles of TRPM6 and TRPM7, since TRPM6 was shown to be regulated by intracellular Mg2+ levels and to be permeable for Mg2+ and Ca2+ (19Voets T.

In contrast, another group using imaging approaches reports that TRPM6 is only present at the cell surface when associating with TRPM7, leading to increased Mn2+ entry as assessed by fura-2 fluorescence quenching measurements (20Chubanov V.

The authors conclude that TRPM7 channel function is dissociated from its kinase activity (24Matsushita M. Kozak J.A. Shimizu Y. McLachlin D.T. Yamaguchi H. Wei F.Y. Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Chait B.T.

In contrast, we found previously that mutations affecting TRPM7 phosphotransferase activity also impact channel function by modulating its dose-response curve to intracellular Mg2+ and MgATP (22Schmitz C.

Another recent study identified annexin 1 as an endogenous substrate of TRPM7 kinase (26Dorovkov M.V. Ryazanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50643-50646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The biological role of annexin 1 phosphorylation via TRPM7 is currently unknown, but this is the first indication that TRPM7 can influence cellular processes by modulating the activity of proteins that are substrates of its kinase domain. Deletion of TRPM7 in chicken DT40 B-lymphocytes is lethal, a rarely observed phenotype in ion channel knock-out models. Both the viability and the proliferation of TRPM7 deficient B-cells are rescued by supplementing the extracellular growth medium with 5–10 mm Mg2+ concentrations, in analogy to TRPM6-deficient patients who live a normal life if provided with a Mg2+-rich diet, linking TRPM7 and Mg2+ to cell proliferation and cell death. Another recent report indicates that TRPM7 is involved in anoxic neuronal death (27Aarts M. Iihara K. Wei W.L. Xiong Z.G. Arundine M. Cerwinski W. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Cell. 2003; 115: 863-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In this study, we document that TRPM6 and TRPM7 are not functionally redundant, since TRPM7 deficiency in DT40 cells cannot be complemented by heterologously expressed TRPM6. This is analogous to TRPM6 patients for whom TRPM7 is not able to complement for TRPM6 deficiency, despite the ubiquitous expression pattern of TRPM7. We show that TRPM6 and TRPM7 can influence each other's biological activity. TRPM6 and TRPM7 can be efficiently co-immunoprecipitated, and TRPM6 requires TRPM7 for surface expression. Using a phosphothreonine-specific antibody, we have found that TRPM6 can phosphorylate TRPM7, but not vice versa. Coexpression studies of TRPM6 and TRPM7 in DT40 cells indicate that TRPM6 might modulate TRPM7 function in a Mg2+-dependent manner. Molecular Biology—Human TRPM7 WT and TRPM7Δkinase cDNA cloning and the establishing of stable inducible expression of the corresponding proteins in HEK-293 T-Rex cells (Invitrogen) have been previously described (22Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). For generation of TRPM6 WT (GenBank™ accession number NM_017662; cDNA was kindly provided by Bernd Nilius and colleagues), TRPM6 K1804R and TRPM6Δkinase (stop codon amino acid position 1735) expression constructs, TRPM6, and TRPM6 mutants were cloned into the pcDNA5/TO-FLAG plasmid, allowing the doxycycline-inducible expression of N-terminally FLAG-tagged channels. The TRPM6-KR mutant (K1804R) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™; Stratagene) following the standard protocol. pcDNA5TO plasmids encoding TRPM6 WT and mutant channels were transfected into HEK-293 cell lines with stable expression of TRPM7 WT and TRPM7Δkinase. TRPM6 WT was also transfected into HEK-293 T-Rex WT cells, in order to generate a cell line overexpressing TRPM6 alone. The predicted DNA sequences of all constructs were verified by sequencing. Immunoblotting— 0.5–1 × 107 HEK-293 cells with inducible expression of the indicated channels were plated, and expression was induced by adding doxycycline for 24–48 h. Anti-FLAG or anti-HA (Sigma) immunoprecipitations were performed from lysates (the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (10 nm; Cell Signaling) was added to the lysis buffer for phosphorylation experiments) of 107 HEK-293 cells. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE using 6% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by anti-FLAG, anti-HA, or anti-Thr(P) (Cell Signaling) immunoblotting. Blots were sometimes reprobed after stripping. Several different Ser(P) antibodies were also tested (Clontech, Sigma, and Cell Signaling) but without success. For surface labeling experiments, intact cells were incubated with biotin (Pierce). After inactivation of residual biotinylation reagent, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were washed extensively and analyzed by Western blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays of hTRPM6 and hTRPM7 Channels— For in vitro assays, hTRPM6 or hTRPM7 WT and mutant channels were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG- or anti-HA-coated beads. The beads were incubated in a total volume of 40 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1 (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10 nm calyculin A, 100 μm Mg-ATP, and containing varying MgAc concentrations). Phosphorylation was analyzed by anti-Thr(P) immunoblotting. Cell Culture—The transiently or stably transfected HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and blasticidin S (5 μg/ml; InvivoGen) to maintain the pcDNA6TR plasmid allowing stable expression of the Tet repressor. Zeocin (400 μg/ml; Invitrogen) was added for HEK-293 cell lines transfected with pcDNA4TO constructs and hygromycin (100 μg/ml; Calbiochem) when pcDNA5TO constructs were used. Protein overexpression was induced by adding doxycycline (100–1000 ng/ml) to the growth medium. The TRPM7-deficient DT40 cell line complemented with stable overexpression of WT TRPM7 (cWT TRPM7, also cWT M7), and mutant channels in an inducible fashion has been described previously (22Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). These cell lines (TRPM7-/- DT40 and cWT TRPM7) were cultured in chemically defined medium + 10 mm MgCl2 for normal cell maintenance and generation of TRPM6-expressing TRPM7-/- DT40 cells. To perform Mg2+ measurements and growth curves, serum- and Mg2+-free medium was used as indicated (chemically defined HyQ CCM1 and customized Mg2+-free HyQ CCM1 media were purchased from Hyclone and supplemented with 1% chicken serum (Sigma)). The TRPM7-/- DT40 cell line and a TRPM7-deficient cell line complemented with hTRPM7 WT were transfected with the same pcDNA5/TO construct encoding FLAG-tagged TRPM6 WT as the one used for transfection of HEK-293 cells. Two cell clones with relatively matched inducible TRPM6 expression as assessed by anti-FLAG immunoblotting were chosen for further analysis. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—For in vitro assays, hTRPM6 or hTRPM7 WT and mutant channels were immunoprecipated with anti-FLAG- or anti-HA-coupled beads. The beads were incubated in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm MnCl2, 100 μm ATP, 20 μCi [γ-33P]ATP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol). The total volume of the reaction was 50 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, Laemmli buffer was added, and the samples were boiled. The samples were separated by 6 or 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.) by semidry transfer. The portion of membrane with phosphoprotein was excised and incubated in 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 1.5 h. After incubation, the samples were dried with a Speedvac evaporator, and the dried material was dissolved in water. Nonradioactive phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were added to the samples. Phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on thin layer cellulose plates 10 × 10 cm (cellulose on glass; Merck). The first dimension was performed in pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer containing 0.58 m formic acid and 1.36 m acetic acid at 1000 V for 20 min. The second dimension was performed in pH 3.5 electrophoresis buffer containing 0.87 m acetic acid, 0.5% (v/v) pyridine, and 0.5 mm EDTA at 1000 V for 8 min. The TLC plates were stained with 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol and then exposed to film. Mg2+ Measurements—Cytosolic [Mg2+] was monitored in a cuvette-based assay by detecting changes in Mag-fura fluorescence using the QM-6/2003 fluorometer from PTI (Photon Technology International). Standard labeling protocols were used (on the World Wide Web, see probes.invitrogen.com). Briefly, cells were plated for 18–24 h prior to analysis and either left untreated or treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline in chemically defined medium supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 and 1% chicken serum or in the same medium without MgCl2. The cells were then loaded with Mag-Fura (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C in Mg2+-free buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), washed, and measured by exposure every 2 s to 340/380-nm excitation accompanied by monitoring 510-nm emission light for the period of time. The ionophore 4-bromo-A-23187 (1 mm final concentration; Sigma) and MgCl2 (10 mm final concentration) were added directly into the cuvette as indicated. Analysis of TRPM6/TRPM7 Association and Cell Surface Expression—TRPM6 and its closest relative TRPM7 are the only known channel kinases. Both have been linked to Mg2+ homeostasis regulation in vertebrates. In analogy to other ion channel families with a similar membrane topology (voltage-gated K+channels, cyclic nucleotide gated channels), the pore of TRP channels is thought to be formed by tetramerization. Since other members of the TRP family are known to heteroassociate, we analyzed the interaction between human FLAG-tagged TRPM6 and HA-tagged TRPM7 proteins by co-immunoprecipitation. To this aim, we generated HEK-293 cell lines with stable, doxycycline-inducible co-expression of these N-terminally tagged versions of TRPM6 and TRPM7. To ensure that FLAG-TRPM6 was not nonspecifically precipitated using the anti-HA antibody, we generated a stable HEK-293 cell line inducibly expressing FLAG-TRPM6 alone (Fig. 1A). No FLAG-reactive band could be seen on Western blots when immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (Fig. 1B, top panel, middle section). In contrast, in the presence of HA-TRPM7, FLAG TRPM6 can clearly be detected using the same conditions (Fig. 1B, top panel, left section). Conversely, HA-TRPM7 could be co-immunoprecipitated when using anti-FLAG beads recognizing FLAG-TRPM6 (Fig. 1B, bottom panel, right section). We therefore concluded that TRPM6 and TRPM7 can associate and probably form heteromeric channels. Since TRPM7 has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed, as opposed to TRPM6, which appears to be predominantly expressed in the kidney and intestine, we investigated the possibility that the association between TRPM7 and TRPM6 might influence surface expression levels of TRPM6. To experimentally assess this hypothesis, we surface-labeled intact FLAG-TRPM6-expressing cells, as well as cells co-expressing FLAG-TRPM6/HA-TRPM7 with biotin. After lysing the cells in both labeling reactions, we immunoprecipitated TRPM6 using anti-FLAG-coated beads. The samples were subsequently analyzed by Western blot, first by developing with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase to visualize protein surface expression and, following a stripping step, with FLAG antibody to assess total levels of FLAG-TRPM6 (Fig. 1C). Although the FLAG-TRPM6 expression level is substantially higher in the “TRPM6 alone” cells, the corresponding streptavidin signal is very low and is probably the result of a small proportion of the cells being already disrupted during the labeling process. On the other hand, biotinylation of TRPM6 was much more efficient when co-expressed with TRPM7 (Fig. 1C, top left) and is labeled to the same extent as a band with a slightly smaller molecular weight. This band probably corresponds to co-precipitated, surface-expressed TRPM7 proteins. This observation suggests that TRPM7 promotes the trafficking of associated TRPM6 subunits to the cell surface. Effects of TRPM6 Overexpression on Cell Growth and on Mg2+ Homeostasis in TRPM7-deficient DT40 B-cells—TRPM7 deficiency is lethal in the avian DT40 B-cell line, unless the growth medium is supplemented with millimolar amounts of Mg2+. Remarkably, human patients suffering from the recessive hereditary disease HSH experience debilitating seizures, leading to death in the first year of age, unless their nutrition is supplemented with Mg2+. These patients have been shown to bear mutations in the TRPM6 alleles but still express TRPM7 (also in the kidneys), indicating that TRPM7 and TRPM6 are not functionally redundant. To further test this idea, we used the TRPM7-/- DT40 B-cell line to assess the ability of TRPM6 to complement for the absence of TRPM7 under conditions of low extracellular Mg2+. We first performed reverse transcription-PCR analysis to look for endogenous TRPM6 expression in DT40 cells and found no transcript of the chicken TRPM6 homologue (data not shown). Next, we established stable doxycycline-inducible expression of hTRPM6 in the TRPM7-/- DT40 cells. Whereas hTRPM7 can complement for TRPM7 deficiency, hTRPM6 does not improve cell growth under low Mg2+ conditions in the absence of TRPM7 (Fig. 2A). Since we demonstrated above that TRPM6 and TRPM7 associate, we constructed a supplementary DT40 cell line starting with the TRPM7-/- cells complemented with hTRPM7 and added simultaneous stable inducible expression of hTRPM6. Surprisingly, despite the comparatively lower level of FLAG-TRPM6 protein expression (Fig. 2B), coexpression of hTRPM6 severely decreases the capability of hTRPM7 to rescue the growth defect resulting from the genomic disruption of TRPM7 in a medium that has a defined ionic composition and contains no Mg2+ except for the slight amount of Mg2+ included in the 1% chicken serum (Fig. 2C). The same observation was made comparing two independent TRPM6/TRPM7-coexpressing DT40 clones. This cell growth phenotype correlates with the relative levels of free Mg2+ in these different cell lines as assessed with the fluorescent Mg2+ dye Mag-fura after culturing the cells for 24 h in the same Mg2+-free medium as the one used for the cell growth experiments (Fig. 2D). Already at base line, the TRPM7-deficient DT40 cells were reproducibly showing the lowest 340/380 fluorescence ratio, reflecting the lower levels of cytosolic free Mg2+ in these cells as compared with the same TRPM7-/- cells complemented with hTRPM7. Paralleling the growth behavior shown in Fig. 2C, the TRPM6/TRPM7-complemented DT40s show an intermediary phenotype. Following the addition of 10 mm MgCl2 into the cuvette, the TRPM7 KO cells show the least recovery of their [Mg2+]i. Subsequently, 4-bromo-A-23187 was given to the same samples in order to cause the progressive release of endogenous Mg2+ from intracellular stores, since this cell-permeable ionophore has been shown to exhibit low activity for Ca2+. Again, the weakest increase in cytosolic [Mg2+] was registered in the TRPM7-deficient cells and the strongest was registered in the hTRPM7-complemented cells, with the TRPM6/TRPM7 DT40s in between. Over the complete course of the experiment, the 340/380 fluorescence ratio increased 35% in the TRPM7-KO cells, 42% in the TRPM7/TRPM6 cells, and 58% in the TRPM7-complemented cells. This suggests that the intracellular stores were as expected, containing the least Mg2+ in the TRPM7-/- cells, and confirms that TRPM6 has a detrimental effect on TRPM7-dependent Mg2+ homeostasis regulation in DT40s under hypomagnesic conditions. Interestingly, this effect was not seen when physiological amounts of Mg2+ (1–2 mm) were added to the growth medium. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis of TRPM6 and TRPM7 Wild Type Channels—Since both TRPM6 and TRPM7 have phosphotransferase activity and can be autophosphorylated, we next conducted studies aimed at comparing the phosphoamino acid composition of full-length TRPM6 and TRPM7. The TRPM6 and TRPM7 kinase domains are 78% identical over a stretch of 280 aa (hTRPM6 aa 1711–1990, hTRPM7 aa 1556–1834), except for the last ∼30 amino acids that show no homology. Interestingly, the region upstream of the kinase domain, which has been shown to be phosphorylated in TRPM7 (13Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 24Matsushita M. Kozak J.A. Shimizu Y. McLachlin D.T. Yamaguchi H. Wei F.Y. Tomizawa K. Matsui H.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20793-20803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), is the only domain that is not conserved at all between the two sister channels. Despite these differences in protein sequence, the relative amounts of phosphothreonine to phosphoserine are very similar in immunoprecipitated wild type FLAG-TRPM6 and HA-TRPM7 following a 10-min-long in vitro incubation at 30 °C with 20 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, as assessed by two-dimensional electrophoresis on thin layer cellulose plates after acidic heat denaturation of the proteins (Fig. 3). Both TRPM6 and TRPM7 exhibit no tyrosine phosphorylation, an expected result, since their kinase subdomains belong to the atypical family of Thr/Ser α-kinases that also includes the prototypical mammalian eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase. Threonine and serine phosphorylation can clearly be detected in both TRPM6 and TRPM7. The proportion of Thr(P) to Ser(P) appears to be very similar in both channels and was 70% Ser(P) to 30% Thr(P) (±4%) in two separate experiments. Cross-phosphorylation Studies between Wild Type and Kinase Mutant TRPM6 and TRPM7 Subunits—It is currently unknown whether TRPM6 and TRPM7 autophosphorylation is an intramolecular or intermolecular event between associated subunits. We therefore sought to determine if TRPM6 and TRPM7 monomers are capable of phosphorylating associated subunits in trans. Since it has been reported that the main TRPM7 phosphorylation sites for its own kinase are in a protein stretch upstream of the kinase domain, we generated TRPM6 and TRPM7 constructs that are lacking the phosphotransferase domain but retain this phosphorylation stretch. We have previously shown that this kinase-d"

We found that calpain I is activated, which in turn cleaves and activates calcineurin in AD brain. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the cleavage of calcineurin by calpain I is at lysine 501, a position C-terminal to the autoinhibitory domain, which produces a 57-kDa truncated form. The 57-kDa calcineurin maintains its Ca2+/calmodulin dependence of the phosphatase activity, but the phosphatase activity is remarkably activated upon truncation. The cleavage and activation of calcineurin correlate to the number of neurofibrillary tangles in human brains.

Many putative etiologic factors of AD, including excitotoxicity, β-amyloid neurotoxicity, and free radical injury, have in common the potential for disrupting intracellular calcium homeostasis (3Choi D.W.

In the central nervous system, the most important calcium-signaling mediators include calpain and calcineurin. Calpain is a family of calcium-activated intracellular cysteine proteases that catalyze limited proteolytic cleavage of a variety of cellular proteins in all eukaryotes (for reviews see Refs. 2Mattson M.P. Chan S.L. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar and 6Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). To date, at least 14 members of the calpain family have been identified (6Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Among them, calpain I and calpain II are the most predominantly and widely expressed in mammalian tissue, which are composed of a large catalytic subunit (80 kDa) and a small regulatory subunit (30 kDa) (2Mattson M.P. Chan S.L. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). They differ mainly in their calcium requirements for activation and their tissue distributions. Both calpain I and II are present principally as inactive precursors in the cell, and they are activated by calcium-stimulated autoproteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal sequence in response to calcium influx. Calpain I, which is the major calpain isoform in the neuron, is fully activated by low micromolar concentrations of calcium (hence, it is also called μ-calpain), whereas calpain II requires low millimolar levels of calcium for optimal activity (hence, also called m-calpain). Calpain is thought to play a critical role in the activation of neuronal cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (7Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H.

Calcineurin (CaN), also known as protein phosphatase (PP) 2B, is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphoseryl/phosphothreonyl protein phosphatase that is highly expressed in the central nervous system (16Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). It is a heterodimer, consisting of an A-subunit (CaN A, a 60-kDa catalytic subunit) and a B-subunit (CaN B, an 18-kDa Ca2+-binding regulatory subunit) (17Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). CaN A has an autoinhibitory domain and a calmodulin-binding domain in the C-terminal part. The phosphatase is activated when Ca2+/calmodulin binds to it, because the binding triggers the release of the autoinhibitory domain from the catalytic active site (16Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J.

To reveal the dysregulated calcium signaling in AD brain, we investigated the proteolytic cleavage and activation of calpain I and CaN, the two major calcium-signaling mediators, in autopsied human brains with a postmortem delay of less than 3 h.

The 16,000 × g extracts were prepared from the homogenates, and the protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). The extracts were then incubated with monoclonal antibody to CaN A that was pre-coupled to protein G-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The negative control was prepared with protein G-agarose beads without pre-coupling anti-CaN A. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed with Tris-buffered saline three times and with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, two times, and then used for Western blots and CaN phosphatase activity assays. The success of the immunoprecipitation was examined by Western blot analyses as described (30Liu F. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Rossie S. Gong C.X. J. Biol.

In Vitro Proteolysis of Calpain I and CaN—Human brain extracts, prepared as described above except the protease inhibitors were omitted from the homogenizing buffer, were incubated in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+ and/or protease inhibitors for 10 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by addition of 4-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by heating in boiling water for 5 min. The products of proteolysis were analyzed by Western blots (30Liu F. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Rossie S. Gong C.X. J. Biol.

Mass Spectrometry (MS)—The immunoprecipitated CaN A from AD brain extracts was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The full-length and the truncated CaN A bands were excised and digested in gel with trypsin (20Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Oda Y. Wei F.Y. Lu Y.F. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Matsui H. J. Biol.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI)-MS was performed using an ABI 4700 (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA), as described previously (20Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Oda Y. Wei F.Y. Lu Y.F. Matsushita M.

Briefly, spectra were obtained in the positive reflectron mode using external calibration. An LCQ (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA) nano-liquid chromatography (LC)/MS system equipped with a laboratory-made nano-spray ion source (spray voltage: 2.5 kV) and LC10 A gradient pumps (Shimazdu, Kyoto, Japan) was used. The nano-LC column was a “stone-arch” column packed in-house with 100 × 0.1-mm C18 beads and was used at a flow rate of 200 nl/min after flow splitting. A linear gradient of B from 5 to 30% was run, using mobile phase A of 0.5% acetic acid and mobile phase B of 0.5% acetic acid/acetonitrile = 20/80. The MS scan range was 350–1500 m/z, and LC/MS spectra were collected in a data-dependent mode in which the highest intensity peaks in each MS scan were chosen for collision-induced dissociation, and the isolation window was 3 Da (precursor m/z 1.5 Da) to select a precursor ion. The dynamic exclusion option was selected with a repeat count of 1, a repeat duration of 0.5 min, and exclusion duration of 1 min. Calcineurin Phosphatase Activity Assays—Unless specified otherwise, the phosphatase activity of CaN was assayed in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm MnCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 μm calmodulin, 0.1 mg/ml 32P-tau, and the immunoprecipitated calcineurin complex. 32P-Tau was prepared by phosphorylation of recombinant human brain tau441 with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cdk5/p25 and using [γ-32P]ATP, as described (30Liu F. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Rossie S. Gong C.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1790-1796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When crude brain extracts were used for CaN activity assays, 100 nm okadaic acid was included in the reaction mixture to inhibit activities of other major brain phosphatases including PP1, PP2A, and PP5. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated, and the released 32Pi was determined by Cerenkov counting after separation from 32P-tau by ascending paper chromatography, as described previously (31Gong C.-X. Shaikh S. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Brain Res. 1996; 741: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both Calpain I and CaN A Are Truncated in AD Brain—To investigate the proteolytic cleavages of calpain I and CaN A in AD brain, we employed Western blots to analyze the homogenates of temporal cortices from 6 AD and 7 age- and postmortem interval-matched control brains (TABLE ONE). In control brains, calpain I is displayed as two major bands (80 and 76 kDa) and a minor band (78 kDa) (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with previous observations that 80-kDa full-length calpain I can undergo calcium-stimulated autoproteolysis into 78- and 76-kDa truncated, activated forms (10Veeranna Kaji T. Boland B. Odrljin T. Mohan P. Basavarajappa B.S. Peterhoff C. Cataldo A. Rudnicki A. Amin N. Li B.S. Pant H.C. Hungund B.L. Arancio O. Nixon R.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 795-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Saito K. Elce J.S. Hamos J.E. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2628-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The average ratio of the truncated over the full-length calpain I was 1.5 in control brains (Fig. 1B). In AD brains, almost all calpain I was proteolyzed into the 76-kDa truncated form, and the ratio was increased to ∼12 (Fig. 1, A and B). CaN A in normal control brains was seen as a single 60-kDa band, whereas ∼50% of CaN A was truncated into a 57-kDa form in AD brains, except the AD case 5 (Fig. 1, A and B). PP5, which is not regulated by calcium and hence was used as a sample loading control, showed no detectable cleavage in either AD or control brains (Fig. 1A). Because both calpain I and CaN A were found truncated in AD brain, we analyzed the levels of truncation of these two proteins and found a strong positive correlation (r = 0.93, p < 0.01) between calpain I truncation and CaN A truncation (Fig. 1C). This positive correlation was also seen when control cases were excluded from the analysis (r = 0.81, p < 0.05). These results suggest that CaN A truncation may be mediated by the proteolysis/activation of calpain I in AD brain. Truncation of CaN A Activates Its Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent Phosphatase Activity in AD Brain—We then investigated whether the truncation of CaN A in AD brain affects its phosphatase activity. In order to assay the specific CaN activity, we immunoprecipitated it from the equal amounts of brain extracts from 6 AD and 7 control cases and measured the phosphatase activity toward 32P-tau as a substrate. Western blot analysis indicated that the anti-CaN A immunoprecipitated CaN A from the brain extracts almost completely and did not co-immunoprecipitate any of the other major brain protein phosphatases (i.e. PP1, PP2A, and PP5) or tau (Fig. 2A). When the precipitated CaN was assayed for phosphatase activity in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin, little activity in both control and AD brains was observed (Fig. 2B), which was consistent with the fact that the phosphatase activity of CaN is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent (17Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). When Ca2+/calmodulin was included in the assay mixture, 2-fold higher activity in control and 9-fold higher activity in AD cases were detected. In the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, the CaN phosphatase activity was 2-fold higher in AD than in control brains. The elevated CaN phosphatase activity in AD brains versus control brains was not because of any change of CaN level, because no difference in CaN levels was found between the two groups, as determined by dot blot assay (data not shown). These results suggest that the truncation of CaN A in AD brain activates its phosphatase activity. Hence, we analyzed the correlation between the CaN A truncation and the phosphatase activity in these human brain samples. We found that the CaN phosphatase activity was positively correlated to the level of CaN A truncation (r = 0.95), and the correlation was highly significant (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). This positive correlation was also seen when control cases were excluded from the analysis (r = 0.89, p < 0.05). These results indicate that the activation of CaN phosphatase activity in AD brain results from the truncation of CaN A. By using 32P-labeled phosphorylase kinase and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrates, it was reported previously that the phosphatase activity of CaN in AD brain extracts was unchanged (32Gong C.-X. Singh T.J. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) or slightly decreased (33Ladner C.J. Czech J. Maurice J. Lorens S.A. Lee J.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Lian Q. Ladner C.J. Magnuson D. Lee J.M. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 167: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as compared with controls. In order to understand the apparent discrepancy between the previous reports and our present findings, we measured the CaN phosphatase activities of the same brain extract samples without immunoprecipitation by using 32P-tau as a substrate and in the presence of 100 nm okadaic acid to inhibit other major brain protein phosphatase activities. Consistent with our previous finding with [32P]phosphorylase kinase as a substrate (32Gong C.-X. Singh T.J. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), we found no difference in the phosphatase activity between AD and control brain extracts (Fig. 2D). To reveal why the difference in phosphatase activity of CaN could not be observed when the brain extracts were used instead of immunoprecipitated CaN, we added the CaN-immunodepleted extracts back into the reaction mixture of the activity assay just before incubation for dephosphorylation reaction. We found that addition of the immunodepleted extracts back into the assay mixture activated the immunoprecipitated CaN phosphatase activity of the control group to the same level of the AD group, but it did not alter the activity of AD group (Fig. 2E). Western blots of the assay mixtures of the control group indicated that the full-length CaN A was partially truncated into the 57-kDa form immediately after the extracts were added back into the reaction mixture where Ca2+/calmodulin was present (data not shown), whereas CaN A immunoprecipitated from AD brain extracts was already partially truncated (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that in the presence of 1.5 mm Ca2+ and 1.5 μm calmodulin in the assay mixture, calpain I in the brain extracts immediately cleaved CaN A and activated its phosphatase activity during assay. Hence, the previous failure of detecting the elevated calcineurin activity in AD brain was probably because CaN A in control samples was truncated and activated during assay incubation with the added Ca2+/calmodulin in the assay mixture. CaN A Is Cleaved by Calpain I in Human Brain Extracts—To investigate further whether the 57-kDa truncation of CaN A is produced by activated calpain I in AD brain, we added various concentrations of calcium together with 2.0 mm EDTA to normal human brain extracts, and we incubated them at 30 °C for 10 min and then determined the truncation/activation of calpain I and the cleavage of CaN A by Western blots. We found that calpain I was proteolyzed and activated from 80 to 78 kDa and 76 kDa in a Ca2+ dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In addition to the truncation/activation of calpain I, a 57-kDa truncated CaN A was also observed in the same Ca2+ dose-dependent manner. Because the incubation was carried out in the presence of 2.0 mm EDTA that chelated all endogenous Ca2+ when no additional Ca2+ was added and most of the added Ca2+ that allowed only free Ca2+ above 2.0 mm chelating capacity of EDTA, only micromolar levels of free Ca2+ were present in the reaction mixture during incubation of the brain extracts. Hence, these results suggest that the CaN A proteolysis in the human brain extracts resulted from activation of calpain I rather than calpain II, which requires millimolar concentrations of free Ca2+ for activation. To confirm that CaN A is proteolyzed by calpain I in human brain, we studied inhibition of the Ca2+-stimulated proteolysis of calpain I and CaN A with various selective protease inhibitors. When aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, and pepstatin, an aspartic protease inhibitor, were included in the normal human brain extracts during incubation, no significant inhibition of the proteolysis of either calpain I or CaN A was observed (Fig. 3B). These results excluded the involvement of serine proteases and aspartic proteases in the proteolysis of calpain I and CaN A. In contrast, when leupeptin, a selective inhibitor of cysteine and serine proteases, and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN), a calpain and cysteine protease inhibitor, were included in the incubation mixtures, a marked inhibition of calpain I proteolysis and an almost complete blockage of CaN A proteolysis were observed (Fig. 3B). A specific calpain inhibitor, calpepstatin peptide, also inhibited the autoproteolysis of calpain I and prevented CaN A from proteolysis. Taken together, these results indicate that in AD brain most probably the elevated Ca2+ induces autoproteolysis and activation of calpain I, which in turn cleaves CaN A into a 57-kDa truncated form. To study the activation of CaN by calpain I, we also incubated CaN immunoprecipitated from human brains with various concentrations of purified calpain I, and we found a concentration-dependent CaN A cleavage (data not shown) and activation of CaN phosphatases activity (Fig. 3C). This activation was more remarkable for CaN from control brains than that from AD brains. At 2.14 μg/ml calpain I, the CaN phosphatase activity immunoprecipitated from both AD and controls reached the same level. This activation was completely blocked when calpain inhibitors ALLN or calpepstatin peptide were included in the reaction mixtures (Fig. 3D). These results further support our conclusion that CaN A is truncated and activated by calpain I in AD brain. Fig. 3, A and B, also indicated that, in addition to the 57-kDa truncation, incubation of normal human brain extracts with Ca2+ also induced a 48-kDa truncated form of CaN A, which was not seen in the extracts of AD brains. To learn whether the 48-kDa truncation of CaN A is an in vitro phenomenon or represents a difference between normal control and AD brains, we incubated the control and AD brain extracts with Ca2+ in parallel. We found that the incubation of control brain extracts induced both a major 57-kDa and a minor 48-kDa truncated CaN A (Fig. 4A). However, the 48-kDa truncated CaN A was not seen in the incubated AD brain extracts. To learn why the 48-kDa truncation could not be seen in AD brain extracts, we studied the activation of a specific endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpepstatin, by quantitating the truncated active 50-kDa form of calpepstatin (35Blomgren K. Hallin U. Andersson A.L. Puka-Sundvall M. Bahr B.A. McRae A. Saido T.C. Kawashima S. Hagberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14046-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in AD brain versus control brain. We found that calpepstatin was overactivated in AD brain (Fig. 4B). Thus, the lack of 48-kDa truncation of CaN A in AD brain might be because of the overactivation of calpepstatin that could prevent this specific truncation. We indeed observed that calpepstatin appeared to have a more potent inhibition to the 48-kDa truncation than to the 57-kDa truncation of CaN A (data not shown).

We show that carbon dioxide enrichment, although causing short-term growth stimulation in a range of European tree species, also leads to an increase in soil microbial respiration and a marked decline in sequestration of root-derived carbon in the soil. These findings indicate that, should similar processes operate in forest ecosystems, the size of the annual terrestrial carbon sink may be substantially reduced, resulting in a positive feedback on the rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration."

G4-DNA is an alternative highly stable DNA structure forming within runs of guanine bases. It has been amply described previously (1.Arthanari H. Bolton P.H. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). G4-DNA structures have the potential to disrupt normal duplex DNA; therefore, it might be expected that the genome would have minimized the usage of runs of deoxyguanosine. On the contrary, a growing body of data support the hypothesis that formation of G4-DNA in vivo is a recognized structural motif of specialized utility for key biological processes. Recent studies with a fluorescent G4-DNA-binding ligand, as well as a specific G4-DNA-binding protein, support the presence of G4-DNA structures located at human telomeres in vivo (2.Chang C.-C.

Compounds that stabilize G4-DNA in vivo have generated much interest because of their antitumor activity, suggesting that G4-DNA structures might be a general control motif utilized to inhibit cell growth, possibly by stabilizing repressor elements in growth related promoters (8.Siddiqui-Jain A.

In addition to possible functional roles of G4-DNA, given the concentrations of nucleic acids in the cell and the single-stranded nature of DNA involved in replication, transcription, and recombination, it is likely that aberrant G4 structures form spontaneously in vivo. In this regard, it has been recently shown that a recombinant transcription construct containing the mammalian immunoglobulin Sμ and Sγ3 switch regions formed intramolecular G4 structures in the non-transcribed DNA strand of the transcription unit upon induction of transcription (15.Duquette M.L. Handa P. Vincent J.A. Taylor A.F. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1618-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Whether G4-DNA structures are formed for biological purpose or by stochastic accident, once present, G4-DNA structures are highly stable. In order for such structures to be dynamic and rapidly resolved, enzymes involved in the recognition of G4-DNA structures and their resolution back into separate nucleotide strands would be of great importance. To date, certain members of the RecQ family of DNA helicases have been observed to catalyze the resolution of G4-DNA structures back to single-stranded DNA (G4-DNA resolvase activity) (16.Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 17.Sun H. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol.

We previously reported that human cell lysates possess traceable tetramolecular G4-DNA resolvase activity that is separable from nuclease and double-stranded helicase activities (19.Harrington C. Lan Y. Akman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24631-24636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, we have utilized G4-DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to purify and identify the major contributing protein enabling tetramolecular G4-DNA resolvase activity in HeLa cell lysates. G4-DNA Substrate Generation and G4-DNA Resolution Activity Assay—To construct synthetic pure G4-DNA substrate for the activity assay or G4-DNA for affinity chromatography, a 1-μmol synthesis of either gel-purified 5 (and 6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-labeled Z33 oligomer DNA sequence: 5′-AAAGTGATGGTGGTGGGGGAAGGATTTCGAACCT or 3′-biotin-labeled Z33 oligomer was purchased from Oligos Etc. The procedures for tetramolecular G4-DNA formation and our standard G4-DNA resolution assay have been described previously (19.Harrington C. Lan Y. Akman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24631-24636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test the ability of recombinant DHX36 protein to resolve other known tetramolecular G4-DNA structures, we used a 1-μmol synthesis of gel-purified TP sequence of the immunoglobin heavy chain switch region (5′-TGGACCAGACCTAGCAGCTATGGGGGAGCTGGGGAAGGTGGGAATGTGA) and “rD4,” 3The abbreviations used are: rD4, an oligonucleotide sequence from the human 28 S ribosomal RNA gene (GenBank™ accession number M11167); βME, β-mercaptoethanol; GSPB, G4-DNA-bound streptavidin paramagnetic beads; G4R1, G4 Resolvase-1, a proposed name for the DHX36 gene product; AU, absorbance unit; RSB, resolvase salt buffer; Q-TOF, quadrupole time-of-flight; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; mAb, monoclonal antibody. an oligonucleotide sequence from the human 28 S ribosomal RNA gene (5′-TTGAAAATCCGGGGGAGAGGGTGTAAATCTCG, GenBank™ accession number M11167). After quadruplex DNA was formed and isolated as above, it was end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP by T4 kinase (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions and purified by G-25 Sephadex Microspin™ columns (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of G4-DNA-bound Streptavidin Paramagnetic Beads (GSPB)—Paramagnetic affinity beads were prepared by standard methods (see supplemental data). Isolation of G4-DNA Resolvase from HeLa Cells—Approximately 0.5 g of frozen HeLa cell pellet were thawed at 37 °C, and immediately an equal volume of ice-cold 2× lysis buffer (100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 0.4 mm EDTA, 40 mm βME, 0.02% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml pepstatin; more recently we have found that leupeptin and pepstatin can be substituted with Sigma protease inhibitor mixture) was added. Lysates were sonicated on ice by a Branson Sonifier 4500. Supernatants were clarified by microcentrifugation. Lysates were preincubated with competitor DNA by combining 0.95 ml of HeLa cell lysate, 2 ml of RSB, 100 AU of randomized 33 base pair oligomers (HHN)11, 10 μlof0.5 m EDTA and then incubating on ice for 10 min. Fifty μl of GSPB were added, and material was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min (with mixing every 3 min) followed by cooling on ice and pelleting by magnet. Lysate-bound GSPB were then washed consecutively in 1-ml volumes of RSB, resolvase high salt buffer (consisting of 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 3.0 m NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol), and finally RSB again. For ATP-dependent elution from beads, 60 μl of ATP-dependent elution buffer (CEB, consisting of RSB + 10 mm ATP) was prewarmed at 37 °C and added to washed GSPB. The material was incubated at 37 °C for 1 min, followed by addition of 6 μl of 5 m NaCl and further incubation at 37 °C for an additional minute. Beads were pelleted and supernatant collected. This elution process was repeated once. Gel filtration chromatography of ATP-dependent elution was done by standard methods on a tandem double Sephadex G-200 column with a running buffer of RSB made 300 mm in NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. One-half-ml fractions were collected; 5-μl aliquots were tested for G4-DNA resolvase activity. Pooled reactions were precipitated in acetone and assayed by SDS-PAGE with colloidal Coomassie G-250 stain. Bands excised from SDS gels were sent to the Keck Center (Yale University) for tryptic digest and quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis followed by Mascot analysis for protein matches. Cloning of DHX36 and the Isolation of Recombinant G4-DNA Resolvase—I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone 5273384 containing the DHX36 gene was purchased from Invitrogen Corp. The gene insert was corrected of errors and cloned into the PshAI-BamHI site of expression plasmid TriEx-4 (Novagen) by standard methods. Recombinant proteins were produced by transformation of Escherichia coli strain Rosetta 2 (Novagen) with either TriEx-4 DHX36 or TriEx-4 vector alone. Recombinant proteins were initially purified by means of a His6 tag by utilizing the TALON purification kit (Clontech). Rosetta 2 cell lysates were isolated and bound to TALON cobalt resin as recommended by the manufacturer. TALON resin (1 ml bed volume) was eluted twice with 1 ml of histidine elution buffer (0.7 m histidine, pH 6.0, 8.6 mm βME, Sigma protease inhibitor mixture), followed by 1 ml of 250 mm EDTA, pH 6.0. For the second phase of purification, eluates were combined and incubated with GSPB in 0.4% α-lactalbumin and 100 AU of 33-base randomized oligomer (HHN)11 at 37 °C for 10 min. Bound GSPB were washed two times in SSC (4×) with 0.1% α-lactalbumin. High purity recombinant DHX36 (20,000 units per μg, units defined previously (19.Harrington C. Lan Y. Akman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24631-24636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) was obtained by ATP-dependent elution of GSPB as described for HeLa extracts, except 0.04% α-lactalbumin and Sigma protease inhibitor (instead of leupeptin and pepstatin) were added to the elution buffer. G4-DNA Competition and Resolution Assays—Unlabeled G4-DNA, Y duplex DNA, 5′-overhang blunt duplex, and 3′-overhang blunt duplex were made utilizing oligomers that were previously used to study WRN helicase activity (20.Harrigan J.A. Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C. Kedar P.S. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22686-22695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). G4-DNA used in competition experiments included tetramolecular Z33, TP, and ribosomal DNA. Serial dilutions of competitor structures were made from 300-fold down to an equimolar ratio of competitor to labeled G4-DNA. In standard 30-μl reactions, competitor dilutions were added first to reaction tubes on ice. Next, one unit of recombinant DHX36 was added, and then the reaction was started by the addition of 0.2 pmol of 5 (and 6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-labeled G4-DNA. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped with 5 μl of 200 mm EDTA. Studies Involving Immunological Reagents—Monoclonal antibody generation, immunodepletion of HeLa cell lysates, and Western blotting were done by standard means (see supplemental data). The Protein Product of the DHX36 Gene Is a G4-DNA Resolvase—In this study we report the isolation, purification, and identification of the major tetramolecular G4-DNA resolvase in HeLa cell lysates. Fig. 1A outlines the purification strategy used for isolating the protein responsible for G4-DNA resolvase activity. It is of note that we initially used G4-DNA affinity chromatography to bind activity without utilizing any other prior fractionation techniques, thus allowing activity to be captured by a comprehensive approach from complete lysates. Fig. 1B shows a standard G4-DNA resolvase activity assay using a previously characterized tetramolecular G4-DNA structure formed by self-annealed deoxyoligonucleotide Z33 as substrate (19.Harrington C. Lan Y. Akman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24631-24636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B, lane 3, pure G4-DNA was exposed to HeLa cell lysates in the presence of ATP and MgCl2; all the G4-DNA tetramolecular substrate of higher electrophoretic mobility was converted to monomer by enzymatic activity. In the absence of ATP or MgCl2, no G4-DNA conversion into monomeric DNA occurred (data not shown). Incubation of HeLa cell lysates with GSPB depleted total HeLa lysates of G4-DNA resolvase activity and in turn enriched GSPB with high levels of activity that could be assayed directly on GSPB (Fig. 1B, lane 4). G4-DNA resolving activity bound to GSPB in the presence of EDTA, and binding did not require activation of the enzyme with MgCl2 and/or ATP. However, GSPB resolvase activity required MgCl2 and ATP. Avid binding of G4-DNA resolvase activity to GSPB allowed us to utilize a stringent 2 m NaCl wash to strip beads of many other bound proteins while maintaining the majority of G4-DNA resolvase activity on the GSPB (data not shown). ATP-dependent G4-DNA resolvase activity was selectively eluted from GSPB into solution by adding 10 mm ATP to beads and titrating the NaCl level to 300 mm (beads had previously seen up to 2 m NaCl). The asterisk over the arrow in Fig. 1A marks the point that bumped soluble GSPB eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Although a number of prominent protein species were detected, an arrow in Fig. 1C marks an ∼120-kDa protein band found to be associated with activity in subsequent gel filtration experiments. Once activity was substantiated, this actual protein band was used for mass spectrometry analysis. Fig. 1D shows a standard G4-DNA resolvase activity assay of ATP-dependent GSPB eluate fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-200. G4-DNA resolvase assays of total fractionated eluate from gel filtration chromatography demonstrated only a single peak of resolvase activity, suggesting one major species of G4-DNA resolvase. G4-DNA resolvase activity was highest in fractions 13 and 14, and elution time correlated with a mass of ∼120 kDa (determined using molecular weight standards). Gel filtration fractions were pooled in pairs (depicted in boxes labeled by Roman numerals in Fig. 1D) for analysis by SDS-PAGE. A polypeptide band at molecular mass ∼120 kDa of peak staining intensity (Fig. 1E) correlated with the peak of G4-DNA resolvase activity observed in pool III. Q-TOF mass spectrometry measurements of tryptic digests of this protein species identified five peptide matches (see supplemental data) with the putative DEXH box helicase DHX36 (21.Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar). The DHX36 protein has a predicted molecular mass of 115 kDa that correlates well with the observed molecular mass on SDS-PAGE of ∼120 kDa. Examination of the DHX36 sequence revealed the protein to be a DEXH box helicase with putative NTPase activity and Mg2+ dependence, both characteristics we had previously reported for G4-DNA resolvase activity in crude extracts (19.Harrington C. Lan Y. Akman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24631-24636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, the identification of DHX36 as a G4-DNA resolvase is confirmed by showing that expression and purification of recombinant DHX36 in E. coli is associated with robust G4-DNA resolving activity. The majority of material remaining after two rounds of purification was a protein of molecular mass 120 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Q-TOF mass spectrometry of tryptic digests of the 120 kDa protein determined it to be recombinant human DHX36 (see supplemental data). No significant protein of 120 kDa was isolated by application of the purification scheme to lysates of cells transformed by TriEx-4 vector without insert (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Purified recombinant DHX36 protein isolated from TriEx-4 DHX36-transformed E. coli had robust G4-DNA resolvase activity (Fig. 2B, lane 6); however, material purified from TriEx-4 (vector only) transformed E. coli had no detectable G4-DNA resolvase activity (Fig. 2B, lane 5). These data conclusively assign G4-DNA resolvase activity to DHX36. DHX36 Protein Prefers Tetramolecular G4-DNA Structures to Watson-Crick Duplex DNA—An inhibition experiment (Fig. 3, A and B) demonstrates the substrate specificity of recombinant DHX36 product for G4-DNA compared with three duplex DNA helicase substrates. While equimolar unlabeled G4-DNA significantly diminished resolution of labeled G4-DNA, a 300-fold molar excess of a Y form duplex was required to have a similar inhibitory effect. A 300-fold molar excess of 5′- and 3′-overhangs had less of an inhibitory effect than equimolar, unlabeled G4-DNA. In other experiments, direct resolution of Y form duplex DNA required at least 27-fold more recombinant enzyme than was required for resolution of equimolar amounts of Z33 G4-DNA (data not shown). These data demonstrate that DHX36 has high specificity for the G4-DNA substrate in comparison to other duplex DNA substrates. Additional experiments demonstrate (Fig. 3C) that substrate specificity of recombinant DHX36 protein product includes other tetramolecular G4-DNA structures. Both mammalian sequences of TP G4-DNA, generated from the immunoglobulin switch region, and human ribosomal G4-DNA effectively inhibit resolution of Z33 G4-DNA, whereas single-stranded deoxyoligonucleotide Z33 oligomer did not. Activity assays comparing the efficiency of resolution of these three substrates (Fig. 3D) demonstrated that ribosomal G4-DNA is readily resolved. In contrast, TP G4-DNA structure is only very slowly resolved. The fact that TP G4-DNA is an excellent inhibitory structure, yet is poorly resolved, suggests that DHX36 recognizes and binds TP G4-DNA well but resolves slowly. DHX36 Protein Is an Abundant Protein in HeLa Cell Lysates That Is Responsible for the Majority of G4-DNA Resolving Activity—To quantify levels of DHX36 protein in HeLa lysates and to determine the extent to which DHX36 gene product contributes to the total G4-DNA resolvase activity by specific immunodepletion of HeLa cell lysates, we developed a mAb to DHX36. Quantitative immunoblotting indicated that DHX36 protein accounts for 0.08 ± 0.006% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) of protein mass present in total HeLa cell lysates (see supplemental data). Fig. 4A shows a Western blot analysis of HeLa cell lysate immunodepleted by anti-DHX36 protein product mAb compared with lysate immunodepleted by a IgG control mAb. Titrations of IgG-depleted lysate allow a direct comparison of DHX36 protein product levels between the mAb immunodepletions. When loading was normalized against β-actin, and DHX36 protein levels were compared with a linear plot of the IgG titrations, ∼77% of DHX36 protein product was estimated to be removed from the lysates compared with the IgG control. In standard G4-DNA resolvase activity assays (Fig. 4B), the lysate specifically immunodepleted for the DHX36 protein had 46.0 ± 0.4% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) of the G4-DNA resolvase activity as did lysates immunodepleted with a control IgG. Thus, DHX36 protein product is the major, but not the sole, G4-DNA resolvase present in HeLa cell lysates. Extrapolation of these data suggests that 100% immunodepletion of DHX36 protein product removes ∼70% of the G4-DNA resolvase activity from HeLa lysates. Therefore, about 30% of G4-DNA resolvase activity of HeLa cell lysates remains unidentified. Since the Sen and Gilbert's initial observation of tetramolecular G4-DNA (4.Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 28: 364-366Crossref Scopus (1425) Google Scholar), its remarkable stability has raised a conundrum concerning how it might be dynamically resolved when formed in a cell. Candidate proteins to fulfill that role include RecQ helicases, a G4-specific nuclease for both DNA and RNA quadruplex that has been found in yeast and identified as KEM1/SEP1 (22.Liu Z. Gilbert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and an analogous DNA quadruplex nuclease activity has been found in human Raji cells (23.Sun H. Yabuki A. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12444-12449Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The protein responsible for the latter activity has yet to be identified. Yeast and mammalian proteins have been found to bind G4-DNA by affinity chromatography approaches (24.Frantz J.D. Gilbert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9413-9419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25.Dempsey L.A. Sun H. Hanakah L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1066-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but to our knowledge the DHX36 protein product is the first NTP driven G4-DNA resolving enzyme to be isolated directly from human cell lysates. Thus this protein may hold a key role for catalytically destabilizing quanine quadruplex structures. Since G4-DNA resolving activity may be a primary role for this protein, we propose to add the name G4 Resolvase-1 (G4R1) for the DHX36 gene product, which is also known as RHAU and MLEL1. Mammalian RecQ helicases are ATP-dependent enzymes capable of resolving certain G4-DNA structures in vitro and have been identified by genetic linkage studies from different cancer and aging syndromes that carry their name. It is noteworthy that RecQ family proteins were not identified by our G4-DNA affinity enrichment approach; this may be due to loss of RecQ proteins during the high salt wash of G4-DNA affinity beads where a detectable but small contribution of activity is lost. However, immunodepletion experiments show that G4R1 makes a greater contribution to G4-DNA resolving activity in HeLa lysates than the RecQ protein members. The identity of DHX36 as being responsible for a major G4-DNA resolvase activity may shed light on its biological function. The motifs of the gene have been discussed previously (26.Tran H. Schilling M. Wirbelauer C. Hess D. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and are typical of DEAD/DEAH box helicases. These helicases can be primarily active on DNA or RNA or both nucleic acids. The closest homologous human protein to DHX36 by BLAST comparison is the DEXH protein nuclear DNA helicase (NDH II), which has 35% identity with DHX36 (27.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). This protein has roles in facilitating enhanced transcription, binding both DNA and RNA, in part through association with RNA pol II (28.Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Nakajima T. Wolpin E.S. Parvin J.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 29.Aratani S. Fujii R. Oishi T. Fujita H. Amano T. Ohshima T. Hagiwara M. Fukamizu A. Nakajima T. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1634-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another DEXH helicase termed dog-1 from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans appears important for maintenance of certain long guanine-rich DNA tracts and has been suggested to resolve G4-DNA arising on the parental lagging strand of DNA replication, although biochemical specificity of dog-1 activity awaits characterization (31.Cheung I. Schertzer M. Rose A. Lansdorp P.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 4: 405-409Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). One mouse homologue of dog-1 termed Rtel (Regulator of telomere length) was found to induce loss of telomeres and a high frequency of chromosomal fusions when knocked out in mouse ES cells (32.Ding H. Schertzer M. Wu X. Gertsenstein M. Selig S. Kammori M. Pourvali R. Poon S. Vulto I. Chavez E. Tam P.P. Nagy A. Lansdorp P.M. Cell. 2004; 117: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). If both Rtel and DHX36 protein helicases are indeed recognizing G4-DNA structures, certain DEXH proteins may represent a new family of DNA caretaker enzymes specializing in preventing quadruplex G4-DNA induced mutations. Only one prior investigation in the literature explores the function of the DHX36 protein (26.Tran H. Schilling M. Wirbelauer C. Hess D. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The DHX36 protein product was isolated from HeLa cell lysates as part of a protein complex that bound proteins to the AU-rich element of urokinase plasminogen activator mRNA (and termed RHAU for RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element) including the exosome complex responsible for 3′-5′ degradation of AU-rich RNAs (26.Tran H. Schilling M. Wirbelauer C. Hess D. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Overexpression of RHAU was associated with accelerated degradation of certain AU containing mRNAs (26.Tran H. Schilling M. Wirbelauer C. Hess D. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining indicated that the majority of HeLa cell DHX36 is nuclear, although a splice variant of RHAU had primarily cytoplasmic staining (26.Tran H. Schilling M. Wirbelauer C. Hess D. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This work does suggest that the cytoplasmic variant of DHX36 protein may have a key function in processing AU mRNA metabolism. DHX36 mRNA expression in human organs is highest in testis (33.Fu J.J. Li L.Y. Lu G.X. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sinica. 2002; 34: 655-661Google Scholar), which is consistent with the protein being utilized in cells with high rates of proliferation. High levels of DHX36 may be needed by rapidly growing cells, including certain tumor types. Regions of DNA that become single-stranded during replication and transcription are vulnerable to forming G4-DNA structures. With the knowledge that the DHX36 protein product (G4R1) is a major G4-DNA resolvase, we are conducting experiments to monitor sequences that are likely to form G-quadruplex structures when G4R1 activity is conditionally knocked out. These experiments will give us a better understanding of the biological function of G4R1 and a better understanding of the roles and extent of G-quadruplex formation in the cell. We thank M. Lively, F. Perrino, J. Sam, B. Shaw, A. Thorburn, and M. Willingham for helpful comments on the manuscript. We thank M. Morris, W. Fortson, and R. Topping for technical assistance.

Nod1 has been described recently as a cytosolic receptor that detects specifically diaminopimelate-containing muropeptides from Gram-negative bacteria peptidoglycan. In the present study we investigated the potential role of Nod1 in the innate immune response against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrate that Nod1 detects the P. aeruginosa peptidoglycan leading to NF-κB activation and that this activity is diminished in epithelial cells expressing a dominant-negative Nod1 construct or in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Nod1 knock-out mice infected with P. aeruginosa. Finally, we demonstrate that the cytokine secretion kinetics and bacterial killing are altered in Nod1-deficient cells infected with P. aeruginosa in the early stages of infection.

The virulence of P. aeruginosa is multifactorial including several cell-associated and secreted proteins such as elastase A (3Johnson D.A. Carter-Hamm B. Dralle W.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1982; 126: 1070-1073PubMed Google Scholar), phospholipase C (4Wieland C.W. Siegmund B. Senaldi G. Vasil M.L. Dinarello C.A. Fantuzzi G. Infect.

PAMPs are conserved structures present in all or large groups of microorganisms but are absent in mammalian cells. PRRs are located either at the cell membrane, where they respond to extracellular PAMPs, or in the cytosol of host cells, where they respond to PAMPs that are present in the cytosol (6Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Human Toll-like receptors interact mainly with extracellular PAMPs; for example, TLR5 interacts with bacterial flagellin (7Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar), and TLR4 interacts with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (8Travassos L.H. Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J. Blanot D. Nahori M.A. Werts C. Boneca I.G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Signaling through TLRs leads to the activation of NF-κB and, subsequently, of NF-κB target genes. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Nod1 and Nod2 in innate immunity. It is thought that they act as cytoplasmatic sensors of bacteria and bacterial products (5Sato H. Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Nod1 structurally contains a CARD domain, a centrally located nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, and multiple C-terminal leucine-rich repeats. Nod1 engages in a homophilic CARD-CARD interaction with Rip2, a CARD-containing protein kinase that in turn interacts with IKKγ and results in NF-κB activation (9Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L.

Nod1 and Nod2 have been recognize muropeptides from bacterial peptidoglycan (PG), although they require distinct molecular motifs within PG to achieve this sensing (10Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Herve M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41702-41708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Although traditionally considered as an extracellular pathogen, P. aeruginosa has been shown to be internalized by and to survive within different types of mammalian cells, in particular epithelial respiratory cells from nonjunctional epithelia (1Plotkowski M.C. de Bentzmann S. Pereira S.H. Zahm J.M. Bajolet L. Roger P. Puchelle E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 880-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa infections are usually associated with a marked host inflammatory response, and previous studies have shown that bacterial products such as LPS, flagellin, and CpG DNA from P. aeruginosa are strong stimuli for TLR4 (11Hajjar A.M. Ernst R.K. Tsai J.H. Wilson C.B. Miller S.I. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), TLR5 (12Zhang J. Xu K. Ambati B. Yu F.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4247-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and TLR9 (13Greene C.M. Carroll T.P. Smith S.G. Taggart C.C. Devaney J. Griffin S. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), respectively. In this study we investigated the ability of P. aeruginosa to induce NF-κB activation through Nod1. Our results demonstrate that in addition to data from literature that show the role of TLRs in the detection of products from P. aeruginosa, signaling through Nod1 constitutes a potential important back-up system against P. aeruginosa. Cell Culture—The human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line HEK293T were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were maintained in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Isolation of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)—Wild-type and Nod1 knock-out mice were used to isolate MEFs as follows. The torsos of 13.5-day-old embryos were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. After removal of the heart and liver, the embryos were transferred to a Petri dish containing fresh PBS, cut into small pieces with a sterile blade, and resuspended in trypsin-EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). The suspensions were incubated twice for 20 min at 37 °C under magnetic stirring and then filtered and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of complete medium (DMEM; 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin) and cultured to 90% confluence. Each culture was expanded to five new dishes and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Before use, the cells were thawed in complete medium. Bacteria and Other Reagents—The following P. aeruginosa strains were used in this study. PAO-1, PAK, and a PAK mutant lacking flagellin (PAKΔfliC) (the last two strains were kindly provided by Dr. Steve Lory, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). tri-DAP was obtained by treatment of the corresponding MurNAc peptide with partially purified Escherichia coli N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase according to the method of van Heijenoort et al. (14Van Heijenoort J. Parquet C. Flouret B. van Heijenoort Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Muramyl dipeptide (15Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8869-8872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar) was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). PG from P. aeruginosa PAO-1 was prepared as described previously (16Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jehanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.K. Labigne A. Zahringer U. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). PG samples were lyophilized in a SpeedVac to estimate the amount of PG and determine the yield per colony-forming unit. Peptidoglycan samples were resuspended in pyrogene-free ultrapure water (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany). Amino acid and amino-sugar compositions were determined with a Hitachi L8800 analyzer (ScienceTec, Les Ulis, France) after hydrolysis of samples in 6 m HCl at 95 °C for 16 h. Recombinant TNF-α was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Infection Protocol—Bacteria were grown in Trypticase soy broth at 37 °C overnight under agitation, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in DMEM culture medium to an OD660 of 0.1 (∼108 colonyforming units/ml). HEK293T cells or MEFs grown to 80% confluence in 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum were infected with bacteria at a multiplicity of infection of 100 or stimulated with flagellin-enriched supernatants from P. aeruginosa cultures unless otherwise stated. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C, extracellular bacteria were removed by washing and by incubation for different periods with DMEM containing 300 μg/ml gentamicin to kill the remaining extracellular bacteria. Flagellin-enriched supernatants were prepared as follows. Bacterial cells from 96-h-old cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the supernatants were filter-sterilized with 0.22-μm membranes and boiled at 100 °C for 30 min to destroy proteins other than flagellin. Plasmids, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—Studies on the synergistic activation of NF-κB by PGs were carried out as described previously (17Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Studies on NF-κB activation following P. aeruginosa infection were carried out as described (18Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Yaniv M. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with 75 ng of the reporter plasmid Igκ-luc alone or in combination with 3 ng of Nod1-HA or a dominant-negative form of Nod1 (DN-Nod1-HA/ΔCARD4-HA). The pcDNA3.1 vector was used to balance the transfected DNA concentration. The PG preparations were used at 1 μg/ml, and tri-DAP or muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln) (10 pmol) were used as the positive and negative control for Nod1, respectively. Western Blots—HEK293T cells were transfected as described above. Briefly, cells were harvested from 6-well plates to detect Nod1-HA expression. Cells were lysed and kept on ice until separation in SDS-8% PAGE. After separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with an anti-HA (Upstate Biotechnology). After three washes, membranes were incubated with an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish-peroxidase. Proteins were visualized by Western Lightening ECL labeling (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were also probed with a control antibody against human β-actin. Cytokine Measurements—Murine cytokines (TNF-α, MIP-2, and KC) released into the medium were measured using BD Pharmingen opt enzyme immunoassay kits or R&D Systems' Duoset enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Intracellular Bacterial Survival—MEFs obtained from wild-type and Nod1 knock-out mice were infected with P. aeruginosa for 1 h, washed, and incubated with gentamicin-containing culture medium. After different periods of incubation, the cells were washed with sterile PBS and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Viable counts of cell-associated bacteria were determined by serial plating of cell lysates. Cell Viability Assays—The cell membrane integrity was analyzed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide labeling as described previously (2Plotkowski M.C. Povoa H.C. Zahm J.M. Lizard G. Pereira G.M. Tournier J.M. Puchelle E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, control non-infected or infected cells were detached from the microplate wells with a 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solution and pooled with spontaneously detached cells present in the cell culture supernatants. After rinsing, cells were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.2, containing 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with propidium iodide at 5 μg/ml for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were kept on ice and analyzed with a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a standard argon ion laser. Statistics—Data were analyzed with the Student's t test and Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate. Differences in data values were considered significant at a p value of less than 0.05. P. aeruginosa Induces NF-κB Activation in Epithelial Cells—We first investigated whether P. aeruginosa was able to induce NF-κB activation in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with a Igκ-luc reporter plasmid. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of a laboratory strain (PAO-1) for 1 h and treated for an additional 3-h period with gentamicin-containing culture medium to eliminate extracellular bacteria. The increase in luciferase activity of infected cells was shown to be up to 5.2 ± 0.5-fold higher than the increase in non-infected control HEK293T cells. Additionally, the increase in luciferase activity was shown to be dependent on the number of bacteria added to the cells (Fig. 1A). Flagella Do Not Account for NF-κB Activation of P. aeruginosa-infected Cells—HEK293T cells, although not expressing TLR2 or TLR4, do express TLR5 (20Smith M.F. Mitchell A. Li G. Ding S. Fitzmaurice A.M. Ryan K. Crowe S. Goldberg J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (Jr.): 32552-32560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), which recognize bacterial flagellin. Because in our assay HEK293T cells were exposed to a P. aeruginosa flagellated strain for 1 h before the gentamicin treatment, and flagellin monomers may be released from the bacterial cell, we could not exclude the participation of TLR5 in the response to P. aeruginosa infection detected in our assays. To determine whether flagella accounted for the NF-κB activation, we compared the levels of luciferase activity following infection with the parental laboratory strain PAK and the nonflagellated mutant PAKΔflic. As shown in Fig. 1B there was no significant difference in the luciferase activity of cells infected with PAK or PAKΔflic. Gentamicin protection assays with PAK and PAKΔfliC showed no difference in the invasive ability between these two strains (data not shown). Interestingly, the flagellin-enriched supernatant from the PAK strain was still capable of inducing high levels of NF-κB activation, whereas the supernatant of the PAKΔflic strain had no activity, demonstrating that the flagellin monomers of P. aeruginosa are a potent proinflammatory stimulus (Fig. 1B). The results suggest that flagellin monomers are a better stimulus for TLR5 than the assembled molecule, as described previously (21Smith K.D. Andersen-Nissen E. Hayashi F. Strobe K. Bergman M.A. Barrett S.L. Cookson B.T. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Nod1 Participates in the Innate Immune Response to P. aeruginosa Infection—The observation that PAKΔflic strain could still induce NF-κB activation, apparently in a TLR-independent manner, led us to hypothesize that the recently described cytosolic receptor Nod1 could be involved in the innate immune recognition of P. aeruginosa. It has been demonstrated that Nod1 detects DAP-containing muropeptides from the PG of Gram-negative bacteria. To determine whether Nod1 is involved in P. aeruginosa detection, we first tested whether the highly purified PG of P. aeruginosa is recognized by Nod1. To this end, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with a Nod1 expression vector and the purified PG from P. aeruginosa. The PG induced a 7.0-fold increase in the luciferase activity when compared with the nonstimulated control (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the transient transfection of a dominant-negative form of Nod1 (DN-Nod1) expression vector inhibited the activation of the co-transfected Igκ-luc reporter gene in response to P. aeruginosa PG by ∼3-fold (Fig. 2C). After the observation that P. aeruginosa PG was detected by Nod1, we questioned whether Nod1 would participate in vitro in the induction of NF-κB during P. aeruginosa infection. To this end HEK293T cells transfected with increasing amounts of DN-Nod1 were infected with PAK and PAK ΔfliC strains. The results showed that luciferase activity was inhibited in response to infection PAK and PAKΔfliC strains in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, MEFs from Nod1-deficient mice infected with PAO-1 strains showed significant lower activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3A, luciferase activity in HEK293T cells transfected with increasing amounts of ΔCARD Nod1 (DN-Nod1) and infected with P. aeruginosa strains PAK and PAKΔflic.

To this end MEFs from wild-type and Nod1 knock-out mice were infected with PAO-1 strain for different periods of time, and the supernatants were assayed for the presence of TNF-α, MIP-2, and KC. P. aeruginosa infection did not lead to TNF-α or MIP-2 secretion either in the knock-out cells or in the control wild-type cells (data not shown). In contrast, it induced the secretion of high amounts of KC. At 3 h post-infection the wild-type cells secreted significantly more KC than the knock-out cells. However, at the end of 20 h post-infection both wild-type and knock-out cells secreted similar amounts of KC (Fig. 4A). Nod1 Knock-out Cells Show Delayed Bacterial Killing—Data from the literature have suggested that Nod2, expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, may serve as an antibacterial factor. The fact that Nod1 and Nod2 are structurally closely related and that both activate NF-κB through the same adapter protein (22Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) led us to investigate the survival of internalized P. aeruginosa in wild-type and Nod1-deficient cells after different periods of time. As shown in Fig. 4B, it was again in the early periods post-infection (2 h) that we observed a significant difference between wild-type and knock-out cells. The number of intracellular P. aeruginosa in Nod1 knock-out cells is significantly higher than in wild-type cells. The difference in bacterial survival decreases with time, and after 10 h both wild-type and knock-out have eliminated intracellular P. aeruginosa. Flow cytometry analysis did not show differences in membrane permeability between wild-type and Nod1-deficient cells at 2 h post-infection, indicating that the bacterial killing was not due to the presence of gentamicin in the cells (data not shown). The innate immune system recognizes and responds to an array of bacterial products, such as LPS, lipoproteins, and flagellin, through TLRs (7Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C.

These products are highly conserved among both pathogenic and commensal microorganisms. The recognition of PG by PRRs has been shown to be a important feature in the innate immunity of flies and mammals (23Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J. Lemaitre B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In mammals TLR2 was the first PRR implicated in PG recognition. However, it has been recently demonstrated that TLR2 does not detect PG but likely detects lipoteicoic acid or lipoprotein contaminants in commercial PG preparations, which makes Nod proteins the only known receptors for PG in mammals (8Travassos L.H. Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J. Blanot D. Nahori M.A. Werts C. Boneca I.G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Nod1 was described as a cytosolic receptor that detects specifically DAP-containing muropeptides from Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan. Indeed it has been demonstrated that it plays a major role in the immune response against intracellular bacteria (18Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Yaniv M. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that Nod1 may participate in the detection of Helicobacter pylori, an extracellular pathogen that is able to translocate its PG into the host cells (24Viala J. Chaput C. Boneca I.G. Cardona A. Girardin S.E. Moran A.P. Athman R. Memet S. Huerre M.R. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Sansonetti P.J. Labigne A. Bertin J. Philpott D.J. Ferrero R.L. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1166-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). In the epithelium, Nod1 plays an important role in the activation of NF-κB following infection with Gram-negative bacteria that do not activate NF-κB through TLR signaling pathways (9Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Induction of the host epithelial cell proinflammatory gene program is essential for rapidly activating the host mucosal inflammatory response and is important for bacterial clearance and host survival following infection (25Athman R. Philpott D. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that epithelial cells have at least two independent physiologically relevant signaling pathways for activating NF-κB and epithelial cell proinflammatory genes in response to bacterial infection. One pathway involves TLRs. For example, pathogenic bacteria that have flagella and adhere to or invade epithelial cells can activate NF-κB and NF-κB target genes by signaling through the TLR5 receptor (7Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). Signaling through Nod1 provides epithelial cells with an independent pathway for rapidly activating NF-κB and the subsequent mucosal inflammatory response, which can favor host survival following infection with bacteria that bypass TLR recognition (26Kim J.G. Lee S.J. Kagnoff M.F. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Importantly, both pathways converge at IκB kinase, making IκB kinase a key molecular target for manipulating mucosal inflammatory responses that are initiated by host epithelium. We demonstrated the participation of Nod1, a cytosolic receptor, in the detection of a bacterium that is not considered to be an invasive pathogen. This has been demonstrated using an epithelial cell line that does not express TLRs (except for TLR5) but expresses Nod1 or a dominant-negative form of Nod1. In this case, Nod1 might represent a backup, in addition to the TLR signaling, in detection of intracellular bacteria or those capable of translocating PG into the cells. In addition, even the strain lacking flagella was able to induce NF-κB activation via Nod1, once more strengthening the importance of this back-up system against bacteria that may bypass TLR recognition. P. aeruginosa-induced production of inflammatory mediators is initiated by the interaction between the bacteria and the host cell receptors (27Cripps A.W. Dunkley M.L. Clancy R.L. Kyd J. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 418-424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of an infection, bacteria likely activate the immune response through several PRRs simultaneously. A major effort has been made to identify the molecules responsible for the initiation of P. aeruginosa-induced inflammation. Several cell surface molecules have been implicated in the direct interaction with P. aeruginosa, including complement receptor 3 (28Agramonte-Hevia J. Gonzalez-Arenas A. Barrera D. Velasco-Velazquez M. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 34: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), gangliotetraosylceramide (29de Bentzmann S. Plotkowski C. Puchelle E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154 (-S162): S155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and syndecan-1 (30Park P.W. Pier G.B. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Nature. 2001; 411: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). More recently, independent studies have demonstrated that LPS, flagellin, and CpG DNA from P. aeruginosa initiate inflammatory responses through TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9, respectively (12Zhang J. Xu K. Ambati B. Yu F.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4247-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Greene C.M. Carroll T.P. Smith S.G. Taggart C.C. Devaney J. Griffin S. O'Neill S.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, even though some PRRs seem to play a more relevant role than others, it is likely that neither of these receptors functions individually as the only component responsible for P. aeruginosa-induced immune response in vivo. Furthermore, interaction between some of these receptors potentiates their activity. For example, it has been demonstrated recently that Nod1 and TLR4 act synergistically in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines (32Fritz J.H. Girardin S.E. Fitting C. Werts C. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Caroff M. Cavaillon J.M. Philpott D.J. dib-Conquy M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2459-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 33van Heel D.A. Ghosh S. Butler M. Hunt K. Foxwell B.M. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Playford R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2471-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, despite all that, we still observed differences in the response to P. aeruginosa in MEFs from normal mice and mice deficient in Nod1, all of which express TLRs and other PRRs. This might be because of the elimination of the extracellular bacteria after 1 h of infection in the gentamicin exclusion assays, allowing the observation of a differential response to the intracellular bacteria. Should that be the case it demonstrates again the importance of an intracellular detection system that provides the cells with additional mechanisms to fight the bacteria that manage to reach the cytosol evading extracellular immune responses. Indeed, wild-type MEFs were able to eliminate intracellular bacteria more efficiently than Nod1 knock-out MEFs after 2 h of infection in gentamicin-containing medium. The mechanisms involved in Nod1-dependent intracellular bacterial killing were not investigated in this study. Again, by analogy with TLRs, one can speculate that production of nitric oxide may be involved, but only future investigation will confirm or not such speculations. Two major features of P. aeruginosa infection are the recruitment of neutrophils and the production of various cytokines and chemokines in the local tissue. KC is a CXC chemokine that recruits and activates neutrophils and is up-regulated during infection in epithelial cells. This chemokine is among the earliest new proteins produced at sites of inflammation, consistent with its role in regulating the early infiltration of neutrophils (34Power M.R. Peng Y. Maydanski E. Marshall J.S. Lin T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49315-49322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study, Nod-1-deficient cells secreted significantly less KC in the first hours of infection, which might lead to a delay in providing signals that are essential for the onset of inflammatory response by infected epithelial cells. A number of prior studies have observed differential expression of this chemokine, both in terms of cell type and temporal pattern (35Endlich B. Armstrong D. Brodsky J. Novotny M. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3586-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Tsai W.C. Strieter R.M. Mehrad B. Newstead M.W. Zeng X. Standiford T.J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4289-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In accordance with our results, in several models of bacterial infection in mice, maximum KC expression occurs in the first hours, whereas MIP-2 (another CXC chemokine that we have tested and that was not detected in periods of infection of up to 24 h) peaks on day 2. Complex temporal patterns of chemokine expression in vivo have been reported previously in a number of settings; however, the regulation of such expression has not been explored in detail. In murine models of acute Gram-negative bacterial and fungal pneumonia, these chemokines appear crucial to the innate host defense. Specifically, in a murine model of Pseudomonas pneumonia, KC levels are associated with the presence of neutrophils in the lung (19Kooguchi K. Hashimoto S. Kobayashi A. Kitamura Y. Kudoh I. Wiener-Kronish J. Sawa T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3164-3169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that site-specific transgenic expression of KC resulted in enhanced clearance of bacteria after Pseudomonas challenge (36Tsai W.C. Strieter R.M. Mehrad B. Newstead M.W. Zeng X. Standiford T.J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4289-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to look at whether this delayed secretion in Nod1 knock-out mice leads to decreased neutrophil recruitment and exacerbation of disease. In summary, we conclude that Nod1 expressed by epithelial cells takes part in the activation of NF-κB and the up-regulated production of an important epithelial cell chemoattractant in response to P. aeruginosa. Murine models of infection will help to further elucidate the role of Nod1 in P. aeruginosa infection."

However, the exact mechanism is currently unknown. We examined a potential role for Wnt signaling and functional cross-talk of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in osteoblast differentiation. To assess the contribution of Wnt, we generated C2C12 cells over-expressing Wnt3a or Wnt5a and treated these with BMP-2. We showed that expression of matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein was induced by BMP-2 in Wnt3a over-expressing C2C12 cells but not in Wnt5a over-expressing C2C12 cells. Over-expression of Wnt3a blocked BMP-2-induced inhibition of myotube formation in C2C12 cells when switched to low mitogen medium. In these cultures, expression of inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation (Id) 1, a helix-loop-helix protein induced by BMP-2, decreased in stable Wnt3a- but not in Wnt5a-expressing cells. This suppression is mediated by a GC-rich region of the BMP-2-responsive element of the Id1 gene promoter, and interaction between Smad1/4 and β-catenin is crucial for Wnt-mediated suppression of the BMP-2 response in C2C12 cells. Over-expression of the inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, Dickkopf, inhibits this suppression. In contrast, BMP-2 or Smad1/4 up-regulated Wnt3a or activated β-catenin-induced lymphoid-enhancing factor 1/T cell factor-dependent transcriptional activity.

The Wnt secreted proteins are a family of glycosylated lipid-modified proteins that are powerful regulators of embryonic development, cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. Signaling is initiated by Wnt ligand binding to two receptor molecules, the seven-transmembrane domain protein receptors of the Frizzled family and lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) (1Nusse R. Development. 2003; 130: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Two types of Wnt proteins have been identified: one class is β-catenin-dependent canonical Wnts such as Wnt1, Wnt2, Wnt3, and Wnt3a; the other class is the so-called “noncanonical” Wnts such as Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Wnt6, and Wnt7a, which is independent of or inhibits β-catenin signaling (2Huelsken J.

Conventional Wnt signaling causes stabilization of β-catenin and its accumulation in a complex with the transcription factor Lef1/Tcf, which regulates expression of target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 (2Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 3Huelsken J. Behrens J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3977-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Dickkopf (Dkk) is a secreted protein that acts as a Wnt pathway inhibitor by binding to and antagonizing LRP5/6 (4Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Conversely, the so-called “noncanonical Wnt pathway” mediated by the Wnt5a subclass of Wnts triggers intracellular Ca2+ release to activate protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and then activates TAK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase and nemo-like kinase (NLK) MAPK (5Ishitani T.

NLK phosphorylates Lef1/Tcf and inhibits the interaction of the β-catenin-Lef1/Tcf complex with DNA (6Ishitani T. Kishida S. Hyodo-Miura J. Ueno N. Yasuda J. Waterman M. Shibuya H. Moon R.T.

A loss of function mutation in LRP5 was found to associate with osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder (7Gong Y. Slee R.B. Fukai N. Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Reginato A.M.

Moreover, a Gly171-to-Val substitution mutation in LRP5 results in a high bone mass phenotype (9Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. N. Engl. J.

Moran R.A. Bex F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 960-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). These phenotypes associated with the loss of function or substitution mutations of LRP5 indicate that Wnt signaling might be involved in modulating the regulation of bone mass and bone formation (11Westendorf J.J. Kahler R.A. Schroeder T.M. Gene. 2004; 341: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). During osteogenesis, pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into preosteoblasts, which then differentiate into mature osteoblasts that deposit the necessary components to form bone matrix and subsequent mineralization. Upon differentiation into osteoblasts, the cells express differentiation-related phenotypes such as a high level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), parathyroid hormone receptor, type I collagen, osteocalcin, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), and bone sialoproteins (12Aubin J.E. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2001; 2: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, Bain et al. (13Bain G. Muller T. Wang X. Papkoff J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) described that stimulation of canonical Wnt signaling using constitutively active forms of β-catenin induces the activity of ALP, which is one of the differentiation markers in osteoblastic cells. However, the exact mechanisms and signaling regulating osteoblastic differentiation or function and bone formation still remain to be elucidated. MEPE was one of the bone matrix proteins identified from cDNA as a tumor-derived phosphaturic factor in oncogenic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia (14Rowe P.S. de Zoysa P.A. Dong R. Wang H.R. White K.E. Econs M.J. Oudet C.L. Genomics. 2000; 67: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar); this cDNA codes for a matrix protein consisting of a serine/glycine-rich secreted peptide that contains numerous potential phosphorylation sites and one RGD motif (15Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E1-E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This protein is a member of the SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein) family of matrix proteins, which includes MEPE, bone sialoprotein, dentin matrix protein 1, dentin sialophosphoprotein, enamelin, and osteopontin, expressed in bones and/or teeth (16Fisher L.W. Fedarko N.S. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of this mRNA is bone-specific and highly expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes (15Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E1-E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Furthermore, targeted disruption of the MEPE gene in mice results in increased bone formation and bone mass (17Gowen L.C. Petersen D.N. Mansolf A.L. Qi H. Stock J.L. Tkalcevic G.T. Simmons H.A. Crawford D.T. Chidsey-Frink K.L. Ke H.Z. McNeish J.D. Brown T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1998-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although MEPE is perhaps involved in the regulation of bone metabolism in vivo, regulation of the expression of this gene during osteoblastic differentiation has not yet been identified. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of various types of cells and organs not only in embryonic development but also in postnatal physiological function (18Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 218-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). At least 15 types of BMPs have been identified in humans. Among them, BMP-2 alone is sufficient to induce ectopic bone formation when it is implanted into the tissues of rodents. BMP-2 is reported to trigger osteoblast differentiation and to up-regulate the expression of most genes encoding osteoblastic phenotype-related proteins in vitro (18Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 218-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Genetic disruptions of BMPs have resulted in various skeletal and extraskeletal developmental abnormalities (19Zhao G.Q. Genesis. 2003; 35: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Signaling by TGF-β superfamily members including BMPs is initiated following their binding to two types (type I and II) of their respective serine/threonine kinase receptors. In the intracellular signaling of BMPs, eight Smad proteins have been identified to play critical roles in mammals (20Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M. Hara T. Furuya T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The receptor Smads (R-Smads), consisting of Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8, are phosphorylated directly by type I receptors and then form complexes with the Co-Smad, Smad4 and move into the nucleus, where they bind to the regulatory regions of the target genes and regulate their expression. Inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation 1 (Id1), one of the basic helix-loop-helix proteins, was identified as a gene for inhibition of myogenesis and as a typical early response gene in BMP treatment in various types of cells in mice and humans (21Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : 151-PE40Google Scholar). We previously reported that the expression of Id1 was stimulated within 1 h after the addition of BMP-2 in C2C12 cells (22Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Id family proteins such as Id1, Id2, and Emc, which lack the basic DNA binding domain, are capable of forming heterodimers with other basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factors, such as MyoD family proteins, that have been implicated in transcriptional regulation during differentiation of certain cell types including myoblasts. The helix-loop-helix heterodimers formed with Id proteins inhibit transcriptional, activity as Id proteins lack DNA-binding activity (23Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we identified a 29-bp GC-rich element as a BMP-2-responsive element in the 5′-flanking region of the human Id1 gene and showed that complexes of Smad1 and Smad4 recognize this element in response to BMP-2 (24Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Here, we have established stimulatory Wnt3a and inhibitory Wnt5a canonical Wnt-expressing pluripotent C2C12 cells to elucidate the responses of canonical Wnt signaling to modulation by BMP-2. In these cultures, expression of MEPE was induced by BMP-2 in Wnt3a over-expressing C2C12 (Wnt3a-C2C12) cells but not in either Wnt5a over-expressing C2C12 (Wnt5a-C2C12) cells or vehicle-transfected C2C12 cells. C2C12 cells form multinucleated myotubes when switched to low mitogen medium, and this can be inhibited by the addition of BMP-2. However over-expression of Wnt3a blocked this BMP-2-induced inhibition of myotube formation. We also show that Wnt3a down-regulates expression of the BMP-2-responsive gene, Id1, and this suppression is mediated by a 29-bp GC-rich region of the BMP-2-responsive element of the Id1 gene promoter. Interaction between β-catenin and Smad1/4 is found to be crucial for Wnt-mediated suppression of the BMP-2 response. In contrast, BMP-2 or Smad1/4 up-regulates β-catenin-induced Lef1/Tcf-dependent transcriptional activity. These findings reveal that Wnt signaling links BMP target gene expression and illustrate the functional role of Wnt signaling in BMP-2-regulated mesenchymal cell differentiation. Cell Cultures—Cells of the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 (Cell Systems, Kirkland, WA) were cultured in α-MEM (Sigma) containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin (Meiji, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) at 37 °C in 100-mm cell culture dishes (Corning, Corning, NY) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Establishment of Stably Transfected C2C12 Cells—Cells were plated 1 day before transfection in α-MEM at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well (24-well plate). The cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of Wnt3a-pUSEamp, Wnt5a-pUSEamp, or empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, the medium was changed to α-MEM containing neomycin/Geneticin (G418) (Promega, Madison, WI) at 0.1 μg/ml. The cells were passaged, and the clones were selected in α-MEM supplemented with G418 and 10% FBS. To rule out the possibility of clonal variation, we characterized at least three independent clones for each stable transfection. To examine the effects of Wnt over-expression on the action of BMP in endogenous differentiation, control C2C12 or stably transfected C2C12 cells were inoculated at 1.5 × 106/cm2 and cultured in α-MEM containing 10% FBS (growth medium). On day 1 the medium was replaced with α-MEM containing 2.5% FBS (low mitogen medium), and the cells were cultured with BMP-2 or vehicle for 3–9 days. Reagents—Recombinant human BMP-2 (25Wang E.A.

Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted from the cells at the indicated time points using Isogen (Nippongene, Toyama, Japan) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to remove any contaminating genomic DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Complementary DNA was synthesized with Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) using an oligo(dT)15 primer (1 μm) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each PCR reaction was carried out in 50 μl of mixture containing 1 μl of cDNA, 5 μl of 10× Qiagen PCR buffer, 10 μl of 5× Q-Solution PCR buffer, 1 μl of 10 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix, 0.1 μm each sense and antisense primers, and 0.5 μl of TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen). Each reaction consisted of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min followed by three-step cycling: denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at a temperature optimized for each primer pair for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min.

For subsequent use, amplified PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM®-T Vector (Promega) using the pGEM®-T Vector System II, and the sequences of the subcloned cDNAs were checked with a DNA sequencer (Prism 310, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All the primers were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan). Amplification products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining followed by UV light illumination. ALP Staining—Confluent cells in 100-mm culture dishes were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 100% methanol, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then overlaid with 5 ml of 0.15 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Wako, Osaka, Japan) plus 0.3 mg/ml of nitro blue tetrazolium (Wako) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 0.01 n NaOH, and 0.05 mm MgCl2 followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h.

Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). The reaction products of biotin-streptavidin were visualized using the AEC substrate kit (Histofine, Nichirei Co., Tokyo). Reporter Constructs—Luciferase reporter plasmids of Id985WT-luc, Id985mutB-luc, IdWT4F-luc, and IdmutB4F-luc were generated as described previously (24Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In brief, the 1079-bp Id1 promoter fragment (-985 to +94) was subcloned to pGL3 Basic (Promega) (Id985WT-luc). Id985mutB-luc was generated by PCR using the specific primer of 5′-ttctcgagCATGGCGACCGCCCGCGCTTTGCCA-3′ (lowercase and underlining indicate flanking sequences and mutations, respectively). To generate IdWT4F-luc and IdmutB4F-luc, the specific oligo DNAs of the 29-bp BMP-responsive element with the wild-type or the mutB sequence flanked by six nucleotides were annealed, digested with XhoI and SalI, and subcloned into the pGL3 promoter (Promega). Topflash is a Tcf reporter plasmid containing two sets (with the second set in the reverse orientation) of three copies of the Lef1/Tcf binding site (wild type) upstream of the thymidine kinase minimum promoter and luciferase open reading frame (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY).

Transient Cell Transfection and Assay for Luciferase Activity—For the reporter assay, transfection of plasmid DNA into cells was performed using the cationic lipid reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). In brief, cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well (24-well plate) and cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were transfected with reporter plasmid and expression plasmid as indicated in the legends for Figs. 3 and 4. BMP-2 or vehicle was then added at the concentration indicated in the legends for Figs. 3 and 4. The cells were subsequently cultured in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were then harvested, and luciferase activities in the cell extracts were determined using a PicaGene® (Toyo Ink, Tokyo) and read using a Mini Lumat LB 9506 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each transfection, additional cells were transfected with 100 ng of the pTKβ plasmid (Invitrogen) for β-galactosidase assays, to account for the variation in transfection efficiency, and luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. All experiments were performed on triplicate samples and were independently repeated four to six times.FIGURE 4The constitutively active form of β-catenin represses transcriptional activity of the BMP-responsive element induced by BMP-2, and over-expression of Dkk reverses Wnt3a-mediated suppression in the BMP-responsive element of the Id1 gene.

https://openalex.org/W2167535306,"South Africa's Mediterranean-climate fynbos shrubland is a hot spot of species diversity, but its diversity patterns contrast strongly with other high-diversity areas, including the Amazon rain forest. With its extremely high levels of endemism and species turnover, fynbos is made up of dissimilar local communities that are species-rich but relatively poor in rare species. Using neutral ecological theory, we show that the relative species-abundance distributions in fynbos can be explained by migration rates that are two orders of magnitude lower than they are in tropical rain forests. Speciation rates, which are indexed by the “biodiversity parameter” Θ, are estimated to be higher than they are in any previously examined plant system."

While NADH dehydrogenase (NDH) is a critical site of this O2⋅¯ production; its mechanism of O2⋅¯ generation is not known. Therefore, the catalytic function of NDH in the mediation of O2⋅¯ generation was investigated by EPR spin-trapping. In the presence of NADH, O2⋅¯ generation from NDH was observed and was inhibited by diphenyleneiodinium chloride (DPI), indicating involvement of the FMN-binding site of NDH. Addition of FMN increased O2⋅¯ production. Destruction of the cysteine ligands of iron-sulfur clusters decreased O2⋅¯ generation, suggesting a secondary role of this site. This inhibitory effect was reversed by addition of FMN. However, FMN addition could not reverse the inhibition of NDH by either DPI or heat denaturation, demonstrating involvement of both FMN and its FMN-binding protein moiety in the catalysis of O2⋅¯ generation. O2⋅¯ production by NDH also induced self-inactivation. Immunospin-trapping with anti-DMPO antibody and subsequent mass spectrometry was used to define the sites of oxidative damage of NDH. A DMPO adduct was detected on the 51-kDa subunit and was O2⋅¯-dependent. Alkylation of the cysteine residues of NDH significantly inhibited NDH-DMPO spin adduct formation, indicating involvement of protein thiyl radicals. LC/MS/MS analysis of a tryptic digest of the 51-kDa polypeptide revealed that cysteine (Cys206) and tyrosine (Tyr177) were specific sites of NDH-derived protein radical formation. Thus, two domains of the 51-kDa subunit, Gly200-Ala-Gly-Ala-Tyr-Ile-Cys206-Gly-Glu-Glu-Thr-Ala-Leu-Ile-Glu-Ser-Ile-Glu-Gly-Lys219 and Ala176-Tyr177-Glu-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ile-Gly-Lys184, were demonstrated to be susceptible to oxidative attack, and their oxidative modification results in decreased electron transfer activity.

Two segments of the ETC have been widely hypothesized to be responsible for O2⋅¯ generation in mitochondria (6Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). One site is located on complex III. At this site, O2⋅¯ production is mediated through the Q-cycle mechanism, in which electron leakage results from the auto-oxidation of ubisemiquinone and reduced cytochrome b566 (7Turrens J.F.

J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Purified bovine heart complex I (or NADH ubiquinone reductase) contains up to 46 different subunits with a total molecular mass of 980 kDa (12Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J.

With the use of chaotropic anions such as perchlorate, complex I can be resolved into three fractions: a flavoprotein fraction (Fp), an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein fraction (Ip), and a hydrophobic protein fraction (Hp). The redox centers of complex I that are involved in mediation of two-electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone include a non-covalent binding FMN, 8 Fe-S centers, and ubiquinone (14Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 15Yano T. Dunham W.R. Ohnishi T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1744-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to the function of electron transfer required for energy transduction in mitochondria, complex I is also responsible for O2⋅¯ generation, which is frequently linked to disease pathophysiology (16Bugiani M. Invernizzi F. Alberio S. Briem E. Lamantea E. Carrara F. Moroni I. Farina L. Spada M. Donati M.A. Uziel G. Zeviani M. Biochim. Biophys.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2958) Google Scholar). Two redox components of complex I are logically hypothesized to be involved in the electron leakage for O2⋅¯ generation: one located on the FMN-containing Fp fraction, and one on the Q-binding site that mediates ubiquinone reduction. Based on this hypothesis, reduced FMN semiquinone radical (FMNH·) (22Kudin A.P. Bimpong-Buta N.Y. Vielhaber S. Elger C.E. Kunz W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4127-4135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and ubisemiquinone radical (O2⋅¯) can provide the sources of O2⋅¯ generation. The Fp fraction of complex I contains the enzymatic activity of NADH dehydrogenase (NDH), and can be isolated as a three subunit subcomplex from submitochondrial particles (SMP) (13Zhu J. Structure-Function Studies of Electron Transfer Complexs in Bovine Heart Mitochondria. 2004; (Ph.D. Dissertation, Oklahoma State University)Google Scholar). Therefore, the Fp-containing three subunit subcomplex is normally termed as NDH. Of the three subunits, the 51-kDa subunit is an NADH-binding polypeptide hosting one FMN and one [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur center (N3 center) with an Em,7 ∼–250 mV. The 24-kDa subunit hosts one [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur center (N1a) with an Em,7 ∼ –370 mV (14Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 23Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The 9-kDa subunit does not contain any cofactor. NDH retains the same kinetic parameters for NADH dehydrogenation, NADH binding, and NAD+ binding as are found in complex I, but its electron transfer properties are markedly different. It can catalyze NADH oxidation in vitro by a variety of electron acceptors such as ubiquinone-1 (Q1), ferricyanide, menadione, cytochrome c, and 2,6-dichloroindophenol. Because of the absence of the Q-binding domain of Hp and most of the iron-sulfur clusters of Ip, NDH provides a simplified and excellent model system to study the molecular mechanism of FMN moiety-mediated O2⋅¯ generation and the role of this O2⋅¯ in inducing oxidative damage to the protein. It is widely recognized that EPR spin-trapping with DEPMPO (5-diethoxylphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) is a sensitive and reliable approach to measure O2⋅¯ production in biological systems. DEPMPO can efficiently trap O2⋅¯ to form a stable adduct, as demonstrated in several enzymatic systems such as eNOS (24Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H.

Immunospin-trapping with a polyclonal antibody against DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) nitrone adduct has developed as a powerful approach to detecting protein radicals resulting from the oxidative attack of ROS (30Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1214-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The antibody exhibits the advantage of high specificity and high sensitivity detection of protein-derived radicals. The present investigation was undertaken to address the fundamental mechanism of O2⋅¯ generation by NDH and its effects on the enzyme. We show by EPR spin-trapping that the FMN and the FMN-binding protein moiety in NDH play the primary role in controlling enzyme-mediated O2⋅¯ production. We further observed by immunospin-trapping with anti-DMPO antibody that the 51-kDa subunit of NDH is the site of O2⋅¯-induced protein radicals. By mass spectrometry (MS), these NDH-derived protein radicals were shown to be specifically located at Cys206 and Tyr177 of the 51-kDa subunit. Ammonium sulfate, Q1, Zn/Cu superoxide dismutase (SOD), sodium cholate, DPI, p-chloromercuribenzoate (CMB), NEM, FMN, β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form, NADPH), and β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form, NADH) were purchased from Sigma and used as received. Catalase (bovine liver) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN). The DEPMPO spin trap was purchased from ALEXIS Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The DMPO spin trap from Aldrich was vacuum-distilled twice and stored under nitrogen at –80 °C until needed. Bovine heart mitochondrial NDH was prepared according to the published method with modifications (13Zhu J. Structure-Function Studies of Electron Transfer Complexs in Bovine Heart Mitochondria. 2004; (Ph.D. Dissertation, Oklahoma State University)Google Scholar). SMP were prepared (31Vinogradov A.D. King T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and used as starting material. 2.5 pounds of trimmed bovine hearts with fat and connective tissues cleaned off were routinely used for SMP preparation. SMP preparation was homogenized with 220 ml of cold water, and then subjected to centrifugation at 95,900 × g for 1 h. The precipitate obtained was homogenized in cold water to a final volume of 1.2 liters. The pH of SMP homogenate was adjusted to 5.5 with 2 n acetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rpm using a Beckman JS 4.2 rotor. The precipitate was then immediately washed with 550 ml of cold water and then homogenized with cold water to a final volume of 400 ml with a protein concentration of about 40 mg/ml. The pH of homogenate was adjusted to 4.8 with 2 n acetic acid. 100% ethanol was added to a final concentration of 9% (v/v). The sample was put into a water bath at 55 °C with constant stirring until it reached 40 °C and stayed at 40 °C for 10 min. The sample was immediately brought to an ice-salt water bath with constant stirring until it reached 4 °C. The homogenate was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 95,900 × g for 30 min, and the gold/red color supernatant was collected. The crude NDH was concentrated by precipitation with 57% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The precipitate of crude NDH was dissolved in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (buffer A), and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with buffer A. The effluent obtained from the Sephadex G-25 column was immediately applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed with buffer A until no colored effluent came out. The pure NDH was eluted with buffer A containing 25 mm NaCl. Pure NDH was then concentrated by precipitation with 60% saturation of ammonium sulfate, kept under argon saturation, and stored at –80 °C until use. The purity of isolated NDH was examined by SDS gel electrophoresis using a 4–20% gradient of polyacrylamide. Analytical Methods—Optical spectra were measured on a Shimadzu 2401 UV/VIS recording spectrophotometer. The protein concentration of SMP and NDH was determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of Q1 was determined by absorbance spectra from NaBH4 reduction using a millimolar extinction coefficient ϵ(275–290 nm) = 12.25 mm–1 cm–1 (33Redfearn E.R. Whittaker P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 118: 413-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The electron transfer activity (ETA) of NDH was assayed by measuring NADH oxidation by Q1 (34Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). An appropriate amount of NDH was added to an assay mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.4 mm Q1, and 0.15 mm NADH. The NDH activity was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The specific activity (nmol NADH oxidation/min/mg protein) of NDH was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient ϵ340 nm = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1 (34Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). EPR measurements were performed using the EPR Core Facilities at the Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute. Experiments were carried out on a Bruker EMX spectrometer operating at 9.86 GHz with 100 kHz modulation frequency at room temperature. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 50-μl capillary, which was then positioned in the HS cavity (Bruker Instrument, Billerica, MA). The sample was scanned using the following parameters: center field, 3510 G; sweep width, 140 G; power, 20 milliwatt; receiver gain, 2 × 105; modulation amplitude, 1 G; time of conversion, 81.92 ms; time constant, 327.68 ms; signal average, 3 scans. The spectral simulations were performed using the WinSim program developed by Duling of NIEHS (35Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was mixed with the Laemmli sample buffer at a ratio 4:1 (v/v), incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, and then immediately loaded onto a 4–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gradient gel. Samples were run at room temperature for 2 h at 100 V. Protein bands were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TTBS) with 5% dry milk (Bio-Rad). The blots were then incubated overnight with anti-DMPO polyclonal antibody (a gift from Dr. Ronald Mason of NIEHS, Research Triangle Park, NC) at 4 °C. Blots were then washed three times in TTBS, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG in TTBS at room temperature. The blots were again washed twice in TTBS, twice in TBS, and then visualized using ECL Western Blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The signal intensity of blotting was digitalized and quantitated using an Alphalmager™ high performance gel documentation & image analysis system, model 3300 (Alpha Innotech Co. San Leandro, CA). The sample of NDH was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands on the gel were then stained with Coomassie Blue and subjected to MS measurement. (a) In-Gel Digestion—Gels were digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) and chymotrypsin (Roche Diagnostics) using the Montage In-Gel Digestion Kit from Millipore (Bedford, MA) following the manufacturer's recommended protocols with minor changes for optimization of peptide extraction. Briefly, the bands of interest were trimmed as closely as possible to minimize background polyacrylamide material. After washing twice in 50% methanol/5% acetic acid for several hours, the gel bands dehydrated with acetonitrile were reconstituted with dithiothreitol solution to reduce the cysteines. Iodoacetamide was added to alkylate the cysteines, and the gel was washed again with cycles of acetonitrile and 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The gels were then dried using a speed vac. 50 μl of trypsin (20 ng/μl) or chymotrypsin (25 ng/μl) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer were added to the dehydrated gel. The gel was set on ice for 10 min for rehydration before the addition of another 20 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The mixture was then incubated at room temperature overnight. The peptides were extracted from the gel using 50% acetonitrile with 5% formic acid several times and pooled together. The extracted pools were concentrated in a speed vac to ∼25 μl. (b) Nano-LC MS/MS—Capillary-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Nano-LC MS/MS) was performed on a Micromass hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight Q-Tof (TM) II (Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK) mass spectrometer equipped with an orthogonal nanospray source (New Objective, Woburn, MA) operated in positive ion mode. The capillary LC system was a Dionex UltiMate (TM) system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Solvent A was water containing 50 mm acetic acid and Solvent B was acetonitrile. A 5-cm 75 μm ID BioBasic C18 column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed directly in the nanospray tip was used for chromatographic separations. 2.5-μl aliquots of each sample were injected onto the column for the analysis. Peptides were eluted directly off the column into the Q-TOF system using a gradient of 2–80% B over 48 min, with a flow rate of ∼500 nl/min. A total run time was 55 min. The nanospray capillary voltage was set at 3.0 kV and the cone voltage at 40 V. The source temperature was maintained at 100 °C. Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 400–2,000 every 0.9 s with a resolution of 8,000 (FWHM) and recorded using MassLynx 4.0 with automatic switching functions. When the desired peak was detected at a minimum of 15 ion counts, the mass spectrometer automatically switched to acquire CID MS/MS spectrum of the individual peptide, and the mass spectra were acquired from m/z 75–2000 to detect immonium ions. Collision energy was set dependent on charge state recognition properties. Sequence information from the MS/MS data were processed using the Mascot Distiller software using standard data processing parameters. Data base searches were performed using the MASCOT (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) and PEAKS (Bioinformatics Solutions, Waterloo, ON, CA) programs. DEPMPO Spin-Trapping of O2⋅¯ Generated from NDH in the Presence of NADH—Mitochondrial complex I-mediated O2⋅¯ production has been reported using a variety of indirect methods. To provide unambiguous and direct measurement and confirmation of this O2⋅¯ generation, we employed EPR spin-trapping with DEPMPO. Purified NDH (50 μg/ml, 0.62 μm) was incubated with DEPMPO (20 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the reaction was then initiated by the addition of NADH (0.5 mm). The EPR spectra recorded (Fig. 1A, solid line) after signal averaging three scans revealed a multi-line spectrum of a DEPMPO adduct. The spectrum was simulated as a superposition of two isomers of the DEPMPO radical adduct of O2⋅¯ (DEPMPO/·OOH, Fig. 1A, dashed line), based on the hyperfine coupling constants: isomer 1, aN = 13.14 G, aHβ = 11.04 G, aHγ = 0.96 G, aP = 49.96 G (80% relative concentration); isomer 2, aN = 13.18 G, aHβ = 12.59 G, aHγ = 3.46 G, aP = 48.2 G (20% relative concentration) (36Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The O2⋅¯ generation mediated by NDH absolutely depended on both enzyme and substrate (Fig. 1, B and C). When the purified NDH was subjected to heat denaturation at 70 °C for 5 min, more than 95% of the superoxide generation activity (SGA) was abolished (Fig. 1D), suggesting that ETA is required. The addition of SOD (0.33 units/μl) prior to NADH quenched the signal of DEPMPO/·OOH almost completely. Replacement of NADH with the same amount of NADPH yielded a SGA of about 7% of the original (Fig. 1F), demonstrating the substrate specificity for NDH-mediated O2⋅¯ generation. The SGA of NDH was inhibited by DPI (>95% inhibition at 25 μm DPI (Fig. 1G)), suggesting that the FMN-binding moiety was involved in the O2⋅¯ generation. In the presence of various amounts of Q1 as an electron acceptor, the SGA was gradually decreased (data not shown). The maximal reduction (∼85% decrease) of SGA was observed at the concentration of 400 μm Q1 used (Fig. 1H). When the rate of O2⋅¯ production by NDH, as detected by DEPMPO spin-trapping, was graphed versus NADH concentration, it was observed to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 2). The apparent Km for NADH was estimated to be 0.234 mm based on a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 2, inset). The Roles of Redox Centers of FMN and Fe-S Clusters in O2⋅¯ Production by NDH—The inhibitory effect of DPI on the NDH-mediated O2⋅¯ production implies that both FMN and the FMN-binding moiety of the 51 kDa subunit play critical roles in controlling O2⋅¯ generation by NDH (22Kudin A.P. Bimpong-Buta N.Y. Vielhaber S. Elger C.E. Kunz W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4127-4135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 37Li Y. Trush M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To establish the role of FMN cofactor, the FMN (1 μm) was added to a reaction mixture containing NDH, DEPMPO, and NADH. The O2⋅¯ production measured by DEPMPO spin-trapping was enhanced by 115%, and by up to 300% when the concentration of FMN was increased to 10 μm (Fig. 3). In the absence of NDH, however, FMN and NADH induced only trace O2⋅¯ formation (Fig. 3). Together with the inhibitory effect of DPI and the enhancing effect of FMN, these results imply that mediation of O2⋅¯ generation is mainly controlled by non-covalently binding FMN and the protein moiety of the FMN-binding site. NDH contains two Fe-S centers, 4Fe-4S and 2Fe-2S, located on the 51-kDa subunit and the 24-kDa subunit, respectively. The binding motifs are CXXCXXCX39C (C, cysteine residue) for 4Fe-4S (38Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), and CXXXXCX35CXXXC for 2Fe-2S (39Yano T. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To further establish the essential role of FMN in the SGA activity of NDH, CMB was used to modify the cysteine ligands of the Fe-S clusters (22Kudin A.P. Bimpong-Buta N.Y. Vielhaber S. Elger C.E. Kunz W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4127-4135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The enzyme suffered a 50% loss of ETA without significant loss of its SGA at a CMB concentration of 5 μm (Fig. 4). However, when 7.5 μm CMB was added, the ETA of NDH decreased up to 75%, while the NDH-derived SGA was diminished by up to 80% (Fig. 4). More than 90% of both the ETA and SGA were inhibited when the concentration of CMB was increased to 10 μm (Fig. 4). Complete inhibition of the ETA and SGA was achieved when the dosage of CMB was further increased to 15 μm. These results imply that both Fe-S clusters are critical for NDH-derived ETA and one specific Fe-S center of NDH is involved in NDH-derived SGA. Although the partial destruction of the Fe-S cluster partially diminished the NDH-derived SGA, it was expected that the Fe-S cluster should play a secondary role in controlling the catalysis of O2⋅¯ generation by NDH. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of CMB (7.5 μm used) on the SGA of NDH should be re-activated by external addition of FMN (10 μm). As expected, the addition of FMN (10 μm) to CMB-inhibited NDH increased its O2⋅¯ generating activity from 20 to 165% (Fig. 5C), thus further confirming the primary role of the FMN cofactor in the SGA of NDH. In the absence of NDH, a trace amount of DEPMPO/·OOH (∼10–12%, Fig. 5D) was detected; this O2⋅¯ generation was presumably because of auto-oxidation of reduced FMN, forming FMNH·. However, a similar enhancement of SGA by an exogenous supplement of FMN was not observed in the case of NDH subjected to complete inhibition by higher dosage (15 μm) of CMB. As indicated in Fig. 5, E and F, the addition of FMN (10 μm) to the CMB-inhibited NDH only increased its SGA to the basal level of non-enzymatic reactions, indicating that a fully or partially active iron-sulfur cluster is required in FMN/NDH-mediated O2⋅¯ production. The Role of the FMN-binding Protein Moiety in O2⋅¯ Production Mediated by NDH—Previous results demonstrated the enhancing effect of FMN cofactor in O2⋅¯ generation mediated by NDH. It is important to know whether the protein moiety of FMN-binding site is required in this enhancement. To address this question, the NDH was pretreated with DPI (25 μm), and followed by measuri"

Generation of Aβ involves β-secretase and γ-secretase activities and is regulated by membrane trafficking of the proteins involved in Aβ production. Here we describe a new small molecule, EHT 1864, which blocks the Rac1 signaling pathways. In vitro, EHT 1864 blocks Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 production but does not impact sAPPα levels and does not inhibit β-secretase. Rather, EHT 1864 modulates APP processing at the level of γ-secretase to prevent Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 generation. This effect does not result from a direct inhibition of the γ-secretase activity and is specific for APP cleavage, since EHT 1864 does not affect Notch cleavage. In vivo, EHT 1864 significantly reduces Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 levels in guinea pig brains at a threshold that is compatible with delaying plaque accumulation and/or clearing the existing plaque in brain. EHT 1864 is the first derivative of a new chemical series that consists of candidates for inhibiting Aβ formation in the brain of AD patients.

The pathology of AD is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques (1Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and pronounced cell death. The β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) (2Buxbaum J.D. Oishi M. Chen H.I. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Jaffe E.A. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10075-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) is the main constituent of senile plaques found in AD brains. Furthermore, extracellular Aβ 42 appears toxic to neurons in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 3Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Aβ is generated by proteolysis of an integral membrane protein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), via at least two post-translational pathways. The amyloidogenic cleavage of APP is a sequential processing of APP initiated by β-secretase (BACE), which cleaves APP within the luminal domain or at the cell surface, generating the N terminus of Aβ (4Vassar R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 23: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This cleavage generates several membrane-bound proteolytic C-terminal fragments (CTFs), such as the 99-residue β-CTF (also called C99), as well as the secreted APP ectodomain sAPPβ. The C terminus of Aβ is subsequently generated by intramembranous cleavage of CTFs by γ-secretase, producing either Aβ 40 or Aβ 42. The cleavages at residues 40–42 are referred to as γ-cleavage, and the cleavages at residues 49–52 are referred to as ϵ-cleavage (5Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The nonamyloidogenic cleavage of APP, which precludes Aβ generation, is mediated by α-secretase, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17, in a reaction believed to occur primarily on the plasma membrane. This proteolytic cleavage by α-secretase occurs within the Aβ region and produces soluble APP (sAPPα), the dominant processing product, and the residual membrane-bound 10-kDa CTF (CTFα, also called C83). Like C99, C83 is a substrate for γ-secretase, which cleaves C83 to generate the nonamyloidogenic p3 fragment. APP is also a substrate of caspase activities that cleave its cytosolic domain (6Weidemann A. Paliga K. Durrwang U. Reinhard F.B. Schuckert O. Evin G. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5823-5829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).

A. 2001; 98: 5371-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids and are also the principal compartment in which Aβ is found (9Lee S.J.

BACE and γ-secretase also localize to these lipid raft microdomains, in endosomes and post-Golgi compartments, enabling them to cleave APP (11Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L.

More generally, lipid rafts contribute to trafficking of proteins and lipids in the secretory and endocytic pathways by regulating vesicle formation and sorting. They also act as signaling platforms for various pathways including GTPase-dependent actin rearrangements (13Jaksits S. Bauer W. Kriehuber E. Zeyda M. Stulnig T.M. Stingl G. Fiebiger E. Maurer D. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1628-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) induced by small GTP-binding proteins from the Rho family such as Rac, Rho, and Cdc42. These small G proteins are activated by GTP/GDP exchange and regulate a wide variety of cellular functions such as gene expression, cytoskeletal reorganization, and vesicle/secretory trafficking. The activated Cdc42 or Rac then activates the PAK Ser/Thr kinase family. Recent studies showed the participation of Rho in the formation of stress fibers, whereas activated Cdc42 induces the formation of filopodia, thin finger-like extensions containing actin bundles. Rac regulates the formation of lamellipodia or ruffles, curtain-like extensions often formed along the edge of the cell (see Ref. 14Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar for a review). In the brain, these small G proteins participate in the morphological changes of neurons, localized in growth cones, axons, dendritic trunks, and spines (15van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the mature brain, it has been shown that Rac1, but not Rho nor Cdc42, is present in the raft domain of neuronal membranes (16Kumanogoh H. Miyata S. Sokawa Y. Maekawa S. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 39: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This was recently confirmed by an unbiased quantitative proteomics study revealing Rac1 as a raft-associated protein (17Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Other studies showed that activation of Rac1 is associated with its rapid recruitment into the lipid rafts, whereas Cdc42 is not, and that Rac1, but not Rho or Cdc42, regulates the assembly and export to the cell membrane of Golgi-derived lipid rafts (18Field K.A.

A number of recent studies have implicated the Rho family of small G proteins, including Rac1 itself, in the modulation of APP processing. Interestingly, two different aspects of APP processing appear to be controlled by Rac1 and other small G proteins: ectodomain shedding (20Maillet M. Robert S.J. Cacquevel M. Gastineau M. Vivien D. Bertoglio J. Zugaza J.L. Fischmeister R. Lezoualc'h F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which is a prerequisite for β-γ-secretase cleavage, and the β-γ-secretase cleavage itself (21Gianni D. Zambrano N. Bimonte M.

Gelfanova V. Hale J.E. May P.C. Paul S.M. Ni B. Science. 2003; 302: 1215-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In particular, overexpression of dominant negative (RacN17) or constitutively active (RacQL) mutants of Rac1 was demonstrated to inhibit or stimulate γ-secretase-mediated APP processing (21Gianni D. Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Minopoli G. Mercken L. Talamo F. Scaloni A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9290-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), respectively, which suggests that Rac1 is crucial for the homeostasis of endogenous Aβ production. It is now clear that APP processing is controlled by multiple pathways to provide a fine tuned processing of APP in physiological conditions. In the AD condition, consequent progress in the identification of dysregulated mechanisms controlling APP processing has been made. For example, Rac1, as well as other small G proteins, has been implicated in the pathways triggered by inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor-α, and by growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-β or platelet-derived growth factor, that have been found to be up-regulated in AD brains (24Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 25Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways have been shown to stimulate the generation of Aβ (26Liao Y.F. Wang B.J. Cheng H.T. Kuo L.H. Wolfe M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49523-49532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The involvement of Rac1 in AD is further stressed by the observation that an up-regulation of neuronal Cdc42/Rac1 occurs in selected neuronal populations of the AD brain in comparison with age-matched controls (27Zhu X. Raina A.K. Boux H. Simmons Z.L. Takeda A. Smith M.A. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 18: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, an attractive hypothesis proposes a role for small G proteins, such as Rac1, in the control of APP processing and Aβ accumulation that occur in AD. We describe here a new molecule, EHT 1864, that inhibits Rac1 signaling and APP processing, lowering Aβ production in vitro and leading to a decrease in Aβ in the brain of guinea pigs. Since this molecule does not affect Notch processing and the neurotrophic α-secretase pathway, EHT 1864 represents a prototype of a new chemical series of interest for developing new treatments for AD.

Cells were treated 48 h after plating in 10-cm plates with various concentrations of the indicated molecules or Me2SO as the vehicle for 16 or 24 h. To do so, medium was replaced with 5 ml of new medium in which treatments were performed. Total Me2SO dilution was 1:1000 in all cases. Cells were allowed to secrete in 5 ml of medium for 7 h in the presence of 1 μm phosphoramidon. Endogenous Rac GTPase Activation Assay—U87-MG cells were grown in a 150-mm diameter dish until they reached 80% confluence. The cells were then treated with the test compounds or the solvent only. Cells were then lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2. Lysates were clarified, the protein concentrations were normalized, and the GTP-bound Rac1 in the lysates were measured using the Rac activation assay Biochem kit (Cytoskeleton) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Endogenous Rho GTPase Activation Assay—GST-Rhotekin Rho-GTP binding domain (RBD) fusion protein beads were prepared as follows, in laboratory of A. Hall (University College, London, UK). BL21 DE3 pLysS strain transformed with pGEX2T Rhotekin RBD grown overnight in LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol was pelleted and then resuspended in GTLB I buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm EDTA, 25% (w/v) sucrose, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Suspension was rotated on a wheel at 4 °C for 10–20 min. GTLB II buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8, 100 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100) was added, and suspension was rotated again for a further 10 min. Bacteria were sonicated on ice at 15 μm in 10-s bursts and centrifuged. Supernatant was carefully removed and transferred to 50-ml Falcon tubes. 1 ml of 50% glutathione-agarose beads was added, and the suspension was rotated on a wheel at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were spun down for 20 s at no more than 2500 rpm. Supernatant was discarded, and beads were washed with cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Beads were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and spun down again, and the last traces of buffer were removed. Beads were then resuspended in wash buffer containing 50% glycerol (final glycerol concentration 25%), aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. Pull-down experiments were performed as described for the Rac-GTPase activation assay except that the detection antibody was an anti-RhoA antibody (Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) used at a 1:750 dilution. Transient Expression Reporter Assays—Transcriptional activation of luciferase gene expression constructs was performed as described previously (30Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 250,000 NIH3T3 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and were co-transfected 24 h later with plasmids prK5-RacV12 and reporter constructs using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). The compound of interest was added after the incubation with Lipofectamine. 24 h after transfection, cells were starved for an additional 24 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS together with the appropriate doses of test compounds or the solvent only. Analyses of the cell lysates of the transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and Fluoroscan Ascent FL plate reader (Thermo LabSystems). All assays were performed in duplicate, and results shown represent the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments for each reporter gene. We did not use an internal standard in the transfections, since all three promoters tested responded to active Rac overexpression to varying extents. However, consistent and reproducible data were obtained in different assays performed using several plasmid preparations, and we monitored protein concentration for yield in the cell extracts as well as expression of the tagged, exogenous protein by Western blotting. The reporter constructs 5× Gal4-Luc plus Gal4-c-Jun, HIV-Luc bearing NF-κB binding sites (30Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L.

Der (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The expression plasmid pRK5-RacV12 was described previously (32Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar) and is a kind gift of Dr. Alan Hall (University College, London, UK). Western Blot Analyses—swAPP-HEK293 cells were scraped and lysed in CelLytic-M (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford procedure. Equal protein quantities were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond-C (Amersham Biosciences) membranes. After transfer, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight with the primary antibody anti-APP antibody at 1:1000 (AHP538; Serotec), allowing the detection of both APP (resolved as doublets in some experiments) and C99 CTF. For sAPPα detection, cells were allowed to secrete for 7 h. Media were collected and cleared by centrifugation, and then equal amounts were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot with 6E10 monoclonal antibody (1:1000). Immunological complexes were revealed with an anti-mouse peroxidase (1:5000; Jackson Laboratories) antibody followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). NotchΔE Transfection and Notch-1 Cleavage Assays in HeLa Cells— HeLa cells in 10-cm plates were transiently transfected with the expression vector pSC2+ΔE3MV-6MT, which overexpresses truncated Notch-1, lacking most of the Notch extracellular domain, and has a C-terminal Myc tag, (NotchΔE). This truncated form of Notch is the substrate of γ-secretase (33Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). 1 day post-transfection, cultures were preincubated with EHT 1864 or the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT for 18 h at the indicated concentrations, and then CelLytic-M lysates were processed for detection of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:1000. In Vivo Delivery of Inhibitors—EHT 1864 or vehicle (physiological saline) were injected in male Hartley albino guinea pigs, weighing 250–270 g at delivery and obtained from Charles River Laboratories (L'Arbresle, France), once a day for 15 consecutive days by the intraperitoneal route. 1 h after the final administration, the guinea pigs were killed; brains were immediately extracted and immersed in an oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) physiological saline bath placed on ice (1–2 °C); and superficial vessels were removed. The whole brains were dissected to provide left and right cortices, which were weighed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C, separately. The maximum time between sacrifice and snap freezing was less than 15 min. Measurements of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42—Stably transfected swAPP-HEK293 cells or confluent SH-SY5Y cells were incubated for 7 h in the presence of phosphoramidon (1 μm) (Sigma). Media and cell lysates were collected as above, centrifuged, normalized to total protein, and assayed for Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 by sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIOSOURCE International). For Aβ 42 detection, samples were concentrated on YM3 Microcon columns (Millipore Corp.). For in vivo samples, the protocol ensured a final concentration of guanidine of <0.1 m, as recommended by the manufacturer, and ELISA standards included guanidine. Right cortices were homogenized for 3 h at room temperature in 5 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and pH 8 with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Tissue homogenates were diluted 1:1 (v/v) in BSAT-DPBS buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.03% Tween 20), pH 7.4, and were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted 1:1 (v/v) in ELISA kit sample buffer, normalized to total protein, and assayed for Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 by sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Aβ 42 detection, samples were concentrated on YM3 Microcon columns (Millipore). BACE Assay—Human BACE1 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from human brain mRNA samples (Biocat) and cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. Subsequently, a HEK293 cell line stably expressing BACE1 was generated and used as a source of BACE1. An in vitro assay was developed based on previous studies (34Ermolieff J. Loy J.A. Koelsch G.

Proteins were extracted in 20 mm MES, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor mixture by incubation on ice for 30 min. The assay was carried out in black 96-well plates (ATGC) in a volume of 200 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm MES, 25 mm sodium acetate, 25 mm Tris, pH 4.4), containing 25 μl of the preparation plus 15 μm peptide Substrate V. Excitation was performed at 320 nm, and the reaction kinetics were monitored by measuring the fluorescence emission at 420 nm on a Fluoroscan Ascent FL plate reader (Thermo LabSystems). Controls included purified recombinant human BACE501 protein (R&D Systems) diluted at 1 μg/well in 200 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.4), the BACE substrate analog inhibitor III (Glu-Val-Asn-statine-Val-Ala-Glu-Phe-NH2; Calbiochem), or substrate alone, and background fluorescence was subtracted from recorded BACE activity. Final Me2SO concentration was 1% (v/v) and did not affect the fluorescence or BACE activity. γ-Secretase Assay—Here, we implemented a γ-secretase assay allowing de novo Aβ generation in vitro, using cell membranes as the source of γ-secretase and endogenous C99 generated from swAPP as the substrate. Preparation of solubilized γ-secretase fractions was performed essentially as described previously (36Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C Ziani-Cherif C Onstead L.

All incubations were performed in the presence of Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Confluent plates of swAPP-HEK293 cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold CelLytic-M (Sigma) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C on a shaker. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For membrane isolation, the supernatant solutions were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation, the ensuing pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of activity buffer (150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4) per cell plate and were defined as solubilized γ-secretase, as previously shown in Ref. 33Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar. Solubilized γ-secretase activity was induced at 37 °C for 2 h with or without the indicated treatments, and Aβ 40 generated de novo was quantified by ELISA. Control experiments used the internally quenched fluorogenic γ-secretase substrate NMA-GGVVIATVK(DNP)-DRDRDR-NH2 (λex = 355 nm; λem = 440 nm) from Calbiochem, which contains the C-terminal β-APP amino acid sequence that is cleaved by γ-secretase and the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Calbiochem). Cytotoxicity Assays—Cell viability and cytotoxicity of the tested compounds were routinely assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay or a released lactate dehydrogenase assay using the CytoTox 96 assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Statistical Analysis—Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test were used to determine the significance between the data means. Significance values are as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus corresponding control. EHT 1864 Inhibits Rac1/Pak1 Interaction—To test whether EHT 1864 might affect Rac1 activity, U87-MG cells were treated with different concentrations of EHT 1864. We used a GST fusion protein containing the p21-binding domain of human p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) to affinity-precipitate endogenous active Rac1 (GTP-Rac1) from cell lysates in order to monitor the activation of the small GTPase Rac1. The GST-Pak-p21-binding domain fusion protein was incubated with cell lysate, and the effector pulled down active or GTP-Rac1 was detected by Western blot analysis using a specific Rac1 antibody. The Rhotekin protein specifically recognizes and binds to the active, GTP-bound, form of RhoA, R"

https://openalex.org/W1977110200,"For most multidomain proteins the thermal unfolding transitions are accompanied by an irreversible step, often related to aggregation at elevated temperatures. As a consequence the analysis of thermostabilities in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics is not applicable, at least not if the irreversible process is fast with respect the structural unfolding transition. In a comparative study we investigated aggregation effects and unfolding kinetics for five homologous α-amylases, all from mesophilic sources but with rather different thermostabilities. The results indicate that for all enzymes the irreversible process is fast and the precedent unfolding transition is the rate-limiting step. In this case the kinetic barrier toward unfolding, as measured by unfolding rates as function of temperature, is the key feature in thermostability. The investigated enzymes exhibit activation energies (Ea) between 208 and 364 kJmol–1 and pronounced differences in the corresponding unfolding rates. The most thermostable α-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis (apparent transition temperature, T1/2 ∼ 100 °C) shows an unfolding rate which is four orders of magnitude smaller as compared with the α-amylase from pig pancreas (T1/2 ∼ 65 °C). Even with respect to two other α-amylases from Bacillus species (T1/2 ∼ 86 °C) the difference in unfolding rates is still two orders of magnitude.

Due to substantially different environmental conditions of habitats where the residentiary organisms have to thrive, proteins can be provided with very different thermostabilities. In the past two decades numerous proteins from extremophilic organisms have been isolated and characterized with respect to their thermal stability (1Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 2Sterner R. Liebl W. Crit Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 39-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 3Georlette D.

Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). A considerable number of proteins has been identified, which maintain their folded (and in general functional) state at rather elevated temperatures, such as 100 °C and above. Interestingly, extreme thermostabilities are not confined to proteins from thermophiles and hyperthermophiles but can also be found for proteins from mesophiles. In particular Bacillus species are able to populate moderately thermophilic habitats (5Laskin A.I. Lechevalier H.A. CRC Handbook of Microbiology, Second Ed., pp. , CRC Press, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio. 1988; : 325-335Google Scholar), which at least partly explains the occurrence of extreme thermostable proteins in Bacillus strains. An example we will discuss in more detail here is given by the starch-degrading enzyme α-amylase. Several rather heat-stable α-amylases were isolated from mesophilic sources (see TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEList of homologous α-amylases for which the apparent transition temperatures measured at 1 °C/min heating rate were determined under calcium-saturated and calcium-depleted conditionsOrigin, α-amylase fromPDB entryNo. of residuesMolecular massNo. of Ca ionsT1/2Calcium-saturatedCalcium-depletedkDa°C°CPig pancreatic (PPA)1DHK49655.35716548Aspergillus oryzae (TAKA)6TAA47852.49027157B. subtilis (BSUA)1BAG61968.42138646B. amyloliquefaciens (BAA)1E4348358.84348638B. licheniformis (BLA)1BLI48358.274310251 Open table in a new tab Thermal stability of proteins includes thermodynamic as well as kinetic stability.

An illustrative parameter given by the melting temperature Tm (as obtained at ΔG = 0) is quite often used to compare thermostabilities of individual proteins. Unfortunately, the most mesophilic and thermophilic proteins unfold irreversible, which in general excludes a quantitative determination of thermodynamic parameter. Only in very rare cases and under specific assumptions were thermodynamic parameter obtained from non-reversible unfolding transitions (6Lepock J.R. Ritchie K.P. Kolios M.C. Rodahl A.M. Heinz K.A.

According to the transition state theory where the folded and unfolded states are separated by an energy barrier, kinetic stability is determined by the activation energy of unfolding ΔG#N (see for example Ref. 9Bachmann A.

For this purpose a simple kinetic model based on the Lumry-Eyring (24Lumry R. Eyring H. J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58: 110-120Crossref Scopus (725) Google Scholar) equation is employed to compare the unfolding kinetics of five different α-amylases. Enzymes—α-Amylase from Bacillus licheniformis (BLA, purchased from Sigma), from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BAA, from Fluka), from Bacillus subtilis (BSUA, from Fluka), and from Aspergillus oryzae (TAKA, from Sigma) was obtained as lyophilized powder. A further α-amylase from pig pancreas (PPA, from Roche Applied Science) was obtained in ammonium sulfate solution. Powders were dissolved in buffer (for details see below), and all enzymes were purified by the use of a desalting column (Econo-Pac 10 DG, Bio-Rad). For spectroscopic studies the following buffers were used: 30 mm Mops, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (standard buffer), 30 mm Mops, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (calcium free samples). In the case of CD-spectroscopy respective buffers were used, but with 10 mm Mops. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Intrinsic fluorescence was measured using a RF-1501 Fluorospectrometer (Shimadzu). Excitation wavelengths of 280 and 295 nm were applied, whereas emission spectra were recorded in the range between 300 and 450 nm. All fluorescence spectra were corrected for background scattering as measured with pure buffer. In some cases an UG1 filter (Schott, Mainz Germany) was used to attenuate the exciting beam, to avoid photo-bleaching and to obtain most reproducibly fluorescence emission spectra. Temperature scans were performed using a constant-temperature cuvette holder connected to an external constant temperature circulator/bath (F25, Julabo). Protein solutions (protein concentrations: 7 μg/ml to 1 mg/ml) were filled into quartz cuvettes with an optical path-length of 1 cm (104F-QS, Hellma). Temperatures of protein solutions up to ∼110 °C were reached in sealed cuvettes without evaporation and boiling. Unfolding transitions were analyzed in terms of wavelength shifts of the emission peak and (or) by calculating the peak ratios of intensities as measured at 330 nm and 350 nm (at 345 and 335 nm for PPA, respectively). Light Scattering—To estimate protein aggregation occurring upon thermal unfolding, an RF-1501 fluorospectrometer was employed to measure elastic scattering at 500 nm. For this purpose the same experimental setup (temperature-controlling unit; quartz cuvettes with 1-cm optical path-length) was used as for fluorescence studies. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra in the far-UV region (200–280 nm) were recorded on a Jasco J-810 equipped with Peltier thermostatting cuvette holder under constant nitrogen flow. The spectra were recorded in a 0.2-cm cell at protein concentration of 0.05–0.1 mg/ml, averaged over three scans, and finally corrected for the buffer signal. The raw data were corrected for pre- and post-transition slopes. Thermal unfolding transitions were monitored by taking the CD signal at 222 nm as a function of temperature. Kinetic Studies—Kinetics of thermal unfolding and of protein aggregation was measured using fluorescence or CD spectroscopy, and light scattering, respectively. For this purpose, buffer solutions were placed in the spectrometer for 5–10 min to reach thermal equilibrium at desired temperatures, before a small amount of concentrated protein solution was rapidly added during permanent stirring and data acquisition was started. The dead time of this procedure was about 10 s. Homologous α-Amylases from Mesophilic Sources with Different Thermostabilities—As shown in TABLE ONE selected α-amylases exhibit rather different thermostabilities, despite the fact that all stem from mesophilic sources. The obtained apparent transition temperatures T1/2 (with the amount of folded protein N = N0/2 but not necessarily N = U = 1/2 as obtained from a reversible two-state unfolding process in equilibrium) were determined with fluorescence and CD spectroscopy by applying a heating rate of 1 °C per minute. All calcium-saturated and calcium-depleted samples (applying this heating rate) reveal rather similar transition temperatures with respect to already published data (13Fukada H. Takahashi K. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10723-10731Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, for BSUA no transition temperatures of thermal unfolding have been published yet. The well known effect of stabilization by calcium ions as part of all selected α-amylase structures (12Violet M. Meunier J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 16Tanaka A. Hoshino E. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 635-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is much more pronounced for the more thermostable enzymes (21Fitter J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For all techniques used to monitor the unfolding transition, such as CD and fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as differential scanning calorimetry, the same transition temperatures within the limits of error were obtained. Calcium saturated samples exhibit thermal unfolding transitions that appear as single steps with a more or less cooperative loss of secondary and tertiary structure. In the following studies presented here, only calcium saturated samples were used. Effects of Aggregation and Heating Rates—For all α-amylases studied here the unfolding transitions were shown to be irreversible, not only for thermal unfolding but also for guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding (see also Refs. 11Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3092-3096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fukada H. Takahashi K. Sturtevant J.M.

It is supposed that chemical modifications, such as deamidation, cysteine oxidation, or peptide bond hydrolysis, take place once the protein is unfolded (1Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 10Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3086-3091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most common model to describe this type of unfolding is given by Reaction 1, N↔kfkuU→kiIREACTION 1 where N is the native state, U is the unfolded state, and I represents the final irreversible denatured state, which quite often forms aggregates (see for example Refs. 6Lepock J.R.

Whether irreversible processes have a significant impact on the apparent thermostability depends on several factors. Because irreversible processes, such as aggregation, are kinetic processes, the relation between transition rates and experimental heating rates plays an important role. Therefore, one of the main questions is: which of the two steps in the unfolding process, either the reversible unfolding (ku) or the irreversible (ki), is the rate-limiting step? In addition, due to the fact that aggregation is related to an interaction of at least two particles, the process depends on the protein concentration. As shown in Fig. 1 all α-amylases exhibit a distinct heating rate dependence of apparent transition temperatures. Considering the limited number of only a few different heating rates, the relative differences in T1/2 appear rather similar for all investigated enzymes. For practical reasons the heating rate dependence of transition temperatures have been fitted with a second-order polynomial function. Inspection of the fitting curves suggest that at heating rates above 3 °C per minute a maximal transition temperature is reached and no further increase of T1/2 takes place. Although the course of the curves at low heating rates provides T1/2 values at a heating rate zero (intercept with the y-axis), these values are meaningless. In the case of irreversible unfolding with much faster aggregation as compared with the unfolding transition (see below) the enzymes will unfold well below the T1/2 (even though much slower), and an extrapolation to a heating rate of zero is not justified with the above given function. With the exception of TAKA 3For unfolded TAKA only rather weak elastic scattering was observed. Nevertheless, TAKA unfolds irreversible and possibly the unfolded TAKA forms much smaller particles of protein aggregates as compared to the other α-amylases. all investigated enzymes show a pronounced aggregation upon thermal unfolding, which is already visible by eye due to turbidity of the protein solution. This phenomenon was analyzed in more detail by employing elastic light scattering, which is rather sensitive for aggregation if the particles increase in size from diameter a < λ/20 (dissolved monomeric proteins) to a ≈ λ (aggregates of proteins). Temperature scans of unfolding transitions and of the accompanying aggregation are shown for BAA in Fig. 2a. For both heating rates the aggregation appears rather concurrent with respect to the unfolding transition as obtained from tryptophan fluorescence. In addition unfolding transitions and aggregation were measured with different protein concentrations (7 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml, and 1 mg/ml; see Fig. 2b). Within the limits of error all protein concentrations exhibit the same apparent transition temperatures for the respective enzymes. A comparison between kinetics of the aggregation process and of unfolding kinetics (see next section Fig. 3c) revealed rather similar rates for both processes. On the basis of these observations we can conclude that the aggregation process 1) appears to be rather similar for all investigated α-amylases and 2) is very fast with respect to the unfolding transition (ki » ku). Furthermore, significant aggregation occurs only for fully (or partly) unfolded states but not for the native state under conditions used here. With respect to the kinetic model described in Reaction 1, our results indicate that the unfolding transition (determined by ku) is the rate-limiting step.FIGURE 3a, CD spectra as measured for BAA (50 μg/ml) at 91 °C in a time interval of 26 s. The decrease of the signal at 222 nm is assumed to be proportional to decrease of the fraction of folded protein with elapsing time. b, mono-exponential fits (solid lines) have been applied to experimental data points for the following temperatures (from slowest to fastest transitions): 70, 78, 82, 85, 87, 91, and 95 °C. For all amylases the experimental error of the obtained unfolding rates ku (see Fig. 4) is in the order of ± 5–7%. c, as shown here for BAA and BLA (each 50 μg/ml) the kinetics of thermal unfolding and accompanying aggregation appear rather similar. A slightly faster aggregation process might be related to the fact that already partly unfolded proteins start to aggregate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unfolding Kinetics—To characterize and to compare the individual thermostabilities of the given α-amylases we measured the temperature dependence of unfolding rate constants. As shown for the example of BAA (see Fig. 3) all unfolding transitions can be described very well with mono-exponential curve fitting. One approach to interpret the data is to assume an unfolding limited first-order kinetic process, which can be analyzed using the Arrhenius equation, k=Ae−Ea/RT(Eq. 1) Applying this approach, activation energies (Ea) and pre-exponential factors (A) were obtained from the experimental kinetic rates k, whereas T is the absolute temperature and R the universal gas constant. Linear regression analysis applied to ln(k) versus 1/T plots (Arrhenius plots, see Fig. 4) yielded Ea (slopes of the curves) and A (y-axis intercepts), according to Equation 1 (see TABLE TWO for results). Due to the limitation of our experimental setup, we did not measure unfolding processes faster than ∼50 s(t½: half-life times). At least in one case (BAA) we measured rather slow unfolding processes at temperatures much below the apparent transition temperature as obtained at the lowest heating rate with T1/2 = 80 °C. In this case, BAA exhibits a half-life time of 5.13 h at 70 °C. Within the limits of error we observe for all α-amylases a linear behavior in the corresponding Arrhenius plots (Fig. 4). The obtained activation energies Ea (more precisely the enthalpic contribution to the activation energy) differs throughout the investigated enzymes. Although BLA exhibits the highest value of 363.7 kJmol–1, BSUA and BAA show rather similar values around 260 kJmol–1. A comparable large Ea value for TAKA (317.9 kJmol–1) seems to be counterbalanced by a relatively large entropic contribution, which leads to a rather low thermostability of TAKA as compared with BAA and BSUA. The least thermostable PPA has the smallest Ea value of 207.5 kJmol–1 accompanied by the smallest entropic contribution. With respect to a reference temperature of 100 °C BLA exhibits a half-life time, which is approximately four orders of magnitude larger as compared with PPA and TAKA, and two orders of magnitude larger than those of BAA and BSUA. Because the Ea values for the α-amylases do not differ too much the relation of half-life times as obtained at 100 °C is rather similar to values determined at 80 °C. At even lower temperatures, of for example 60 °C, BLA shows already a half-life time that is already four orders of magnitude larger than BAA and BSUA and approximately six orders of magnitude larger with respect to those of PPA and TAKA. This indicates that with respect other α-amylases, BLA (and to a certain extend also TAKA) is kinetically more stabilized at lower temperatures as compared with higher temperatures. The half-life times obtained at the respective apparent transition temperatures (roughly indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 4) are rather similar, with a slightly larger value for BLA. A comparison of unfolding rates at the respective apparent transition temperatures strongly depends on the correct value of T1/2, because small deviations in T1/2 can lead to rather different unfolding rates. However, in principle this result suggests similar unfolding processes of the investigated α-amylases at their respective transition temperatures.TABLE TWOParameter obtained from linear regression fits as shown in Fig. 4Eaku at 100 °Ct1/2 at 100 °Ct1/2 at T1/2 h.r. 1 °C/minkJ mol-1s-1ssPPA207.5 (±10.4)2.250.308314TAKA317.9 (±11.6)19.960.035267BSUA262.0 (±15.5)5.337 × 10-212.9308BAA255.4 (±13.9)5.429 × 10-212.8317BLA363.7 (±21.3)6.929 × 10-41000.4535 Open table in a new tab The consistency between scan-rate-dependent thermal unfolding data and the obtained unfolding rate coefficients can be checked easily by calculating the fraction of folded protein fN(T,r), fN(T,r)=exp(−1r∫T0TAe−Ea/RTdT)(Eq. 2) where T0 denotes a temperature at which the fraction of unfolded proteins is negligible, and T is the temperature of interest (for more details see Refs. 8Galisteo M.L. Mateo P.L. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L.

Values as obtained using Equation 2 were fitted with sigmoidal Boltzmann functions, and the resulting transition temperatures (T1/2) are shown in Fig. 1b (open symbols). The comparison with scan-rate data (solid symbols this figure) yields some systematic deviations at higher heating rates for BAA, BSUA, and TAKA. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that a temperature lag in the cuvettes relative to the heating system had occurred. However, considering the experimental error of fundamental parameter ku (±5–7%) the obtained consistency appears satisfactory. The impact of aggregation and heating rates on the apparent transition temperatures has been described for several cases in previous studies (6Lepock J.R. Ritchie K.P. Kolios M.C. Rodahl A.M. Heinz K.A. Kruuv J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12706-12712Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Vogl T. Jatzke C. Hinz H.J. Benz J. Huber R.

Although it is quite often stated that heating rates of 1 °C per minute are reasonable to measure the unfolding transition of mesophilic proteins, it was demonstrated in various studies that equilibrium was not reached. There are many possible reasons for such an observation. In some cases slower heating rates are required due to unusually slow relaxation unfolding or refolding kinetics (27Rosengarth A. Rosgen J. Hinz H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 28Kaushik J.K. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In other cases the irreversible process leading to aggregates is rate-limiting and therefore high heating rates can reduce irreversible transitions (7Vogl T. Jatzke C. Hinz H.J. Benz J. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Galisteo M.L. Mateo P.L. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this case one can even obtain thermodynamic equilibrium parameters from irreversible unfolding transitions (7Vogl T. Jatzke C. Hinz H.J. Benz J. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast we observe for all α-amylases an irreversible process, which is fast as compared with the unfolding transition. This seems to be the more common case for most multidomain proteins. In this case equilibrium thermodynamics is without any importance for the thermostability. Only the barrier height of the transition state ΔG#N as measured by ku determines the thermostability. A comparable effect of kinetic stability caused by a remarkable high unfolding barrier was observed for a mechanism of protein longevity (29Cunningham E.L. Jaswal S.S. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11008-11014Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). With respect to our kinetic model (Reaction 1) it is of interest whether a reduction (or prolongation) of the irreversible process would increase the apparent thermostability (30Shin I. Wachtel E. Roth E. Bon C. Silman I. Weiner L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2022-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One approach to reduce protein aggregation of unfolded α-amylases is to add co-solvents such as non-detergent sulfobetaine (31D'Amico S. Marx J.C. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7891-7896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) or cyclodextrins (32Yazdanparast R. Khodagholi F. Khodarahmi R. Int. J Biol. Macromol. 2005; 35: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on thermal unfolding studies we observed for non-detergent sulfobetaine only a slight increase of the apparent transition temperature, but still no reversibility of the unfolding process (data not shown here). On the other hand, for chemical-induced unfolding (by guanidine hydrochloride) in some cases reversibility of the unfolding transition was observed (32Yazdanparast R. Khodagholi F. Khodarahmi R. Int. J Biol. Macromol. 2005; 35: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Kawata Y. Hongo K. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1293-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Based on early observation by Tomazic and co-worker (10Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3086-3091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the irreversibility of the thermal unfolding transition (at least for BLA) is caused by deamidation of amide residues at elevated temperatures. In this respect aggregation is only an accompanying process but is not the reason for the irreversibility. This appears to be rather different in the case of guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding. However, the irreversible thermal unfolding seems not to be an inherent property of larger multidomain proteins (even not at extreme high temperatures). As known from hyperthermophiles, a nascent polypeptide chain is able to fold into its native conformation at rather elevated temperatures. Therefore, it is still a question whether in vitro conditions can be found for reversible thermal unfolding or whether the help of other factors (e.g. molecular chaperons) as supplied under in vivo conditions are necessary (34Ogasahara K. Lapshina E.A. Sakai M. Izu Y. Tsunasawa S. Kato I. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition to a vast body of work on the kinetics of thermoinactivation, numerous studies on the unfolding kinetics of proteins have recently been published (34Ogasahara K. Lapshina E.A. Sakai M.

Marqusee S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In particular a comparison between mesophilic and thermophilic proteins was the focus of these studies. Besides some exceptions (40Mukaiyama A. Takano K. Haruki M. Morikawa M. Kanaya S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13859-13866Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 42Hollien J. Marqusee S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), most studies revealed significant slower unfolding rates for thermophilic proteins as compared with their mesophilic counterparts. At a reference temperature of 100 °C for rubredoxin a difference in unfolding rates of 2–3 orders of magnitude was obtained (35Cavagnero S. Debe D.A. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For glycosidases and peptidases at a much lower reference temperature (60–65 °C) differences of about five orders of magnitude in the unfolding rates were observed (37Ogasahara K. Nakamura M. Nakura S. Tsunasawa S. Kato I. Yoshimoto T. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17537-17544Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although our comparison considers only mesophilic proteins the difference in unfolding rates between BLA and PPA (or TAKA) we obtained here are at least as large (if not even larger at the corresponding reference temperatures) as those obtained for the mesophilic-thermophilic pairs. Even for BAA (or BSUA) compared with PPA (TAKA) we obtained differences in unfolding rates of two orders of magnitude. Our results emphasizes that BLA is one of the most thermostable proteins from a mesophilic source (43Vihinen M. Mantsala P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 329-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). With respect to difference in unfolding kinetics between BLA and BBA, early studies on thermoinactivation (at 90 °C) revealed similar differences for these enzymes (11Tomazic S.J. Klibanov A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3092-3096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated, for irreversible unfolding α-amylases, that the obtained unfolding rate constants are very meaningful parameters to compare thermostabilities of different proteins. Similar to numerous thermophilic proteins, which exhibit very slow unfolding processes, we obtained extremely small unfolding rates for the thermostable BLA originating from a mesophilic source. In contrast to reversible unfolding proteins, where either kinetic or thermodynamic stability can be the key feature in thermostabilization (40Mukaiyama A. Takano K. Haruki M. Morikawa M. Kanaya S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13859-13866Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), only kinetic barriers determine thermostability for the α-amylases with a fast irreversible process. Based on this, mutant studies often revealed enhanced stabilities that are determined kinetically rather than thermodynamically. For example, recently a BLA mutant was studied that unfolds 32 times slower than the wild type (44Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11546-11553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). J. F. thanks G. Büldt (Forschungszentrum Jülich) for continuous support in his institute."
https://openalex.org/W2038132108,"Rieske oxygenases catalyze a wide variety of important oxidation reactions. Here we report the characterization of a novel Rieske N-oxygenase, aminopyrrolnitrin oxygenase (PrnD) that catalyzes the unusual oxidation of an arylamine to an arylnitro group. PrnD from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf5 was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, and the activity of the purified PrnD was reconstituted, which required in vitro assembly of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster into the protein and the presence of NADPH, FMN, and an E. coli flavin reductase SsuE. Biochemical and bioinformatics studies indicated that the reconstituted PrnD contains a Rieske iron-sulfur cluster and a mononuclear iron center that are formed by residues Cys69, Cys88, His71, His91, Asp323, His186, and His191, respectively. The enzyme showed a limited range of substrate specificity and catalyzed the conversion of aminopyrrolnitrin into pyrrolnitrin with Km = 191 μm and kcat = 6.8 min–1. Isotope labeling experiments with 18O2 and H218O suggested that the oxygen atoms in the pyrrolnitrin product are derived exclusively from molecular oxygen. In addition, it was found that the oxygenation of the arylamine substrates catalyzed by PrnD occurs at the enzyme active site and does not involve free radical chain reactions. By analogy to known examples of arylamine oxidation, a catalytic mechanism for the bioconversion of amino pyrrolnitrin into pyrrolnitrin was proposed. Our results should facilitate further mechanistic and crystallographic studies of this arylamine oxygenase and may provide a new enzymatic route for the synthesis of aromatic nitro compounds from their corresponding aromatic amines. Rieske oxygenases catalyze a wide variety of important oxidation reactions. Here we report the characterization of a novel Rieske N-oxygenase, aminopyrrolnitrin oxygenase (PrnD) that catalyzes the unusual oxidation of an arylamine to an arylnitro group. PrnD from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf5 was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, and the activity of the purified PrnD was reconstituted, which required in vitro assembly of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster into the protein and the presence of NADPH, FMN, and an E. coli flavin reductase SsuE. Biochemical and bioinformatics studies indicated that the reconstituted PrnD contains a Rieske iron-sulfur cluster and a mononuclear iron center that are formed by residues Cys69, Cys88, His71, His91, Asp323, His186, and His191, respectively. The enzyme showed a limited range of substrate specificity and catalyzed the conversion of aminopyrrolnitrin into pyrrolnitrin with Km = 191 μm and kcat = 6.8 min–1. Isotope labeling experiments with 18O2 and H218O suggested that the oxygen atoms in the pyrrolnitrin product are derived exclusively from molecular oxygen. In addition, it was found that the oxygenation of the arylamine substrates catalyzed by PrnD occurs at the enzyme active site and does not involve free radical chain reactions. By analogy to known examples of arylamine oxidation, a catalytic mechanism for the bioconversion of amino pyrrolnitrin into pyrrolnitrin was proposed. Our results should facilitate further mechanistic and crystallographic studies of this arylamine oxygenase and may provide a new enzymatic route for the synthesis of aromatic nitro compounds from their corresponding aromatic amines. The antibiotic pyrrolnitrin (3-chloro-4-(2′-nitro-3′-chlorophenyl)pyrrole) is produced by many Pseudomonads such as Pseudomonas pyrrocinia, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas cepacia and has broad spectrum antifungal activity (1Arima K.

Phytopathology. 1993; 83: 1223-1228Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Biological activity of pyrrolnitrin at low concentrations was demonstrated to be due to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in Neurospora crassa and at higher concentrations due to inhibition of electron transport both in the flavin region and through cytochrome c oxidase (6Lambowitz A.M. Slayman C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 1020-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that pyrrolnitrin leads to glycerol accumulation and stimulation of triacylglycerol synthesis, resulting in leaky cell membranes and concomitant breakdown of biosynthetic activity followed by cessation of cell growth (7Jespers A.B.K. Dewaard M.A. Pesticide Sci. 1995; 44: 167-175Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cloning and characterization of a 5.8-kb DNA region that encodes the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic pathway was reported (8Hammer P.E. Hill D.S. Lam S.T. VanPee K.H. Ligon J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This DNA region confers the ability to produce pyrrolnitrin when expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli and contains four genes, prnABCD, each of which is required for pyrrolnitrin production (9Kirner S. Hammer P.E. Hill D.S. Altmann A. Fischer I. Weislo L.J. Lanahan M. van Pée K.H. Ligon J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1939-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A hypothetical biochemical pathway for the synthesis of pyrrolnitrin has been proposed by van Pée et al. (10van Pée K.H. Salcher O. Lingens F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1980; 19: 828-829Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this pathway shown in Fig. 1, the first step is the chlorination of tryptophan by PrnA at the 7 position to form 7-chlorotryptophan, followed by rearrangement of the indole ring to a phenylpyrrole ring and decarboxylation by PrnB to form monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin. This intermediate is chlorinated a second time by PrnC to form aminopyrrolnitrin, which, in the last step of the pathway, undergoes oxidation of the amino group in aminopyrrolnitrin to a nitro group by PrnD to form pyrrolnitrin. The biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin is one of the best examples of enzyme-catalyzed arylamine oxidation. Although arylamine oxygenases seem to be widely distributed within the microbial world and used in a variety of metabolic reactions (11Morris M. Pagan G. Warmke H.

Engl. 2005; 44: 4083-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The nitro group plays an important role in their activity. Pyrrolnitrin analogues containing an amino group instead of a nitro group have no inhibiting effect on the growth of Neurospora crassa (18van Pée K.H. Ligon J.M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggested that PrnD is a Rieske oxygenase consisting of a consensus Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding motif and a mononuclear non-heme Fe(II)-binding motif DXXHXXXXH (8Hammer P.E. Hill D.S. Lam S.T. VanPee K.H. Ligon J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rieske oxygenases are widespread in nature and catalyze a diverse set of oxidation reactions including cis-dihydroxylation, monohydroxylation, desaturation, sulfoxidation, and O- and N-dealkylation (19Costas M. Mehn M.P. Jensen M.P. Que L. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 939-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar, 20Resnick S.M. Lee K. Gibson D.T. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 17: 438-457Crossref Google Scholar). However, because of the difficulties in protein expression and purification, arylamine oxygenases involved in arylnitro group formation including PrnD have never been characterized and assigned a defined function. Here we report for the first time the functional expression, purification, reconstitution, and characterization of a novel Rieske N-oxygenase, PrnD, that catalyzes unusual arylamine oxidation. To explore the mechanism of its reaction further, we describe in vitro oxygenation of the precursor arylamine to an arylnitro product by purified and reconstituted PrnD, which has one Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] center and one mononuclear iron site/monomer. We also suggest the origin of oxygen in the nitro group and the putative mechanism for arylamine oxidation by PrnD. Materials—The pMal-c2x expression vector, malE primer, factor Xa, amylose resin, Taq DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, DNase I, and restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Plasmid pQE-80L was obtained from Qiagen. Plasmid pTKXb119 was a kind gift of Dr. K. H. Park at Seoul National University (Seoul, Korea). 18O2 (97% O18-enriched), H2182O (97% O18-enriched), superoxide dismutase (2500 units/mg), xanthine oxidase (7 units/mg), catalase (10,000 units/mg), BCA protein assay kit, mannitol, and pyrrolnintrin were from Sigma. Materials for PCR product purification, gel extraction, and plasmid preparation were obtained from Qiagen. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The physiological substrate, aminopyrrolnitrin (3 mg), was a kind gift of Dr. J. W. Frost at Michigan State University (East Lansing, MI). Substrate analogues (4-amino-l-phenylalanine, 2-amino-3-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-amino-4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-amino-4-chlorophenol, 4-aminobenzamidine dihydrochloride, 4-aminobenzyl amine, 3-aminobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzamide, aniline, 4-aminoacetophenone, 4-aminoacetanilide, 3-amino-acetanilide, 1,2-phenylenediamine, 1,3-phenylenediamine, 1,4-phenylenediamine, 1,3,5-triamino-benzene), and the corresponding nitro compounds including 4-nitrobenzyl amine were from Aldrich. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—E. coli BL21 (DE3) and DH5α were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI) and the Media Preparation Facility of the University of Illinois Biochemistry Department (Urbana, IL), respectively. P. fluorescens Pf-5 (number BAA-447) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). E. coli strains DH5α and BL21(DE3) were grown aerobically at 37 °C or 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium with constant shaking (220 rpm). When necessary, kanamycin was added at 50 μg/ml and ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. The solid media were prepared by the addition of 1.5% (w/v) agar. Construction of the pMAL-c2x-prnD Expression Plasmid—The prnD gene was amplified by PCR from P. fluorescens Pf-5 genomic DNA using two oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGGGATCCATGAACGACATTCAATTGGATCAAG-3′ (BamHI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-GGAAGCTTTCACCGCTCACTTGCGACGCG-3′ (HindIII restriction site is underlined). The PCR amplification was carried out using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to minimize potential point mutations introduced by PCRs under standard conditions (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). The PCR program was 2 min at 96 °C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 48 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, and a final elongation of 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were cleaved by BamHI and HindIII and purified using QIAEX II gel purification kit (Qiagen). The purified product was cloned into the BamHI- and HindIII-digested expression vector pMal-c2x. The resulting pMal-c2x-prnD is under the control of the tac promoter and expresses PrnD as a fusion protein to the C terminus of the maltose-binding protein (MBP). 3The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. The cloned PrnD gene was confirmed to be free of point mutations by DNA sequencing at the Biotechnology Center of the University of Illinois using the Big Dye™ Terminator sequencing method and an ABI PRISM® 3700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Expression and Purification of the Fusion Protein—Overnight cultures of BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the pMal-c2x-prnD vectors were diluted 1:200 into LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown at 30 °C until absorbance at 600 nm (A600) reached ∼0.6. Then protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.1 mm final concentration, and the incubation was continued for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 6,000 × g, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen and stored at –20 °C. The yield was ∼3 g of bacterial wet weight/liter of culture. A bacterial lysate was prepared by thawing and resuspending cells from a 1-liter culture in 40 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm EDTA (starting buffer); this suspension was treated with 10 mg of lysozyme for 30 min. The suspension was sonicated on ice with a Branson sonicator for 1 min five times at 1-min intervals. After centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl and loaded onto an amylose resin column (3 mg of fusion protein/ml of amylose). The column was washed with 10 volumes of 0.5 m NaCl in starting buffer and with 20 volumes 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, before eluting with 10 mm maltose in the latter buffer. For cleavage with factor Xa, the dialyzed MBP-prnD fusion protein was incubated with factor Xa (1 μg/200 μg of fusion protein) for 16 h at 4 °C. Maltose was removed by hydroxyapatite resin, and MBP was removed after cleavage by a second adsorption to the amylose resin. Fractions from the amylose column were then concentrated with Centricon-10 ultrafiltration units (Amicon), adjusted to 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, l mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8. Construction of the pTKXb-prnD Plasmid and Its Expression and Purification—The PCR product obtained by using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGCATATGAACGACATTCAATTGGATCAAG-3′ (NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-GGCTCGAGTCACCGCTCACTTGCGACGCG-3′ (XhoI restriction site is underlined) was cleaved by NdeI and XhoI and purified using QIAEX II gel purification kit (Qiagen). The purified product was cloned into the NdeI- and XhoI-digested expression vector p6xHTKXb119 (22Kim Y.W. Choi J.H. Kim J.W. Park C. Kim J.W. Cha H.J. Lee S.B. Oh B.H. Moon T.W. Park K.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 4866-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to give pTKXb-prnD, which was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). In this expression plasmid, the prnD gene was placed under the transcriptional control of the promoter PBLMA from Bacillus licheniformis, which is constitutively induced in E. coli (23Kim I.C. Cha J.H. Kim J.R. Jang S.Y. Seo B.C. Cheong T.K. Lee D.S. Choi Y.D. Park K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22108-22114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the purification of His6-tagged TKXb-PrnD protein, 3 g of E. coli cells cultured for 24 h were resuspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) supplemented with 25 μg/ml DNase I and disrupted by the same method as described above. After clarification by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C, the volume of the crude extract was adjusted to 10 ml with binding buffer. The crude extract was then loaded at a flow rate of 25 ml/h onto a 2.5-ml HisBind Resin column (Novagen, Madison, WI), which had been activated with NiSO4 and equilibrated with binding buffer as described by the manufacturer. The sample was washed with 10 column volumes of binding buffer, followed by washing with 6 column volumes of wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). An additional wash step with a buffer containing 100 mm imidazole was performed for 6 column volumes prior to PrnD elution with 200 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, pH 7.9. The protein solution was stored at –20 °C until further use. Site-directed Mutagenesis of pTKXb-PrnD—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The pTKXb-prnD plasmid was used as the DNA template. Two conserved Cys residues (Cys69 and Cys88) in the iron-sulfur cluster and two Asp residues (Asp323 and Asp333) were mutated to Ala individually. The plasmids containing the correct mutant genes were then used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3), and colonies selected by kanamycin resistance were used for protein expression. The pTKXb-PrnD mutants were expressed according to the same procedure for the wild type enzyme as described above. In Vitro Reconstitution of the Iron-Sulfur Clusters into the PrnD Proteins—The reconstitution procedures (24Yano T. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol.

All of the solutions were incubated anaerobically for 2 h before the beginning of each experiment. The purified PrnD was diluted to 10–20 μm with N2-sparged 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to the protein solution at 1.0% (v/v), and the solution was gently mixed and left for 90 min. Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and Na2S were added to the solution at a final concentration of ∼1.0 mm. The reconstitution proceeded for 2–3 h. The solution was diluted 8-fold by the addition of N2-sparged 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8), further diluted 2-fold by the addition of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) equilibrated in air, and then dialyzed against the same buffer. Excess Fe2+ and S2– were removed by a desalting column (Bio-Rad; 10-DG). The reconstituted PrnD protein was concentrated on Centricon-30 ultrafiltration units (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to a final volume of 0.2 ml and stored at 4 °C or for longer periods at –80 °C. The iron-sulfur cluster incorporation was analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. Construction of pQE-ssuE Expression Plasmid—For the production of SsuE reductase, the ssuE gene was placed under the control of the T5 RNA polymerase promoter using vector pQE-80L. The ssuE gene was amplified by PCR from E. coli XL1 Blue genomic DNA using the two oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGCATATGCGTGTCATCACCCTGGC-3′ (NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-GGAAGCTTTTACGCATGGGCATTACCTC-3′ (HindIII restriction site is underlined). The 672-base pair PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII, and the resulting fragment was ligated in pGEMT-easy to form plasmid pGEMTssuE. For the production of SsuE as an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein, the NdeI-HindIII SsuE-encoding fragment from plasmid pGEMTssuE was ligated into NdeI-HindIII-digested pQE-80L to form plasmid pQE-ssuE. Production and Purification of SsuE Protein—E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the appropriate overexpression plasmid pQE-ssuE was grown at 30 °C and 220 rpm in a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask containing 400 ml of growth medium. To minimize the formation of insoluble protein aggregates, which were observed when protein production was carried out at 30 °C, cultures grown to an A600 of 0.5 were cooled to 16 °C, induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 mm and incubated for a further 5 h at 16°C with constant shaking (220 rpm). The cells were collected by centrifugation for 20 min at 6000 × g and 4 °C, washed in an excess of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, and stored at –20 °C as frozen pellets until further use. About4gof fresh weight of cells was collected from a 1000-ml culture. SsuE protein was purified as described under “Construction of the pTKXb-prnD Plasmid and Its Expression and Purification.” Reconstitution of PrnD Activity—PrnD activity was routinely assayed with HPLC. The assay mixture (final volume, 0.5 ml) contained 100 μm NADPH, 3 μm FMN, 500 μm substrate, SsuE and PrnD to a SsuE/PrnD molar ratio of 4.0 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and was stirred at 30 °C. The reactions were started by the addition of PrnD to the reaction mixture and analyzed by HPLC. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme forming 1 μmol of product/min at 30 °C under standard assay conditions, calculated from the rate of substrate depletion. Activity Assay of PrnD with Superoxide Dismutase, Xanthine Oxidase, and Hydroxyl Radical Scavengers—Superoxide dismutase was added to some of the incubation mixtures. After a 5-min preincubation at 30 °C with shaking, the reaction was started by the addition of aminopyrrolnitrin (1 mm). The reaction was run for 30 min and was terminated by pouring the incubation mixture into 10 ml of ice-cold dichloromethane that had previously been bubbled with N2 for 20 min and analyzed by HPLC. Incubation mixtures for the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) contained 75 μm of xanthine, 5 units of xanthine oxidase, and 1 mm of aminopyrrolnitrin in a final volume of 300 μl. Catalase, mannitol, or Me2SO were also included in some incubation mixtures. After a 5-min preincubation at 30 °C, the reaction was started by the addition of substrate, allowed to proceed for 30 min, and stopped and analyzed as described above. The production of pyrrolnitrin was linear under these conditions for at least 30 min. Protein Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were performed largely as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on a Mini-PROTEAN II system (Bio-Rad) with 12% polyacrylamide gels (30% acrylamide, 0.8% bis-acrylamide stock) under denaturing conditions. Protein concentrations were measured using the method of BCA (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples for SDS-PAGE were incubated, typically 5 min at 90–100 °C, with an equal volume of denaturing sample buffer. Broad range molecular weight standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Proteins from gels were transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Nonfat dry milk was used as the blocking agent. The His® monoclonal primary antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) and the secondary mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) were used at 1:10,000 and 1:20,000 dilutions, respectively. Cross-reacting protein bands were visualized with 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.17 mg/ml) and nitro blue tetrazolium (0.33 mg/ml) purchased from Sigma. Enzyme Kinetics and pH Profiles of the Kinetic Parameters—Kinetic parameters determined in atmospheric oxygen were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. To determine the kinetic constants for oxygen, the oxygen was removed from the enzyme reaction mixture by alternately filling and evacuating the vessel containing the reaction mixture with pure nitrogen. Different oxygen concentrations were bubbled through the substrate solutions for at least 10 min to obtain final oxygen concentrations of 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.6 mm. The concentrations of the arylamines varied from 20 μm to5mm. For assays at different pH values, the reactions were performed in the following buffers (50 mm) and pH values: sodium citrate (pH 5.0–5.5), potassium phosphate (pH 6.0–6.8), Tris/HCl (pH 7.0–9.0), and glycine/NaOH (pH 9.5–10.0). To construct the pH profiles, the kinetic parameters kcat and kcat/Km for aminopyrrolnitrin were determined between pH 5.0 and 9.5, and the pH dependence of Y (kcat/Km) was fitted to a bell-shaped curve described by Equation 1, which describes a bell-shaped curve with a slope of +1 at low pH and a slope of –1 at high pH, logY=log[YH/(1+H/K1+K2/H)] (Eq. 1) where H is the proton concentration, K1 and K2 are the dissociation constants for the groups that ionize at low and high pH, respectively, and YH is the pH-independent plateau value of Y at intermediate pH. The pH profile for kcat was constructed in a point-to-point manner. Analytical Methods—Optical spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectra (500 MHz) were measured with a DXR 500 AVANCE spectrometer from Bruker Instruments (Karlsruhe, Germany). EPR samples were prepared in an anaerobic chamber. The protein solution was transferred to an EPR tube, and after 5–10 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were quickly frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until EPR analyses. EPR measurements were performed on a Varian E-122 X-band spectrometer equipped with an Air Products Helitran cyrostat. Other parameters for the measurement include 2-milliwatt microwave power, 2-G modulation amplitude, and 9.08-GHz microwave frequency. The spectra were acquired at 15 K. Spin concentrations were determined by double integrating base line-corrected spectra. For calibration, a sample containing 1 mm CuSO4 in a 20% glycerol solution was run at the same power and temperature used for the protein samples. Mononuclear iron content was determined as described previously (28Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Potentiometric redox titrations monitored by EPR were preformed using sodium dithionite anaerobically in 20 mm buffer at pH 7. PrnD protein concentration was 56 μm. The following redox mediators were used: methyl viologen, benzyl viologen, neutral red, anthraquinone-2-sulfonate, anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzoquinone, phenazine methosulfate, menadione, and duroquinone, each at a concentration 50 μm. Acid-labile sulfide was determined as described elsewhere (29Gong X.M. Carmeli C. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 321: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Enzyme reaction products were analyzed and purified by an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC System. The sample was eluted on a ZORBAX SB-C8 Column (4.6× 150 mm, Agilent). HPLC parameters were as follows: 25 °C; solvent A, 1% acetic acid in water; solvent B, methanol; gradient, 5% B for 2 min; then to 100% B in 18 min and finally maintain at 100% B for 2 min; flow rate 1.0 ml/min; detection was by UV spectroscopy at 254 nm. Reactions in the Presence of 18O2—Two vials, one containing aminopyrrolnitrin and one containing the holo-PrnD reaction mixture, were degassed by application of a vacuum and flushed with argon for three times. The anaerobic holo-PrnD solution was transferred to the substrate vial containing aminopyrrolnitrin. The argon was removed by application of a vacuum, and finally 18O2 was allowed to enter into the vial. After incubation for 1 h at 30°C, the reaction was analyzed by HPLC coupled to an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (TSQ Quantum; ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) in positive ion mode. A linear gradient of MeOH (0–75%) in 0.1% aqueous acetic acid was used. Cloning and Heterologous Expression of PrnD—One of the most critical limitations for biochemical and mechanistic studies of PrnD to date has been the lack of an efficient method to obtain large amounts of purified enzymes. Indeed, soluble expression of PrnD has never been reported. In the present study, the gene encoding PrnD was amplified from P. fluorescens Pf-5 genomic DNA using PCR and cloned into the expression vectors pTKXb119 and pMal-c2x to give the plasmids pTKXb-prnD and pMal-c2x-prnD, respectively. Among them, the constitutive expression of the plasmid pTKXb-prnD with the N-terminal His6 tag in E. coli BL21(DE3) led to the soluble production of a protein of expected size ∼41 kDa that cross-reacted with a His6 tag-specific antibody but only at a low level requiring immunological detection (Fig. 2A, lane 4). The overall protein yield of pTKXb-PrnD (below 0.1 mg of purified PrnD obtained per liter of culture) was too low to be used for characterization of PrnD. Instead, a large amount of purified PrnD was obtained from the cleavage of MBP-PrnD fusion protein followed by affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Induction of the plasmid pMal-c2x-prnD with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C led to the overproduction of soluble MBP-PrnD fusion protein of expected size ∼85 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Induction of empty plasmid pMAL-c2x produced ∼40 kDa proteins of the size expected for MBP alon"

Galvanotropism in a direct current (DC) electric field represents a natural model of cell re-orientation toward the direction of future migration. Keratinocyte migration is regulated through both the nicotinic and muscarinic classes of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. We sought to identify the signaling pathway mediating the cholinergic regulation of chemotaxis and galvanotropism. The pharmacologic and molecular modifiers of the Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/ERK signaling pathway altered both chemotaxis toward choline and galvanotropism toward the cathode in a similar way, indicating that the same signaling steps were involved. The galvanotropism was abrogated due to inhibition of ACh production by hemicholinium-3 and restored by exogenously added carbachol. The concentration gradients of ACh and choline toward the cathode in a DC field were established by high-performance liquid chromatographic measurements. This suggested that keratinocyte galvanotaxis is, in effect, chemotaxis toward the concentration gradient of ACh, which it creates in a DC field due to its highly positive charge. A time-course immunofluorescence study of the membrane redistribution of ACh receptors in keratinocytes exposed to a DC field revealed rapid relocation to and clustering at the leading edge of α7 nicotinic and M1 muscarinic receptors. Their inactivation with selective antagonists or small interfering RNAs inhibited galvanotropism, which could be prevented by transfecting the cells with constitutively active MEK1. The end-point effect of the cooperative signaling downstream from α7 and M1 through the MEK1/ERK was an up-regulated expression of α2 and α3 integrins, as judged from the results of real-time PCR and quantitative immunoblotting. Thus, α7 works together with M1 to orient a keratinocyte toward direction of its future migration. Both α7 and M1 apparently engage the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway to up-regulate expression of the “sedentary” integrins required for stabilization of the lamellipodium at the keratinocyte leading edge.

Marubio L.M. Grando S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To characterize the physiologic control of keratinocyte migration, we developed an in vitro model of skin epithelialization, termed the agarose gel keratinocyte outgrowth system (AGKOS) (9Grando S.A. Crosby A.M. Zelickson B.D. Dahl M.V. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 804-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using AGKOS, we have demonstrated that activation of the keratinocyte nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) comprised by α7 subunits exhibit reciprocal effects on cell motility by stimulating directional (chemotaxis) and inhibiting random (chemokinesis) migration and that ACh-gated ion channels containing α3 subunit stimulate chemokinesis of KCs (8Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Marubio L.M. Grando S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, α7 nAChR has been shown to mediate chemotaxis of vascular smooth muscle cells toward nicotine (10Li S. Zhao T. Xin H. Ye L.H. Zhang X. Tanaka H. Nakamura A. Kohama K. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 94: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) subtypes M3 and M4 also exhibit reciprocal regulation of the keratinocyte migratory function by inhibiting or stimulating it via the signaling pathways coupled to preferential expression of either sedentary (α2 and α3) or migratory (α5, αv, and β5) integrins, respectively (11Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Wess J. Karlsson E. Grando S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).

This cytoplasmic protrusion, or leading lamella (pseudopodium), is free from organelles; it has the optically dense leading edge, or lamellipodium, and long, straight, stiff cylindrical rods, or filopodia, extending outward. Lamellipodium of a crawling cell attaches tightly to the substratum. Consistent with the idea that ion channels are involved at the leading lamella in directional migration of KCs are the results of experiments involving cathodal cell migration (galvanotaxis) and directed lamellipodium extension (galvanotropism) in direct current (DC) electric field (12Nishimura K.Y. Isseroff R.R. Nuccitelli R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 199-207PubMed Google Scholar). The exposed KCs orient the axis of direction of their migration parallel to the field lines and migrate toward the cathode. Because a membrane potential gradient asymmetrically alters transmembrane ion fluxes across the cell, the accumulations of ion channels leading to membrane depolarization at the leading lamellae have been proposed to explain protrusive activity and thereby direct cell locomotion (13Poo M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1981; 10: 245-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). An example of such field-induced redistribution of ion channels is accumulation of nAChRs at the cathode-facing cell pole, which continues to aggregate after the field has been terminated (14Young S.H. Poo M.M. Nature. 1983; 304: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Luther P.W. Peng H.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Peng H.B.

Turning of neuronal cells toward ACh gradient required the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and involved calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (18Zheng J.Q. Felder M. Poo M.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 19Zheng J.Q. Poo M.M. Connor J.A. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 4: 205-213PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of nAChRs on the cathodal side of a cell allows a focal ion flux and local osmotic swelling required for leading lamella and lamellipodium formation (18Zheng J.Q. Felder M. Poo M.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This phenomenon mimics known accumulation of muscle nAChRs at sites of nerve input where ACh is released (reviewed in Ref. 20Bloch R.J. Pumplin D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C345-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its highly positive charge (21DiPalma J.R. Basic Pharmacology in Medicine. 4th Ed. Medical Surveillance Inc., West Chester1994Google Scholar), ACh secreted by KCs should migrate toward the cathode, thus creating its own concentration gradient in a DC field. Hence, migration toward the cathode may represent migration toward the concentration gradient of ACh. Redistribution of α7 immunoreactivity to the leading edge of KCs upon exposure to a cholinergic chemoattractant precedes crescent shape formation and directional migration (8Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Marubio L.M. Grando S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that accumulation of α7 nAChRs is required for lamellipodium formation. The signaling downstream from α7 nAChR can proceed via several pathways. The Ca2+ ions that enter KCs through α7-made ACh-gated channels can raise the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ (22Grando S.A. Horton R.M. Mauro T.M. Kist D.A. Lee T.X. Dahl M.V. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 412-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Zia S. Ndoye A. Lee T.X. Webber R.J. Grando S.A. J Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 973-981PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway mediating α7-dependent keratinocyte chemotaxis includes intracellular free Ca2+, activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, conventional isoforms of protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and recruited Rac/Cdc42 (8Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Marubio L.M. Grando S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In various types of epithelial cells, α7 nAChR has been shown to utilize the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (24Schuller H.M. Plummer 3rd, H.K. Jull B.A. Anat. Rec. 2003; 270A: 51-58Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Jull B.A. Plummer 3rd, H.K. Schuller H.M. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Dajas-Bailador F.A. Soliakov L. Wonnacott S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This pathway has been implicated in the physiologic regulation of cell migration and chemotaxis (27Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Vaidya R.J. Ray R.M. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C350-C359Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ERK signaling pathways are engaged in healing of lens epithelial monolayer wounds and in the DC field-directed migration of the wound edge (29Wang E. Zhao M. Forrester J.V. McCaig C.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The putative mechanism of signaling along this pathway involves up-regulated expression of the sedentary integrin α2 (30Liang C.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21146-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that α7-mediated signaling can contribute to galvanotropism of KCs in a DC field, and that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway subserves the function of α7 and, possibly, some other subtypes of keratinocyte ACh receptors regulating directional migration of KCs. In this study, we measured the effects of pharmacologic and molecular modifiers of the specific steps in the Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/ERK signaling pathway in KCs crawling toward the concentration gradient of the α7 agonist choline, and in KCs turning toward the cathode in a DC electric field. We found that α7 works together with M1 to orient a keratinocyte toward direction of its future migration, and that both α7 and M1 receptors can employ the Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway to up-regulate expression of the α2 and α3 integrins required for stabilization of the lamellipodium.

Dermatol. 1993; 101: 32-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study has been approved by the University of California Davis Human Subjects Review Committee. The cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) in KGM containing 0.09 mm Ca2+ at 37 °C in a humid, 5% CO2 incubator. The purity of cultures was investigated immunocytochemically using DAKO-CK monoclonal mouse anti-human cytokeratin antibody (MNF 116) and was consistently >95%. The keratinocyte cultures used in the assays were between the passages 2 and 4. For transfection with siRNAs, we followed the standard protocol described in detail elsewhere (48Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Marubio L.M. Beaudet A.L. Jolkovsky D.L. Pinkerton K.E. Grando S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 597-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, KCs were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well of a 24-well plate and incubated for 16–24 h to achieve ∼70% confluence. To each well, increasing concentrations of siRNA duplex in the transfection solution with the TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) were added, and the transfection was continued for 16 h at 37 °C in a humid, 5% CO2 incubator. On the next day, the transfection medium was replaced by KGM, and the cells were incubated for 72 h to achieve maximum inhibition of the receptor protein expression, as was experimentally determined by Western blotting at different time points after transfection. The siRNA transfection efficiency was also assayed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled luciferase GL2 duplex (Dharmacon). The same generic protocol of KCs transfection was used to express MEK1 kinase mutants. The efficacy of expression of MEK1 mutants was assessed by Western blotting. Chemotaxis AGKOS Assay—In accordance to published protocol of the chemotaxis assay (8Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Marubio L.M. Grando S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the KCs seeded in the chemotaxis AGKOS plate were exposed to the concentration gradient of the α7 agonist choline for 10 days with daily changes of KGM and refreshing the chemoattractant solution. The cells were fed with a choline-free KGM custom prepared by Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR). After migration was terminated, a blueprint of the outgrowth was obtained and used to compute the directional migration distance. Some KCs were first transfected with siRNA and/or MEK1 mutants and then used in the chemotaxis assay. Galvanotropism Assay—KCs were seeded onto culture treated Thermanox® coverslips (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) at a cell density of 2.5 × 104, incubated overnight, mounted on the galvanotaxis chamber in a drop of KGM containing 0.2 mm Ca2+ (49Trollinger D.R. Isseroff R.R. Nuccitelli R. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 193: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and exposed for 1 h at 37°C to a DC electric field with a constant voltage of 100 mV/mm and a current of ∼0.5 mA, which is equivalent to the physiologic strength of the DC field detectable near the edge of skin wound (50Barker A.T. Jaffe L.F. Vanable Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: R358-R366PubMed Google Scholar). Compliant with the standard design (51Erickson C.A. Nuccitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 296-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), the galvanotaxis chamber was assembled on a glass slide using as spacers the number 1 glass coverslips (thickness 130–170 μm) onto which the Thermanox® coverslip with KCs was waxed, forming a 10-mm wide, ∼150-μm high, and 22-mm long trough bordered by 2% agar bridge electrodes at each end of the trough. After exposure, the KCs were fixed, and the number of cells oriented toward the cathode versus anode was counted at the magnification 10× in at least two randomly selected fields with ∼50–70 individual KCs from three different donors in each, and compared with corresponding control cells. Fig. 1 shows the high power view of human KCs prior to and after exposures that allows observation of cell morphology. The experiments were performed with KCs from three different donors, and the results are expressed as percentage of appropriate control. To visualize the ACh receptors and α2 and α3 integrins on the cell surface of KCs exposed to the DC field, the cells were fixed for 3 min in 3% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde that contained 7% sucrose, thus avoiding cell permeabilization, washed, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody, and then for 1 h at room temperature with secondary, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.). The fluorescence was examined with an Axiovert 135 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). The specificity of antibody binding was demonstrated by omitting the primary antibody or by replacing it with an irrelevant antibody of the same isotype and species as the primary antibody, as detailed elsewhere (45Ndoye A. Buchli R. Greenberg B. Nguyen V.T. Zia S. Rodriguez J.G. Webber R.J. Lawry M.A. Grando S.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the DC field on distribution of ACh molecules in a solution, a constant voltage of 100 mV/mm and a current of ∼0.5 mA were applied to a 1 mm solution of ACh in Tris-buffered saline, phosphate-buffered saline, or distilled water, and aliquots of the solution were pipetted out 3 min after beginning of the exposure at the anodal and the cathodal borders and subjected to ACh measurement. Measurement of ACh and Choline—ACh and choline were measured by cationic exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography combined with bioreactors and electrochemical detection, as described in detail elsewhere (52Reinheimer T. Bernedo P. Klapproth H. Oelert H. Zeiske B. Racke K. Wessler I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L722-L728PubMed Google Scholar). The BAS 481 microbore system was used (Bioanalytical Systems Inc., West Lafayette, IN). ACh and choline were separated on an analytical SepStik column (1 × 530 mm; BAS, Axel Semrau GmbH, Sprockhövel, Germany) using a mobile phase of 45 mm phosphate buffer and 0.3 mm EDTA (adjusted to pH 8.5). The analytical column was followed by an immobilized enzyme reactor (SepStik IMER.2/pkg; BAS) containing acetylcholinesterase to hydrolyze ACh and choline oxidase to produce H2O2. H2O2 flowing across a platinum electrode (reference electrode Ag/AgCl; set at 0.5 V) is oxidized, producing a current that is proportional to the amount of ACh in the sample. The 20-μl samples were injected by an automatic injector (Bio-Rad AS100). The amounts of ACh and choline were calculated by comparison with external standard containing 1 pmol/20 μl of both ACh and choline. ERK1/2 Activity Assay—To measure the effects of a DC field on the activities of ERK1 and ERK2 in KCs, we employed the phospho-ERK1/2 TiterZyme® enzyme immunometric assay kit (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), and followed the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, ∼1 × 105 KCs were seeded on a standard glass coverslip, incubated overnight to allow cell-substrate adherence, washed, and exposed for 30 min to the DC field described above. The cells were lysed with the lysis buffer, and the lysate was transferred to a microtiter plate with immobilized ERK monoclonal antibody. After a short incubation, the excess sample was washed out and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to phosphoERK was added. The amount of bound anti-phosphoERK antibody was measured at 450 nm, and the results are expressed as optical density (A) values. Real-time PCR Assay—The assay was performed as we previously described (48Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Marubio L.M. Beaudet A.L. Jolkovsky D.L. Pinkerton K.E. Grando S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 597-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cultured KCs at the end of experiments using the RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Primers for the genes encoding human integrins α2, α3, α5, and αV were designed with the assistance of the Primer Express software version 2.0 computer program (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and the service Assays-on-Design provided by Applied Biosystems.

Ceruloplasmin has ferroxidase activity oxidizing iron(II) to iron(III). In the present study, we analyzed the amount of ceruloplasmin, iron, ferritin, and transferrin and the ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity in serum of patients with the diagnosis of PD carrying the ceruloplasmin mutations I63T, D544E, and R793H. The impact of these missense mutations on the biosynthesis of holo-ceruloplasmin was investigated in cell culture experiments. Functional relevance was found for the ceruloplasmin mutations I63T and D544E. In vivo, the I63T mutation resulted in half the normal ceruloplasmin concentration and markedly reduced ferroxidase activity in serum from a heteroallelic PD patient. In cell culture, the I63T glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked ceruloplasmin isoform was retained in the endoplasmatic reticulum of human embryonic kidney cells. Furthermore, the D544E polymorphism resulted in significantly reduced serum ceruloplasmin levels and ferroxidase activity in heteroallelic patients and in expression of mainly apo-ceruloplasmin in cell culture. Our studies indicate that altered activity of ceruloplasmin may present a vulnerability factor for iron induced oxidative stress in PD."
https://openalex.org/W2124127114,"Achieving efficient distribution of neural stem cells throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and robust generation of specific neurons is a major challenge for the development of cell-mediated therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. We isolated a primitive neural stem cell subset, double positive for LeX(Le) and CXCR4(CX) antigens that possesses CNS homing potential and extensive neuronal repopulating capacity. Le+CX+ cells are multipotential and can generate neurons as well as myogenic and endothelial cells. In vivo Le+CX+ cells displayed widespread incorporation and differentiated into cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Since intravenous delivery could be a less invasive route of transplantation, we investigated whether Le+CX+ cells could migrate across endothelial monolayers. Intracerebral coadministration of SDF enabled migration of intravenously injected Le+CX+ cells into the CNS and a small, yet significant, number of donor cells differentiated into neurons. The isolation of a specific neural stem cell population could offer major advantages to neuronal replacement strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1981761756,"DNA damage triggers cellular signaling pathways that control the cell cycle and DNA repair. Chk2 is a critical mediator of diverse responses to DNA damage. Chk2 transmits signals from upstream phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-like kinases to effector substrates including p53, Brca1, Cdc25A, and Cdc25C. Using chromatin fractionation as well as immunostaining combined with detergent pre-extraction, we have found that a small pool of Chk2 is associated with chromatin prior to DNA damage. Recovery of chromatin-bound Chk2 is reduced in an ATM-dependent manner by exposure to ionizing radiation. Camptothecin and adriamycin also reduce the amount of chromatin-associated Chk2. The Thr68-phosphorylated forms of Chk2 induced by DNA damage are found in soluble fractions, but not in the chromatin-enriched fraction. Functional serine/threonine glutamine cluster domain, forkhead-associated domain, and kinase activity are all required for efficient reduction of chromatin-bound Chk2 in response to DNA damage. Artificial induction of Chk2 oligomerization concomitant with exposure to low dose ionizing radiation reduces chromatin-bound Chk2. When Chk2 is incubated with chromatin-enriched fractions in vitro in the presence of ATP, hyperphosphorylated forms of Chk2 bind more weakly to chromatin than hypophosphorylated forms. Taken together, our data suggest that DNA damage induces activation of chromatin-bound Chk2 by a chromatin-derived signal, and that this results in dissociation of activated Chk2 from chromatin, facilitating further signal amplification and transmission to soluble substrates.

DNA damage checkpoint pathways sense the damage promptly and execute coordinated cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest to allow time for efficient recovery, transcriptional induction of repair-related genes, and/or apoptosis. DNA damage checkpoint pathways are required for the maintenance of genome stability and prevention of tumor development.ATM and ATR, members of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-like kinase (PIKK) family, play central roles in damage responses. ATM is activated mainly by DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Cells from patients with ataxia telangiectaxia (AT), a severe disease caused by ATM mutations, have IR hypersensitivity, and defects in IR-induced G1, S, and G2/M cell cycle arrest. ATR responds to a broader range of signals, including UV-induced damage, DSBs, and stalled replication forks (1Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2131) Google Scholar). ATM and ATR phosphorylate a broad spectrum of substrates, including Chk1 and Chk2, which are important downstream effector kinases with overlapping functions.The principal kinase that relays signals initiated by ATM appears to be Chk2. UV irradiation or replication blockade cause the phosphorylation of Chk2 independent of ATM, possibly through ATR (2Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Activated Chk2 mediates the rapid IR-induced G1 arrest and inhibition of DNA synthesis through the phosphorylation of Cdc25A, which triggers the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Cdc25A (4Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In addition, Chk2 participates in G2/M arrest through the phosphorylation of mitosis-promoting Cdc25C phosphatase (5Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). By phosphorylating p53, Chk2 also helps maintain sustained G1, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis (6Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Additional substrates of Chk2 include the tumor suppressor Brca1, PML, and the transcription factor E2F1 (7Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H.

They include an amino-terminal SCD (SQ/TQ cluster domain), which contains multiple preferred SQ/TQ phosphorylation sites for PIKKs, a FHA (forkhead associated) domain, which binds to phosphopeptides, and a carboxyl-terminal protein kinase domain (6Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). ATM phosphorylates Chk2 at Thr68 (2Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K.

Various techniques, including fluorescent tagging, immunofluorescence, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and biochemical fractionation have revealed the damage-induced spatiotemporal behavior of checkpoint proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ddc1-Rad17-Mec3 complex (Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 homologs) and Rad24 (Rad17 homolog) are recruited to the DNA damage sites through a distinct mechanism from the recruitment of Mec1-Ddc2 (ATR-ATRIP homologs) (14Melo J.A.

Science. 2001; 294: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mammalian cells, Rad17 (a RFC-like protein) binds to chromatin prior to damage and, after DNA damage recruits Rad9-Rad1-Hus1, a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like protein complex, whereas ATR-ATRIP are recruited to chromatin independently. The chromatin-bound 9-1-1 complex helps ATR recruit and phosphorylate its substrates, including Rad17 (16Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Replication protein A (RPA)-coated single-stranded DNA facilitates the recruitment of both ATRIP-ATR and Rad17/Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complexes to DNA damage sites or stalled replication forks (17Zou L.

We have used chromatin fractionation and in situ detergent pre-extraction combined with immunofluorescence to investigate dynamic regulation of Chk2 by DNA damage. We found that a small pool of Chk2 is associated with chromatin before DNA damage. Irradiation reduces chromatin-bound Chk2 in an ATM-dependent manner. Topoisomerase inhibitors also decrease the association of Chk2 with chromatin. Hyperphosphorylated Chk2 binds more weakly to chromatin than its hypophosphorylated counterpart in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Chromatin Fractionation—Immortalized A-T fibroblasts A-T22IJE-T stably transfected with pEBS7 encoding full-length ATM tagged with FLAG or the control vector were kindly provided by Y.

HEK293 and AT cells stably transfected with vector or wild type ATM were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics.Chromatin fractionation was carried out as described in Ref. 31Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar with some modifications. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Ca2+ and Mg2+-free) and resuspended in solution A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, protease inhibitors (Roche)). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the cells were incubated for 5 min on ice. Cytosolic proteins (S1) were separated from nuclei by centrifugation (4 min, 1,300 × g). Nuclei were washed once in solution A, and then lysed in solution B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) for 30 min. Insoluble chromatin was then separated from soluble nuclear proteins (S2) by centrifugation (4 min, 1,700 × g), washed once in solution B, and collected by centrifugation (1 min, 10,000 × g). The final chromatin pellet (P) was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. To release chromatin-bound proteins by micrococcal nuclease treatment, nuclei were resuspended in solution A plus 1 mm CaCl2 and micrococcal nuclease (Sigma). After incubation at 14 °C, the digestion was stopped by the addition of 1 mm EGTA. Nuclei were separated from supernatant (S2A) by centrifugation and lysed. Chromatin (P) was separated from soluble nuclear proteins (S2B) by centrifugation and washed as above.Antibodies—Rabbit anti-phospho-T68 Chk2 antibody was described previously (32Tsvetkov L. Xu X.

Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Chk2 monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-Orc2 from BD Pharmingen, anti-Grb2 from BD Transduction Laboratories, and anti-HA monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate from Roche.In Vitro-coupled Transcription-Translation Assays—pCDNA-FlagChk2, wild type, and mutants (described in Ref. 10Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor) and allowed to swell on ice for 30 min. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization. The cytoplasmic fraction was separated from the nuclear pellet by centrifugation (15 min, 3,300 × g). Nuclei were washed with solution A, resuspended in solution A supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), and kept on ice for 30 min. The soluble nuclear fraction was separated from the chromatin-enriched fraction by centrifugation (10 min, 3,300 × g). The chromatin-enriched fraction was then washed with solution A and resuspended in solution A.In Fig. 8, A and B, FLAG-Chk2 translated from wheat germ extract in vitro or GST-Chk2 expressed in Escherichia coli was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with HEK293 chromatin preparation in kinase buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol), in the presence or absence of an ATP-regenerating system (5 mm ATP, 70 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase). Insoluble chromatin and proteins remaining in the supernatant were separated by centrifugation. The chromatin pellet was washed with solution A and the wash was combined with the supernatant. SDS sample buffer was added to the chromatin pellet. For FLAG-Chk2, the supernatant fraction was mixed with 200 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor), and anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma) were added. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 3 to 4 h. Precipitates were washed four times with NETN buffer. Then, SDS sample buffer was added to the beads. For GST-Chk2, SDS sample buffer was added directly to the supernatant.For consecutive chromatin binding and release assays (Fig. 8C), GST-Chk2 was incubated for 40 min at 30 °C with the HEK293 chromatin preparation in kinase buffer A, in the absence of an ATP-regenerating system. The reaction mixture was separated into three aliquots. No further incubation was carried out on the first aliquot. The second aliquot was incubated for another 40 min at 30 °C. An ATP-regenerating system was added to the third aliquot, before it was further incubated for another 40 min at 30 °C. For all three samples, insoluble chromatin and proteins remaining in the supernatant were separated by centrifugation. The chromatin pellet was washed once with solution A and the wash was combined with the supernatant. SDS sample buffer was added to the chromatin pellet and the supernatant.Transfection and Experimental Treatments—Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche). Stable transfectants were selected in growth medium containing G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were irradiated in a Mark I 137Cs irradiator (Shepard), treated with 1 μm camptothecin (Sigma) or 2 μm adriamycin (Sigma). For UV treatment, cells were irradiated with 254-nm UV light at a dose of 50 J/m2 with a Stratalinker (Stratagene).Recombinant Protein Purification—Expression of GST-Chk2 in E. coli strain BL21 was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopy-ranoside for 3 h. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor) with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, and sonicated. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to cleared lysates, and the mixture rotated for 2-4 h or overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. GST fusion protein was eluted with Glutathione Elution Buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione).Induced Oligomerization of 2FKBP-Chk2—HEK293 cells stably transfected with pcDNA-HA-2FKBP-Chk2 (WT or kinase-defective) (described in Ref. 10Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell.

Cell lysates were prepared and fractionated at the indicated times.Immunofluorescence—HEK293 cells were grown on 8-well culture slides (BD Biosciences). Cells were treated, or not, with 1 μm camptothecin for 3 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS, before being pre-extracted in situ on ice for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with polyclonal anti-Chk2 antibody (Santa Cruz) diluted in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20/PBS) at 37 °C. The slides were mounted with Anti-fade mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Images were captured using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a Sensicam camera.RESULTSChromatin-bound Chk2 Level Is Decreased after Certain Types of DNA Damage—Chk2 is phosphorylated and activated in response to DNA damage and replication blockade. Because Chk2 is important for the transduction of DNA damage signals, we investigated if Chk2 associates with chromatin and whether it undergoes damage-regulated relocalization. Cellular extracts were fractionated into cytoplasmic (S1), soluble nuclear (S2), and chromatin-bound components (P) (16Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 31Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Grb2 and Orc2, used as markers for S1 and P, respectively, were resolved well when these fractions were prepared from HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). Grb2 and Orc2 levels were not altered when cells were exposed to γ-irradiation prior to lysis (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-6). Chk2 is a nuclear protein (7Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H.

There was substantial recovery of Chk2 in cytosolic fractions (Fig. 1B, lane 7), presumably originating in leakage from a soluble nuclear compartment. The clean fractionation of Orc2 suggests that chromatin-bound proteins will not be affected under these conditions. A small proportion of Chk2 was detected in the chromatin-enriched fraction (P) in cells undergoing unperturbed growth (Fig. 1B, lane 1). This component was reduced by treatment with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Fig. 1C), confirming that this material is associated with chromatin. Under these conditions, most of the chromatin-bound Orc2 was released by MNase into soluble fractions (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 1Chromatin-associated Chk2 is reduced after IR. Extracts of HEK293 cells were fractionated as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, separation of a chromatin-bound protein (Orc2) and a cytoplasmic protein (Grb2).

IR induced the electrophoretic mobility shift associated with Chk2 hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 8). Interestingly, IR, but not UV, reduced the proportion of Chk2 associated with chromatin (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3). Chk2 levels in cytosolic fractions (S1) or whole cell lysates did not change after DNA damage (Fig. 1B, lanes 7-9, and data not shown). Pretreatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 had no effect on the decrease in chromatin-bound Chk2 (data not shown). The IR-induced hyperphosphorylated form of Chk2, which is the active form, was found mostly in the soluble fractions, including cytoplasmic and soluble nuclear fractions, but not in the chromatin-enriched fraction (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2, 5, and 8). Chromatin association of Orc2, the marker for the chromatin fraction, was not altered by either IR or UV treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3). Similar results were obtained with IR-treated U2OS cells (data not shown). Increasing doses of IR progressively reduced the amount of chromatin-associated Chk2 relative to the S1 fraction (Fig. 2, upper panel). This reduction of chromatin-associated Chk2 occurs rapidly, within 10 min after 10 Gy of IR (Fig. 2, middle panel). The hyperphosphorylated form of Chk2 appeared rapidly in both S1 and S2 fractions after 2 Gy of IR, but there was little change in the amount of chromatin-associated Chk2 (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Because the functional activation of nuclear ATM precedes and is separable from its retention at DNA double strand breaks (35Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P.

Phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 is prerequisite for the activation of Chk2 by IR (2Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2113216706,"Many theories have been advanced to account for the ageing process, among which the free radical theory deserves much attention. Numerous studies have also shown an association between tissue fibrosis and oxidative stress. Of note, fibrosis may be considered a significant index of tissue ageing. Calorie restriction (CR) has been demonstrated to maintain many physiological processes in a youthful state until a very advanced age. However the anti-ageing mechanisms of CR are still not fully understood. We thus evaluated the effect of CR on oxidative damage and its relationship with fibrosis during ageing. We found a significant increase of both oxidative stress and fibrosis parameters in the aortae from aged vs. young rats. CR reversed both phenomena. CR also protected against the age-associated increase of Jun-N-terminal kinase and p-38 activities, involved in TGFbeta1 expression and signaling. On the contrary, extracellular regulated kinases did not show any age-related change. CR similarly reversed the age-related increase of AP-1 DNA binding activity and the AP-1-dependent increase of vimentin gene expression. In parallel, CR reversed the age-related morphological alterations of the aorta wall cell composition. These data further support the relationship between oxidative stress and fibrosis in different diseases and during ageing. The protection exerted by CR against fibrosclerosis might be due to a decrease of oxidative stress, with consequent decreased MAPK activity and down-regulation of AP-1 activation and of TGFbeta1 expression and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2060869402,"In osteoblasts, the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and p38 as well as the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) have been implicated in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. The osteogenic growth peptide (OGP) is a 14-mer bone cell mitogen that increases bone formation and trabecular bone density and stimulates fracture healing. OGP-(10–14) is the physiologically active form of OGP. Using gene array analysis, real-time reverse transcription-PCR, and immunoblot and DNA synthesis assays we show here that in MC3T3 E1 and newborn mouse calvarial osteoblastic cultures the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic signaling is critically dependent on de novo synthesis of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (Mapkapk2) mRNA and protein. The increase in Mapkapk2 occurs following short term (5–60 min) stimulation of ERK1/2 activity by OGP-(10–14); phosphorylation of p38 remains unaffected. Downstream of Mapkapk2, CREB is phosphorylated on Ser133 leading to its enhanced transcriptional activity. That these events are critical for the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic signaling is demonstrated by blocking the effects of OGP-(10–14) on the ERK1/2 pathway, Mapkapk2, CREB, and DNA synthesis using the MEK inhibitor PD098059. The OGP-(10–14) stimulation of CREB transcriptional activity and DNA synthesis is also blocked by Mapkapk2 siRNA.

The present work was undertaken to identify osteoblastic MAP kinases involved in the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic action and to elucidate the OGP-(10–14) signaling pathway downstream of MAP kinase. We have identified a novel OGP-(10–14)-stimulated mitogenic pathway whereby short term activation of ERK1/2 enhances the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (Map-kapk2), resulting in increased phosphorylation and the transcriptional activity of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB).

Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was purchased from Sigma (catalog no. A-7030). Collagenase P was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Antibodies to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated ERK1/2, p38 MAP kinase, Mapkapk2, and CREB were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The respective PD098059 and SB203580 inhibitors of the ERK1/2-activating kinase MEK and p38 MAP kinases were from Calbiochem.

Cell Culture, Western Blotting, RNA Interference, and DNA Synthesis Measurement—Two culture models were employed in this study. MC3T3 E1 osteoblastic cells were maintained as reported previously (17Gabarin N. Gavish H. Muhlrad A. Chen Y.C. Namdar-Attar M. Nissenson R.A. Chorev M. Bab I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Newborn mouse calvarial osteoblasts (NeMCO) were prepared from 5-day-old mice by successive collagenase digestion (18Kato M. Patel M.S. Levasseur R. Lobov I. Chang B.H. Glass II., D.A. Hartmann C. Li L. Hwang T.H. Brayton C.F. Lang R.A. Karsenty G. Chan L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, MC3T3 E1 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish and incubated in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Subconfluent cultures were serum-starved overnight in 0.1% bovine serum albumin containing αMEM. Thereafter, the cells were incubated for various time periods, ranging from 5 min to 8 h, in the same medium with or without OGP-(10–14) and MAP kinase inhibitors. The cells were then rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The cells were then scraped off using a rubber policeman, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Samples from each lysate, containing 40–120 μg of protein, were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with nonfat dry milk in TBS/Tween-20. The Western blots were probed with antibodies to phosphorylated ERK1/2, ERK1/2, phosphorylated p38, p38, phosphorylated Mapkapk2, Mapkapk2, phosphorylated CREB, and CREB. Proteins on the Western blots were detected using the LumiGLO chemiluminescent detection system (Cell Signaling). DNA synthesis was measured as reported previously (17Gabarin N. Gavish H. Muhlrad A. Chen Y.C. Namdar-Attar M. Nissenson R.A. Chorev M. Bab I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After serum starvation the cells were incubated in 4% bovine serum albumin with or without OGP-(10–14) and with or without inhibitors of MAP kinase phosphorylation. After labeling with BrdUrd for 24 h, its incorporation into DNA was determined using a commercial kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—A luciferase construct reporting on CREB transcriptional activity, containing three copies of a canonical CRE (pCRE3-luc) was stably transfected into MC3T3 E1 cells. Resistance to hygromycin B (Calbiochem) was conferred by pCEP4 (Invitrogen) encoding hygromycin B phosphotransferase. Cells were plated in 6-well plates and cotransfected, using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, with pCRE3-luc and pCEP4 at a molar ratio of 15:1. Resistant cells were selected by treatment with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B for 20 days. Wells with 1–3 resistant colonies were propagated, and one cell line, in which luciferase activity was stimulated severalfold by forskolin, was chosen for further experiments. To test the effect of OGP-(10–14) on CREB transcriptional activity, the stably transfected cells, heretofore MC3T3 E1/CRE-luc, were plated in 48-well plates and grown for 48 h in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 2 h of starvation the cells were fed with OGP-(10–14) with or without PD098059 in αMEM containing 4% bovine serum albumin. The cells were harvested 13 h thereafter and lysed in “reporter lysis buffer” (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined using a microtiter plate luminometer (LB940 multilabel reader, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). RNA Interference—Inhibition of Mapkapk2 expression was achieved using a commercial siRNA kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kit included mouse Mapkapk2 siRNA (catalog no. SC-35856), control siRNA (catalog no. SC-37007), siRNA dilution buffer (catalog no. SC-29527), siRNA transfection reagent (catalog no. SC-29528), and siRNA transfection medium (catalog no. SC-36868). Briefly, MC3T3 E1 or NeMCO cells were seeded in 96-well plates, 5 × 103 cells/well in 200 μl of antibiotic-free medium. Cultures at ∼50% confluence were transfected with control or Map-kapk2 siRNA in transfection medium containing transfection reagent. After 5 and 30 h of incubation in control and Mapkapk2 siRNA, respectively, the cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then challenged with OGP-(10–14). RNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated from MC3T3 E1 and NeMCO cells incubated for 4 or 8 h with or without OGP-(10–14) and MAP kinase inhibitors using TRI reagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) followed by a phenol-chloroform phase extraction and isopropyl precipitation. RNA quality was assessed by light absorbance at 260 and 280 nm and by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. A similar RNA isolation protocol was applied to cells transfected with siRNA. cDNA Macroarray Analysis—RNA samples displaying an A260/280 ratio of 1.8 or higher and well defined 18 S and 28 S ethidium bromide-stained bands were subjected to expression analysis using mouse MAP kinase signaling pathways gene array kit (GEArray™ Q series, catalog no. MM-017; Superarray Bioscience Corp.). Synthesis of 32P-labeled cDNA and hybridization were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Digital images were acquired from autoradiographs with a phosphorimaging device (BAS2000, Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) at 200 pixel/inch and formatted (squared, cropped, inverted). The data were extracted using ScanAlyze 2.5 software (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). For each macroarray the formatted image was loaded into channel 1 and channel 2 (gain = 1). A grid of spots (10-pixel diameter) was overlaid and adjusted to the array image, and the average pixel intensity (API) within the spot was measured. GEArray Analyzer version 1.2 software (Superarray Bioscience Corp.) was used to calculate gene expression levels for each feature. The usable range of API values was 7,000–59,000. This range was established from the minimum (background) and maximum (or plateau) API value detected on the radiograph (∼6,000-∼65,000, respectively). API values outside of this range were re-evaluated on another autoradiograph with a different exposure time. API values equal to or less than the minimum background value on a 17-h exposure autoradiograph were classified as “absent calls.” API values for features adjacent to highly expressed genes were excluded from the analysis because of “bleeding” of the strong signals. After background subtraction, the data were normalized for each exposure. The autoradiographs showed a wide range of expression levels that prevented accurate measurement of all features at a single exposure time. We therefore performed multiple exposures and calculated the expression for each feature with the most appropriate normalization control included in each array (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, ribosomal protein L13a, or β-actin). Autoradiographs were inspected visually to determine the most appropriate normalization control. Real-time RT-PCR—A quantity of 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 as primer, together with 500 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was carried out with the LightCycler Instrument (Roche Applied Science) using the DNA binding dye SYBR Green I for detection of PCR products. Gene-specific PCR primers for Mapkapk2 were as follows: sense, 5′-GCCATTTTGAAACTCACTG-3′; antisense, 5′-AGGGACCTTCGTAGATTG-3′; and for β-actin: sense, 5′-GAGACCTTCAACACCCCAGCC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GGCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTC-3′. Expression level of the Map-kapk2 gene was evaluated as the ratio of its mRNA to that of β-actin mRNA. Statistical Analysis—Analysis of variance was employed for statistical analysis. When significant differences were indicated by analysis of variance, group means were compared using the Student-Newman-Keuls test for pairwise comparisons. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for the cDNA macroarray analysis. OGP-(10–14) Mitogenic Signaling in Osteoblasts Involves Activation of ERK1/2 but Not p38—Previously, we showed by immunoprecipitation and kinase assays that treatment of osteoblastic cells with OGP-(10–14) results in stimulation of MAP kinase (17Gabarin N. Gavish H. Muhlrad A. Chen Y.C. Namdar-Attar M. Nissenson R.A. Chorev M. Bab I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because the antibodies used in that study did not differentiate between MAP kinase subtypes, we performed Western analyses to identify the specific MAP kinase involved in the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic signaling. We initially investigated the activation of ERK1/2. Cells challenged for 5 min with different OGP-(10–14) concentrations clearly demonstrated a dose-dependent stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). The strongest signal was observed at 10–13 m, which is also the concentration at which OGP-(10–14) exhibits the strongest effects on both MAP kinase activity and MC3T3 E1 cell proliferation (17Gabarin N. Gavish H. Muhlrad A. Chen Y.C. Namdar-Attar M. Nissenson R.A. Chorev M. Bab I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Chen Y.C. Muhlrad A. Shteyer A. Vidson M. Bab I. Chorev M. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1624-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by OGP-(10–14) at 10–13 m was evident already after 5 min, was strongest after 15 min, and was sustained for at least 60 min (Fig. 1B). As expected, the OGP-(10–14)-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not observed in the presence of PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, the ERK1/2-activating kinase (20Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether ERK1/2 phosphorylation is required for the mitogenic activity of OGP-(10–14), we tested the effect of PD098059 on OGP-(10–14)-induced DNA synthesis in the MC3T3 E1 and NeMCO cultures (Figs. 1, D–F). Because OGP-(10–14) had not been tested in the NeMCO model, we initially carried out a dose-response analysis, testing the mitogenic effect of OGP-(10–14) in this system. OGP-(10–14) stimulated BrdUrd incorporation into newly synthesized DNA in these cells with a peak effect at 10–12 m (Fig. 1E). Therefore, the inhibition experiments that followed were carried out at this concentration. As shown in Fig. 1, D and F, the OGP-(10–14) stimulation of BrdUrd incorporation into newly synthesized DNA in the MC3T3 E1 and NeMCO cells was dose-dependently suppressed by the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor PD098059. These results suggest that stimulation of the ERK1/2 pathway is required for the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic signaling. To rule out the occurrence of an alternative MAP kinase signaling pathway in short term use of OGP-(10–14), we analyzed p38 activation employing a similar approach. OGP-(10–14) did not stimulate p38 phosphorylation in MC3T3 E1 osteoblastic cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 (21Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), did not inhibit the OGP-(10–14) stimulation of DNA synthesis in these cells even at 75 μm (Fig. 2B). Identification of OGP-(10–14)-regulated Genes Involved in MAP Kinase Signaling Pathway—To identify signaling pathways downstream of ERK1/2 that are affected by OGP-(10–14), we surveyed changes in gene expression in the MC3T3 E1 cells using a commercially available gene array system designed to analyze the mRNA levels of genes involved in the MAP kinase pathway. OGP-(10–14) significantly upregulated Mapkapk2, NFAT3, and Mef2c, which encode signaling molecules downstream of the MAP kinase (22ter Haar E. Structure. 2003; 11: 611-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J.

FASEB J. 1990; 9: 1595-1604Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, our MAP kinase-related gene array analysis suggests that OGP-(10–14) has a low though significant effect on the expression of Col1α1, which encodes the α1(I) chain of the predominant bone matrix protein type I collagen (25Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Owen T.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3111-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The expression of Kcnn1, a small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (26Bond C.T. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Open table in a new tab Regulation of Mapkapk2 Gene Expression by OGP-(10–14)—Of the signaling molecules downstream of the MAP kinase, OGP-(10–14) most strongly stimulated Mapkapk2 mRNA levels, by 3.03- and 5.21-fold following 4 and 8 h, respectively (TABLE ONE). To validate this response, we performed real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses of Mapkapk2 in OGP-(10–14)-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, in both the MC3T3 E1 and NeMCO cells Mapkapk2 mRNA was increased by more than 2-fold after 4 and 8 h of treatment, respectively. The up-regulation of Mapkapk2 mRNA resulted in a parallel increase at the protein level (Fig. 3C). We also investigated whether the increase in the Mapkapk2 protein was associated with an alteration in its phosphorylation status. Western analyses with antibodies against phosphorylated Thr222-labeled Mapkapk2 and phosphorylated Thr334-labeled Map-kapk2 yielded essentially the same results as those obtained with the pan antibody, suggesting that the OGP-(10–14)-induced increase in the 47-kDa Mapkapk2 was not associated with alterations in its phosphorylation status (Fig. 3C). The increases in Mapkapk2 mRNA and protein levels were blocked by PD098059 (Fig. 3), indicating that activation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway is critical for mediating the OGP-(10–14)-induced stimulation of Mapkapk2 expression. Mapkapk2 Mediates the Mitogenic Effect of OGP-(10–14)—We used RNA interference to silence the Mapkapk2 gene and determine whether Mapkapk2 plays a role in the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic activity. As in the case of some other genes, such as lamin A/C in HeLa SS6 cells (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) and S100A4 in periodontal ligament cells (28Kato C. Kojima T. Komaki M. Mimori K. Duarte W.R. Takenaga K. Ishikawa I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the Mapkapk2 siRNA knocked down the basal Mapkapk2 expression almost completely. It also repressed the OGP-(10–14) stimulation of Mapkapk2 mRNA (Fig. 4A). Likewise, compared with control siRNA, Mapkapk2 siRNA mitigated the stimulatory effect of OGP-(10–14) on DNA synthesis in both the MC3T3 E1 and NeMCO culture systems (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that Mapkapk2 is necessary for the mitogenic effect of OGP-(10–14). Interestingly, DNA synthesis in the absence of OGP-(10–14) was marginally inhibited by Mapkapk2 siRNA, suggesting a possible role for this kinase in setting the basal level of cell proliferation. OGP-(10–14) Stimulates Long Term CREB Phosphorylation and Transcriptional Activity—Because CREB is one of the main targets of Mapkapk2 (29Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), we assessed the effect of OGP-(10–14) on CREB activation. Although CREB is constitutively expressed in MC3T3 E1 cells, CREB phosphorylation is normally low, becomes readily detectable within 1 h after stimulation, and returns to a low level thereafter (30Ogasawara A. Arakawa T. Kaneda T. Takuma T. Sato T. Kaneko H. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indeed, phosphorylated CREB was readily detectable in cultures 30 min after medium change; however, OGP-(10–14) had no effect on CREB phosphorylation at this early time point (Fig. 5A). By contrast, although CREB phosphorylation returned to the low, hardly detectable levels in the control cultures 8 h after medium change, it was sustained for at least 8 h after administration of medium containing OGP-(10–14) (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, this long term CREB phosphorylation was no longer observed in the presence of PD098059, suggesting the involvement of the MEK-ERK1/2-Mapkapk2 axis. Luciferase assays were then performed to functionally investigate the transcriptional outcome after stimulation of the ERK1/2-Mapkapk2-CREB axis with OGP-(10–14). The effect of the peptide at various concentrations was measured in MC3T3 E1 cells stably transfected with a luciferase construct that reports on CREB transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 5B, OGP-(10–14) had a biphasic effect on luciferase activity in the MC3T3 E1/CRE-luc cells, with the maximum stimulation observed at 10–14 m. This bell-shaped curve is reminiscent of the OGP-(10–14) dose-response curve observed when DNA synthesis is measured (14Bab I. Gavish H. Namdar-Attar M. Muhlrad A. Greenberg Z. Chen Y. Mansur N. Shteyer A. Chorev M. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The OGP-(10–14) stimulation of CREB transcriptional activity was mitigated dose-dependently by the MEK-ERK1/2 inhibitor PD098059 (Fig. 5C) and by Mapkapk2 siRNA (Fig. 5D). Jointly, the established relationship between Mapkapk2 and CREB, the delayed OGP-(10–14) activation of both proteins, and the attenuation of the OGP-(10–14)-induced CREB activation and transcriptional activity by the MEK-ERK1/2 inhibitor PD098059 and Mapkapk2 siRNA (Fig. 5) suggest that CREB is the downstream link in an OGP-(10–14)-activated mitogenic signaling axis that is dependent on the stimulation of ERK1/2 activity and de novo synthesis of Mapkapk2. In this study we show that the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic signaling in osteoblastic cells involves rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and de novo Mapkapk2 mRNA and protein synthesis. Downstream of the activated Mapkapk2, OGP-(10–14) stimulates CREB phosphorylation and transcriptional activity (Fig. 6), which is inhibitable by suppressing ERK1/2 activation or Mapkapk2 protein synthesis. Using the MC3T3 E1 cell line, we have reported recently (17Gabarin N. Gavish H. Muhlrad A. Chen Y.C. Namdar-Attar M. Nissenson R.A. Chorev M. Bab I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that OGP-(10–14) acutely stimulates MAP kinase activity. ERK1/2 have been reported previously to mediate a handful of extracellular signals in osteoblasts (31Chen C. Koh A.J. Datta N.S. Zhang J. Keller E.T. Xiao G. Franceschi R.T. D'Silva N.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7586-7592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, to identify the specific MAP kinases activated by OGP-(10–14), we initially asked whether the peptide stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Indeed, OGP-(10–14) induced rapid and potent stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, this stimulation and the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic effect were blocked by the MEK (ERK1/2-activating kinase) inhibitor PD098059, indicating that ERK1/2 activation is a critical link in the OGP-(10–14) stimulation of DNA synthesis. Studies in osteoblastic and other cells demonstrated acute (minutes to hours) and/or delayed (days) ERK1/2 activation in response to different extracellular stimuli. Rapid responses that are sustained for several days were also reported (5Huang Z. Cheng S.L. Slatopolsky E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21351-21358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar, 36Jessop H.L. Sjoberg M. Cheng M.Z. Zaman G. Wheeler-Jones C.P. Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1045-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The acute response is attributable to direct, primary receptor-triggered phosphorylation events, whereas the delayed ERK1/2 activation is thought to be preceded by events such as calcium mobilization, prostaglandin production, and protein synthesis (37Ghayor C. Rey A. Caversario J. Bone. 2005; 36: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Jessop H.L. Rawlinson S.C. Pitsillides A.A. Lanyon L.E. Bone. 2002; 31: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic effect is dependent, at the very least in part, on rapid ERK1/2 activation. This is based on the following observations: (i) ERK1/2 was activated after a 5–60-min challenge with OGP-(10–14), and this activation was prevented by 15 min of treatment with PD098059; (ii) the PD098059 suppressed OGP-(10–14)-stimulated Mapkapk2 mRNA level after 4 h; and (iii) the PD098059 inhibited OGP-(10–14)-induced CREB phosphorylation after 8 h. We have noted previously that unlike the case of many other mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 (whereby stimulation of DNA synthesis is measurable already after 24 h) (39Shimoaka T.

Krane S.M. Walters K. Pilbeam C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), ∼48 h are required before the mitogenic action of OGP-(10–14) becomes traceable (10Bab I. Chorev M. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that the OGP-(10–14)-activated signaling cascade downstream of the MAP kinase involves de novo mRNA and protein synthesis. Indeed, using hybridization to cDNA arrays, real time RT-PCR, and Western analyses we demonstrate that accumulation of Mapkapk2 mRNA and protein are critical events in the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic signaling. We further show a parallel increase in phosphorylated Mapkapk2, suggesting that stimulation of the non-phosphorylated Mapkapk2 substrate leads to a parallel stimulation of the phosphorylated Mapkapk2 product. The increase in activated Mapkapk2 is traceable after several hours but not within the first hour of challenge with OGP-(10–14), in line with the requirement for de novo protein synthesis. That de novo Mapkapk2 protein synthesis is essential for the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic activity is demonstrated by its inhibition using Mapkapk2 siRNA. Although Map-kapk2, also designated MK2 (22ter Haar E. Structure. 2003; 11: 611-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), is generally thought to be a substrate for p38 (41Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M.

Marshall C.J. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5920-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it was originally identified as an ERK target (43Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PD098059 partially inhibits the activation of Mapkapk2 by the G-protein coupled receptor agonist endothelin-1 (44Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear to what extent the ERK stimulation of Mapkapk2 is dependent on de novo protein synthesis, such dependence is suggested by several instances where prolonged challenging was required for its activation (45Cheng T.J. Lai Y.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 46Vician L.J. Xu G. Liu W. Feldman J.D. Machado H.B. Herschman H.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). That the OGP-(10–14) stimulation of Mapkapk2 synthesis and phosphorylation is dependent on ERK1/2 activation is shown by its complete inhibition with PD098059. The other MAP kinase candidate that we tested, p38, is not activated by exposure to OGP-(10–14), and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 does not affect the OGP-(10–14)-stimulated DNA synthesis suggesting that ERK1/2 are the only MAP kinases involved in the OGP-(10–14) mitogenic signaling. CREB is one of the best characterized stimulus-induced transcription factors. It activates transcription of target genes in response to a diverse array of stimuli, including peptide hormones and growth factors that stimulate a variety of protein kinases (47Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). In osteoblastic cells CREB is activated by extracellular stimuli including parathyroid hormone, epidermal growth factor, and prostaglandin E2 (7Guicheux J. Lemonnier J. Ghayor C. Suzuki A. Palmer G. Caverzasio J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 2060-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 48Samoto H. Shimizu E. Matsuda-Honjyo Y. Saito R. Nakao S. Yamazaki M. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. Sodek J.

Furthermore, a parathyroid hormone-activated pathway involving ERKs and CREB has been implicated recently (31Chen C. Koh A.J. Datta N.S. Zhang J. Keller E.T. Xiao G. Franceschi R.T. D'Silva N.J. McCauley L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29121-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in osteoblasts. The present data demonstrate an osteoblastic mitogenic pathway involving transcriptional activity by CREB. These data further suggest that Mapkapk2 links the activation of ERK1/2 and CREB, thus leading to increased DNA synthesis. It has been demonstrated previously in the MC3T3 E1 osteoblastic cell line and primary stromal cells derived from adult human bone marrow that the activity of OGP is concentration-dependent (9Bab I.

Biochem. 1997; 65: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At low doses, exogenous OGP stimulates endogenous OGP production with the resultant increase in exogenous OGP stimulating mitogenesis (10Bab I. Chorev M. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The fast increase in endogenous OGP production is not attributable to de novo protein synthesis. Hence, it is most likely that the pathway proposed by our previous (17Gabarin N. Gavish H. Muhlrad A. Chen Y.C. Namdar-Attar M. Nissenson R.A. Chorev M. Bab I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and present results, which involves the stimulation of Mapkapk2 mRNA and protein synthesis, is employed by the osteoblastic mitogenic response proper. In the MC3T3 E1 model this pathway consists of Gi protein and ERK1/2 activation, accumulation of Mapkapk2, and stimulation of CREB (Fig. 6). Moreover, the similarity in the OGP-(10–14)-induced ERK1/2 and Mapkapk2 activation between the MC3T3 E1 cell line and the primary NeMCO model suggests that this pathway is shared by osteoblastic cells in vivo. Further investigation is needed to validate this pathway in human osteoblasts and to identify missing links upstream of Mapkapk2 and downstream of CREB."
https://openalex.org/W2041413396,"The neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) flavoprotein domain (nNOSr) contains regulatory elements that repress its electron flux in the absence of bound calmodulin (CaM). The repression also requires bound NADP(H), but the mechanism is unclear. The crystal structure of a CaM-free nNOSr revealed an ionic interaction between Arg1400 in the C-terminal tail regulatory element and the 2′-phosphate group of bound NADP(H). We tested the role of this interaction by substituting Ser and Glu for Arg1400 in nNOSr and in the full-length nNOS enzyme. The CaM-free nNOSr mutants had cytochrome c reductase activities that were less repressed than in wild-type, and this effect could be mimicked in wild-type by using NADH instead of NADPH. The nNOSr mutants also had faster flavin reduction rates, greater apparent Km for NADPH, and greater rates of flavin auto-oxidation. Single-turnover cytochrome c reduction data linked these properties to an inability of NADP(H) to cause shielding of the FMN module in the CaM-free nNOSr mutants. The full-length nNOS mutants had no NO synthesis in the CaM-free state and had lower steady-state NO synthesis activities in the CaM-bound state compared with wild-type. However, the mutants had faster rates of ferric heme reduction and ferrous heme-NO complex formation. Slowing down heme reduction in R1400E nNOS with CaM analogues brought its NO synthesis activity back up to normal level. Our studies indicate that the Arg1400-2′-phosphate interaction is a means by which bound NADP(H) represses electron transfer into and out of CaM-free nNOSr. This interaction enables the C-terminal tail to regulate a conformational equilibrium of the FMN module that controls its electron transfer reactions in both the CaM-free and CaM-bound forms of nNOS.

Our studies indicate that the Arg1400-2′-phosphate interaction is a means by which bound NADP(H) represses electron transfer into and out of CaM-free nNOSr. This interaction enables the C-terminal tail to regulate a conformational equilibrium of the FMN module that controls its electron transfer reactions in both the CaM-free and CaM-bound forms of nNOS.

Each NOS is composed of an N-terminal oxygenase domain that contains binding sites for iron protoporphyrin IX (heme), 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin, and Arg, and a C-terminal flavoprotein domain (NOSr) that contains binding sites for FAD, FMN, and NADPH (10Stuehr D.J.

CaM plays a critical role in activating NO synthesis, because its Ca2+-dependent binding triggers electron transfer from the FMN hydroquinone to the ferric heme (14Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc.

In NOSr, a hydride transfer occurs from NADPH to FAD within the FNR module, followed by electron transfer from the FAD hydroquinone to FMN (17Daff S. Noble M.A. Craig D.H. Rivers S.L. Chapman S.K.

The reduced FMN module (containing FMN hydroquinone) is then thought to swing away from the FNR module to transfer electrons to the NOS ferric heme or to exogenous acceptors like cytochrome c (Fig. 1A) (30Garcin E.D. Bruns C.M. Lloyd S.J. Hosfield D.J. Tiso M. Gachhui R. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. J. Biol.

According to this model, the steady-state activity of nNOSr is determined in part by a conformational equilibrium that determines the probability and extent to which the FMN module interacts with its electron donor (FNR) and the electron acceptor (NOS heme or cytochrome c). Recent reports suggest that NADP(H) binding shifts the set point for the conformational equilibrium to favor an “FMN shielded” form of nNOSr that has repressed cytochrome c reductase activity (32Craig D.H.

CaM shifts the conformational equilibrium in the opposite direction to favor a deshielded FMN module that is associated with increased cytochrome c reductase activity. Notably, a single point mutation within nNOSr reverses the effect of NADP(H) binding such that it then mimics CaM in influencing the conformational equilibrium of nNOSr and its catalysis (34Konas D.W.

These results imply a finely tuned regulation of FMN module reactivity in nNOSr.Studies with NOS chimeras established that the identity of NOSr determines the ferric heme reduction rate in a given NOS (35Siddhanta U.

At least three unique regulatory elements are present in NOSr. They are an autoinhibitory helix, represented by a 42- to 45-amino acid insert in the FMN module of eNOS and nNOS (38Salerno J.C.

Although these studies established a basic framework for regulation in nNOSr, they could not discern the physical basis for the effects nor address their potential relationships.A recent crystal structure of an intact, CaM-free nNOSr (Protein Data Bank Code 1TLL) has revealed how certain regulatory elements may repress electron transfer (30Garcin E.D. Bruns C.M. Lloyd S.J. Hosfield D.J. Tiso M. Gachhui R. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37918-37927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Specifically, the position of the C-terminal tail helix suggests that it physically restrains the FMN module from moving away from the FNR module as required for its electron transfer functions (Fig. 1B). A closer view reveals that the C-terminal tail residue Arg1400 makes an ionic interaction with the negatively charged 2′-phosphate group of bound NADP(H) (Fig. 1C). We therefore hypothesized that Arg1400 enables an interaction between bound NADP(H), the C-terminal tail, and the FMN module that could conceivably link NADP(H) binding to repression of FMN electron transfer in CaM-free nNOS. In the current report, we explore this hypothesis by characterizing mutants of nNOSr and full-length nNOS enzymes that contain amino acid substitutions designed to either eliminate the charge interaction between Arg1400 and the 2′-Pi of NADPH, or switch it to a charge-repelling interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and General Methods—All reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma or sources previously reported (47Siddhanta U.

David Johnson, Biochemistry Dept., Ohio State University.UV-visible spectra and steady-state kinetic data were recorded on a Hitachi U2000 spectrophotometer or Varian Cary 100 Bio spectrophotometer using a quartz cuvette with a 1-cm path length. Single wavelength stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed using a Hi-Tech (Salisbury, U.K.) SF-51MX instrument equipped for anaerobic work and photomultiplier detection. Full-spectra stopped-flow experiments were performed using a Hi-Tech SF-61 instrument equipped for anaerobic work and rapid-scanning diode array detection. The buffer used for all experiments and protein purifications (Buffer A) unless noted otherwise contained 40 mm EPPS (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl. When necessary, samples were made anaerobic in an air-tight cuvette by repeated cycling of vacuum followed by a positive pressure of catalyst-deoxygenated nitrogen. The nNOS reductases were prepared for use by oxidizing the purified air-stable semiquinone form with potassium ferricyanide followed by passing the mixture through a PD-10 desalting column.Molecular Biology—Restriction digestions, cloning, bacterial growth, transformation, and isolation of DNA fragments were performed using standard techniques. Originally rat nNOS DNA was inserted into the pCWori vector at 5′-NdeI and 3′-XbaI restriction sites. The R1400S and R1400E mutation sites in the nNOS cDNA were constructed by sub-cloning a PCR-generated fragment from the pCWori/nNOS using a 5′-oligonucleotide constructed as previously reported (34Konas D.W.

The nNOS cDNA fragment coding from the KpnI unique restriction site at position 4170 to the XbaI restriction site at position 4441 was amplified using primers as follows: R1400S forward primer, AAC CGG TAC CAC GAG GAC ATC TTT GGA GTC ACC CTC AGC ACG; R1400E forward primer, AAC CGG TAC CAC GAG GAC ATC TTT GGA GTC ACC CTC GAA ACG. The reverse primer in both cases was AAA TCT AGA AGG ACC AGG ACA CAG CAA CAG GAC AAG. Mutations are denoted in bold; silent restriction sites are underlined. The sequences of mutations were confirmed at the Cleveland Clinic DNA sequencing facility, and DNA containing the desired mutation was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. These cells were also transformed with a pACYC plasmid containing human CaM and selected with chloramphenicol to co-express CaM with the nNOS protein.Expression and Purification—The nNOSr domain (construct 695–1429) has been purified by sequential chromatography on a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column and CaM-Sepharose resin following a procedure recently published (34Konas D.W.

The protein was dialyzed against buffer A (see “Experimental Procedures”) and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and spectral analysis. The flavin content of the nNOSr proteins was obtained by boiling a known amount of nNOSr protein for 3 min followed by short centrifugation and determination of the flavin concentration in the supernatant using an extinction coefficient of 12.2 mm-1 cm-1 at 447 nm. The full-length wild-type and mutant nNOS proteins were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing a His6 tag in the N termini to aid purification in a Ni-resin affinity column (54Stuehr D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 324-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was estimated by quantification of heme protein content as evidenced through the formation of the ferrous-CO adduct with an absorption maxima at 444 nm (55Adak S. Ghosh S.

In the case of NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation the oxyhemoglobin assay buffer solution contains also 150 mm NaCl.Measurement of Apparent Km and Kcat for NADPH and NADH— Apparent Km and kcat values of wild-type and mutants nNOS enzymes were determined in the presence or absence of bound Ca2+/CaM by analysis of cytochrome c reduction measured at 550 nm using quartz cuvettes or a 96-microwell Molecular Dynamics kinetic plate reader. Assays were run at 25 °C in 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 70 μm cytochrome c, 0.6 mm EDTA, or 0.8 mm Ca2+, and 0.1 μm CaM and variable concentrations of NADPH (0.5–15 μm) or NADH (0.33–10 mm). Assay volumes were 0.66 ml for cuvettes and 0.2 ml for microwell plates. Reactions were started by adding 1.5 nm enzyme. Data were fitted to the classic Michaelis-Menten equation for analyzing the enzyme kinetics using the software Origin® version 6.1.Auto-oxidation of Reduced nNOSr—A solution of nNOSr protein (8–10 μm) containing EDTA (0.5 mm) in air-saturated buffer was reduced by adding excess NADPH (200 μm) and then allowed to autooxidize at room temperature in an open cuvette. The process was monitored at 457 nm, and visible spectra at indicated time points (see “Results”) were recorded in similar experiments.Anaerobic Stopped-flow Flavin Reduction Kinetics—The absorbance changes associated with nNOSr flavin reduction by NADPH were recorded at 10 °C in the single-wavelength stopped-flow instrument by rapidly mixing a solution of oxidized nNOSr (6–8 μm) containing either EDTA (1 mm) or CaCl2 (2 mm) plus CaM (18–24 μm) with a solution of 60–100 μm NADPH (excess NADPH). For each protein sample used the maximum absorbance value at 457 nm was obtained by replacing the NADPH solution in one of the stopped-flow syringes with buffer only and recording two to three additional mixing events. The individual rate constants were first estimated by analyzing experiments of different time duration. The final reported values were obtained by fitting to a quadruple exponential function experiments at a 2-s time scale, which captures all four rate constants. The residuals were minimized, and the signal-to-noise ratio was improved by averaging four to five individual mixing experiments. Percent absorbance changes were calculated for the absorbance change occurring in the instrument dead time (1.5 ms), and each kinetic phase was calculated as the ratio between the total absorbance change and the relative ΔAbs (absorbance change) value of each kinetics phase as obtained from the fitting program.Anaerobic Pre-steady-state Cytochrome c Reduction—A solution of nNOSr (16 μm), glycine (3 mm), 5-deazariboflavin (catalytic), and either EDTA (1 mm) or CaCl2 (2 mm) plus CaM (30 μm) was completely photoreduced in an anaerobic cuvette using a commercial slide projector bulb until no changes in the UV-visible spectrum of the sample were observed upon further irradiation of the sample. The pre-reduced protein sample was rapidly mixed in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer with a solution of cytochrome c (4 μm) at 10 °C, and the absorbance changes at 550 nm were recorded. In some cases 1 mm NADPH was added to the pre-reduced protein sample, and the mixture was incubated at 10 °C for at least 15 min prior to mixing. Absorbance data were then fit to a single exponential function.Heme Reduction of Full-length Proteins—Kinetics of heme reduction was analyzed at 10 °C as described previously (56Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by mixing an anaerobic, buffered, CO-saturated solution containing 100 μm NADPH with 4 μm nNOS (wild-type or mutant) prepared under anaerobic conditions in 100 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Arg, and 10 μm CaM, or 20 μm soybean or chimeras CaM isoforms. Heme reduction was followed by formation of the ferrous-CO complex at 444 nm. The time course of absorbance changes was fit to a single exponential equation using a nonlinear least square method provided by the instrument manufacturer. The initial spectrum recorded without NADPH was used as a baseline. Signal-to-noise ratio was improved by averaging data from multiple individual mixing experiments.Kinetics of Heme-NO Complex Formation—Experiments were done at 10 °C in a SF-61 Hi-Tech stopped-flow apparatus. To initiate NO synthesis an air-saturated solution that contained 100 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 5 μm nNOS or mutant, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Arg, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm Ca2+, and 10 μm CaM was rapidly mixed with a buffered solution containing 50 μm NADPH. Absorbance at 436 nm was monitored to follow ferrous heme-NO formation, and absorbance at 340 nm was monitored to follow NADPH oxidation (56Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D.

Each experiment was performed three separate times.Analysis of Stopped-flow Data—In most cases, the spectral traces were fit according to single or multiple exponential equations, with the residuals for each fit determined by the software. The best fit was designated when adding further exponentials did not improve the fit as judged by the residuals. In the case of flavin reduction by excess NADPH, we used a four exponential equation to fit the absorbance change at 457 nm, as done in previous reports (34Konas D.W. Zhu K. Sharma M. Aulak K.S.

The nNOSr enzymes were obtained in about 3-fold greater yield than the full-length proteins. All enzymes were found to have 2 mol of flavin incorporated (FAD plus FMN) per mole of protein (data not shown). Spectrophotometric analysis of the full-length proteins showed that 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin and Arg binding caused their heme Soret bands to shift to a high spin state, and reduction of the enzymes in the presence of CO produced the expected 444 nm Soret absorbance peak for the ferrous heme-thiolate CO complex (data not shown). These findings indicate that the mutations at Arg1400 do not grossly perturb enzyme structure, prosthetic group and substrate binding, or heme electronic environment.Interactions of nNOSr Enzymes with NADPH and NADH Cofactors— We investigated the importance of Arg1400 interaction with the 2′-Pi group of NADPH by measuring cytochrome c reductase activities in reactions that were supported either by NADPH or NADH. Fig. 2 shows representative plots of initial velocity versus dinucleotide substrate concentrations for the wild-type and R1400E nNOSr enzymes (data for R1400S nNOSr is not shown). TABLE ONE contains the apparent kcat values obtained for these experiments. In the NADPH-supported reactions the wild-type and Arg1400 mutant enzymes had similar apparent kcat values in the CaM-bound state. However, the apparent kcat of the CaM-free wild-type was suppressed 10-fold relative to its CaM-bound value, consistent with previous reports (39Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Of these six introns, only the RIR-3 intron encodes a maturase protein and showed efficient RNA splicing when expressed in Escherichia coli cells. The other five introns do not encode a maturase protein and did not show RNA splicing in E. coil. But these maturase-less introns showed efficient RNA splicing when the RIR-3 intron-encoded maturase protein was co-expressed from a freestanding gene in the same cell. These findings demonstrated that an intron-encoded protein could function as a general maturase for multiple introns of different genes.

Major implications may include an intron-mediated co-regulation of the different genes and a resemblance of the evolutionary origin of spliceosomal introns. Group II introns are mobile genetic elements and presumed evolutionary progenitors of nuclear spliceosomal introns (1Lambowitz A.M. Zimmerly S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 2Cavalier-Smith T. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). RNA sequences of group II introns can be folded into a conserved six-domain structure with properties of a catalytic RNA (3Lambowitz A.M. Belfort M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 4Michel F. Ferat J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Group II introns are found more abundantly in mitochondria and chloroplasts (5Edgell D.R. Belfort M. Shub D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Bonen L. Vogel J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 322-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), where they reside in conserved genes. In contrast, most bacterial group II introns were found in mobile DNA or outside of genes (5Edgell D.R. Belfort M. Shub D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5281-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Toro N. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which may suggest barriers against intron insertion in conserved bacterial genes. To do RNA splicing in vivo, group II introns require proteins or maturase to help the intron RNA fold into a structure that is catalytically active (1Lambowitz A.M. Zimmerly S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 3Lambowitz A.M. Belfort M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), although some group II introns can self-splice in vitro under non-physiological conditions. Most bacterial group II introns and some organelle group II introns encode a protein typically in the domain IV loop region of the folded intron structure. The intron-encoded protein functions as a maturase to assist the RNA splicing, in addition to assisting intron retrohoming or retrotransposition (8Matsuura M. Noah J.W. Lambowitz A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7259-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Zimmerly S. Hausner G. Wu X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1238-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Previously characterized intron-encoded maturase proteins assist specifically the intron that encodes the maturase, although it is possible that closely related maturases may cross-react. In mitochondria and chloroplasts, many group II introns do not encode a maturase protein, and at least some of the maturase-less introns have recruited nuclear proteins to assist the RNA splicing (1Lambowitz A.M. Zimmerly S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, indirect evidences have suggested that maturase-less group II introns may be assisted by a maturase protein encoded in another intron (10Wolfe K.H. Morden C.W. Palmer J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10648-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 11Vogel J. Borner T. Hess W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3866-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but this has not been demonstrated. In bacteria, maturase-less group II introns are rare and found recently in an Archaea and a thermophilic cyanobacterium (12Dai L. Zimmerly S. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Most bacterial introns are located outside genes or conserved genes, and it is not known whether or how the maturase-less introns do RNA splicing. Here we report an unusual case of four maturase-less group II introns in a conserved bacterial protein gene, which is the largest number of introns known in a bacterial gene. More interestingly, these maturase-less introns could do RNA splicing in Escherichia coli when assisted by a maturase protein encoded in another intron of a different gene. This demonstrated for the first time that an intron-encoded protein could function as a general maturase for multiple introns of different genes, which has interesting implications on intron evolution and on possible roles of intron in coordinating gene expression. Gene Cloning and Sequence Analysis—The dnaN gene, or parts of it, was amplified from genomic DNA of Trichodesmium erythraeum strain IMS101, by doing PCR using the high fidelity DNA polymerase Phusion (Finnzymes). The resulting DNAs were cloned in a plasmid vector pDrive (Qiagen) at the T/A cloning site, and DNA sequences were determined through automated DNA sequencing. GenBank™ searches, sequence alignments, and intron RNA folding were performed using the BLAST search program (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar), the Clustal W program (14Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), and the Mfold program (15Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (9968) Google Scholar), respectively. RNA Splicing Analysis—Intron-containing DNAs were PCR-amplified and inserted in a ColEI-derived pDrive plasmid vector behind a Ptac promoter. This plasmid has an ampicillin resistance gene, and the Ptac promoter is inducible with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). 2The abbreviations used are: IPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosidentnucleotideRTreverse transcription. The coding sequence of the maturase protein was PCR-amplified and inserted in a modified pAR plasmid vector behind a PBAD promoter. This plasmid was derived from a pACYC184 plasmid that is compatible with ColEI-derived plasmids, it has a chloramphenical resistance gene, and the PBAD promoter is inducible with l-arabinose. Site-specific mutations (single nucleotide insertion in the maturase coding sequence and deletion of the domain IV loop region from some introns) were produced through inverse PCR using specific primers at the sites of mutation. DNA sequences of cloned DNAs were confirmed through automated DNA sequencing. Individual recombinant plasmid was introduced into E. coli cells through electroporation. For co-expression experiments, two plasmids were introduced sequentially into the same E. coli cells, and transformed cells were selected and maintained in the presence of both ampicillin and chloramphenical. isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside nucleotide reverse transcription. For RNA splicing assays, E. coli cells containing the specified plasmid were grown in liquid Luria Broth medium at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A600, 0.3). IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm to induce transcription of the intron-containing gene, and the induction was continued for 2 h. For cells containing also the maturase-encoding plasmid, l-arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% to induce production of the maturase protein 30 min before adding IPTG. Total RNAs of the induced cells were extracted and treated with RNase-free DNase using the RNAease kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription and subsequent PCR were carried out using specified primers and the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR kit (Qiagen). The resulting DNA products were identified by their predicted sizes and confirmed through cloning and DNA sequencing. Identification and Sequence Analysis of dnaN Gene and Its Introns—The recent findings of group II introns in an RIR gene (16Liu X.Q. Yang J. Meng Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46826-46831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) prompted us to find similar introns in related genes in the nearly complete genome sequence of the oceanic N2-fixing cyanobacterium T. erythraeum strain IMS101 (www.jgi.doe.gov), which had been determined at the United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. This search revealed an intron-rich dnaN gene as illustrated in Fig. 1, whose 6,510-bp sequence consists of five exons and four group II introns. The five exons are 30, 55, 158, 303, and 615 bp long, respectively, and together they predict a 387-amino acid protein sequence that is highly similar to DnaN sequences of related organisms. As shown in Fig. 1, the predicted DnaN protein sequence is 54–57% identical and 70% similar to intron-less DnaN sequences of other cyanobacteria. It is also 23% identical and 42% similar to the functionally characterized E. coli DnaN protein sequence (data not shown). The four introns in the dnaN gene, referred to as dnaN-1, -2, -3, and -4 introns, are 1408, 1128, 1835, and 978 nt long, respectively. Boundaries of these introns were easily predicted through sequence comparisons with intron-less dnaN genes of closely related organisms (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, the four introns are similar to one another and also to two other introns previously identified in the same organism. The previously identified introns are the T.er.I3 and T.er.I4 introns in the RIR gene encoding a ribonucleotide reductase (16Liu X.Q. Yang J. Meng Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46826-46831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and they are referred to as RIR-2 and RIR-3 introns, respectively, to be consistent with the naming of the dnaN-1, -2, -3, and -4 introns and to allow easier identification of the host gene of each intron. These six introns of the dnaN and RIR genes are 75–85% identical in a ∼680-nt catalytic core region, which can be folded into a conserved six-domain structure typical of group II introns. The folded structures are not shown, because they are very similar to published structures of previously identified introns of this organism (17Dai L. Toor N. Olson R. Keeping A. Zimmerly S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Outside the folded catalytic core, the six introns differ greatly in size in the domain IV loop region (Fig. 2), where a maturase-coding open reading frame is usually located. Among the six introns, only the RIR-3 intron has a complete maturase-coding sequence in domain IV of its folded structure. None of the others has a maturase-coding open reading frame, although various amounts of apparent remnants of maturase-coding sequences could be recognized. Exon-binding sequences (EBS1 and EBS2) and intron-binding sequences (IBS1 and IBS2) could also be predicted for each of the six introns (Fig. 2), which are known to facilitate RNA splicing by forming base-pairings between the intron and the exon (18Lambowitz A.M. Caprara M.G. Zimmerly S. Perlman P.S. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). As expected, EBS1 and EBS2 are in the loop sequence of Domain I, the corresponding IBS1 and IBS2 are in the 5′-exon immediately before the intron, with EBS1 and EBS2 base-pairing with IBS1 and IBS2, respectively. The EBS1 and EBS2 of the six introns are located at the same corresponding position of the different introns, but their sequences are not similar (Fig. 2). RNA Splicing Activity of the Intron—To determine whether the six similar introns of dnaN and RIR genes are capable of RNA splicing in E. coli, each intron coding sequence was inserted in a plasmid expression vector to construct an intron-containing recombinant gene (Fig. 3A). Various lengths of the native exon sequences were included with the introns, because this is usually required for efficient RNA splicing. After transcription of the recombinant gene and RNA splicing in E. coli, total RNAs were isolated and reverse-transcribed, and the resulting cDNAs were PCR-amplified, using specific oligonuleotide primers. This RT-PCR procedure produces DNA fragments corresponding to the precursor RNA and the spliced RNA, whose predicted sizes are listed in Fig. 3A. The predicted sizes of different precursors vary according to the different sizes of the introns. The predicted sizes of the spliced products also differ with different introns, because the sizes of the native exons that were included with the introns differ with different introns. The RT-PCR products corresponding to individual introns were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and shown in Fig. 3B. DNA bands corresponding to the precursor and spliced RNAs were identified initially by matching their observed sizes with the predicted sizes listed in Fig. 3A. DNA bands corresponding to the spliced RNAs were inserted into cloning plasmids and subjected to sequence determination (data not shown), which confirmed their identities as well as the predicted splice junctions. For the complete RIR-3 intron that encodes a maturase protein, only a band corresponding to the spliced RNA was observed (lane 2), indicating complete RNA splicing. To see whether the intron-encoded maturase is required for the RNA splicing, we deleted the maturase coding sequence except the first 15 codons. The resulting intron (RIR-3d) produced only the precursor band (lane 3), indicating that the maturase coding sequence was required for the splicing. We then expressed the maturase coding sequence as a freestanding gene on a separate plasmid in the same cell, and this restored the splicing activity to the RIR-3d intron (lane 4). This indicated that the maturase protein can act in trans, and the maturase coding sequence does not need to be a part of the intron. For the RIR-2 intron that does not encode a maturase protein, only a precursor band corresponding to the precursor RNA was observed (lane 5), indicating a lack of RNA splicing. However, efficient splicing of the RIR-2 intron was observed when the maturase protein from the RIR-3 intron was co-produced in the same cell from a freestanding gene on a separate plasmid (lane 6). This indicated that the maturase protein from the RIR-3 intron acted in trans on the maturase-less RIR-2 intron to assist its RNA splicing. Similarly, the four introns (dnaN-1, dnaN-2, dnaN-3, and dnaN-4) of the dnaN gene do not encode a maturase protein, and each produced only a precursor band corresponding to the precursor RNA (lanes 7, 9, 11, and 13), indicating a lack of RNA splicing. However, all showed efficient RNA splicing when the maturase coding sequence from the RIR-3 intron was co-expressed in the same cell as a freestanding gene on a separate plasmid (lanes 8, 10, 12, and 14). This indicated that the maturase protein from the RIR-3 intron acted in trans on each of these maturase-less introns to assist their RNA splicing. To confirm that the maturase protein, not its coding sequence, acted on the maturase-less introns, we disrupted the maturase protein synthesis by introducing a frameshift mutation (single nucleotide insertion) at nucleotide position 1178 of the 1770-bp maturase gene, and this abolished the RNA splicing activity of all the maturase-less introns (data not shown). In group II introns, the domain IV loop region is outside the catalytic core and generally not conserved. Among the six introns studied here, the domain IV loop region varies greatly in size (Fig. 2), but the terminal parts of this region show a high level of sequence conservation (Fig. 4A). To test whether the domain IV loop region is required for RNA splicing, we deleted from three introns (RIR-3, dnaN-3, and dnaN-4) the entire domain IV loop sequence except the five terminal nucleotides AATGG. The resulting deletion introns (RIR-3D2, dnaN-3D, and dnaN-4D) were tested for RNA splicing in comparison with the original introns (Fig. 4B). Unlike the original introns, none of the deletion introns showed RNA splicing whether in the presence or in the absence of the maturase from the RIR-3 intron, indicating that the domain IV loop region of these introns are required for the RNA splicing. We have demonstrated for the first time that an intron-encoded protein could function as a general maturase for the RNA splicing of multiple maturase-less introns of different genes. This suggests that the RIR-3 intron-encoded maturase can recognize certain common structural elements present in all the six introns. Previous studies of the bacterial Ll.LtrB intron and the yeast aI2 intron have identified intron-specific structural elements that are recognized by the intron-specific maturases encoded in these introns (8Matsuura M. Noah J.W. Lambowitz A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7259-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Huang H.R. Chao M.Y. Armstrong B. Wang Y. Lambowitz A.M. Perlman P.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8809-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). They included a high affinity binding site at the beginning of the own coding sequence of the maturase located in the domain IV loop region of the intron, which forms an idiosyncratic structure named DIVa, in addition to secondary binding sites in the intron catalytic core. The six introns of the dnaN and RIR genes share ∼80% sequence identity in the intron catalytic core (Fig. 2), which may provide common binding sites for the general maturase. They also show a high level of sequence conservation in a putative DIVa region corresponding to the beginning of the coding sequence of the maturase protein (Fig. 4A), although five of the six introns have none or only remnants of a maturase-coding sequence. This putative DIVa region constitutes nearly the entire domain IV loop region in the dnaN-4 intron or a part of the domain IV loop region in the other introns. The domain IV loop region was shown to be necessary for RNA splicing (Fig. 4B), which is consistent with a hypothesis that the putative DIVa region may function in maturase binding like in the well studied L1LtrB intron, and its conserved sequence may provide common binding sites for the general maturase to act on all the six introns. A general maturase assisting multiple introns of different genes may suggest a novel and intron-mediated mechanism of coordinating gene expressions, in which the production or function of the general maturase could control the functional expression (transcript maturation) of both the RIR gene and the dnaN gene. The two genes are functionally related in nucleotide synthesis and DNA replication, with the dnaN gene encoding the sliding DNA clamp of DNA polymerase III and the RIR gene encoding a ribonucleotide reductase. The dnaN and RIR genes are expected to be functional in vivo despite their multiple introns, because each gene predicts a protein highly conserved with homolog proteins of other bacteria, and because no additional copy of the gene was predicted from the genome sequence. The RNA splicing activities of the dnaN and RIR introns were studied in E. coli; therefore it is not certain that our findings will apply in the native organism. We have not been able to study the RNA splicing in the native organism T. erythraeum, due to extreme difficulties of culturing this organism in the laboratory. It is also not known whether the general maturase acts on additional group II introns of other genes in this organism; therefore the above hypothesis of intron-mediated gene regulation remains to be proven. The finding of a general maturase for multiple group II introns may also have implications on the evolution of nuclear spliceosomal introns. It is thought that group II introns have given rise to spliceosomal introns (2Cavalier-Smith T. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A likely early step may be the emergence of a general maturase that assisted the RNA splicing of multiple introns, which would eventually lead to the evolution of a general splicing enzyme like the spliceosome. A general maturase might emerge more easily from a preexisting intron-specific maturase by recognizing conserved structures of the group II introns and not needing idiosyncratic structures of specific introns. The presence of multiple similar introns in the same organism, like the six similar introns in T. erythraeum, may facilitate this evolution process. Once the maturase from one intron can assist the RNA splicing of other introns, the maturase coding sequences of the other introns can be lost through mutation. The resulting maturase-less introns become dependent on the maturase-containing intron for their RNA splicing and therefore host gene function. This dependence shall prevent a loss of the maturase-containing intron, except when the maturase coding sequence becomes a freestanding gene. Freestanding maturase-like genes have been found in plants and thought to have derived from group II introns (20Mohr G. Lambowitz A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although their biochemical function remains to be determined. A freestanding maturase gene has not been found in T. erythraeum."

Infections by the γ-herpesviruses have been implicated in the development of lymphoproliferative diseases and in some cases, tumorigenesis (1Dourmishev L.A. Dourmishev A.L. Palmeri D. Schwartz R.A. Lukac D.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 175-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 2Verma S.C. Robertson E.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 222: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One of the characteristic biological features of the γ-herpesviruses is their ability to establish a life-long latent infection in lymphocytes, during which only a few viral genes are expressed. One hypothesis is that these viral genes play a major role in the establishment and maintenance of viral latency. Understanding the molecular mechanisms whereby latency-associated proteins alter the regulation of the cellular pathways of the infected host cell, as well as evade immune surveillance will provide essential information for devising therapeutic strategies against these viruses. γ-Herpesviruses employ similar strategies to subvert the infected host cell, encoding for viral proteins, which often interfere with cellular processes in the host cell, in particular targeting the transcriptional machinery and signaling pathways. In EBV, the EBNA-1, EBNA-2, EBN-3A, -B, -C, and EBNA-LP latency-associated proteins are involved in the altered transcriptional regulation of the host's genes (3Zimber-Strobl U. Strobl L.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Pokrovskaja K. Mattsson K. Kashuba E. Klein G. Szekely L. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas the LMP-1 and LMP-2A proteins are involved in the altered regulation of endogenous cellular signaling pathways. In the case of LMP-1, it functions as a constitutively active CD40 receptor. This viral protein binds and activates TRAF-2 and -3 proteins leading to NF-κB activation and consequently cell proliferation (5Klein E. Teramoto N. Gogolak P. Nagy N. Bjorkholm M. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6Young L.S. Dawson C.W. Eliopoulos A.G. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 53: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that LMP-2A associates with the cellular tyrosine kinases Fyn, Lyn, and Syk, modulating their interactions with the B-cell receptor (7Fruehling S. Swart R. Dolwick K.M. Kremmer E. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7796-7806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Longnecker R. Merchant M. Brown M.E. Fruehling S. Bickford J.O. Ikeda M. Harty R.N. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), thereby acting in the same manner as a constitutively active B-cell receptor. In B-cell receptor-negative B-cells, LMP-2A activates signals that are usually generated by the B-cell receptor to inhibit apoptosis of infected cells (9Caldwell R.G. Wilson J.B. Anderson S.J. Longnecker R. Immunity. 1998; 9: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). LMP-2A has been shown to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (also called PKB) signaling cascade, which has a major role in cell proliferation and survival (10Scholle F. Bendt K.M. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10681-10689Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 11Swart R. Ruf I.K. Sample J. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10838-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). During latency, HHV-8 expresses viral proteins, such as the D-type cyclin homologue (v-cyclin) (12Godden-Kent D. Talbot S.J. Boshoff C. Chang Y. Moore P. Weiss R.A. Mittnacht S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4193-4198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Li M. Lee H. Yoon D.W. Albrecht J.C. Fleckenstein B. Neipel F. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1984-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the transcription regulators LANA-1 and LANA-2 (vIRF-3) (14Rivas C. Thlick A.E. Parravicini C. Moore P.S. Chang Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 15Esteban M. Garcia M.A. Domingo-Gil E. Arroyo J. Nombela C. Rivas C. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), kaposin A (16Muralidhar S. Veytsmann G. Chandran B. Ablashi D. Doniger J. Rosenthal L.J. J. Clin. Virol. 2000; 16: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and vFLIP (17Field N. Low W. Daniels M. Howell S. Daviet L. Boshoff C. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) to manipulate cellular signaling pathways. Another HHV-8 latent protein, LAMP, has been shown to inhibit B-cell receptor-dependent signal transduction and to associate with the cellular proteins TRAF-1, -2, and -3, suggesting that it might also mimic the function of the CD40 receptor (18Choi J.K. Lee B.S. Shim S.N. Li M. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Sharp T.V. Wang H.W. Koumi A. Hollyman D. Endo Y. Ye H. Du M.Q. Boshoff C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 802-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).It is evident that the biological functions of some of these γ-herpesviruses latent proteins are to promote lymphocyte proliferation and survival to preserve and propagate the viral genomes during latent infection. Mammalian cell proliferation requires successful transition through cell cycle phases (G1, S, G2, and M) (20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2699-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). The expression of D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) is predominantly regulated by extracellular mitogenic (or inhibitory) signals and are rate-limiting for transition through G1. Once cells have reached late G1, the E-type cyclins (E1 and E2) accumulate and allow S phase initiation, followed by induction of cyclin A in S phase. The D-type cyclins preferentially associated with and activate CDK-4 and -6, whereas cyclin E/A with CDK2. The primary physiological substrate for the CDKs is the retinoblastoma (pRb) family of pocket proteins (pRb, p107, and p130). When hypophosphorylated, the pocket proteins bind to and inactivate the E2F family of transcription factors that are required for the transcription of genes that are necessary for entry into S-phase. The activities of the CDKs are negatively regulated by two families of CDK inhibitors, namely the Cip/Kip family (comprising p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) and the INK4 family. The Cip/Kip family inhibits a broad range of cyclin-CDK complexes, whereas the INK4 family members specifically inhibit cyclin D-CDK4/6 (21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). The HHV-8 v-cyclin D has been shown to be refractory to the inhibitory effects of the Cip/Kip family of CKIs, and has been shown to increase the rates of proliferation of the infected cells, thereby propagating the viral genome (22Child E.S. Mann D.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3311-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Another mechanism whereby the viral genome is propagated during latency is via inhibition of apoptosis.The Bcl-2 family of proteins is central to regulating the commitment of cells to apoptosis (programmed cell death) (23Harada H. Grant S. Rev. Clin. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 7: 117-138PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lutz R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family of proteins contains both anti- and pro-apoptotic members and can be divided into three distinct classes: the anti-apoptotic sub-group (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL); the pro-apoptotic, multi-Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain sub-group (e.g. Bak and Bax); and the pro-apoptotic, BH3 domain-only sub-group (e.g. Bad, Bik, Bid, Bim, PUMA, and Bmf). The pro-apoptotic BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, Bim, plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis in lymphocytes during negative selection. Bim, like other BH3-only Bcl-2 proteins, mediates apoptosis through inducing mitochondrial cytochrome c release, which in turn activates caspase-9, caspase-3, and eventually the downstream cell death machinery (23Harada H. Grant S. Rev. Clin. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 7: 117-138PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Bim is believed to promote apoptosis by neutralizing pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins in a mechanism that requires members of the multi-BH-domain pro-apoptotic subgroup.The murine γ-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) is closely related to the human HHV-8 and EBV. Because γ-herpesviruses often share similar mechanisms to manipulate the host cellular signaling cascades, MHV-68 is often used as a rodent model of γ-herpesviral infection. M2 is a unique latency-associated protein of MHV-68. It has no known cellular or viral homologues and does not contain any previously defined conserved domains. This protein is expressed during both the establishment and long term maintenance of latency, indicating that it is likely to play a key role in viral persistence (26Flano E. Kim I.J. Moore J. Woodland D.L. Blackman M.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3828-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Flano E. Kim I.J. Woodland D.L. Blackman M.A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To study the functional role of this viral protein we sought to identify cellular targets of M2. Yeast-two-hybrid screening of a cDNA library derived from MHV-68 latently infected B lymphocytes demonstrated M2 interaction with both the Vav1 and Vav2 guanine nucleotide exchange factors. In immature B-cell line WEHI-231, the interaction between M2 and Vav promotes cell proliferation and survival.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of a Splenic B Cell cDNA Library from Latently Infected BALB/c MiceSplenic B220+ cells from three MHV-68 latently infected mice were purified at 15, 18, and 21 days post infection by the μMACS Streptavidin kit (Miltenyl Biotec, Surrey, UK). The percentage of B220+ cells over total cell number determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was of 95%. mRNA was extracted by the mRNA Fast Track 2.0 mRNA isolation system (Invitrogen), and the cDNA was synthesized by the TimeSaver cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). cDNAs were ligated to the oligonucleotide adaptors 5′-pCCG GTG CTT CCG G-3′ and 5′-pCGA GGC CAC GAA GGC C-3′, which allowed the insertion into the XhoI site of λACT2 vector (Clontech, Basingstoke, UK).

To determine its function and cellular targets, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using M2 as bait. Full-length M2 protein was fused in-frame with the DNA binding domain of the GAL4 (GAL4-BD) yeast transcription factor and used as a bait to screen a cDNA library derived from MHV-68 latently infected mouse splenic B-lymphocytes fused with the activation domain of GAL4 (GAL4-AD) (TABLE ONE). A total of 8.7 × 107 transformants was analyzed in two independent rounds of screening. Of the seven positive clones selected for sequence analysis, four were found to contain the C-terminal region of Vav1 (amino acids 532–845), encoding for a fragment of the zinc finger (ZF) region and the entire SH3-SH2-SH3 domains, following comparison with the nucleotide data base at the National Library of Medicine using the BLAST algorithm (TABLE ONE). The other three clones did not match any of the published cDNAs, and their identities remained undefined. The Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors is composed of three highly homologous proteins, namely Vav1, -2, and -3 (31Turner M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 512: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Additional interaction experiments using the yeast two-hybrid system showed that M2 is also able to bind to the C-terminal region of Vav2 (amino acids 536–868) encoding for the SH3-SH2-SH3 domains but not to Vav3.TABLE ONEScreening of an MHV-68 latently infected B-cell cDNA library with the latency-associated M2 protein Yeast cells (Y190) sequentially transformed with M2 in-frame with Gal4BD in pGBT9 (pGBT9-M2) and a spleen B-cell cDNA library in pACT2 (pACT2-cDNA/B220+) were selected on –Trp, –Leu, –His medium containing 50 mm 3-AT.

These loosely defined motifs have been proposed to have a role in binding to signaling molecules through their SH3 domains (32Alexandropoulos K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3110-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Given that the C terminus region of Vav proteins contain two SH3 domains, it is possible these moieties are mediating the M2 binding. To determine if these PXXP motifs were important for binding to Vav, we constructed several M2 deletion mutants lacking specific PXXP motifs. These mutants were cloned in-frame with the binding domain of GAL4 and used in a yeast two-hybrid experiment to study for their interactions with Vav1 and Vav2 SH3-SH2-SH3 regions. These results showed that amino acids 160–179 of M2 are essential for Vav1 and Vav2 SH3-SH2-SH3 binding (Fig. 1). This region of M2 contains three PXXP motifs, at amino acid residues 162–165, 167–170, and 174–176. To further investigate the importance of these motifs in Vav binding, we generated two M2 mutants in which the proline residues at positions 167 and 170 (M2ΔP1 mutant) and 165, 167, 170, and 174 (M2ΔP2 mutant) were replaced by alanine residues. As shown in Fig. 1, the M2ΔP1 and M2ΔP2 mutations partially or totally abrogated the binding of M2 to Vav1 and Vav2, respectively. These results demonstrated that the three PXXP motifs located at the C terminus of M2 are essential for binding to the SH3-SH2-SH3 region of both Vav1 and Vav2 proteins.M2 Interacts with Vav1 and Vav2 Proteins in Vivo—We next studied the in vivo interaction between M2 and Vav proteins in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, A and B). To this end, 293T cells were transiently transfected with Vav mammalian expression vectors either alone or in combination with M2, M2ΔP1, or M2ΔP2. 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-M2 serum or with the pre-immune serum. The immunoprecipitates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Vav antibodies. As shown in"
https://openalex.org/W2052519363,"Aedes aegypti chorion peroxidase (CPO) plays a crucial role in chorion hardening by catalyzing chorion protein cross-linking through dityrosine formation. The enzyme is extremely resistant to denaturing conditions, which seem intimately related to its post-translational modifications, including disulfide bond formation and glycosylation. In this report, we have provided data that describe a new type of glycosylation in CPO, where a mannose is linked to the N-1 atom of the indole ring of Trp residue. Through liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry and de novo sequencing of CPO tryptic peptides, we determined that three of the seven available Trp residues in mature CPO are partially (40-50%) or completely mannosylated. This conclusion is based on the following properties of the electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry spectra and the enzymatic reaction of these peptides: 1) the presence of a 162-Da substituent in each Trp residue; 2) the presence of abundant fragments of m/z 163 ([Hex + H]) and [M + H - 162] (typical for N-glycosides); 3) the absence of a loss of 120 Da (this loss is typical for aromatic C-glycosides); and 4) the cleavage of the glycosidic linkage by PNGase A or F (typical for N-glycans). These results establish that a C-N bond is formed between the anomeric carbon of a mannose residue and the N-1 atom of the indole ring of Trp. This is the first report that provides definitive evidence for N-mannosylation of Trp residues in a protein. In addition, our data demonstrate that PNGase can hydrolyze Trp N-linked mannose in peptides, which is unusual because no typical beta-amide bond is present in the Trp-mannosyl moiety. Results of this study should stimulate research toward a comprehensive understanding of physiology and biochemistry of Trp N-mannosylation in proteins and the overall biochemical mechanisms of PNGase-catalyzed reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2101384385,"M13 major coat protein, a 50-amino-acid-long protein, was incorporated into DOPC/DOPG (80/20 molar ratio) unilamellar vesicles. Over 60% of all amino acid residues was replaced with cysteine residues, and the single cysteine mutants were labeled with the fluorescent label I-AEDANS. The coat protein has a single tryptophan residue that is used as a donor in fluorescence (or Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, using AEDANS-labeled cysteines as acceptors. Based on FRET-derived constraints, a straight α-helix is proposed as the membrane-bound conformation of the coat protein. Different models were tested to represent the molecular conformations of the donor and acceptor moieties. The best model was used to make a quantitative comparison of the FRET data to the structures of M13 coat protein and related coat proteins in the Protein Data Bank. This shows that the membrane-bound conformation of the coat protein is similar to the structure of the coat protein in the bacteriophage that was obtained from x-ray diffraction. Coat protein embedded in stacked, oriented bilayers and in micelles turns out to be strongly affected by the environmental stress of these membrane-mimicking environments. Our findings emphasize the need to study membrane proteins in a suitable environment, such as in fully hydrated unilamellar vesicles. Although larger proteins than M13 major coat protein may be able to handle environmental stress in a different way, any membrane protein with water exposed parts in the C or N termini and hydrophilic loop regions should be treated with care."
https://openalex.org/W2134590925,"Graft arteriopathy (GA), characterized by diffuse concentric narrowing of coronary arteries, is the major cause of late graft failure in cardiac transplantation. alphavbeta3 Integrin is up-regulated in proliferating vascular cells and may constitute an appropriate target for imaging GA. We used a human/mouse chimeric model of GA, in which segments of human coronary artery were transplanted to severe combined immunodeficiency mice, followed by reconstitution with allogeneic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This led to vascular remodeling characterized by neointima formation over a period of 4 wk. alphavbeta3 expression in the graft was minimal in animals without PBMC, considerably increased by 2 wk, and decreased toward baseline by 4 wk after PBMC reconstitution. Cell proliferation was maximal at 2 wk, correlating with peak alphavbeta3 expression. RP748, an 111In-labeled alphavbeta3 (active conformation)-targeted radiotracer was injected into groups of 5 recipients at 0, 2, and 4 wk after PBMC reconstitution. Relative uptakes, defined as autoradiographic intensity in the graft/native aortas closely tracked the proliferative process. Specificity of uptake was demonstrated using excess nonlabeled tracer. In conclusion, alphavbeta3 integrin is transiently up-regulated (and activated) in GA and may be targeted by RP748 for detection of the proliferative process in early GA."
https://openalex.org/W1995796899,"Macromolecular translocation inhibitor II (MTI-II), which was first identified as an in vitro inhibitor of binding between the highly purified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and isolated nuclei, is an 11.5-kDa Zn2+-binding protein that is also known as ZnBP or parathymosin. MTI-II is a small nuclear acidic protein that is highly conserved in rats, cows, and humans and widely distributed in mammalian tissues, yet its physiological function is unknown. To elucidate its in vivo function in relation to GR, we transiently transfected mammalian cells with an expression plasmid encoding MTI-II. Unexpectedly, we found that the expression of MTI-II enhances the transcriptional activity of GR. The magnitude of the transcriptional enhancement induced by MTI-II is comparable with that induced by the steroid receptor coactivator SRC-1. In contrast, MTI-II had little effect on the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that in the presence of glucocorticoid hormone, GR coprecipitates with MTI-II, and, vice versa, MTI-II coprecipitates with GR. The expression of various deletion mutants of MTI-II revealed that the central acidic domain is essential for the enhancement of GR-dependent transcription. Microscopic analysis of MTI-II fused to green fluorescent protein and GR fused to red fluorescent protein in living HeLa cells showed that MTI-II colocalizes with GR in discrete subnuclear domains in a hormone-dependent manner. Coexpression of MTI-II with the coactivator SRC-1 or p300 further enhances GR-dependent transcription. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that in the presence of glucocorticoid hormone, p300 and CREB-binding protein are coprecipitated with MTI-II. Furthermore, the knockdown of endogenous MTI-II by RNAi reduces the transcriptional activity of GR in cells. Moreover, expression of MTI-II enhances the glucocorticoid-dependent transcription of the endogenous glucocorticoid-inducible enzyme in cells. Taken together, these results indicate that MTI-II enhances GR-dependent transcription via a direct interaction with GR in vivo. Thus, MTI-II is a new member of the GR-coactivator complex.

Upon hormone binding, GR dissociates from the chaperone proteins and translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus (1Bamberger C.M. Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr.

In the nucleus, the ligand-bound GR binds to specific DNA sequences termed glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), where it recruits a coactivator complex containing the p160 steroid receptor coactivator (SRC), acetyltransferases (CBP, p300, and p/CAF), and methyltransferases (CARM1 and PRMT1) (3McKenna N.J.

In association with this coactivator complex, GR directly activates gene transcription. Previously, using an in vitro assay of binding between highly purified activated GR and isolated nuclei, we identified at least three macromolecular translocation inhibitors (MTI-I, MTI-II, and MTI-III) from the cytosol of rat hepatocytes (6Okamoto K. Isohashi F. Horiuchi M. Sakamoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 1655-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and other cells (7Isohashi F. Horiuchi M. Okamoto K. Sakamoto Y. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 20: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We purified the most potent of these in vitro inhibitors (MTI-II) to apparent homogeneity and determined the N-terminal amino acid sequences of four enzyme-digested fragments, which showed that MTI-II is identical to the 11.5-kDa Zn2+-binding protein ZnBP (also known as parathymosin) (8Okamoto K. Isohashi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). MTI-II is a small and very acidic protein consisting of 101 amino acid residues, of which 11 are aspartic acid and 36 are glutamic acid residues, yielding a pI value of about 4.0. This protein has been found to be highly conserved in rats, cows, and humans (9Clinton M. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Panneerselvam C. Horecker B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

MTI-II and PTα were thought to be the native proteins or the putative precursor peptides of thymosin α1, the immunomodulatory polypeptide (or “thymic hormone”) that influences lymphocyte maturation. Although the N-terminal region of MTI-II consists of 28 amino acids that are homologous to thymosin α1 (corresponding to 46% identity), the proposed role of this protein as the precursor of thymosin α1 has been brought into question, because MTI-II was found to have no coding sequence for signal peptides, as would be expected for a secretory protein, but instead was found to have an active bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in its C-terminal region (15Trompeter H.I.

Thus, this protein is actively translocated into the nuclei of Xenopus oocytes (16Watts J.D. Cary P.D. Sautiere P. Crane-Robinson C. Eur. J.

Frangou-Lazaridis M. van der Kraan I. Tsolas O. van Driel R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MTI-II has been reported to bind to the linker histone H1 in vitro (19Kondili K. Tsolas O. Papamarcaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that MTI-II affects the binding of histone H1 to the nucleosome and is likely to be involved in remodeling of the chromatin structure (20Martic G. Karetsou1 Z.

Therefore, this protein is now thought to be a ubiquitous nuclear acidic protein that affects histone H1 function, rather than being the precursor of the thymosin α1 secreted peptide. Independently, MTI-II was isolated as ZnBP, a Zn2+-dependent reversible inactivator of phosphofructokinase-1 from rat liver cytosol (21Brand I.A. Söling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5892-5900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thereafter was found to be identical to parathymosin (22Trompeter H.I. Brand I.A. Söling H.-D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the presence of Zn2+in vitro, MTI-II/ZnBP has been reported to bind directly to both phosphofructokinase-1 and a large variety of cytosolic proteins, including several glycolytic enzymes (23Brand I.A. Heinickel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20984-20989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that MTI-II has functions not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm. Brand et al. (13Brand I.A. Heinickel A. Söling H.-D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar) showed that MTI-II is actively translocated into the nuclei of undifferentiated cells, whereas it stays in the cytoplasm of differentiated and nonproliferated cells of rat tissues. Further detailed studies have suggested that the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of the protein is regulated by cell density and is related to the differentiation state of the cell (15Trompeter H.I.

Thus, in the context of its high conservation and wide distribution, this interesting protein is expected to play essential and important role(s) in cell differentiation, although its the specific functions and precise molecular mechanisms remain unknown. By contrast, the nuclear functions of PTα are known in more detail (reviewed in Ref. 25Piñeiro A. Cordero O.J. Nogueira M. Peptides. 2000; 21: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PTα consists of 111 amino acid residues, of which 18 are aspartic acid and 35 are glutamic acid residues (26Haritos A.A. Goodall G.J. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The N-terminal region of PTα consists of 28 amino acids that are identical to thymosin α, the C-terminal regions contains two NLSs, and the protein is promptly translocated into nuclei (16Watts J.D.

PTα is also widely distributed in mammalian tissues, with highest concentrations in the spleen and thymus and lowest concentrations in the liver and kidney (12Clinton M. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Panneerselvam C. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PTα is involved in chromatin remodeling (29Gómez-Márquez J. Rodríguez P. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of PTα accelerates the proliferation and retards the differentiation of the HL-60 cell (30Rodríguez P.

Thus, PTα plays an important role in cell proliferation. Furthermore, PTα binds to histones (both core histones and histone H1) and shows a nucleosome assembly activity in vitro (34Papamarcaki T.

Acta. 1996; 1296: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PTα also modulates the interaction of histone H1 with chromatin (36Karetsou Z. Sandaltzopoulos R. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Lai C.Y. Tsolas O. Becker P.B. Papamarcaki T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3111-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that PTα interacts with CBP and enhances the transcriptional potential of CBP (37Karetsou Z. Kretsovali A. Murphy C. Tsolas O. Papamarcaki T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, PTα interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C and p300, and cooperatively regulates the acetylation (38Cotter M.A. Robertson E.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5722-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 39Subramanian C. Hasan S. Rowe M. Hottiger M. Orre R. Robertson E.S. J.

Virol. 2003; 77: 4261-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) of histones. Moreover, PTα selectively enhances the transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor (ER) but not the transcriptional activity of other nuclear receptors (41Martini P.G.V. Delage-Mourroux R. Kraichely D.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6224-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These recent results indicate that PTα might function as a coactivator of cellular and viral transcription. In previous in vitro experiments (8Okamoto K. Isohashi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we found that highly purified GR binds to an MTI-II affinity matrix. In the context of the findings on PTα, we speculated that MTI-II might be involved in regulating the transcriptional activity of GR in vivo. In this study, we therefore transiently transfected an expression plasmid encoding MTI-II into mammalian cells and examined the in vivo effects of MTI-II expression on GR-dependent transcription. We report that overexpression of MTI-II enhances GR-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Vice versa, the RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous MTI-II reduces GR-dependent transcription. Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that MTI-II interacts with GR in a glucocorticoid hormone-dependent manner. The expression of MTI-II fused to green fluorescence protein (GFP) and GR fused to red fluorescence protein (RFP) in living HeLa cells shows that MTI-II colocalizes with GR in discrete subnuclear domains. Taken together, our findings identify a new physiological role for MTI-II as a coactivator of GR-dependent transcription. Plasmids—The coding regions of the human MTI-II and SRC-1 cDNAs were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from HeLa cells. The coding region of the human ERα cDNA was amplified by PCR from human breast tumor cDNA library (Novagen). To construct the pTriEx-MTI plasmid expressing MTI-II with no His tag, we subcloned the amplified MTI-II cDNA into the NcoI-HindIII sites of the pTriEx-4 vector (Novagen). For pTriEx-SRC-1, we subcloned the SRC-1 cDNA into the SmaI-PstI sites of pTriEx-4. For pTriEx-ERα, we subcloned the ERα cDNA into the SmaI-SacI sites of pTriEx-4. For pTriEx-GR, we digested the recombinant transfer vector pVL1393-GR (42Hyodo M. Okamoto K. Shibata K. Suematsu N. Isohashi F. J. Chromatogr. B. 2001; 765: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) with BamHI and NotI, and subcloned the GR cDNA into the BglII-NotI sites of pTriEx-4. To construct a plasmid expressing MTI-II with an N-terminal His tag, pTriEx-MTI (+H), we subcloned the amplified MTI-II cDNA into the PstI-HindIII sites of the pTriEx-4 vector. The three plasmids expressing deletion mutants of MTI-II (the thymosin homolog domain plus one NLS motif, the acidic domain plus the whole C-terminal NLS domain and the C-terminal NLS domain) were constructed by digesting pTriEx-MTI with Cac81I/BamHI, PstI/Cac81I, and PstI/EcoO109I, respectively. For the plasmids expressing GFP-fused MTI-II and RFP-fused GR, we subcloned the MTI-II cDNA and the GR cDNA into the EcoRV-NotI sites of pQBI25-fC1 (Qbiogene) and the HindIII-SalI sites of pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech), respectively. The p300 expression plasmid (pCMVβ-p300) was obtained commercially (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in the presence of penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. For the GRE-luciferase assay, in order to reduce the level of the glucocorticoid hormone in the cells, we changed the medium to DMEM plus 10% FCS treated with dextran-charcoal (Hyclone) at 18 h after the cell plating. At 24 h after the medium change, the cells were transfected with 2.0 μg of GRE-firefly luciferase (Clontech) plus 40 ng of Renilla luciferase control reporter plasmid pRL-TK (Promega); 10 ng of pTriEx-GR; various amounts of pTriEx-MTI, pTriEx-SRC-1, or pCMVβ-p300; and control vector to a total of 5.0 μg of DNA/well, by using a cationic lipid reagent (TransFast; Promega). At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 120 nm triamcinolone acetonide (TA) or control vehicle. The cells were harvested 24 h after hormone treatment, and the luciferase activities in the cell extracts were detected by using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). For the estrogen response element-luciferase assay, in order to reduce the level of the estrogen hormone in the cells, we changed the medium to DMEM (without phenol red) plus 10% FCS treated with dextran-charcoal at 18 h after the cell plating. At 24 h after the medium change, the cells were transfected with 2.0 μg of estrogen response element-firefly luciferase (Clontech), plus 40 ng of Renilla luciferase control reporter plasmid pRL-TK, 20 ng of pTriEx-ERα, various amounts of pTriEx-MTI or pTriEx-SRC-1, and control vector to a total of 5.0 μg of DNA/well. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 12 nm 17β-estradiol or control vehicle. The cells were harvested 24 h after hormone treatment. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HeLa cells were grown in DMEM plus 10% FCS in the presence of penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm diameter plate. After 18 h, the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FCS treated with dextran-charcoal. At 24 h after the medium change, the cells were transfected with 7.25 μg of pTriEx-MTI (+H) per 100-mm plate by using a cationic lipid reagent (Tfx-20; Promega). At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 120 nm TA or control vehicle. The cells were harvested 24 h after hormone treatment. Whole cell extracts were prepared from about 2 × 107 cells (four 100-mm plates), which were lysed in 270 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 135 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For cells treated with control vehicle, 20 mm Na2MoO4 was added to the lysis buffer in order to stabilize the ligand-free unactivated GR (i.e. heteromeric GR associated with Hsp90). The extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and preincubated with 20 μl of Protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4°C in a rotator. The preincubated lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were incubated with antibody (50 μg)-conjugated Protein G-agarose beads (10 μl) overnight at 4 °C in a rotator. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then resuspended in 40 μl of SDS gel loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na2EDTA, and 10% glycerol). After boiling for 10 min, the samples were applied to a 4-20% acrylamide gradient gel (for the analysis of GR, SRC-1, p300, and CBP) or a 15% acrylamide gel (for the analysis of MTI-II). The proteins were electroblotted from the gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected with ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). We used the following antibodies: anti-GR polyclonal antibody (43Okamoto K. Liu G. Yu W.G. Ochiai T. Isohashi F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and anti-SRC-1 polyclonal antibody (M-341) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), both for immunoprecipitation only; anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen) and antibodies against p300 (N-15) and CBP (A-22) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for immunoprecipitation and detection; and anti-GRα (P-20) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-SRC-1 monoclonal antibody (MS-1130) (NeoMarkers) for immunodetection. Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/35-mm coverslip bottom dishes (Becton Dickinson). After 18 h, the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FCS treated with dextran-charcoal. At 24 h after the medium change, the cells were cotransfected with the pQBI-MTI-II and the pDsRed2-GR plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 120 nm TA or control vehicle for 6 h. Cells were viewed on a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 META laser-scanning confocal microscope. RNA Interference—For the RNAi analysis of MTI-II, we used a 27-nt hairpin siRNA expression vector system (Promega). We selected three sequences from the MTI-II mRNA corresponding to nucleotides 35-56 (1-hp), 72-98 (3-hp), and 99-125 (4-hp) on the basis of computer analysis by B-bridge and Promega. We synthesized cDNAs for the selected mRNAs, which each comprised two identical 27-nt sequence motifs arranged in an inverted orientation and separated by a 9-nt spacer (loop region) of nonhomologous sequence (AAGTTCTCT). Then, we used these as primers in PCR to amplify DNA containing the U6 promoter, the hairpin motif, and the U6 polymerase terminator. To construct a mock vector for negative control, we amplified DNA containing the U6 promoter, the 9-nt spacer sequence, and the U6 polymerase terminator. Each DNA was inserted into the EcoRV site of the psiLentGene vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The constructs were verified by sequencing. HeLa cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. After 18 h, we changed the medium to DMEM plus 10% FCS treated with dextran-charcoal (Hyclone). At 24 h after the medium change, the cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of the hairpin siRNA expression vector, 1.0 μg of GRE-firefly luciferase (Clontech), and 40 ng of Renilla luciferase control reporter plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) by using a cationic lipid reagent (Tfx-20; Promega). At 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 40 μl of the SDS gel loading buffer. After boiling for 20 min, the samples were applied to a 15% acrylamide gel (for the analysis of MTI-II and actin) or a 4-20% acrylamide gradient gel (for the analysis of GR). For the immunodetection of endogenous MTI-II in cells treated with hairpin siRNA, the proteins were electroblotted from the gel onto a charged nylon membrane (Immobilon-NY+; Millipore Corp.) and fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde. An anti-MTI-II polyclonal antibody was obtained from a rabbit immunized with a synthetic peptide representing amino acid residues 6-31 (VEAAAELSAKDLKEKKDKVEEKAGRK) of MTI-II. The antibody was affinity-purified on a resin conjugated with the peptide. Endogenous MTI-II was detected with ECL Advance Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For the immunodetection of actin and GR in cells treated with hairpin siRNA, the proteins were electroblotted from the gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and detected with an anti-actin monoclonal antibody (A4700; Sigma) and an anti-GR polyclonal antibody (43Okamoto K. Liu G. Yu W.G. Ochiai T. Isohashi F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For the GRE-driven luciferase assay in HeLa cells treated with hairpin siRNA, the cells were treated with 120 nm triamcinolone acetonide (TA) or control vehicle at 48 h after transfection. The cells were harvested 24 h after hormone treatment, and the luciferase activities in the cell extracts were detected by using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Glucocorticoid-regulated Enzyme (Tyrosine Aminotransferase) Assay—HeLa cells were plated at a density of 3.0 × 106 cells/100-mm diameter plate. After 18 h, the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FCS treated with dextran-charcoal. At 24 h after the medium change, the cells were transfected with 20 μg of pTriEx-MTI or mock vector (pTriEx-4) per 100-mm plate by using a cationic lipid reagent (Tfx-20). At 24 h afte"

FucT from strain UA948 can transfer fucose to the OH-3 of Type II acceptors as well as to the OH-4 of Type I acceptors on the GlcNAc moiety, so it has both α1,3 and α1,4 activities. In contrast, FucT from strain NCTC11639 has exclusive α1,3 activity. Our domain swapping study (Ma, B., Wang, G., Palcic, M. M., Hazes, B., and Taylor, D. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 21893–21900) demonstrated that exchange of the hypervariable loops, 347DNPFIFC353 in 11639FucT and 345CNDAHYSALH354 in UA948FucT, were sufficient to either confer or abolish α1,4 activity. Here we performed alanine scanning site-directed mutagenesis to identify which amino acids within 345CNDAHYSALH354 of UA948FucT confer Type I substrate specificity. The Tyr350 → Ala mutation dramatically reduced α1,4 activity without lowering α1,3 activity. None of the other alanine substitutions selectively eliminated α1,4 activity. To elucidate how Tyr350 determines α1,4 specificity, mutants Tyr350 → Phe, Tyr350 → Trp, and Tyr350 → Gly were constructed in UA948FucT. These mutations did not decrease α1,3 activity but reduced the α1,4 activity to 61.8%, 78.5%, and 4.7% of wild type level, respectively. Apparently the aromatic nature, but not the hydroxyl group of Tyr350, is essential for α1,4 activity. Our data demonstrate that a single amino acid (Tyr350) in the C-terminal hypervariable region of UA948FucT determines Type I acceptor specificity. Notably, a single aromatic residue (Trp) has also been implicated in controlling Type I acceptor preference for human FucT III, but it is located in an N-terminal hypervariable stem domain.

Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastritis and peptic ulcer formation and is a risk factor for the development of gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. One of the virulence factors of H. pylori is the lipopolysaccharide, which contains lipid A, core oligosaccharide and O-antigens. The O-antigens of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide contain fucosylated oligosaccharides, predominantly the Type II blood group antigens, Lewis X (Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAc) and Lewis Y (Fucα1,2Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAc) (1Wirth H.P. Yang M. Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a small number of H. pylori strains also express the Type I blood group antigens, Lewis A (Galβ1,3(Fucα1,4)GlcNAc), and Lewis B (Fucα1,2Galβ1,3(Fucα1,4)GlcNAc) (2Monteiro M.A. Chan K.H.

Bacterial α1,3/4 FucTs are functionally equivalent to the mammalian α1,3/4 FucTs, which have been well characterized. Mammalian FucTs are Type II membrane proteins with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, stem region, and C-terminal catalytic domain. H. pylori FucTs share weak homology with their mammalian counterparts in two small segments within the catalytic domain, called α1,3 FucT motifs (14Martin S.L. Edbrooke M.R.

Instead, they contain 2–10 heptad repeats that connect the N-terminal catalytic domain with two amphipathic helices at the C terminus (17Rasko D.A. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol.

FucT VI and bovine FucT possess exclusively α1,3 activity, whereas FucT III and V have both α1,3 and α1,4 activity.

In contrast, the α1,3 FucTs, including human FucT IV, VI, VII, and IX and bovine FucT have an Arg at the corresponding position. Similar to mammalian FucTs, H. pylori α1,3/4 FucTs also exhibit Type I and Type II acceptor specificity. Radiochemical assays showed that 11639FucT is an α1,3 FucT (13Ge Z. Chan N.W. Palcic M.M.

In an effort to identify the region that determines acceptor specificity, we constructed 12 chimeric FucTs by domain swapping between 11639FucT and UA948FucT in our previous study. In contrast to mammalian FucTs, our data demonstrated that exchange of a small hypervariable region near the C terminus, specifically 347DNPFIFC353 in 11639FucT and 345CNDAHYSALH354 in UA948FucT, was sufficient to either confer or abolish α1,4 activity (22Ma B.

Using plasmid DNA harboring the futA gene as DNA template, alanine substitutions were created by PCR following the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene.

Wang G. Palcic M.M. Hazes B. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21893-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Standard Fucosyltransferase Assay—FucT enzyme activities were assayed in reactions containing donor GDP-Fuc at 200 μm, GDP-[3H]Fuc (60,000 dpm), and Type II-R or Type I-R acceptors at concentrations of 1.8 or 7.5 mm, respectively. The reversed-phase C18 Sep-Pak cartridge was used to isolate the products (containing the hydrophobic aglycone and the acquired radiolabeled fucose moiety) from the unreacted GDP-[3H]Fuc as described previously (30Palcic M.M. Heerze L D. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconjugate J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). One milliunit represents the amount of enzyme that converts 1 nmol of acceptor substrate to product per min. The specific activity (milliunits mg-1) was obtained by dividing the enzyme activity (milliunits) by the amount of total protein that was determined by BCA protein assay kit. Specific enzyme activity below 0.01 milliunit mg-1 was considered undetectable. Immunoblot Analysis of WT and Mutant FucT Protein Expression—Cell extracts containing equal amounts of total protein (7.35 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (pore size, 0.22 μm). Nitrocellulose blots were probed with mouse anti-pentahistidine monoclonal primary antibody (1:1000) and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2000). Blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit, and the images were visualized on BioMax MR films. A standard curve plotting the band density versus the amount of protein loaded for immunoblot analysis was carried out in our previous study, and 7.35 μg of total protein was shown in the middle of the linear range of standard curve (22Ma B. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Hazes B. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21893-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The density of each FucT band was quantified using Alpha Ease FC software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA), and the expression level of WT UA948FucT was set to 1. Subsequently, the expression level of each FucT mutant was determined relative to that of UA948FucT and used to normalize the enzyme specific activity, by dividing the enzyme-specific activity (milliunits mg-1) by the relative FucT expression level. Capillary Electrophoresis Assay—To detect very low levels of α1,4 activity in FucT enzymes, capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used in our current study. The incubation mixtures contained 6.3 μl of the cell crude extract, 10 μm Type I-TMR, 200 μm GDP-Fuc in a total volume of 10 μl, including 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 35 mm MgCl2,1 mm ATP, 5 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm MnCl2. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, or 5 h. Samples were removed and diluted (1:25) with CE running buffer (10 mm phosphate, 10 mm borate, 10 mm SDS, and 10 mm phenylboronic acid, pH 9.0) to quench the reaction. Samples were subsequently electrokinetically injected onto the electrophoresis capillary (40-cm length and 9-μm internal diameter, Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) at 4 kV for 4 s. Products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis at 450 V cm-1 as described previously (13Ge Z. Chan N.W. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The area of the product and substrate peaks were integrated by Igor Pro software (Lake Oswego, OR) and compared with each other to give a quantitative analysis of each reaction. The percentage of Type I-TMR conversion to Lewis A-TMR in each reaction was standardized with the total protein concentration as well as the FucT expression level that was detected by Western blot. The total protein concentration and the FucT expression from WT UA948FucT was set as 1; the relative levels of total protein concentration and FucT expression of each mutant were determined relative to those of WT UA948FucT. The α-1,3/4-fucosidase treatment was performed by removing 4 μlof 5-h reaction mixtures and heating up at 90 °C for 10 min to de-activate residual FucT activity. The mixtures were then incubated with 20 microunits of α-1,3/4-fucosidase in a total volume of 40 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37 °C for 6 h. Products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The percentage of Lewis A-TMR present in each reaction was quantified and standardized with total protein concentration and FucT expression level as described above. Determination of Kinetic Parameters—Acceptor kinetics were performed using 0.03–2 mm Type II-R, or 0.4–25 mm Type I-R, with GDP-Fuc at 200 μm, including GDP-[3H]Fuc at 0.2 μm. 2 mm Type II-R was the highest concentration that can be reached in our study due to its low solubility. Due to the limited supply of the acceptors, donor kinetics were determined using 3–200 μm GDP-Fuc with Type II-R at 2 mm or Type I-R at 15 mm, including GDP-[3H]Fuc at 0.8 μm. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the initial rate data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear regression analysis with Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Substrate Specificity of UA948FucT Alanine Mutants—Alanine scanning site-directed mutagenesis was performed to identify which amino acids within 345CNDAHYSALH354 of UA948FucT are required for α1,4 activity. The α1,3 and α1,4 activities of all mutants with single amino acid substitutions were determined with Type II-R and Type I-R substrates at 1.8 mm and 7.5 mm, respectively (Fig. 1). Mutations with a significant effect on enzyme activity clustered in residues 350–353. Alanine substitutions of Ser351 and Leu353 drastically decreased both α1,3 and α1,4 activities, with the α1,4/α1,3 ratio reduced to 21.0% and 24.3% of that of WT, respectively. Notably, alanine substitution of the only aromatic residue in the loop sequence, Tyr350, had the most dramatic effect. It reduced α1,4 activity almost 30-fold without decreasing α1,3 activity (Fig. 1). The α1,4/α1,3 ratio of Tyr350 → Ala mutant was 2.2% of that of WT. This indicates that Tyr350 is specifically required for α1,4 activity in UA948FucT. Substrate Specificity of UA948FucT and 11639FucT Tyrosine and Phenylalanine Mutants—The Tyr350 → Ala mutation removes both the aromatic ring and the hydroxyl group of Tyr. To determine the contribution of each group to Type I acceptor specificity in UA948FucT, Tyr350 was mutated to Phe, Trp, and Gly. These mutations did not cause any decrease in α1,3 activity. However, the α1,4 activities were reduced to 61.8%, 78.5%, and 4.7% of the WT level, and their α1,4/α1,3 ratios were at 51.9%, 65.6%, and 2.5% of the WT level, respectively (Fig. 1). The data demonstrated that the aromatic ring structure present in Tyr, Phe, and Trp but absent in Ala and Gly is essential for α1,4 activity in UA948FucT, whereas the hydroxyl group in Tyr350 is optimal but not absolutely required. The hypervariable region 347DNPFIFC353 in 11639FucT contains two Phe residues, but it shares virtually no sequence homology with the hypervariable loop of UA948FucT. It is not clear which Phe, if any, could be aligned with Tyr350 in UA948FucT. Mutants 11639FucT Phe350 → Tyr and Phe352 → Tyr were constructed to determine if the addition of a hydroxyl group would improve α1,4 activity. In addition, to determine whether or not the presence of an extra bulky aromatic residue in the variable loop of 11639FucT (instead of a single aromatic amino acid in UA948FucT) is responsible for the poor α1,4 activity in 11639FucT, mutants 11639FucT Phe350 → Ala and Phe352 → Ala were also made. In comparison to WT 11639FucT, mutants Phe350 → Tyr, Phe352 → Tyr, and Phe350 → Ala possessed a similar level of α1,3 activity, whereas Phe352 → Ala displayed a reduced α1,3 activity at ∼25% of WT level. None of the mutants Phe350 → Tyr, Phe352 → Tyr, Phe350 → Ala, or Phe352 → Ala displayed any α1,4 activity in our standard radiochemical assay. However, when the cell lysates were concentrated 4–5 times and the Type I acceptor concentration in radiochemical assays was raised from 7.5 mm to 25 mm, trace amounts of α1,4 activity were detected from all four mutants as well as from WT 11639FucT at 0.01–0.16 milliunit mg-1. Again, mutant Phe352 → Ala displayed the lowest α1,4 activity compared with WT and the other three mutants. Although α1,4 activity was just above the background level, it was detectable yet too weak for accurate quantification. Capillary Electrophoresis Analysis—To measure the low level of α1,4 activity more precisely in WT 11639FucT and in its mutants Phe350 → Tyr, Phe352 → Tyr, Phe350 → Ala, and Phe352 → Ala, capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF) was utilized with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled Type I acceptor (Type I-TMR). CE-LIF is an ultra-sensitive analytical technique and can quantitate as few as 60 molecules of enzyme reaction product (32Zhang Y. Le X. Dovichi N.J. Compston C.A. Palcic M.M. Diedrich P.
