https://openalex.org/W2008620264,"Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems."
https://openalex.org/W2109363337,"Although cancer classification has improved over the past 30 years, there has been no general approach for identifying new cancer classes (class discovery) or for assigning tumors to known classes (class prediction). Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W1967994686,"The proper function of immune surveillance requires well-coordinated mechanisms in order to guide the patrolling immune cells through peripheral tissues and into secondary lymphoid organs. Analyzing gene-targeted mice, we identified the chemokine receptor CCR7 as an important organizer of the primary immune response. CCR7-deficient mice show severely delayed kinetics regarding the antibody response and lack contact sensitivity and delayed type hypersensitivity reactions. Due to the impaired migration of lymphocytes, these animals reveal profound morphological alterations in all secondary lymphoid organs. Upon activation, mature skin dendritic cells fail to migrate into the draining lymph nodes. Thus, in order to bring together lymphocytes and dendritic cells to form the characteristic microarchitecture of secondary lymphoid organs, CCR7 is required to rapidly initiate an adoptive immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2104159258,"Defensins contribute to host defense by disrupting the cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms. This report shows that human beta-defensins are also chemotactic for immature dendritic cells and memory T cells. Human beta-defensin was selectively chemotactic for cells stably transfected to express human CCR6, a chemokine receptor preferentially expressed by immature dendritic cells and memory T cells. The beta-defensin-induced chemotaxis was sensitive to pertussis toxin and inhibited by antibodies to CCR6. The binding of iodinated LARC, the chemokine ligand for CCR6, to CCR6-transfected cells was competitively displaced by beta-defensin. Thus, beta-defensins may promote adaptive immune responses by recruiting dendritic and T cells to the site of microbial invasion through interaction with CCR6."
https://openalex.org/W2016484384,"MT1-MMP is a membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMP) capable of mediating pericellular proteolysis of extracellular matrix components. MT1-MMP is therefore thought to be an important molecular tool for cellular remodeling of the surrounding matrix. To establish the biological role of this membrane proteinase we generated MT1-MMP-deficient mice by gene targeting. MT1-MMP deficiency causes craniofacial dysmorphism, arthritis, osteopenia, dwarfism, and fibrosis of soft tissues due to ablation of a collagenolytic activity that is essential for modeling of skeletal and extraskeletal connective tissues. Our findings demonstrate the pivotal function of MT1-MMP in connective tissue metabolism, and illustrate that modeling of the soft connective tissue matrix by resident cells is essential for the development and maintenance of the hard tissues of the skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2111121844,"In primates, prefrontal, inferior temporal, and posterior parietal cortex are important for cognitive function. It is shown that in adult macaques, new neurons are added to these three neocortical association areas, but not to a primary sensory area (striate cortex). The new neurons appeared to originate in the subventricular zone and to migrate through the white matter to the neocortex, where they extended axons. These new neurons, which are continually added in adulthood, may play a role in the functions of association neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2055613750,"In Drosophila, plexin A is a functional receptor for semaphorin-1a. Here we show that the human plexin gene family comprises at least nine members in four subfamilies. Plexin-B1 is a receptor for the transmembrane semaphorin Sema4D (CD100), and plexin-C1 is a receptor for the GPI-anchored semaphorin Sema7A (Sema-K1). Secreted (class 3) semaphorins do not bind directly to plexins, but rather plexins associate with neuropilins, coreceptors for these semaphorins. Plexins are widely expressed: in neurons, the expression of a truncated plexin-A1 protein blocks axon repulsion by Sema3A. The cytoplasmic domain of plexins associates with a tyrosine kinase activity. Plexins may also act as ligands mediating repulsion in epithelial cells in vitro. We conclude that plexins are receptors for multiple (and perhaps all) classes of semaphorins, either alone or in combination with neuropilins, and trigger a novel signal transduction pathway controlling cell repulsion."
https://openalex.org/W2001371234,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) binds to cells through interactions of viral glycoproteins gB and gC with heparan sulfate chains on cell surface proteoglycans. This binding is not sufficient for viral entry, which requires fusion between the viral envelope and cell membrane. Here, we show that heparan sulfate modified by a subset of the multiple D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase isoforms provides sites for the binding of a third viral glycoprotein, gD, and for initiation of HSV-1 entry. We conclude that susceptibility of cells to HSV-1 entry depends on (1) presence of heparan sulfate chains to which virus can bind and (2) 3-O-sulfation of specific glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate to generate gD-binding sites or the expression of other previously identified gD-binding receptors."

The phosphorylation targets them for rapid degradation through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, allowing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. We have examined the possibility that IKK can phosphorylate the p65 NF-κB subunit as well as IκB in the cytokine-induced NF-κB activation. In the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, the p65 subunit was rapidly phosphorylated in response to TNF-α in a time dependent manner similar to IκB phosphorylation.

Recent investigations have focused on the phosphorylation of IκBs and clearly elucidated the molecular mechanisms of the phosphorylation. In brief, two closely related kinases, designated IκB kinase (IKK) α and IKKβ, have been identified as components of the multiprotein IKK complex (500–900 kDa) that directly phosphorylates the critical Ser residues of IκBs (16DiDonato J.A.

IKKα and IKKβ together form a heterodimer through their COOH-terminal leucine zipper motifs, and the functional IKK complex contains both IKK subunits. NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, interacts with and activates the IKK complex (21Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V.

The activity of several inducible transcription factors, including cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (30Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and c-Jun (31Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation. It has been shown that the p65 NF-κB subunit is also phosphorylated during the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBs. However, the cytokine-inducible phosphorylating activity of p65 remains to be characterized. Here we show that IKKs are possible p65 kinases in the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, and the phosphorylation site is Ser-536 in the COOH-terminal transactivation domain. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α (R & D Systems) for the indicated time period. Where indicated, cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor,N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (Nacalai Tesque). After stimulating with TNF-α, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (23Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The nuclear translocation of p65 and the degradation of IκBα were determined by Western blotting with an anti-p65 antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an anti-IκBα antibody (C-21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, respectively. For metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate, HeLa cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subsequently incubated with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. After stimulating the cells with TNF-α for a given period, we immunoprecipitated p65 or HA-p65 with the anti-p65 antibody or anti-HA antibody as described previously. The precipitated proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The cDNA encoding full-length p65 was obtained from HeLa cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Several deletion cDNAs were inserted into pGEX-5X-3 bacterial expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-fused p65 proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Point mutations were made by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and all of the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for Xpress (XP) epitope-tagged IKKs, FLAG epitope-tagged TAK1, HA epitope-tagged TAB1, and HA epitope-tagged p65 using LipofectAMINE reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). For expression of IKKβ, NIK, and TAK1/TAB1 as 6 × His-tagged proteins in the Baculovirus system, Sf21 insect cells were infected with recombinant viruses generated by co-transfection with the BaculoGold DNA and transfer vectors (pAcHLT-NIK, pAcHLT-IKKβ, or pAcUW51-TAK1/TAB1) (PharMingen). The recombinant kinases were purified by nickel column chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TNF-α-stimulated whole cell lysates, cytoplasmic extracts, immunoprecipitated IKKs, or Baculovirus-expressed recombinant IKKβ were incubated with 1 μg of GST-fused p65 in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm disodium p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 3 μCi [γ-32P]ATP) at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphorylated GST-p65 was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Treatment of HeLa cells with TNF-α induced the degradation of IκBα and the subsequent nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB within 5 min after the treatment (Fig. 1 A). A phosphorylated form of IκBα was detected at 2–5 min, indicating an inducible kinase activity of the endogenous IKK complex (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, an in vivo 32P metabolic labeling immunoprecipitation analysis showed that p65 was also phosphorylated at the time of the IκBα phosphorylation (Fig.1 B). To establish whether the phosphorylation of p65 occurred in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, the cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor,N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN). The treatment with ALLN caused an accumulation of the phosphorylated form of IκBα, resulting in an impaired nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the phosphorylated p65 could be detected even in the presence of ALLN, indicating that the phosphorylation occurred in the cytoplasm prior to the nuclear translocation (Fig. 1 D). To characterize the p65 kinase activity in vitro, we generated NH2-terminal (from amino acid 1 to 305) and COOH-terminal (from amino acid 354 to 551) p65 proteins fused with GST. An inducible kinase activity was detected in whole cell lysates of TNF-α-stimulated HeLa cells when the COOH-terminal p65 was used as a substrate (Fig. 2 A). Zhonget al. (32Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar) reported that Ser-276 of p65 was phosphorylated by PKA; however, the TNF-α-induced p65 kinase did not phosphorylate GST-p65-(1–305) containing the Ser residue (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, the in vitro p65 phosphorylating activity was induced in a time-dependent manner similar to the phosphorylation of p65 in vivo (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the activity was extracted into the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the p65 phosphorylating activity was efficiently extracted from TNF-α-treated HeLa cells. We next determined the phosphorylation site in the COOH-terminal p65 using the TNF-α-treated cytoplasmic extracts as a kinase source. GST-p65-(354–521), a mutant lacking the 30 NH2-terminal amino acids (TA1 domain), failed to be phosphorylated by the activity (Fig. 3 A). Wang et al. (33Wang D. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) recently reported that TNF-α induced p65 phosphorylation at Ser-529 in this domain. In contrast, our in vitro kinase assays using Ser to Ala substitution mutants indicate that the phosphorylation site is Ser-536 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to Ser-529, the target Ser residue is conserved in human, mouse, chicken, and Xenopus p65 subunits (Fig.3 C), suggesting a role for the phosphorylation in the transactivation of NF-κB. We previously reported that the endogenous IKK kinase activity was induced by TNF-α in a time-dependent manner similar to the p65 phosphorylating activity (23Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the p65 kinase is a component of the IKK complex. The endogenous IKK complex was examined for kinase activity against GST-p65-(354–551) and GST-IκBα-(1–54) (Fig.4 A). Activity could be detected for GST-p65-(354–551), which was comparable with the IKK activity for GST-IκBα-(1–54). Moreover, the p65 phosphorylating activity was competed by an excess amount of GST-IκBα-(1–54), but not GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (Fig. 4 B). We further examined whether two IKK subunits can phosphorylate the p65 subunit by using an overexpression experiment (Fig. 4 C). HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for Xpress-epitope tagged IKKs (XP-IKKs) with or without expression vectors for FLAG-epitope tagged TAK1 (FLAG-TAK1) and the TAK1 activator, hemagglutinin-epitope-tagged TAB1 (HA-TAB1). An anti-XP immunocomplex kinase assay showed that TAK1-activated IKKs phosphorylated p65 (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that the p65 kinase is a component of the IKK complex. Some protein kinases, such as TAK1, NIK, IKKα, and IKKβ, have been shown to be components of the IKK complex. We generated recombinant TAK1, NIK, and IKKβ as 6 × His-tagged proteins by using the Baculovirus expression system and examined their abilities to phosphorylate GST-p65-(354–551) (Fig. 4 D). Only IKKβ could phosphorylate GST-p65, whereas TAK1 and NIK showed autophosphorylation activities. The site of phosphorylation by IKKβ was also Ser-536. These results indicate that the p65 phosphorylation may be mediated by IKKs in vitro. We next investigated whether p65 is a substrate for IKKs in vivo by co-transfection and metabolic labeling analyses. HA-p65 was transiently co-expressed in HeLa cells together with XP-IKKα, XP-IKKβ, and FLAG-NIK. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 A). The phosphorylation of HA-p65 was detected when XP-IKKs were activated by the co-expression with Flag-NIK. In addition, the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p65 occurred at Ser 536, as demonstrated by the reduced phosphorylation of HA-p65 (S536A). Taken together, these results indicate that the p65 NF-κB subunit is phosphorylated by IKKs in the cytokine-induced NF-κB activation pathway. NF-κB p65 has been shown to be phosphorylated along with phosphorylation of IκB. In contrast to the IκB phosphorylation, the p65 phosphorylation has not been well characterized. Here we show that TNF-induced phosphorylation of p65 is mediated by IKKs prior to the nuclear translocation. It is reasonable that p65 and IκB are phosphorylated by the same protein kinases, since they associate in the cytoplasm and are phosphorylated in a similar time-dependent fashion in response to TNF-α. Mercurioet al. (34Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that p65, but not other Rel family members c-Rel and p52, was phosphorylated by a recombinant constitutive active mutant of IKKβ in vitro with a specificity constant similar to that for IκBα, suggesting a physiological role of the phosphorylation. There are two IKK subunits, and they form a homodimer or heterodimer in the IKK complex; however, the physiological role of the dimerization is still unclear. It is possible that one component of the dimer phosphorylates IκB and the other phosphorylates p65. Recently, IKKα- and IKKβ-deficient mice have been developed (35Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T.

In contrast, IKK complex derived from IKK-β deficient mice, but not IKK-α, has impaired phosphorylation of IκBs in vitro, indicating that the IKKα homodimer might recognize p65, but not IκBs, as a substrate. Future analysis of the three-dimensional structure of IKKs·NF-κB·IκB complex will elucidate the spatial localization of these components and the role of dimerization of IKKs in the phosphorylation of the NF-κB·IκB complex. In addition, the development of an IKKα/IKKβ double knockout mouse will provide more information on the p65 phosphorylation. The transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of p65 has been characterized by using fusion protein with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor (41Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 42Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Altmann H. Czisch M. Holak T.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol.

The COOH-terminal 30 amino acids (TA1 domain) comprise the most important transactivation domain, which is predicted to be α-helix. In addition, there are seven Ser residues in the TA1 domain of human p65 and they locate on one face of the presumptive α-helix, suggesting transcriptional regulation by phosphorylation. In fact, Wang et al. (33Wang D. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) recently reported that p65 was phosphorylated at Ser-529 in the TA1 domain by an undefined protein kinase in response to TNF-α. Here we demonstrated the IKK-mediated phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536 in the TA1 domain. In addition, Zhong et al. (32Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar) reported that protein kinase A phosphorylated p65 at Ser-276 in the NH2-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD), which promoted an interaction of p65 with the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300. Furthermore, MAPK cascades that are sensitive to the MAPK kinase (MEK1, MEK2) inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 were shown to enhance the TNF-α-induced transactivation of the p65 subunit (44Vanden Berghe W.

Thus, these observations indicate that the NF-κB transactivation may be regulated by multiple phosphorylations in TAD and RHD. In summary, we demonstrated the IKK-mediated phosphorylation of p65 in the cytokine-induced NF-κB activation pathway. Previous studies on the characterization of p65 TAD employed the GAL4 system. However, this system does not reflect inducible phosphorylations in the cytoplasm, because the fusion proteins translocated into the nucleus in a stimulus-independent manner. Therefore, the development of a new transactivation assay system evaluating the IKK-mediated phosphorylation is necessary for future characterization of the physiological role of the phosphorylation.

We find that the two known semaphorin-binding proteins, plexin 1 (Plex 1) and neuropilin-1 (NP-1), form a stable complex. Plex 1 alone does not bind semaphorin-3A (Sema3A), but the NP-1/Plex 1 complex has a higher affinity for Sema3A than does NP-1 alone. While Sema3A binding to NP-1 does not alter nonneuronal cell morphology, Sema3A interaction with NP-1/Plex 1 complexes induces adherent cells to round up. Expression of a dominant-negative Plex 1 in sensory neurons blocks Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. Sema3A treatment leads to the redistribution of growth cone NP-1 and plexin into clusters. Thus, physiologic Sema3A receptors consist of NP-1/plexin complexes."

The peptide, termed rhesus theta defensin-1 (RTD-1), is microbicidal for bacteria and fungi at low micromolar concentrations. Antibacterial activity of the cyclic peptide was threefold greater than that of an open-chain analog, and the cyclic conformation was required for antimicrobial activity in the presence of 150 millimolar sodium chloride. Biosynthesis of RTD-1 involves the head-to-tail ligation of two alpha-defensin-related nonapeptides, requiring the formation of two new peptide bonds. Thus, host defense cells possess mechanisms for synthesis and granular packaging of macrocyclic antibiotic peptides that are components of the phagocyte antimicrobial armamentarium."

https://openalex.org/W2137808356,"During X inactivation, mammalian female cells make the selection of one active and one inactive X chromosome. X chromosome choice occurs randomly and results in Xist upregulation on the inactive X. We have hypothesized that the antisense gene, Tsix, controls Xist expression. Here, we create a targeted deletion of Tsix in female and male mouse cells. Despite a deficiency of Tsix RNA, X chromosome counting remains intact: female cells still inactivate one X, while male cells block X inactivation. However, heterozygous female cells show skewed Xist expression and primary nonrandom inactivation of the mutant X. The ability of the mutant X to block Xist accumulation is compromised. We conclude that Tsix regulates Xist in cis and determines X chromosome choice without affecting silencing. Therefore, counting, choice, and silencing are genetically separable. Contrasting effects in XX and XY cells argue that negative and positive factors are involved in choosing active and inactive Xs."

https://openalex.org/W2050345170,"The repair of DNA double-strand breaks is essential for cells to maintain their genomic integrity. Two major mechanisms are responsible for repairing these breaks in mammalian cells, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)1,2: the importance of the former in mammalian cells is well established3, whereas the role of the latter is just emerging. Homologous recombination is presumably promoted by an evolutionarily conserved group of genes termed the Rad52 epistasis group4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. An essential component of the HR pathway is the strand-exchange protein, known as RecA in bacteria8 or Rad51 in yeast6. Several mammalian genes have been implicated in repair by homologous recombination on the basis of their sequence homology to yeast Rad51 (ref. 11): one of these is human XRCC2 (refs 12, 13). Here we show that XRCC2 is essential for the efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination between sister chromatids. We find that hamster cells deficient in XRCC2 show more than a 100-fold decrease in HR induced by double-strand breaks compared with the parental cell line. This defect is corrected to almost wild-type levels by transient transfection with a plasmid expressing XRCC2. The repair defect in XRCC2 mutant cells appears to be restricted to recombinational repair because NHEJ is normal. We conclude that XRCC2 is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination."

Most of the lost receptors were not quickly replaced. Direct muscle stimulation or restoration of synaptic transmission inhibited this process. AChRs that were removed from nonfunctional synapses resided for hours in the perijunctional membrane before being locally internalized.

Here a Cα-based three-helix-bundle-like protein model with a realistic thermodynamic phase diagram is used to calculate several hundred folding trajectories. By varying a single parameter, the difference between the strength of native and non-native contacts, folding is changed from a diffusion–collision mechanism8 to one that involves simultaneous collapse and partial secondary-structure formation, followed by reorganization to the native structure. Non-obligatory intermediates are important in the former, whereas there is an obligatory on-pathway intermediate in the latter.

This regulatory activity mapped to a cluster of acidic residues in the NH(2)-terminal tail; mutating these residues proportionately inhibited R domain binding and CFTR channel function.

https://openalex.org/W2084766033,"A key step in the signaling mechanism of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-responsive kinase (ERK) cascade is its translocation into the nucleus where it regulates transcription and other nuclear processes. In an attempt to characterize the subcellular localization of ERK2, we fused it to the 3′-end of the gene expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), resulting in a GFP-ERK2 protein. The expression of this construct in CHO cells resulted in a nuclear localization of the GFP-ERK2 protein. However, coexpression of the GFP-ERK2 with its upstream activator, MEK1, resulted in a cytosolic retention of the GFP-ERK2, which was the result of its association with MEK1, and was reversed upon stimulation. We then examined the role of the C-terminal region of ERK2 in its subcellular localization. Substitution of residues 312–319 of GFP-ERK2 to alanine residues prevented the cytosolic retention of ERK2 as well as its association with MEK1, without affecting its activity. Most important for the cytosolic retention are three acidic amino acids at positions 316, 319, and 320 of ERK2. Substitution of residues 321–327 to alanines impaired the nuclear translocation of ERK2 upon mitogenic stimulation. Thus, we conclude that residues 312–320 of ERK2 are responsible for its cytosolic retention, and residues 321–327 play a role in the mechanism of ERK2 nuclear translocation.

The first MAPK cascade elucidated is the one that signals through the extracellular signal-responsive kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), which are activated via a sequential phosphorylation and activation of the protein kinases Raf1 and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK). Upon activation, ERK phosphorylates and activates several regulatory targets, which eventually culminate in regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and other cellular processes. Key steps in the signaling mechanism of the ERK cascade are the changes in localization of its components upon stimulation. In resting cells, all components of the cascade seem to be localized primarily in the cell cytosol. However, this localization is rapidly changed upon extracellular stimulation, which causes Raf1 recruitment to the plasma membrane (5Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

After translocation, MEK seems to be rapidly exported from the nucleus by its nuclear export signal (NES; Ref. 8Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), although the timing and role of its translocation are still controversial (9Fukuda M. Gotoh I.

ERK and RSK on the other hand are retained in the nucleus for longer times after stimulation, and this longer time is correlated with the effects of ERK on mitogenesis and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (11Traverse S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of nuclear translocation of the different kinases is not fully understood. Recently, it was shown that in resting cells ERK is retained in the cytosol by its association with MEK (10Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and upon stimulation ERK is detached from this cytosolic anchor to rapidly translocate into the nucleus. This translocation requires dimerization and phosphate incorporation into the regulatory Thr and Tyr residues of at least one of the ERKs in the dimer (13Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Here we further support the cytosolic retention of mammalian ERK2 by MEK1, which is reversed upon stimulation. We find that residues 312–320 of ERK2 play a crucial role in its MEK-induced cytosolic retention, and thus prevent nuclear localization of ERK in resting cells. We also provide evidence that residues 321–327 play a role in the nuclear translocation of ERK2. Thus, the 312–327 region of ERK2 plays an important role in securing the proper subcellular localization of ERK2 both before and after stimulation.

In an attempt to characterize the subcellular localization of ERK2, we fused the cDNA of rat ERK2 to the 3′-end of the gene expressing GFP, resulting in a GFP-ERK2 protein. This fused protein was transfected into CHO cells and was examined for its subcellular localization using fluorescence microscopy.

After stimulation with VOOH, a strong and non-selective activator of ERK, a large portion of GFP-ERK2 was translocated into the nucleus. Nuclear translocation was observed also with other stimuli (data not shown), although, a small portion (<15%) of GFP-ERK2 was observed in the cytosol under all conditions as described previously (15Reszka A.A.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), we modified several parts in this region (Fig. 1), which include (i) deletion of the C terminus of ERK2 (amino acids 338–358, ΔCOOH), (ii) substitution of amino acids 328–336 to alanines (328A), (iii) substitution of amino acids 321–327 to alanines (321A), (iv) substitution of amino acids 312–319 to alanines (312A), and (v) substitution of Asp-316, Asp-319, and Glu-320 to alanines (316A). As described for the GFP-ERK2, these constructs were fused to GFP and expressed in CHO cells, either with or without exogenous MEK1. The localization of ΔCOOH and GFP-328A appeared similar to that of GFP-ERK2 under all conditions and treatment used (data not shown). No changes as compared with GFP-ERK2 were detected also when the other three constructs 312A, 316A, and 321A, were expressed in CHO cells without additional MEK1 (Fig. 2). On the other hand, changes in localization were detected when these constructs were coexpressed with exogenous MEK1. Thus, unlike GFP-ERK2, GFP-312A was localized in the nucleus of resting cells, and this remained unchanged after VOOH stimulation. Nuclear localization was observed also with the GFP-316A protein, although the amount of this protein in the cytosol of resting cells was higher than that of the GFP-312A construct. GFP-321A had similar localization in resting cells as GFP-ERK2 when coexpressed with MEK1. However, stimulation with VOOH caused a uniform cellular distribution of this protein, indicating that this mutated protein might be compromised in its ability to translocate into the nucleus. To exclude the possibility that the altered localization is because of the GFP part of the constructs, we determined the localization of HA-ERK2 and HA-312A by staining with anti-HA antibody. Indeed, both constructs demonstrated similar distribution to that of their GFP counterparts (Fig. 2 B,left), indicating that the localization observed is indeed because of ERK2. Interestingly, when the amount of transfected GFP-ERK2 was significantly reduced, the weak staining observed was either cytosolic or spread all over the cell, even in the absence of exogenous MEK1 (Fig. 2 B, right). This cytosolic retention can be explained by an interaction of GFP-ERK2 with residual, unsaturated, cytosolic anchoring protein. Under these conditions, GFP-312A was still detected in the nucleus, indicating that the 312–319 region is responsible for this interaction. The subcellular localization of the various GFP-ERK mutants was further verified by isolating the nuclei of the GFP-ERK2 constructs-expressing CHO cells. As expected from the results in Fig. 2, Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibodies revealed that the amount of GFP-ERK2 in the nucleus was reduced when coexpressed with MEK1 and elevated again upon stimulation (Fig. 3). The amount of GFP-312A and GFP-316A proteins in the nucleus was not significantly changed when MEK1 was coexpressed, whereas the amount of GFP-321A protein was reduced by MEK1 and only slightly enhanced after VOOH-stimulation. Together, these results show that GFP-312A, and to a lesser extent also GFP-316A, lost their MEK1-induced, cytosolic-retention in resting cells. On the other hand, GFP-321A protein exhibited a compromised VOOH-induced nuclear-translocation. Hence, residues 312–327 play an important role in the subcellular localization of ERK2 both before and after external stimulation. To clarify whether these differences in subcellular localization are because of altered ERK2 activation, we examined the phosphorylation state and catalytic activity of the various constructs. Thus, CHO cells were transfected with GFP-ERK2, GFP-312A, GFP-316A, and GFP-321A, either with or without MEK1. The cells were then lysed and immunoblotted with either anti-general ERK or anti-diphospho ERK antibodies. Beside the endogenous ERKs, an additional band of 70 kDa was detected by the antibodies, which represents the GFP-ERKs. Similar levels of expression of the various mutated proteins were detected by the anti-general ERK antibodies (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, no significant differences in the amount of phosphates incorporated into the regulatory Thr and Tyr residues were detected between the various mutants under any of the conditions used, indicating that the four GFP proteins undergo proper upstream activation. We then examined whether the various mutations affected the catalytic activity of ERK2. To do so, the various GFP-conjugated ERKs were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody and assayed for their ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP). The activity of the mutants did not differ from that of GFP-ERK2, either with or without exogenous MEK1 (Fig.4 B). Therefore, these results indicate that residues 312–327 are not obligatory for either activation or catalytic activity of ERK2, and exclude the possibility that the altered localization of the modified proteins is because of compromised activation. Because the cytosolic localization of GFP-ERK2 seems to be MEK-dependent, we next asked whether this localization is because of an association between ERK and MEK and whether the mutations in the C terminus interfere with this ERK-MEK association. Lysates from CHO cells coexpressing MEK1 and the four GFP-ERK constructs were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies. As expected (10Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), immunoblotting with anti-MEK1 antibodies showed coprecipitation of MEK1 with GFP-ERK2, which was reversed upon VOOH stimulation (Fig.5). However, this coimmunoprecipitation was not stable and was easily disrupted, even under mild washing conditions (e.g. 0.15 m NaCl; data not shown). These results support the notion that, in resting cells, ERK and MEK are indirectly associated and dissociate upon stimulation to allow translocation of both MEK and ERK into the nucleus. On the other hand, no coprecipitation of MEK was detected in immunoprecipitates of GFP-312A either before or after stimulation. When GFP-316A was immunoprecipitated from resting cells, a small amount of MEK1 was coprecipitated, in agreement with the small amount of GFP-316A that remained in the cytosol in the fluorescence studies (Fig. 2). As with GFP-ERK2, VOOH reversed the coimmunoprecipitation of MEK by GFP-316A. GFP-321A pulled down MEK1 from resting cells and less from VOOH-stimulated cells, indicating that the association and dissociation of this mutant from MEK1 were not affected. As expected, both GFP-ERK2 and GFP-312A did not interact with a constitutively active MEK1 (Fig.5 B), indicating that the activation of these cells by active MEK was sufficient to prevent the ERK-MEK association. The mechanism by which ERKs are retained in the cytosol of resting cells and translocated into the nucleus is not fully understood. Based on our and others studies (10Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 16Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pages G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), it seems that ERK is kept out of the nucleus of resting cells by several anchoring proteins. One docking matrix is the microtubule cytoskeleton, which serves as a major docking matrix for up to 35% of the cellular ERK1 and ERK2 (15Reszka A.A. Seger R. Diltz C.D. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8881-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Other putative anchoring proteins for ERK in the cytosol are MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) and in particular MKP3 (17Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssigur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 18Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), but these interactions do not seem to be reversed by mitogenic stimulations. Unlike the activity-independent binding of ERK to microtubules and MKPs, our results indicate that the cytosolic retention of ERK2 by MEK1 is reversed by mitogenic stimulation, thus allowing the nuclear translocation of ERK. Similar results were previously obtained forXenopus ERK (10Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and we noticed the same also with ERK1 (data not shown). However, the amount of endogenous MEK1 seems to be significantly lower than that of ERKs in many cells (20Ferrell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 460-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and cannot account for the cytosolic retention of all ERKs. Moreover, ERK and MEK association is easily disrupted, and a small amount of ERK can be retained in the cytosol without exogenous MEK. It is therefore possible that additional proteins (e.g. the scaffold protein MP1 (21Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar)) play a role in the reversible ERK retention in the cytosol, thus forming big signaling complexes, which may include more than one ERK molecule. In this study we examined the role of the C-terminal region of ERK in determining its subcellular localization. We found that deletion of the C-terminal residues 338–358 or substitution of residues 328–336 to alanines did not affect the subcellular localization of ERK2. However, it was reported (13Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) that this combined C-terminal region (residues 328–358) contains a putative NES and dimerization-promoting leucine residues. A possible explanation for the lack of influence of the mutations is that each one of the mutations covers only part of the dimerization residues or the NES and the truncated parts are still active. In contrast to residues 328–358, mutations in residues 321–327 affected nuclear translocation, and residues 312–320 affected cytosolic retention of ERK. The most important residues for the cytosolic retention seem to be the three acidic residues Asp-316, Asp-319, and Glu-320. However, because the effect of GFP-316A was weaker than that obtained with GFP-312A, it is likely that additional residues between 312–318 contribute to the cytosolic retention. Interestingly, Asp-319, which is substituted to Gln in theDrosophila sevenmaker gain-of-function mutant, was found to be responsible also for the binding of ERK to MKPs (18Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, because MKPs are inducible proteins (19Camps M. Chabert C. Muda M. Boschert U. Gillieron C. Arkinstall S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and are not expressed in any significant amount in resting CHO cells (data not shown), this association is unlikely to account for the cytosolic retention of ERK in resting cells. Upon mitogenic stimulation, ERK (7Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as MEK (6Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Tolwinski N.S. Shapiro P.S. Goueli S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6168-6174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) are activated and translocate into the nucleus. According to our results, this process involves dissociation of these two kinases. It is likely that after dissociation from the anchoring protein, ERK passively diffuses to the nuclear membrane and then penetrates to the nucleus by an unknown mechanism. The molecular size of the endogenous ERK and MEK (<50 kDa) may allow free diffusion into the nucleus. However, it was suggested that ERK undergoes a phosphorylation-dependent dimerization, which allows its proper translocation (13Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and we show here that the 70-kDa GFP-ERK2 can rapidly translocate into the nucleus. Thus, it is likely that the molecular size of these proteins and the fast kinetic of translocation of the endogenous ERK requires an active mechanism, which might involve interactions with importins or exportins, to cross the nuclear membrane. In summary, we found that substitution of residues 312–319 of ERK2 with alanine residues does not change its activity, but prevents the cytosolic retention of ERK, as well as its association with MEK1. Substitution of residues 321–327 to alanines impairs the nuclear translocation of ERK2 upon mitogenic stimulation. We conclude that residues 312–327 of ERK2 play a role in its subcellular localization both before and after stimulation."

Neurexins contain LNS domains, folding units found in many proteins like the G domain of laminin A, agrin, and slit. The crystal structure of neurexin Ibeta, a single LNS domain, reveals two seven-stranded beta sheets forming a jelly roll fold with unexpected structural similarity to lectins. The LNS domains of neurexin and agrin undergo alternative splicing that modulates their affinity for protein ligands in a neuron-specific manner. These splice sites are localized within loops at one edge of the jelly roll, suggesting a distinct protein interaction surface in LNS domains that is regulated by alternative splicing."

The halocompounds are tolerated by A. ornata as they are degraded by dehaloperoxidase (DHP)2. We have determined the amino-acid sequence and crystal structure of DHP and find that its fold is typical of the globin family, indicating that the enzyme evolved from an oxygen carrier protein. Residues at the dimer interface do not correspond to those in tetrameric and dimeric haemoglobins and the spatial arrangement of the dimers is different.

https://openalex.org/W2022671828,"In yeast and somatic cells, mechanisms ensure cell-cycle events are initiated only when preceding events have been completed. In contrast, interruption of specific cell-cycle processes in early embryonic cells of many organisms does not affect the timing of subsequent events, indicating that cell-cycle events are triggered by a free-running cell-cycle oscillator. Here we present evidence for an independent cell-cycle oscillator in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed periodic activation of events normally restricted to the G1 phase of the cell cycle, in cells lacking mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activities that are essential for cell-cycle progression. As in embryonic cells, G1 events cycled on schedule, in the absence of S phase or mitosis, with a period similar to the cell-cycle time of wild-type cells. Oscillations of similar periodicity were observed in cells responding to mating pheromone in the absence of G1 cyclin (Cln)- and mitotic cyclin (Clb)-associated kinase activity, indicating that the oscillator may function independently of cyclin-dependent kinase dynamics. We also show that Clb-associated kinase activity is essential for ensuring dependencies by preventing the initiation of new G1 events when cell-cycle progression is delayed."

Here we report that the vesicle traffic regulatory (SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor)) protein, syntaxin 1A (S1A), inhibits ENaC mediated sodium entry. This inhibitory effect is selective for S1A and is not reproduced by syntaxin 3. The inhibition does not require the membrane anchoring domain of syntaxin 1A. It was reversed by the S1A-binding protein, Munc-18, but not by a Munc-18 mutant, which lacks syntaxin affinity. Immunostaining of epitope-tagged ENaC subunits showed that syntaxin 1A decreases ENaC current by reducing the number of ENaC channels in the plasma membrane; S1A does not interfere with ENaC protein expression. Immunoprecipitation of syntaxin 1A from the sodium-transporting epithelial cell line, A6, co-precipitates ENaC. These findings indicate that syntaxin 1A and other members of the SNARE machinery are involved in the control of plasma membrane ENaC content, and they suggest that SNARE proteins participate in the regulation of sodium absorption in relation to agonist mediated vesicle insertion-retrieval processes.

These channels can be identified operationally by their high affinity for the diuretic, amiloride, and by their high selectivity for sodium over potassium. Cloned ENaC channels, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, exhibit properties expected for the highly selective amiloride-sensitive channel. This expression system has been employed extensively for functional studies of ENaC genetic mutations (3Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D.

Acute hormonal regulation of sodium entry is provided by vasopressin, prostaglandins, and insulin (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Vasopressin and prostaglandin E increase sodium entry by promoting the delivery of new ENaC channels to the apical surface (6Kokko K.E. Matsumoto P.S. Zhang Z.R. Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C548-C557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical events that govern many membrane trafficking processes conform to a similar paradigm and involve interactions among proteins that comprise the SNARE fusion complex (8Bennett M.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). These interactions govern the insertion and retrieval of membrane vesicles that contain secretory products or integral membrane proteins, like ENaC, that will become constituents of the plasma membrane. Evidence of ENaC regulation by the SNARE machinery is provided by our finding that exogenous expression of syntaxin 1A selectively inhibits ENaC currents. Syntaxin expression decreases the plasma membrane content of ENaC, consistent with its role as a traffic regulatory protein. Biochemical studies suggest a physical interaction between ENaC and syntaxin 1A, which may reflect a direct role for the SNARE machinery in regulated Na entry. Oocyte isolations and RNA injections were performed as described previously (10Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M.E. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1887-C1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stage 5–6 oocytes were maintained in a modified Barth's solution overnight before injection (50 nl) with cRNA for ENaC α, β, and γ subunits with or without syntaxin 1A, 2, or 3. Noninjected oocytes served as controls. Expression proceeded at 18 °C for 1–3 days in a sodium-free ND-96 solution before current recordings or immunofluorescence measurements. Human ENaC cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Welsh (University of Iowa), syntaxin constructs by the laboratory of Dr. Richard Scheller (Stanford University), and Munc-18 constructs by Dr. Jonathan Pevsner (Johns Hopkins University). The ND-96 solution utilized for current measurements contained (mm): 96 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.2. In low sodium ND-96, N-methyl-d-glucamine Cl replaced NaCl. Recordings of ENaC-mediated sodium current (I Na) were performed by double electrode voltage clamp as described (10Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M.E. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1887-C1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state currents recorded at −100 mV are given in the figures; they reflect inward flow of Na through ENaC, as reflected by their amiloride sensitivity and augmentation when bath sodium was replaced by lithium. We used immunofluorescence techniques and confocal microscopy to monitor the expression of ENaC in the oocyte plasma membrane. Cells were injected with cRNA encoding ENaC subunits in which the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was introduced into the human ENaC α, β, and γ subunits at positions used previously to monitor cell surface expression of rat ENaC (11Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15373Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In our studies, the amiloride-sensitive currents of flag-hENaC were indistinguishable from wild-type: wt-ENaC = 1.5 ± 0.2 μA; FLAG-ENaC = 1.8 ± 0.4 μA; n = 6. FLAG-ENaC-expressing oocytes were subjected to a staining protocol to quantitate ENaC protein expression at the cell surface using the monoclonal M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.). Oocytes were cooled rapidly to 4 °C and incubated with M2 antibody overnight (1:1250 dilution). After washing with 5% fetal calf serum/ND-96, oocytes were incubated at 4 °C in fluorescein conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution) and then washed five times as above. This protocol avoids permeabilization or fixation conditions that might expose intracellular FLAG-ENaC to the M2 antibody. Thus, the staining conditions and epitope positions are selected to permit detection of FLAG-ENaC only when it is localized in the plasma membrane. In other surface expression studies, oocytes expressing FLAG-ENaC were fixed or fixed and permeabilized before M2 antibody labeling. Oocytes were cooled rapidly to 0–4° C and blocked for 15 min in 5% BSA-C (Aurion) in low sodium ND-96 (BSA-C/low sodium). They were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with Medium A (Caltag) and, if permeabilized, were bathed in Medium B for 15 min, then processed as described for nonfixed oocytes. The vegetal poles of individual, labeled oocytes were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics Multi-probe 2001 laser confocal microscope at 10× magnification using 10-μm optical sections. Control, noninjected oocytes were scanned to set the fluorescence background and to obtain laser intensity and voltage settings within the linear camera range. For metabolic labeling, oocytes were incubated overnight in 1.2 μCi/μl Tran35S-labelTM (ICN, 10 μl/oocyte), washed in sodium-free ND-96, and solubilized (25 mm MES, pH 6.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm n-octyl glucoside, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.02% deoxycholic acid (sodium salt), 1% digitonin, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.02% CHAPS, and 2 mm Empigen BB). Lysates were homogenized on ice, forced through an acrodisc filter, spun at 4 °C (13,800 ×g, 10 min), and 200 μl of M2 affinity gel (Kodak) added to supernatants. After overnight rotation at 4 °C, samples were spun as above for 1 min. Bead complexes were washed and then 70 μl of Laemmli buffer was added. Samples were boiled 3 min, then resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, which was subjected to fluorography and exposed to film. Xenopus Syntaxin 1A (Sigma HPC-1 monoclonal) or γ-ENaC were immunoprecipitated from A6 epithelia using procedures described previously (12Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E.

When using chicken antibodies, immobilized anti-chicken IgY (Promega, number G1191) was used in place of GammaBindR Sepharose beads. Western blots were performed as described previously (12Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E. Johnson J.P. J. Biol.

Reactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, ULTRA-ECL) followed by autoradiography. All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Fig.1 provides the results of ENaC current measurements in oocytes co-expressing the human α, β, and γ ENaC subunits together with syntaxin 1A or 3. ENaC current is markedly attenuated in oocytes co-expressing ENaC and syntaxin 1A, but not in oocytes that co-express ENaC and syntaxin 3. The absence of syntaxin 3 inhibition indicates specificity among syntaxin isoforms and that the inhibitory effect of S1A is not due to translational competition. Co-expression of a truncated syntaxin 1A (S1AΔC) inhibited ENaC currents to a level similar to that observed with the full-length syntaxin. This mutant lacks the C-terminal transmembrane domain and is expected to result in the expression of a soluble syntaxin 1A. The inhibition of ENaC currents by syntaxin 1A was reversed by co-expression of the syntaxin binding protein Munc-18 (13Pevsner J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This gain-of-function effect also cannot be attributed to translational competition among the cRNAs, since ENaC currents increased. Co-expression of a mutant Munc-18 which lacks high affinity for syntaxin was ineffective in reversing the S1A inhibition. After metabolic labeling, cell lysates from oocytes expressing flag-ENaC were precipitated using M2 antibodies and the precipitate subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We observed no difference in the amount of ENaC in cells co-expressing syntaxin 1A relative to control (Fig. 2). In parallel current measurements, ENaC inhibition with syntaxin 1A co-expression was similar to that shown in Fig. 1. The inhibitory effect of S1A could result from an effect on ENaC channel gating or from a decrease in the number of plasma membrane resident sodium channels. To examine this issue, we expressed epitope-tagged α, β, and γ ENaC subunits and monitored their cell surface expression using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. For the initial studies, FLAG-ENaC expressing oocytes were labeled with primary and secondary antibodies at 4 °C without cell permeabilization or fixation. Composite confocal images of intact, nonpermeabilized oocytes expressing FLAG-ENaC are shown (Fig. 3,B and C). The background fluorescence intensity of noninjected oocytes was low (Fig. 3 A), whereas surface fluorescence of FLAG-ENaC oocytes was readily detected (Fig.3 B). Co-expression with syntaxin 1A markedly reduced ENaC expression in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 C). As observed for ENaC currents (Fig. 1), syntaxin 3 co-expression had no effect on cell surface ENaC staining (data not shown). These findings suggest that syntaxin 1A reduces ENaC currents by decreasing the number of sodium channels in the plasma membrane. Similar experiments were carried out in oocytes subjected to fixation and/or permeabilization conditions prior to antibody labeling, the latter to detect intracellular ENaC. Figs.4, A and B,illustrate the effect of syntaxin 1A on ENaC cell surface expression in fixed oocytes. The results are similar to those obtained when ENaC was labeled at 4 °C without fixation (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the fixation conditions do not affect antibody labeling. Fig. 4,C and D, provide composite images of permeabilized cells expressing ENaC or ENaC plus S1A. The detection of ENaC after permeabilization in oocytes co-expressing S1A (Fig.4 D) indicates that syntaxin does not compromise ENaC protein expression. The average fluorescence intensity and sodium current data from all experiments of this type are provided in Fig. 4 E. The data indicate that syntaxin 1A inhibits ENaC current by reducing plasma membrane ENaC content. The effect of S1A is on ENaC location, not on the level of protein expression. To determine whether the effect of S1A on cell surface ENaC is associated with an inhibition of ENaC insertion into the plasma membrane or to its enhanced endocytic retrieval, we inhibited channel delivery to the plasma membrane using brefeldin A (BFA). The time-constant (τ) describing the single exponential decay of amiloride-sensitive sodium current following BFA addition was used as a measure of ENaC retrieval from the plasma membrane (5Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In oocytes expressing ENaC alone or ENaC plus S1A, τ was 44 or 45 min−1, respectively. Pre-BFA current was reduced 60% by S1A co-expression in these experiments. The failure of syntaxin to enhance ENaC retrieval suggests that S1A reduces ENaC current and channel density by interfering with its insertion into the plasma membrane. To determine whether ENaC-syntaxin interactions are present also in epithelial cells, we asked whether a syntaxin 1A homolog is expressed in A6 cells, a cell line with distal nephron properties. As shown in Fig.5 A, antibodies against rat syntaxin 1A immunoprecipitated a 35-kDa protein from A6 cell lysates, which were prepared from cells grown as transport-competent monolayers on permeable supports. To assess putative interactions of syntaxin with ENaC in A6 epithelia, the syntaxin IP was blotted with antibodies to the α, β, and γ Xenopus ENaC subunits (12Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4491-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Each antibody recognizes its respective full-length subunit on immunoblots subsequent to ENaC in vitro translation, and this interaction is abolished by excess immunizing peptide (12Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4491-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, there is no subunit cross reactivity among these antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the γ-xENaC antibody identifies a 97-kDa band in the syntaxin immunoprecipitate from A6 cells, which corresponds to the glycosylated form of γ-xENaC (12Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4491-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The α and β xENaC antibodies did not detect these subunits in the syntaxin IP. Fig.5 C shows that the γ-xENaC antibody produces a similar result. In A6 cell lysates, anti-γ antibody precipitates γ; under these experimental conditions, α and β are not detected significantly. The results of Fig. 5 are consistent with a physical association between syntaxin and the γ subunit. The results of these studies provide evidence of functional and physical interactions between syntaxin 1A and epithelial sodium channels. They suggest that a functional interaction between syntaxin and ENaC, perhaps modulated by Munc-18, is involved in the control of sodium entry rate at the apical membranes of sodium-absorbing epithelial cells. Syntaxin expression selectively decreased ENaC currents, and cell surface labeling studies indicate that this inhibition of current reflects a decrease in the number of sodium channels present in the plasma membrane. A syntaxin 1A homolog is detected in A6 epithelia, 2The HPC-1 antibody used in these studies immunoprecipitates rat syntaxin 1A, but not rat syntaxin 3, fromXenopus oocytes expressing these proteins; it does not immunoblot rat syntaxins 2, 3, or 4 in lysates from MDCK cells expressing these proteins (data not shown; MDCK cells provided by S. H. Low and T. Weimbs, Cleveland Clinic). a sodium-transporting cell line that is used widely for studies of regulated sodium absorption, and a physical interaction between S1A and ENaC was evident from their co-precipitation. In prior experiments (14Peters K.W. Qi J.-J. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C174-C180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the influence of syntaxin 1A on the functional activity of several other membrane proteins to determine whether S1A has a generalized effect on plasma membrane protein expression in this system. The functional expression of several other transport or receptor proteins was not affected by S1A, indicating that syntaxin is not simply disrupting the expression of integral membrane proteins. Physical and functional interactions of syntaxin 1A with ion channels have been observed in several other systems. Binding of syntaxin 1A to N-type calcium channels is thought to play an important role in the docking of presynaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter at sites of calcium entry (15Sheng Z.H. Retting J. Cook T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Calcium current measurements suggest that syntaxin co-expression inhibits calcium entry (16Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 17Wiser O. Bennett M. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Similarly, co-expression of syntaxin with CFTR inhibits cAMP-dependent chlorine currents in Xenopus oocytes and an interaction between these proteins is detected using in vitro protein binding assays (18Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W.W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 19Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In principle, syntaxin could alter ion channel currents by affecting channel open probability (gating) or channel number, but the above reports do not provide insight into this issue. The inhibition of plasma membrane ENaC content by syntaxin 1A (Figs. 3 and 4) implicates the SNARE machinery, and in particular S1A, in the control of plasma membrane sodium channel density. Results from the brefeldin A experiments are consistent with a primary effect of S1A on the rate of ENaC delivery to the plasma membrane. This effect of syntaxin expression has been observed previously for membrane trafficking processes. For example, exogenous expression of the Golgi t-SNARE syntaxin 5 inhibits protein traffic from ER to Golgi, a step in which this syntaxin isoform functions (20Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5866-5869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Expression of syntaxin 1A, but not 1B, blocks glucose stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells (21Nagamatsu S. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Watanabe T. Katahira H. Sawa H. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1160-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Likewise, expression of syntaxin 4 blocks insulin-stimulated GLUT-4 trafficking in adipocytes (22Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), a process mediated by syntaxin 4 and other SNARE proteins (23Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In MDCK cells, syntaxin 3 is apically localized, and its expression selectively inhibits apical targeting and recycling of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (27). Together, these findings indicate that exogenous expression of a specific syntaxin isoform disrupts the pathway in which that isoform normally plays a role in membrane trafficking events. This inhibition occurs presumably because overexpression of a single component of the fusion complex disrupts the stoichiometric interactions among SNARE proteins that are required for normal membrane trafficking (20Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5866-5869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Nagamatsu S. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Watanabe T. Katahira H. Sawa H. Akagawa K. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As for other syntaxin-sensitive ion channels, our findings raise questions about the molecular mechanism of these effects, and in particular, their relation to the physical interactions with syntaxin that are detected in protein binding assays. Immunoprecipitation of S1A from A6 cells co-precipitated γ-ENaC, but the IP did not contain detectable α or β subunit. This may result from dissociation of the ENaC subunits under the immunoprecipitation conditions employed, since precipitation performed using γ-ENaC antibody produced an identical result (Fig. 5 C). The forces that govern subunit associations have not been defined, and they may be of relatively low affinity. A selective association of S1A with γ-ENaC could lead to its sequestration and degradation as a means of reducing ENaC currents, but we did not detect a reduction in protein levels during syntaxin 1A co-expression (Figs. 2 and 4). In addition, our data cannot distinguish a direct interaction of S1A and γ-ENaC from the possibility that these proteins are part of a macromolecular complex where their interaction is conferred by other proteins. The actions of several sodium transport agonists are thought to involve the delivery of additional ENaC channels to the apical cell surface (above discussion). Shimkets et al. (25Shimkets R.A. Lifton R. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) identified similar sites in the C termini of the β and γ subunits that are phosphorylated in response to aldosterone, insulin, and protein kinases A and C, suggesting that these regulatory pathways may converge at a common control point. Thus, interactions of ENaC with SNARE proteins may be influenced by the state of ENaC regulation (e.g.phosphorylation), which would permit SNARE protein interactions with ENaC to govern the apical sodium channel density in response to agonists. Consistent with this view, phosphorylation of the syntaxin binding domain of the N-type Ca channel was found to markedly alter its affinity for syntaxin 1A (26Yokoyama C.T. Sheng Z.H. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6929-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further understanding of ENaC regulation by syntaxin will require identification and manipulation of the other SNARE constituents that lie at the apical membrane domain of sodium-transporting epithelia.

Neurochem. 1995; 62: 1716-1726Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells can be morphologically differentiated into neuronal cells, the phenotype of which varies depending on the inducing agent (1Påhlman S. Hoehner J.C. Nånberg E. Hedborg F. Fagerström S.

For example, retinoic acid (RA)1 drives SH-SY5Y cells to differentiate along a sympathetic chromaffin lineage, whereas 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induces differentiation along a sympathetic lineage (1Påhlman S. Hoehner J.C. Nånberg E. Hedborg F. Fagerström S. Gestblom C. Johansson I. Larsson U. Lavenius E. Örtoft E. Söderholm H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31A: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, little is known of the genes or patterns of gene expression that are essential for the process of neuronal differentiation. The ubiquitously expressed mammalian transcription factor NF-κB is one of a family comprising at least five members (NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel) that bind the consensus DNA motif 5′-GGGPuNNPyPyCC-3′ as homo- or heterodimers upon activation (3May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 4Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). NF-κB dimers are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by one of several protein inhibitors (e.g. I-κBα, I-κBβ, I-κBγ, or I-κBε) that mask the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB (3May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Receptor-generated signals lead to the phosphorylation and release of I-κB proteins, and the subsequent nuclear translocation and functional activation of NF-κB occurs as the result of the unmasking of its nuclear localization signal (3May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 4Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). NF-κB not only participates in the induction of the expression of many genes, including those encoding proteins that fulfill important roles in the processes of immunity and inflammation (5Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar), but also contributes to the regulation of apoptosis (6Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lipton S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Studies on B cells from p50/NF-κB knockout mice and on B cells and thymocytes transformed with I-κBαM, a strong dominant-negative inhibitor of the activation of different NF-κB/Rel complexes that bind I-κB proteins, have indicated that NF-κB is required for or participates in immune cell differentiation and development (8Siebenlist U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: R7-R13PubMed Google Scholar, 9Snapper C.M. Zelazowski P. Rosas F.R. Kehry M.R. Tian M. Baltimore D. Sha W.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB/Rel proteins may have unique roles in the central nervous system, contributing to synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity as well as neuronal development and differentiation (10O'Neill L.A.L. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). During neurogenesis, NF-κB becomes activated in neurons in certain regions of the brain, showing marked changes in both constitutive and inducible activity postnatally (10O'Neill L.A.L. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Several in vitro models have suggested that these profound changes in vivo may reflect an involvement of NF-κB in neuronal differentiation (10O'Neill L.A.L. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 11Kurata S. Wakabayashi T. Ito Y. Miwa N. Ueno R. Marunouchi T. Kurata N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3710-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but this notion is far from being established. Here we show that, in a neuroblastoma cell line, NF-κB is activated prior to neuronal differentiation induced by two different agents and that both its activation and the differentiation into neurons are blocked by a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-κB. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. LipofectAMINE was used for transfections according to the Life Technologies, Inc. manual, and stably transfected clones were selected and maintained with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). All-trans-retinoic acid and TPA were from Sigma. For differentiation, 1 × 105 cell/ml were grown in 10-cm cell+ plates (Sarsted, Inc.) for 24 h, and then RA (10 μm) or TPA (16 nm) was added (1Påhlman S. Hoehner J.C. Nånberg E. Hedborg F.

For cytoplasmic proteins, the cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and antipain) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged, and supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic proteins. For isolating nuclear proteins, cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain. After centrifugation at 600 × g, the pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml of protease inhibitors and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as nuclear proteins (14Feng Z. Mati A. Jehn B. Altermatt H.J. Chicaiza G. Jaggi R. J.

Typically, 5 μl of nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were added to the reaction buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (14Feng Z.

The control probe (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing an Oct-1-binding site (5′-AAT TGC ATG CCT GCA GGT CGA CTC TAG AGG ATC CAT GCA AAT GGA TCC CCG GGT ACC GAG CTC-3′) was labeled with 105 cpm (3000 Ci/mmol) [α-32P]dATP. In the antibody supershift experiment, 1 μg of antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against the p65 subunit of NF-κB was added together with nuclear proteins, and the reactions were incubated for another 20 min at 24 °C. Samples were electrophoresed in 5% polyacrylamide gels in Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.5, for 3 h at 4 °C. The gels were dried and autoradiographed with intensifying screens at −88 °C. 30 μg of cytoplasmic proteins were electrophoresed in 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was carried out with antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After washing, the membrane was probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antiserum to rabbit or mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). It is known that the DNA binding activity of NF-κB is activated by a variety of differentiation-inducing agents in some cells at early stages of neuronal differentiation (2Körner M. Tarantino N.

To clarify the roles of NF-κB members in neuronal differentiation, we generated stable transformed SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells expressing I-κBαM, which is a derivative of I-κBα, a binding partner and protein inhibitor of NF-κB (3May M.J.

I-κBαM is an effective dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-κB/Rel complexes, because two key phosphorylation sites in I-κBαM are mutated, thus preventing its phosphorylation, release from NF-κB, and degradation (8Siebenlist U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: R7-R13PubMed Google Scholar, 13Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells expressing I-κBαM (or transformed with a vector control plasmid) were induced to differentiate with either RA or TPA (1Påhlman S. Hoehner J.C. Nånberg E. Hedborg F. Fagerström S.

Pleskoff O. Lee L.M. Debré P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 62: 1716-1726Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the synthesis of I-κBαM and endogenous I-κBα was followed over 24 h. In the vector control cells, I-κBα protein levels showed a small but insignificant decrease around 1–2 h after treatment with RA or TPA, followed by a marked increase from 8 to 24 h (Fig.1 A, upper panels). In one of several I-κBαM-expressing SH-SY5Y clones, similar amounts of endogenous I-κBα and the faster migrating I-κBαM protein were initially synthesized, but only I-κBαM steadily accumulated in the 24 h following RA or TPA treatments (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). The accumulation of I-κBαM is not surprising, as it is a mutant form of I-κBα that is resistant to degradation (13Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). In the presence of I-κBαM, the enhanced expression of endogenous I-κBα was blocked, and the endogenous I-κBα levels declined dramatically at ∼8–24 h after addition of the differentiation inducers (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). This finding indicates that NF-κB function is inhibited by I-κBαM, because NF-κB normally up-regulates I-κBα at the level of transcription (15Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Previously, NF-κB activation was found to be associated with neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, but the relationship of NF-κB activation to differentiation was not further investigated (2Körner M. Tarantino N. Pleskoff O. Lee L.M. Debré P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 62: 1716-1726Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNA band-shift analyses were performed using an oligonucleotide containing a NF-κB consensus sequence to confirm and extend these findings and to determine whether I-κBαM prevented the activation of NF-κB that occurs in cells treated with different inducers of differentiation (2Körner M. Tarantino N. Pleskoff O. Lee L.M. Debré P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 62: 1716-1726Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At 1–2 h after the addition of RA or TPA, the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was clearly activated in the vector-transfected SH-SY5Y cells but not in the cells transformed with I-κBαM (Fig. 2). NF-κB activation was transient in the vector control cells (Fig. 2), and no further NF-κB complexes were formed at any times between 8 and 24 h after addition of the differentiation agents in either the vector-transformed or the I-κBαM-expressing cells. Under these conditions (Fig. 2), the DNA complex contains the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-κB (2Körner M. Tarantino N. Pleskoff O. Lee L.M. Debré P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 62: 1716-1726Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The transient NF-κB activation at 1–2 h following the addition of RA or TPA to the vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2) was accompanied by a significant reduction in the level of the NF-κB-inhibitory protein I-κBβ (3May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) that began at 1 h and returned to unstimulated levels by 8 h after RA or TPA addition (Fig. 1 B, upper panels). In contrast, I-κBβ protein levels remained constant for 8 h after RA or TPA addition in cells transformed with I-κBαM in which NF-κB activation is abolished (Fig. 1 B, lower panels). Altogether, these results show that I-κBαM is effective at inhibiting NF-κB activation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which may proceed through the degradation of I-κBβ rather than I-κBα. Complete degradation of I-κBβ was not observed, perhaps because of the transient nature of NF-κB activation and the fact that destruction of I-κB proteins is not the only mechanism capable of activating NF-κB (16Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells rapidly undergo neuronal differentiation, the phenotype of which depends on the inducing agent (1Påhlman S. Hoehner J.C. Nånberg E. Hedborg F. Fagerström S. Gestblom C. Johansson I. Larsson U. Lavenius E. Örtoft E. Söderholm H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31A: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Four days after RA or TPA treatment, extensive neuronal differentiation was observed in the SH-SY5Y cell cultures transformed with the empty vector, as judged by the shrinkage of the cell body and the extension of neurites, which made cell-to-cell connections (Fig.3, left panels). As expected (1Påhlman S. Hoehner J.C. Nånberg E. Hedborg F. Fagerström S. Gestblom C. Johansson I. Larsson U. Lavenius E. Örtoft E. Söderholm H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31A: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the neurites in TPA-treated cells were on average much shorter than neurites in RA-treated cells (Fig. 3, left panels). These morphological signs of differentiation were first evident 2 days after RA or TPA treatment. In contrast few, if any, I-κBαM-expressing transformants differentiated into neurons under the same conditions, even at 4 days after the treatments (Fig. 3,right panels). Identical results were obtained with several independent I-κBαM-transformed SH-SY5Y cell lines. Thus, blocking NF-κB activation prevents neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. Bcl-2 levels are progressively elevated during neuronal differentiation of some neuroblastoma cells (including SH-SY5Y) induced by RA (17Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar), TPA (18Hanada M. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Cazals-Hatem D. Spengler B.A. Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Reed J.C.

Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hanada M. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Cazals-Hatem D. Spengler B.A. Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Reed J.C.

Biol. 1997; 7: 798-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis confirmed that Bcl-2 protein levels increased during the neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells induced by RA or TPA (Fig.4). This increase was first evident 1–2 days after the addition of RA or TPA (Fig. 4), which is just prior to or corresponding to the appearance of the morphological signs of differentiation. In contrast, the marked increase in Bcl-2 failed to occur at any time during the 4-day period following RA or TPA treatment of SH-SY5Y cells transformed with I-κBαM cDNA (Fig. 4). Therefore, the absence of Bcl-2 up-regulation correlates with the failure of the cells to differentiate and provides biochemical evidence that neuronal differentiation is blocked in I-κBαM-expressing SH-SY5Y cells. Various proteins are known to be activated or synthesized and several genes are up-regulated in neuronal differentiation (1Påhlman S. Hoehner J.C. Nånberg E. Hedborg F. Fagerström S. Gestblom C.

Bcl-2 and NF-κB are two genes that have been directly implicated in neuronal development and differentiation (8Siebenlist U. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1997; 7: 798-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that Bcl-2 is strongly up-regulated in parallel with neuronal differentiation (17Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hanada M. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Cazals-Hatem D. Spengler B.A. Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Reed J.C.

Moreover, Bcl-2 appears to be required for neuronal differentiation of Paju, a neural crest-derived cell (21Zhang K-Z. Westberg J.A. Hölttä E. Andersson L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4504-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and a Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide suppressed nerve growth factor-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (19Katoh S. Mitsui Y. Kitani K. Suzuki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 also influences the axonal growth of embryonic sensory neurons (22Hilton M. Middleton G. Davies A.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 798-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that the characteristic RA- or TPA-induced Bcl-2 up-regulation fails to occur when NF-κB activation and neuronal differentiation are abrogated in I-κBαM-expressing SH-SY5Y cells, further illustrating the close relationship between Bcl-2 and differentiation. Diverse stimuli activate NF-κB in the brain and in neuronal cells, leading to the expression of genes associated with immune-related functions, growth regulation, inflammation, and cell adhesion (10O'Neill L.A.L. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB/Rel proteins has been observed during neuronal differentiation in the brain (10O'Neill L.A.L. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells (12Sheppard A.M. McQuillan J.J. Iademarco M.F. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3710-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and in SH-SY5Y, GOTO, and IMR32 neuroblastoma cells (2Körner M. Tarantino N. Pleskoff O. Lee L.M. Debré P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 62: 1716-1726Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Kurata S. Wakabayashi T. Ito Y. Miwa N. Ueno R. Marunouchi T. Kurata N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but the timing, requirement, and role of NF-κB in neuronal differentiation have not been established until now. Here we showed that NF-κB is activated in SH-SY5Y cells prior to neuronal differentiation induced by two different agents, and that when this activation is blocked, neuronal differentiation is completely prevented by both morphological and biochemical criteria (i.e. absence of Bcl-2 up-regulation). Thus, NF-κB/Rel proteins are required for neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The fact that a transient, and not sustained, NF-κB activation is observed well before the morphological signs of differentiation appear suggests that NF-κB activation is an early event required for neuronal differentiation. An earlier study utilizing DNA band-shift analysis suggesting that NF-κB activation accompanies TPA-, but not RA-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells is puzzling (2Körner M. Tarantino N. Pleskoff O. Lee L.M. Debré P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 62: 1716-1726Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as we found that both RA and TPA activate NF-κB by DNA band-shift analysis. Moreover, our finding that I-κBαM completely prevents neurite outgrowth, shrinkage of the cell body, and Bcl-2 up-regulation is by itself an indication that one or more NF-κB/Rel proteins are activated and contribute to RA- and TPA-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. Our conclusion that NF-κB/Rel proteins are required for neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells induced by two different types of stimuli is also in accord with recent evidence that this family of transcription factors is involved in or essential for the development or differentiation of hemopoietic cells, including CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and T and B cells (8Siebenlist U.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar). With both differentiation inducers, the onset of NF-κB activation in vector-transformed cells coincided with a reduction in the amount of the NF-κB-inhibitory protein I-κBβ, whereas I-κBα levels were essentially unchanged in these cells. Protein levels of two other NF-κB-inhibitory proteins (I-κBγ and I-κBε) also did not change during RA- or TPA-induced NF-κB activation and neuronal differentiation. 2Z. Feng and A. G. Porter, unpublished observations. These findings suggest that the destruction of I-κBβ might be a trigger for NF-κB activation, which is unusual and interesting because almost all known NF-κB inducers cause the degradation of I-κBα, not I-κBβ (3May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). If NF-κB is required for neuronal differentiation, why does neuronal development appear normal in mice in which individual NF-κB or Rel proteins are absent (4Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar)? The dominant-negative inhibitor I-κBαM inhibits the different NF-κB/Rel complexes that bind various I-κB inhibitory proteins (e.g. I-κBα and I-κBβ). Our results therefore raise the intriguing possibility that more than one class of heterodimeric NF-κB-related transcription factors (comprising NF-κB1 or NF-κB2 complexed with RelA, RelB, or c-Rel) may act together in neuronal differentiation, which is consistent with the failure to obtain viable mice lacking more than one type of NF-κB or Rel subunit (4Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). Finally, as NF-κB activation and Bcl-2 up-regulation are abrogated in the I-κBαM-expressing cell lines, and increased Bcl-2 synthesis has previously been associated with NF-κB activation in other systems (26Rowe M. Peng-Pilon M. Huen D.S. Hardy R. Croom-Carter D. Lundgren E. Rickinson A.B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5602-5612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27DeLuca C. Kwon H. Pelletier N. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. Virology. 1998; 244: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is worth asking whether bcl-2 is a NF-κB-regulated gene. The long lag between transient NF-κB activation and the sustained increase in Bcl-2 levels strongly argues against bcl-2 being a direct target gene of NF-κB in neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, but it still leaves open the possibility that NF-κB indirectly contributes to Bcl-2 up-regulation. We are very grateful to D. R. Green (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology) for the I-κBαM-expressing plasmid and E. Feldman (University of Michigan) for the SH-SY5Y cell line. We thank V.

The second requirement is difficult because of the challenge of either trapping detectable populations of nonequilibrium structures or creating a synchronized nonequilibrium population whose dynamics can be followed. Because protein dynamics can span many decades in time starting on the picosecond time scale, it is often necessary to prepare the evolving population using a short, laser-derived excitation pulse. This approach has been very useful when starting with ligand-saturated hemeproteins. Nanosecond and faster photodissociation of ligand-bound hemoglobins has shed considerable light on the sequence of molecular steps associated with the tertiary and quaternary structure changes in the globin that follow ligand dissociation (2Scott T.W.

The sequence of conformational events following solvent-derived (non-geminate) ligand binding to deoxy hemoglobin is much more of a challenge because of the temporal constraints imposed by ligand diffusion. The initial conformational responses to ligand or substrate binding to a given protein will typically be faster than the diffusion time that is inherent to any rapid mixing experiments. In the present work, an approach to overcoming this limitation, based on sol-gel encapsulation, is presented in which the conformational response time is extended well beyond the ligand diffusion time. Thus we have been able to use UVRR1 to probe the initial sequence of conformation changes in hemoglobin when CO binds to the equilibrium form of deoxy-HbA. The encapsulation of proteins in porous TMOS-derived sol-gels has been shown to occur without significant alteration of protein structure and function (11Dave B.C. Dunn B. Valentine J.S. Zink J.I.

Encapsulated proteins are in contact with the solvent through the approximately 50–100-Å diameter gel pores and are capable of binding or releasing small ligands or substrate molecules. Sol-gel encapsulated HbA binds and releases oxygen non-cooperatively (13Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 14Shibayama N. Saigo S. J.

Furthermore, the results indicate that a decrease in temperature from ambient to below 10 °C enhances the capability of the sol-gel to limit ligand binding-induced quaternary structure changes. More recently (1Das T.K. Khan I. Rousseau D.L. Friedman J.M. Biospectroscopy. 1999; PubMed Google Scholar), it has been directly shown via resonance Raman spectroscopy that encapsulation dramatically slows—but not prevents—-both the nanosecond to microsecond tertiary changes and the slower quaternary structure changes that follow the dithionite-mediated removal of oxygen from oxy-HbA. At 4 °C, minimal relaxation is observed out to 103 s. At higher temperature, both tertiary and quaternary relaxation phases are observed, but on time scales that are orders of magnitude slower than in free solution at the same temperature. At 80 °C, the complete relaxation takes on the order of 2 h in contrast to 4 °C, where much of the relaxation is essentially frozen for days. This approach allows for probing the relaxation of a fully dissociated oxy-HbA population without the complications that occur with photodissociated samples in which geminate rebinding generates a mixed population of partially liganded species. A key observation in that earlier study (1Das T.K. Khan I. Rousseau D.L. Friedman J.M. Biospectroscopy. 1999; PubMed Google Scholar) is that, at lower temperatures, the addition of dithionite and its subsequent diffusion and oxygen scavenging can be made to occur faster than the relaxation times of hemoglobin. This finding stimulated the current study by raising the prospect of following the T to R transition in HbA by adding ligand to a cooled, encapsulated deoxy hemoglobin sample. Quaternary structure dynamics in the sol-gel matrix have been previously studied by rapidly increasing the temperature of encapsulated samples of partially liganded iron-metal hybrid hemoglobin, and following kinetics using absorption spectroscopy (16Shibayama N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1363-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The absorbance changes seen in the broad Soret and visible bands during this transition provide no details about the critical movement of specific amino acid residues within the globin. In the present study, UVRR spectroscopy (17Kitagawa T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1992; 58: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Asher S. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 59A-66ACrossref Google Scholar, 19Austin J. Jordan T. Spiro T. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Biomolecular Spectroscopy Part A. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 55-127Google Scholar) is used to probe the ligand binding-induced conformational changes of tyrosine and tryptophan residues in HbA. Conformational changes are probed both in the critical “switch” and “hinge” regions of the R-T sensitive α1β2 interface and in the scaffolding of the distal heme pocket, as reflected in the packing of the E and A helices. The ligand diffusion problem is overcome, as discussed above, by adding CO to TMOS-encapsulated deoxy-HbA under conditions where the T state is favored (high ionic strength and added effector, IHP) and conformational changes are highly constrained (6 °C). CW laser excitation at 229 nm was provided by an intracavity frequency-doubled Ar2+ laser. The power at the sample was 1.7 milliwatt. The UVRR system is described elsewhere (20Juszczak L.J. Hirsch R.E. Nagel R.L. Friedman J.M. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1998; 29: 963-968Crossref Google Scholar). Adult human hemoglobin A was a generous gift of Dr. Seetharama Acharya. Concentrated HbA was diluted to 0.125 mm with 50 mm Hepes, at pH 7.5, for solution samples. Deoxygenation was carried out on nitrogen-purged samples in an anaerobic atmosphere via addition of a 4-fold excess (4× heme concentration) of sodium dithionite (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ). CO ligation was accomplished by gaseous replacement. The hemoglobin ligation state was monitored by absorption spectroscopy of the visible and Soret bands (Lambda 2 UV/VIS spectrometer, Perkin-Elmer). 0.3 mperchlorate was added as an internal standard (sodium perchlorate, 0.002% chloride maximum, EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). Sol-gels were prepared according to the protocol given in Refs. 11Dave B.C. Dunn B. Valentine J.S. Zink J.I. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 1120A-1127ACrossref Scopus (792) Google Scholar and 12Ellerby L.M. Nishida C.R. Nishida F. Yamanaka S.A. Dunn B. Valentine J.S. Zink J.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1113-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar. Hemoglobin concentration in the sol is 0.125 mm with a 6-fold excess of the effector, IHP. Deoxy-HbA sol-gel “pipes,” measuring 10 mm outer diameter × 9 mm inner diameter × 25.4 mm height, were cast in quartz NMR tubes using a Teflon mold under a nitrogen atmosphere. Subsequent to gelation, the deoxy-HbA samples were bathed in nitrogen-purged 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, buffer with the addition of 0.3 m perchlorate as an internal UVRR standard. The NMR tubes were subsequently sealed with rubber septa. The sol-gel samples were then wet-aged for 20 h at 4 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. After acquisition of the UVRR spectrum of encapsulated deoxy-HbA, the bathing buffer solution was exchanged with CO-saturated buffer, and the cavity space above the sol-gel was exchanged with CO gas. The time of CO addition was recorded, as well as the time of UVRR spectral acquisition for the CO-exposed deoxy-HbA. UVRR spectra were acquired at 6 °C. UVRR spectra were normalized at the perchlorate standard peak (934 cm−1) prior to calculation of a UVRR difference spectrum. Fig. 1 a shows the 229-nm excited UVRR spectrum of human adult deoxy-HbA under solution conditions (7Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Both tyrosine and tryptophan bands predominate. The former are located at 1177 cm−1 (Y9a), 1208 cm−1 (Y7a), and 1617 cm−1 (Y8a), whereas the latter are located at 1010 cm−1 (W16), 1236 cm−1 (W10), 1340 cm−1 and 1360 cm−1 (W7), 1459 cm−1 (W5), 1493 cm−1 (W4), and 1559 cm−1 (W3). Changes in several of these UVRR bands occur upon ligand binding. Of considerable significance (see below) is the decrease in intensity of the W3 shoulder at 1549 cm−1 and the frequency shift of the Y8a band to 1616 cm−1. Fig. 1 b illustrates these changes in a UVRR difference spectrum, deoxy-HbA minus CO-HbA, under solution conditions. Several features in the difference spectrum have been characterized and are associated with the T-to-R state conformational changes involving tryptophan and tyrosine residues (7Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The UVRR difference spectrum for sol-gel encapsulated HbA in different ligation states at 6 °C is given in Fig. 1 d. Here, the minuend is the UVRR spectrum for deoxy-HbA, whereas the subtrahend is the spectrum for the same deoxy-HbA sol-gel sample 1 h after the introduction of CO. It should be noted that the reduced signal-to-noise ratio of Fig. 1 d is because of the shortened signal acquisition time of 5 min. The short acquisition time was used to preclude, or at least to minimize, the impact of an evolving spectrum for the ligand bound species. For stable equilibrium species, signal acquisition times (Fig. 1 b, e.g.) are on the order of 30 min. The UVRR difference spectrum for the sol-gel encapsulated hemoglobin (Fig. 1 d) reveals that after 1 h of CO exposure, the intensity of tryptophan bands W16 at 1006 cm−1 and W3 at 1558 cm−1 has substantially decreased. The yet unassigned 1512 cm−1 band has also decreased in intensity. Tyrosine peaks at 1177 and 1620 cm−1 are on the same order of magnitude as noise. The broad band at 1040 cm−1 is a base-line subtraction artifact. Because the intensity differences in the UVRR difference spectrum in Fig. 1 d are evident as a limited subset of well separated Raman bands, they cannot be ascribed to artifact. Given the absence of any strong differences in tyrosine bands throughout the full spectrum, the difference feature at 1608 cm−1 is tentatively assigned to a W1 mode (21Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G. Science. 1994; 265: 1697-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The UVRR difference spectrum in Fig. 1 c illustrates subsequent conformational changes in the CO-saturated, encapsulated HbA (subtrahend) vis-à-vis deoxy-HbA (minuend). After the first hour at 6 °C, the CO-exposed sample was then warmed to 25 °C for 4 h to facilitate conformational mobility (1Das T.K. Khan I. Rousseau D.L. Friedman J.M. Biospectroscopy. 1999; PubMed Google Scholar) and then re-cooled to the initial 6 °C for spectroscopic examination. After this warming cycle, the UVRR difference spectrum exhibited several new features. A shoulder at 1549 cm−1 has been added to the 1559 cm−1 peak. The Y8a derivative-shaped difference peak from 1597 to 1627 cm−1, prominent in the solution difference spectrum (Fig. 1 b), is still not discernible; however, a decrease in intensity at 1620 cm−1 is apparent. The same observation holds for the Y9a difference peak at 1181 cm−1. Absorption spectra corresponding to the three states of the encapsulated HbA (discussed above) are very similar to spectra obtained from corresponding solution phase species, indicating that deoxy-HbA and, later, CO-HbA predominate in the sol-gel sample (supplemental data available upon request). The deoxy-HbA absorption spectrum was taken subsequent to the sol-gel wet-aging (20 h), indicating that deoxy-HbA is stable in sol-gel. The UVRR spectra of deoxy-HbA and CO-HbA in sol-gel alone are indicators of the globin conformational state as the W3 and Y8a bands are sensitive to Trp and Tyr conformation, which report on ligation state-associated globin tertiary and quaternary changes (7Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G. Science. 1994; 265: 1697-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A comparison between the solution phase difference spectrum (Fig.1 b) and those for encapsulated HbA (Fig. 1, c andd) reveals substantial encapsulation-associated differences. These differences cannot be ascribed to a mixture of the equilibrium T and R state species that give rise to the Fig. 1 b solution phase differences. In solution, the binding of CO to deoxy-HbA initiates an undetermined sequence of rapid tertiary structure changes that ultimately result in a quaternary switch from the low affinity T structure to the high affinity R structure (22Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The deoxy-HbA minus CO-HbA solution phase UVRR difference spectrum (Fig. 1 b) is primarily reflective of changes in the R-T sensitive α1β2 dimer interface arising from differences between the deoxy T and liganded R conformations (7Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Su C. Park Y.D. Liu G. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

The W3 difference feature at 1549 cm−1 (Fig. 1 b) on the low frequency side of the central peak at 1559 cm−1 (Fig. 1 a) originates from a T-R conformational difference in Trpβ37, the pivotal residue in the hinge region of the α1β2 interface (7Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Su C. Park Y.D. Liu G. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

Whereas Trpβ37 is responsible for the low frequency shoulder of the W3 band, Trpα14 and Trpβ15, located on the A helices, are the source of the central W3 peak at 1559 cm−1 (7Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G. Science. 1994; 265: 1697-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As the solution phase W3 difference spectrum (Fig. 1 b) shows, the two A helix tryptophans and their environment do not change upon switching from deoxy T to liganded R conformations (7Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9940-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have been ascribed to alterations in the packing of the A and E helices. This conclusion follows from x-ray crystallographic results which indicates that both α14 and β15 are hydrogen bonded to residues on the E helix (33Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The derivative-shaped feature at 1597–1627 cm−1, associated with Y8a (Fig. 1 b), has been shown to originate from Tyrα42 in the switch region of the α1β2 interface (27Huang S. Peterson E.S. Ho C. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6197-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Nagai M. Wajcman H. Lahary A. Nakatsukasa T. Nagatomo S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Nagai M. Imai K. Kaminaka S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Mol. Struct. 1996; 379: 65-75Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bond between Tyrα42 and Aspβ99 is broken upon switching from the T to R quaternary structure (35Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Intensity changes in Y8a without frequency shifts have been linked to variations in the packing of the penultimate tyrosines, α140 and β145, which alter their spectra-determining hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl of the respective FG5 valines (24Jayaraman V. Rodgers K.R. Mukerji I. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Huang S. Peterson E.S. Ho C. Friedman J.M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) as well as interactions with surrounding residues and solvent molecules. Fig. 1, c and d, clearly reveals that the binding of CO to deoxy HbA in the sol-gel initiates a discernible sequence of changes. The first changes (Fig. 1 d) involve primarily, if not entirely, tryptophan bands. In particular, the central portion of W3 at 1559 cm−1 shows a dramatic decrease in intensity, indicative of a weakening of the hydrogen bonds between the A helix tryptophans and their respective partner on the E helix. Noticeably absent is a change in the low frequency shoulder of W3 arising from Trpβ37 (Fig. 1 b). The absence in the 1 h sol-gel UVRR difference spectrum (Fig.1 d) of strong derivative-shaped Y8a and Y9a bands seen in the solution-phase difference spectrum (Fig. 1 b) indicates that the T state hydrogen bond between Tyrα42 and Aspβ99 is still largely intact. Both the lack of intensity change and frequency shift in the Y8a and Y9a bands for the sol-gel HbA at early time (Fig.1 d) implies that the packing of both penultimate tyrosines is unperturbed (29Nagai M. Wajcman H. Lahary A. Nakatsukasa T. Nagatomo S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, b–d, implies a progression of conformational changes for the deoxy-T→liganded R transition that starts with a change in the distal heme pocket, as signaled by the Trp W3 (1559 cm−1) and W16 (1010 cm−1) difference bands (Fig. 1 d). It can be seen (Fig. 1 c) that at longer times (and exposure to higher temperatures) the encapsulated, CO-exposed deoxy-HbA sample has undergone additional changes. The appearance of the 1549 cm−1 difference band (Fig.1 c), signals a shift of the hinge region Trpβ37 in the α1β2 interface toward its R state configuration. The decrease in the intensity of the Y8a and the Y9a peaks (Fig. 1 c) are ascribed to a loosening (increased disorder) of one or both penultimate tyrosines. Crystallographic studies (36Kavanaugh J.S. Weydert J.A. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4358-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) on a series of β37 mutants provide a plausible structural and mechanistic explanation for the spectral changes shown in Fig. 1 c that is based on the coupled behavior of Trpβ37 and Tyrα140. The packing of Tyrα140 is likely to be disrupted by the ligand binding-induced shift in the F helix because of movement of the iron into the plane of the heme porphyrin. Arnone and co-workers (36Kavanaugh J.S. Weydert J.A. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4358-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) describe a lever-like amplification of the iron motion via the vertical displacement of the proximal histidine F8 (Hisα87) and the adjacent F9 Alaα88 that directly contacts the phenol ring of Tyrα140. The movement of this lever upon ligand binding should result in increased disordering for the tyrosine side chain. The tight packing of the tyrosine side chain in the deoxy-T state maintains the T state β37 hinge configuration. An increase in the mobility of the tyrosine side chain allows the environment about β37 to slip toward its R state conformation, thus linking the tyrosine- (Y8a, Y9a) and Trpβ37 (W3)-associated spectral features seen in the “5 h” UVRR difference spectrum (Fig. 1 c). Visible Raman spectroscopic (37Peterson E.S. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallographic (36Kavanaugh J.S. Weydert J.A. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4358-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) studies on β37 mutants imply both that the proximal heme environment is tightly coupled to these degrees of freedom and consequently, that the above UVRR changes should be accompanied by a decrease in proximal strain at the α hemes. The progressive increase in the iron-proximal His visible Raman frequency in a series of T state Trpβ37 mutants implies a progressive decrease in proximal strain and is correlated with both an increased disorder in α140 and a corresponding enhancement in ligand binding rates (37Peterson E.S. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Kwiatkowski L.D. Hui H.L. Wierzba A. Noble R.W. Walder R.Y. Peterson E. Sligar S. Sanders K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4325-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the encapsulation of deoxy-HbA with IHP in porous sol-gels has enabled us to study a homogeneous population of ligand-bound deoxy-HbA. This accomplishment is a direct consequence of the ability of the sol-gel to slow the rate of conformational change relative to that of ligand diffusion within the sol-gel. The UVRR difference spectra obtained from the binding of CO to encapsulated deoxy-HbA reveal an initial E helix motion upon ligand binding tentatively attributed to the β subunits. The subsequent simultaneous appearance of Tyr (Y8a and Y9a) and W3 (1549 cm−1) UVRR difference bands is ascribed to a ligand binding-induced increase (via the iron-F8 proximal histidine-F9Ala lever) in the disorder of the penultimate Tyrα140 and the concomitant shifting of the “hinge” region Trpβ37. Studies designed to probe the next phases of relaxation are in progress. More generally, this report demonstrates that sol-gel encapsulation of proteins can be used to study sequences of conformational events triggered by substrate binding that are not accessible via conventional rapid mixing experiments.
