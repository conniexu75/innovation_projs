https://openalex.org/W1988870963,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is an important mediator of insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes through its ability to decrease the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (IR). Treatment of cultured murine adipocytes with TNF-α was shown to induce serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of the IR tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. Myeloid 32D cells, which lack endogenous IRS-1, were resistant to TNF-α-mediated inhibition of IR signaling, whereas transfected 32D cells that express IRS-1 were very sensitive to this effect of TNF-α. An inhibitory form of IRS-1 was observed in muscle and fat tissues from obese rats. These results indicate that TNF-α induces insulin resistance through an unexpected action of IRS-1 to attenuate insulin receptor signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2054246670,"Rho, a Ras-like small guanosine triphosphatase, has been implicated in cytoskeletal responses to extracellular signals such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to form stress fibers and focal contacts. The form of RhoA bound to guanosine triphosphate directly bound to and activated a serine-threonine kinase, protein kinase N (PKN). Activated RhoA formed a complex with PKN and activated it in COS-7 cells. PKN was phosphorylated in Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated with LPA, and this phosphorylation was blocked by treatment of cells with botulinum C3 exoenzyme. Activation of Rho may be linked directly to a serine-threonine kinase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2009394026,"The Rho guanosine 5'-triphosphatase (GTPase) cycles between the active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound form and the inactive guanosine diphosphate-bound form and regulates cell adhesion and cytokinesis, but how it exerts these actions is unknown. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to clone a complementary DNA for a protein (designated Rhophilin) that specifically bound to GTP-Rho. The Rho-binding domain of this protein has 40 percent identity with a putative regulatory domain of a protein kinase, PKN. PKN itself bound to GTP-Rho and was activated by this binding both in vitro and in vivo. This study indicates that a serine-threonine protein kinase is a Rho effector and presents an amino acid sequence motif for binding to GTP-Rho that may be shared by a family of Rho target proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1967519473,"The chromatic dimensions of human color vision have a neural basis in the retina. Ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, exhibit spectral opponency; they are excited by some wavelengths and inhibited by others. The hypothesis that the opponent circuitry emerges from selective connections between horizontal cell interneurons and cone photoreceptors sensitive to long, middle, and short wavelengths (L-, M-, and S-cones) was tested by physiologically and anatomically characterizing cone connections of horizontal cell mosaics in macaque monkeys. H1 horizontal cells received input only from L- and M-cones, whereas H2 horizontal cells received a strong input from S-cones and a weaker input from L- and M-cones. All cone inputs were the same sign, and both horizontal cell types lacked opponency. Despite cone type selectivity, the horizontal cell cannot be the locus of an opponent transformation in primates, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2075824960,"Quaternary ammonium blockers inhibit many voltage-activated potassium (K+) channels from the intracellular side. When applied to Drosophila Shaker potassium channels expressed in mammalian cells, these rapidly reversible blockers produced use-dependent inhibition through an unusual mechanism--they promoted an intrinsic conformational change known as C-type inactivation, from which recovery is slow. The blockers did so by cutting off potassium ion flow to a site in the pore, which then emptied at a rate of 10(5) ions per second. This slow rate probably reflected the departure of the last ion from the multi-ion pore: Permeation of ions (at 10(7) per second) occurs rapidly because of ion-ion repulsion, but the last ion to leave would experience no such repulsion."
https://openalex.org/W2018332833,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is activated in response to both receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors. Recently, Gi-coupled receptors, such as the α2A adrenergic receptor, were shown to mediate Ras-dependent MAPK activation via a pathway requiring G-protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) and many of the same intermediates involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. In contrast, Gq-coupled receptors, such as the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1AChR), activate MAPK via a pathway that is Ras-independent but requires the activity of protein kinase C (PKC). Here we show that, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the M1AChR and platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) mediate MAPK activation via the α-subunit of the Go protein. Go-mediated MAPK activation was sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin but insensitive to inhibition by a Gβγ-sequestering peptide (βARK1ct). M1AChR and PAFR catalyzed Goα-subunit GTP exchange, and MAPK activation could be partially rescued by a pertussis toxin-insensitive mutant of Goα but not by similar mutants of Gi. Go-mediated MAPK activation was insensitive to inhibition by a dominant negative mutant of Ras (N17Ras) but was completely blocked by cellular depletion of PKC. Thus, M1AChR and PAFR, which have previously been shown to couple to Gq, are also coupled to Go to activate a novel PKC-dependent mitogenic signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2053145125,"The visual world consciously perceived is very different from the spatial array of photo-receptor activation present on our retinae; it is composed of segregated surfaces, organized into distinct objects. An important component of this organizational process, the segmentation of an image into figures and background, is shown to be performed much better in the lower visual field. This finding is demonstrated by the performance in two tasks that involve the perception of illusory contours. This asymmetry indicates a neural specialization that may be related to the anatomical discontinuity along the representation of the horizontal meridian in extrastriate visual cortex."

Rap1 has been shown to antagonize the Ras functions, such as the Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells and the Ras-induced activation of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase-dependent mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade in Rat-1 cells, whereas we have shown that Rap1 as well as Ras stimulates DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells. We have established a cell-free assay system in which Ras activates bovine brain B-Raf protein kinase. Here we have used this assay system and examined the effect of Rap1 on the B-Raf activity to phosphorylate recombinant MAP kinase kinase (MEK). Recombinant Rap1B stimulated the activity of B-Raf, which was partially purified from bovine brain and immunoprecipitated by an anti-B-Raf antibody. The GTP-bound form was active, but the GDP-bound form was inactive. The fully post-translationally lipid-modified form was active, but the unmodified form was nearly inactive. The maximum B-Raf activity stimulated by Rap1B was nearly the same as that stimulated by Ki-Ras. Rap1B enhanced the Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity in an additive manner. These results indicate that not only Ras but also Rap1 is involved in the activation of the B-Raf-dependent MAP kinase cascade.

This phosphorylation of Rap1B lowers its membrane binding activity and induces its translocation from the membrane to the cytosol(18.Lapetina E.G. Lacal J.C. Reep B.R. Vedia L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These observations suggest that Rap1 shows multiple functions, but the mode of action of Rap1 at a molecular level remains to be clarified. The mode of action of Ras has recently been intensively investigated, and one of its direct downstream target molecules has been identified to be c-Raf-1, which induces the activation of the MAP kinase/ERK through MEK (for a review, see (26.Avruch J. Zhang X.-F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar)). Although GTP-Ras has been shown to interact directly with c-Raf-1(27.Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J.

Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), evidence has not been obtained that GTP-Ras activates c-Raf-1 in a cell-free assay system. We have developed a cell-free assay system in which GTP-Ras activates MEK and identified a Ras-dependent MEK kinase in Xenopus oocytes and eggs(29.Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T.

Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2460-2465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have purified a Ras-dependent MEK kinase from bovine brain cytosol and identified it as B-Raf, which was tightly complexed with 14-3-3 proteins(31.Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11723-11726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the earlier observations that MAP kinase is activated by B-Raf, but not by c-Raf-1, in intact PC12 cells in response to nerve growth factor(32.Jaiswal R.K. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Landreth G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that the association of MEK with immobilized Ha-Ras is dependent on B-Raf, but not on c-Raf-1, in rat brain(33.Moodie S.A. Paris M.J. Kolch W. Wolfman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7153-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and that the MEK-activating activity is accompanied with B-Raf, but not with c-Raf-1, in bovine brain and bovine adrenal chromaffin cells(34.Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Cox M.E. Parsons S.J. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30014-30021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ras has a Cys-A-A-X structure (where A is aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid) that undergoes post-translational modifications; the cysteine residue is first farnesylated followed by proteolytic removal of the A-A-X portion and the carboxyl methylation of the exposed cysteine residue (for a review, see (35.Magee A.I. Newman C.M.H. Giannakouros T. Hancock J.F. Fawell E. Armstrong J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). Rap1 has a Cys-A-A-Leu structure, which similarly undergoes post-translational modifications except that it is geranylgeranylated(36.Kawata M. Farnsworth C.C. Yoshida Y. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8960-8964Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These modifications of Ras are essential for its biological activities(35.Magee A.I.

The lipid modifications of Rap1 are also essential for its activities to inhibit the Ki-Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (42.Kitayama H. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4284-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the Ki-Ras-induced activation of the c-fos promoter/enhancer in NIH 3T3 cells (6.Sakoda T. Kaibuchi K. Kishi K.

Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that Rap1 as well as Ras interacts with c-Raf-1 by use of a yeast two-hybrid system(27.Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). More recently, the structure of a complex of Rap1A with the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf-1 has been determined by x-ray crystal structure analysis(43.Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). However, no evidence has thus far been obtained that Rap1 directly affects the c-Raf-1 activity or the Ras-stimulated c-Raf-1 activity. In the present study, by use of our cell-free assay system, we have attempted to clarify whether Rap1B stimulates the B-Raf activity or whether Rap1B antagonizes the Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity. Post-translationally lipid-modified Rap1B, lipid-unmodified Rap1B, and lipid-modified Ki-Ras were prepared as described(37.Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). GST-MEK and GST-ERK2 were prepared as described (30.Kuroda S. Shimizu K.

GTPγS-Rap1B, GDP-Rap1B, GTPγS-Ki-Ras, and GDP-Ki-Ras were prepared as described(37.Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The B-Raf activity was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of MBP by recombinant GST-ERK2 in the presence of recombinant GST-MEK as described with a slight modification(31.Yamamori B. Kuroda S.

Briefly, 5 μl of various combinations of GTPγS-Rap1B, GDP-Rap1B, GTPγS-Ki-Ras, and GDP-Ki-Ras were mixed with 15 μl of B-Raf. The concentrations of these compounds used were indicated in each experiment. Fifteen μl of a reaction mixture containing 120 μM ATP was added, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 30°C. After the incubation, 15 μl of GST-MEK was added and the incubation was continued for 10 min at 30°C. After further incubation, 10 μl of GST-ERK2 was added and the incubation was continued for 20 min at 30°C. Then, 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 100 μM [γ-([0-9]+)P]ATP (300 cpm/pmol) and 220 μM MBP was added. After further incubation for 10 min at 30°C, 30 μl of the mixture was spotted onto a phosphocellulose paper sheet. The sheet was washed with 75 mM phosphoric acid, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. B-Raf was purified from bovine brain as described(31.Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11723-11726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine brain cytosol was subjected to Mono S column chromatography and the active fractions were collected. They were subjected to Mono Q column chromatography and the active fractions were collected. These fractions, containing B-Raf complexed with 14-3-3 proteins, were used. Five μl of GTPγS-Rap1B, GDP-Rap1B, GTPγS-Ki-Ras, or GDP-Ki-Ras was mixed with 15 μl of B-Raf partially purified from bovine brain and 5 μl of Buffer A containing 20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 18 mM EGTA, 25 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM ATP. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 30°C. After 45 μl of GST-MEK (0.3 μg of protein) and 5 μl of Buffer B containing 20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 18 mM EGTA, 75 mM MgCl2, and 200 μM [γ-32P]ATP (10,000 cpm/pmol) were added, the incubation was continued for a further 30 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer (37.5 μl) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel). The radioactivity of 32P incorporated into MEK was detected by bioimaging analyzer BAS 2000 (FUJIX, Tokyo) as described previously (29.Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ten μl of GTPγS-Rap1B, GDP-Rap1B, GTPγS-Ki-Ras, or GDP-Ki-Ras was mixed with 30 μl of B-Raf, which was partially purified from bovine brain, and 10 μl of Buffer A. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 30°C. After the incubation, anti-B-Raf antibody-coupled Protein A-Sepharose beads (6 μl) were added, and the mixture was agitated for 1 h at 4°C. The immunocomplex was precipitated and washed three times with Buffer C containing 20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 4 mM EGTA, 12 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% CHAPS. The immunoprecipitate was resuspended in 5 μl of Buffer A and 20 μl of Buffer C. Twenty-five μl of the immunoprecipitate was incubated with 45 μl of GST-MEK (0.3 μg of protein) and 5 μl of Buffer B for 30 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel). The radioactivity of 32P incorporated into MEK was detected by bioimaging analyzer BAS 2000. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli(44.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein by the method of Bradford(45.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). GTPγS-Rap1B as well as GTPγS-Ki-Ras stimulated the B-Raf activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas GDP-Rap1B or GDP-Ki-Ras did not (Fig. 1A). The maximum B-Raf activity stimulated by GTPγS-Rap1B was nearly the same as that stimulated by GTPγS-Ki-Ras. To confirm that MBP phosphorylation indeed resulted from the B-Raf-induced activation of exogenously added GST-MEK, we examined the phosphorylation of GST-MEK by B-Raf in the presence of GTPγS-Rap1B, GDP-Rap1B, GTPγS-Ki-Ras, or GDP-Ki-Ras. GST-MEK was indeed phosphorylated in the presence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras or GTPγS-Rap1B but was not phosphorylated in the presence of their GDP-bound form (Fig. 1B). The maximum level of the Rap1B-induced phosphorylation of GST-MEK was nearly the same as that of the Ki-Ras-induced one. To further confirm that Ras and Rap1B directly act on B-Raf, we examined the phosphorylation of GST-MEK by B-Raf immunoprecipitated by its antibody. Immunoprecipitated B-Raf indeed phosphorylated GST-MEK in GTPγS-Ki-Ras- and GTPγS-Rap1B-dependent manners (Fig. 1C). The maximum level of the Rap1B-induced phosphorylation of GST-MEK was slightly lower than that of the Ki-Ras-induced one. ( 2The exact reason for the small difference between their maximum levels is not known, but one explanation is that, since GTPγS-Rap1B has less affinity with B-Raf than GTPγS-Ki-Ras, some GTPγS-Rap1B might dissociate from the GTPγS-Rap1B-B-Raf complex and the B-Raf activity might be decreased during the preparation of the immunoprecipitate.) We have shown that the lipid modifications of Ki-Ras are important for the B-Raf activity(31.Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11723-11726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarly, lipid-modified GTPγS-Rap1B stimulated the B-Raf activity, whereas the lipid-unmodified one was nearly inactive (Fig. 2). Rap1 has been shown to antagonize various Ras functions(3.Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The effect of GTPγS-Rap1B on the Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity was examined. GTPγS-Rap1B enhanced the Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity in an additive manner (Fig. 3). We have previously shown that Rap1B is phosphorylated by protein kinase A at Ser179 in the C-terminal region(24.Hata Y. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura S. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of this protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of Rap1B on the B-Raf activity was examined. The protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of Rap1B itself did not affect the B-Raf activity nor the Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity (data not shown). Rap1 has been shown to interact with c-Raf-1 in a yeast two-hybrid system (27.Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) and to affect the c-Raf-1 activity in intact cells(8.Cook S.J. Rubinfield B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Recently, Rap1A has been co-crystallized with the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf-1(43.Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between Rap1 and B-Raf has not thus far been studied. We have shown here in our cell-free assay system that GTPγS-Rap1B as well as GTPγS-Ki-Ras stimulates the B-Raf activity and that GTPγS-Rap1B enhances the Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity in an additive manner. These results indicate that both Ras and Rap1 interact with B-Raf and induce its activation in a similar manner and suggest that Rap1 as well as Ras induces the activation of the B-Raf-dependent MAP kinase cascade and does not antagonize the Ras-induced activation of the B-Raf-dependent MAP kinase cascade in intact cells. It has been shown in many systems that Rap1 antagonizes various Ras functions, some of which have been considered to be mediated by the action of c-Raf-1(3.Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 4.Campa M.J. Chang K.J. Vedia L. Reep B.R. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). c-Raf-1 has been shown to be expressed in most tissues, but B-Raf has been shown to be expressed in brain, spinal cord, and testis(46.Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis ( 3Rat spleen and heart cytosol extracts were subjected to Mono S column chromatography. Immunoblot analysis of each fraction with an anti-B-Raf antibody identified B-Raf with a Mr value of 95 kDa.) has, however, revealed that B-Raf is also expressed in rat spleen and heart, suggesting that both c-Raf-1 and B-Raf are expressed in most tissues. The reason Rap1B does not antagonize the Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity is not known, but it is possible that Rap1 as well as Ras activates B-Raf whereas Rap1 does not activate c-Raf-1 and antagonizes the Ras-induced activation of c-Raf-1. It is important to establish the cell-free assay system in which Ras stimulates the c-Raf-1 activity and to examine the effect of Rap1 on the c-Raf-1 activity and the Ras-stimulated c-Raf-1 activity. We obtained the result that the protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of Rap1B itself did not affect the B-Raf activity or the Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity (data not shown). Rap1 has been shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A(16.Hoshijima M. Kikuchi A. Kawata M. Ohmori T. Hashimoto E. Yamamura H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 1628-1635PubMed Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation of Rap1 has been suggested to induce the activation of Rap1(24.Hata Y. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura S. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N. Ostrowski M.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol.

Therefore, the present results together with these earlier observations suggest that the protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of Rap1 is important for its activation but not for its function, such as the activation of B-Raf. It has been shown that the cyclic AMP-protein kinase A system induces the activation of the MAP kinase cascade in intact PC12 cells (48.Frödin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and intact COS7 cells(49.Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that the cyclic AMP-protein kinase A system inhibits the B-Raf activity in intact PC12 cells (50.Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the Ras-dependent MAP kinase activity in intact NIH 3T3 cells and Rat-1 cells(51.Burgering B.M. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), in Rat-1 cells overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor(52.Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), and in a cell-free assay system(53.VanRenterghem B. Browning M.D. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has recently been reported that the B-Raf activity is not inhibited by cyclic AMP in PC12 cells maintained in the serum-containing medium but is inhibited in serum-starved PC12 cells(54.Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5524-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This result, together with the present result that the protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of Rap1B did not antagonize the Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity, suggests that the apparent discrepancies observed between cell-based and in vitro protein kinase A studies reported might reflect different regulatory mechanisms of B-Raf, which are affected by growth conditions and cell type-specific differences of B-Raf expression. Further studies are necessary to clarify these discrepancies. It may be noted that the lipid modifications of Rap1B are important for the B-Raf activity. We have previously shown that the lipid modifications of Rap1B are important for the Smg GDS-induced activation of Rap1B(37.Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, the lipid modifications of Rap1B are important for its activation and function. This property of Rap1B is similar to that of Ras of which lipid modifications are important for both its activation and function(31.Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J.

However, it still remains to be clarified how the lipid modifications are important for the interaction of Ras and Rap1 with their regulators and target molecules."

Both chaperones bound to native barnase under physiological conditions and catalyzed exchange of deeply buried amide protons with solvent. Such exchange required complete unfolding of barnase, which occurred in the complex with the chaperones. Subsequent collapse of unfolded barnase to the exchange-protected folding intermediate was markedly slowed in the presence of GroEL or SecB. Thus, both chaperones have the potential to correct misfolding in proteins by annealing."

One of the putative targets of calcineurin is the pre-existing, cytosolic component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATp; also referred to as NFAT1), which is one of several transcription factors required for the expression of interleukin 2. Inhibition of calcineurin by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 prevents dephosphorylation of NFATp and its translocation to the nucleus. However, a physical interaction between calcineurin and NFATp has not been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate the binding of NFATp from lysates of T cells to immobilized calcineurin. Stimulation of T cells with calcium ionophore induced a shift in the molecular weight of NFATp that is due to its dephosphorylation. This dephosphorylation was inhibited by treatment of T cells with cyclosporin A or FK506 prior to stimulation. Of note, both the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated form of NFATp bound to calcineurin. Furthermore, the binding of both forms of NFATp to calcineurin was inhibited by pretreatment of calcineurin with a complex of FK506 and its ligand FKBP12.

The central role of calcineurin in T cell signaling was appreciated by its identification as the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506(1.Friedman J. Weissman I.

The phosphatase activity of CN is inhibited by either drug when complexed to intracellular binding proteins (immunophilins), i.e. CsA to cyclophilin and FK506 to the FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), respectively. Neither drug nor immunophilin alone bind to or affect the activity of CN(2.Liu J. Farmer J.D.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L.

Increases in intracellular calcium induce the translocation of the cytosolic component of NFAT to the nucleus, where NFATp interacts with the AP1 elements Fos and Jun and binds to its cognate DNA-binding site. The calcium-dependent dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT cytoplasmic components are inhibited by CsA and FK506 whereas the generation of the nuclear components is unaffected (11.Jain J.

It has been further demonstrated that CN dephosphorylates NFATp in vitro and that the dephosphorylated form of NFATp binds with a higher affinity to an NFAT oligonucleotide(20.Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M.

Moreover, it has been shown that CN phosphatase activity correlates with T cell receptor-induced IL-2 expression in vitro and in vivo(22.Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3686-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 23.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that CN plays a central role in transducing T cell receptor- mediated signals to the nucleus. However, it has not been determined whether the influence of CN on the nuclear translocation of the cytosolic forms of NFAT is due to a direct or indirect interaction. In this report we show that purified bovine CN immobilized to calmodulin Sepharose beads precipitates NFATp from lysates of a murine T cell line. Of note, CN associated with both the phosphorylated as well as the dephosphorylated form of NFATp. The interaction of CN with NFATp was inhibited by the complex of FK506•FKBP12 but not by either FK506 or FKBP12 alone. The finding of a physical association of CN with NFATp supports a model whereby CN is directly involved in dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFATp. The CD4+ CD8+ murine T cell hybridoma BYDP (25.Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was grown in RPMI 1640 complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% iron-supplemented calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 × 10-5M β-mercaptoethanol). Four hours prior to stimulation, BYDP cells were washed and placed in serum-free medium (same as complete RPMI 1640 medium, except without serum). BYDP (107 cells/sample) were washed once and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with FK506 (0.1 μM) with or without rapamycin (10 μM) or with ethanol as control for 30 min at 37°C. Subsequently the cells were stimulated with PMA (5 ng/ml or as indicated) and/or ionomycin (2 μM) for 5 min at 37°C. Control samples were adjusted to a similar concentration of the diluent ethanol. The cells were pelleted by a pulse spin, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 10 μM CaCl2, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, and proteinase inhibitors (60 μg/ml aprotinin, 60 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 200 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 17 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I, 7 μg/ml calpain inhibitor II, 50 μg/ml antipain, 50 μg/ml chymostatin, 25 μg/ml bestatin, 10 μg/ml E64, 100 μg/ml phosphoramidon, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)). Calmodulin-Sepharose beads were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mM CaCl2 and preincubated with 4 μM (or as indicated) FK506 and/or 400 μM rapamycin and 4 μM FKBP12 or GST-FKBP12 and 0.2 μM calcineurin for 60 min at 4°C in 250 μl of lysis buffer. Subsequently 500-μl lysates of 107 cells were added and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed four times with precipitation wash buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 30 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). For postincubation of beads with FKBP12•FK506, beads were washed three times before adding 40 μM FK506 and 4 μM FKBP12 for 20 min at 4°C in 250 μl of precipitation wash buffer and washed additionally two times with the same buffer. Proteins bound to calmodulin-Sepharose beads were separated by 8-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Corp.). CsA is produced by Sandoz (East Hanover, NJ) and FK506 by Fujisawa (Melrose Park, IL), and rapamycin was kindly provided by Dr. J. Johnson (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Ionomycin was purchased from Calbiochem and PMA from Sigma. Proteinase inhibitors, with the exception of trypsin inhibitor which was purchased from Sigma, were acquired from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Calmodulin-Sepharose beads were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Bovine brain calcineurin and human, recombinant FKBP12 were obtained from Sigma. The fusion protein GST-FKBP12 was prepared as described(26.Jin Y.-J. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10942-10945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-peptide antiserum specific for FKBP12 (amino acids 1-16) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Harding (Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). The rabbit antiserum against NFATp (R59) was generated by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant NFATp and generously provided by Dr. A. Rao(13.McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J.

Murine hybridoma T cells (BYDP) were stimulated for 5 min with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, the protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, PMA, or with both agents. Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antiserum raised against NFATp(13.McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Two major forms of NFATp were visualized by Western blotting. In unstimulated T cells and T cells stimulated with PMA alone, NFATp had an molecular mass of ∼134 kDa. Stimulation with ionomycin or ionomycin plus PMA induced a downward shift in the molecular mass of NFATp to a band of ∼113 kDa (Fig. 1A). The induction of this shift has been previously demonstrated to be due to the dephosphorylation of NFATp (19.Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22602-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20.Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl.

Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). PMA alone did not elicit a shift in mobility of NFATp, indicating that a rise in intracellular calcium concentration is sufficient to induce dephosphorylation of NFATp. In order to evaluate the time course of the dephosphorylation of NFATp, T hybridoma cells were stimulated with ionomycin; whole cell lysates were prepared at the indicated time points, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with NFATp-antiserum (Fig. 1B). Thus, ionomycin induced a rapid shift in mobility of NFATp after 5 min, which was maintained for 8 h in the continuous presence of ionomycin and reverted to the slower migrating, phosphorylated form after 19 h. The rephosphorylation of NFATp is consistent with the observation that 5 h after T cell receptor activation NFATp translocates to the cytoplasm and is rephosphorylated. ( 2C. Loh, J. Kim, P. G. Hogan, and A. Rao, submitted for publication.) Calcineurin is thought to be involved in the dephosphorylation and subsequent translocation of NFATp from the cytoplasm to the nucleus since inhibition of calcineurin activity by the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and CsA inhibits nuclear translocation of cytosolic NFAT(11.Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Arthur V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 17.Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether NFATp, in T cell lysates (BYDP cells), associates with exogenous calcineurin in vitro. T cell lysates were incubated with purified calcineurin from bovine brain immobilized to calmodulin-Sepharose (CaM beads). In order to inhibit phosphatase activity of CN we included the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride and sodium pyrophosphate during incubation. In lysates of unstimulated T cells, CN bound to the higher (phosphorylated) Mr form of NFATp whereas in lysates of T cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin, CN associated with the lower (dephosphorylated) form (Fig. 2). Thus, immobilized CN bound both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of NFATp. CN activity in T cells was inhibited in vivo by preincubating T cells with FK506, and this resulted in the inhibition of the activation-induced dephosphorylation of NFAT. When rapamycin was added in a 100-fold excess to FK506, the FK506-mediated inhibition of NFATp dephosphorylation was reversed (Fig. 2). Since rapamycin and FK506 bind competitively to FKBP12, but the complex of rapamycin•FKBP12 does not bind to CN(2.Liu J. Farmer J.D.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar), the reversal by rapamycin of FK506-mediated inhibition of the stimulation-induced shift of NFATp supports the involvement of CN in the dephosphorylation of NFATp in vivo. It has previously been demonstrated that the complex of FK506 with its intracellular ligand FKBP12 binds to and inhibits the phosphatase activity of CN in vitro(2.Liu J. Farmer J.D.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). Since we could demonstrate a physical interaction of CN with NFATp, we investigated the effect of the FK506•FKBP12 complex on the association of CN and NFATp in vitro. CaM beads were incubated with purified CN in the presence of FK506 and purified FKBP12 before adding lysates of stimulated or unstimulated T cells. It was observed that once the complex of CN, FKBP12, and FK506 was formed, NFATp from either unactivated or activated T cell lysates could no longer bind to CN (Fig. 2). Interestingly, once NFATp was associated with CN in vitro, the addition of the FK506•FKBP12 complex could not disrupt this interaction. Specifically, NFATp bound to CN/CaM beads could not be “eluted” with FK506•FKBP12 (Fig. 2). In order to assess the specificity of the FK506•FKBP12-mediated inhibition of NFATp to CN, rapamycin was added in 100-fold excess to FK506 during preincubation of CN/CaM beads and GST-FKBP12 with or without FK506. After preincubation, lysates of activated or nonactivated T cells were added, and proteins associated with CN/CaM beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-NFATp, anti-CN (data not shown), or anti-FKBP12 antibodies (Fig. 3). Preincubation of CN/CaM beads with FK506 and FKBP12 (GST-FKBP12) led to the binding of FK506•FKBP12 to CN and the inhibition of the interaction of CN with NFATp. Only the combination of both FKBP12 plus FK506 blocked the binding of NFATp to CN; neither drug nor immunophilin alone had any effect on the association nor did rapamycin•FKBP12. Inhibition by FK506•FKBP12 was mediated by blocking the binding of CN to NFATp and not by disturbing the interaction of CN with CaM, since immunoblots for CN revealed no loss of CN (precipitated via CaM beads) in the presence of FK506•FKBP12 (data not shown). Addition of rapamycin in 100-fold excess to FK506 restored the association of NFATp to CN, thus reversing the effect of FK506•FKBP12 on the CN/NFATp interaction (Fig. 3). Although the presence of FK506 is necessary for optimal binding of FKBP12 to CN some binding of FKBP12 alone to CN/CaM beads was noted. It has been reported that FK506•FKBP12 inhibits the phosphatase activity of CN on protein/peptide substrates but not on small organic substrates such as para-nitrophenyl phosphate(2.Liu J. Farmer J.D.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the complex of FK506•FKBP12 inhibits substrate binding to CN rather than affecting the phosphatase activity of CN. It further implies that the catalytic domain of CN consists of at least two sites: a substrate-binding site and a catalytic site. Our observation that (i) CN binds both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of NFATp and (ii) these interactions are inhibited by FK506•FKBP12 supports the notion that the major interaction of CN with NFATp occurs via the substrate-binding site rather than the catalytic site. The recently solved x-ray crystallographic structure of FK506•FKBP12 bound to CN revealed that the FK506•FKBP12 complex binds to the A-chain of CN at a site approximately 10 Å removed from the catalytic site(27.Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). This structural information is consistent with our data, suggesting that the interaction of NFATp with the catalytic site is not a requirement for binding. Though we were able to demonstrate the binding of NFATp to CN, we could not exclude the possibility of a third protein involved in this interaction. While it has been shown that CsA and FK506 inhibit the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFATp, it has not yet been demonstrated whether the influence of CN on the nuclear translocation of the cytosolic form of NFAT is due to a direct or indirect interaction. In the direct model, CN dephosphorylates NFAT directly, thereby enabling it to cross the nuclear membrane. Thus, the nuclear translocation of the cytoplasmic component of NFAT would be regulated by dephosphorylation, as has been shown for the regulation of the yeast transcription factor SWI5(28.Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 29.Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the indirect model takes into account that all four isoforms of the cytosolic component of NFAT contain a region similar to the Rel homology domain of the NFκB family(14.Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 15.Hoey T. Sun Y.-L. Wiliamson K. Xu X.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has, therefore, been suggested that NFAT in nonactivated T cells might be retained by a cytosolic anchoring protein, in a similar manner as NFκB is retained by IκB(30.Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of the putative anchoring protein by CN would then result in the release of NFAT and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus(31.Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The finding that CN associates with phosphorylated and dephosphorylated NFATp favors a model of a direct interaction of CN with NFATp for the following reasons. (i) It has been demonstrated that dephosphorylated NFATp is able to translocate to the nucleus(19.Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22602-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20.Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In case NFATp is released from a cytosolic anchoring protein after activation it is unlikely that CN associates with NFATp via a cytosolic anchoring protein, since NFATp would already be released. (ii) The known NFκB anchoring proteins, IκBα and IκBβ degrade 10 min and 4 h after stimulation, respectively(32.Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of NFATp takes place 5-10 min after stimulation(19.Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22602-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20.Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), indicating that if NFATp is retained in the cytosol by an IκB-like anchoring protein it must be released from this protein and from CN within 5-10 min. Since we could demonstrate that CN/CaM beads precipitate NFATp from lysates of T cells stimulated for up to 6 h (Fig. 4) it is unlikely that NFATp would still associate with CN via an IκB-like protein. Therefore, our observation of a physical interaction of CN and NFATp, together with the fact that phosphorylated NFATp can serve as a substrate for CN in vitro(21.Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), supports a model in which CN is directly involved in the dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of NFATp.

Described here is the site-specific integration through reciprocal exchange, and subsequent expression, of a selectable marker gene into the genome of the pathogenic, bloodstage forms of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Stable integration of a single copy of the marker gene (retained for more than 70 generations in the absence of drug pressure) into a nontranscribed subtelomeric repeat array of different chromosomes was observed. Expression of the gene within the subtelomeres indicated that the previously recorded absence of transcription in these regions could be due to a corresponding absence of genes rather than active silencing mechanisms."

Analysis of the effect of ISP-1 by flow cytometry revealed that the ISP-1-dependent decrease in cell number was not due to inhibition of the cell cycle progression of CTLL-2 cells but to the induction of apoptosis of the cells. The ISP-1-induced apoptosis was inhibited by the addition of sphingosine (2 μM), suggesting that this ISP-1-induced apoptosis is triggered by the decrease in the intracellular levels of sphingolipids caused by the inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase. However, another interleukin-2-dependent cell line, F7, which was derived from a mouse pro-B cell line, did not show ISP-1-dependent apoptosis, indicating that the effect of ISP-1 may be specific for a certain type of T cell lineage such as CTLL-2. On the other hand, a high dose of sphingosine (5 μM) by itself induced the apoptosis of CTLL-2 cells. This sphingosine-dependent apoptosis was also observed with F7 cells. These results provide evidence that the intracellular levels of sphingolipids play an important role in the signaling of the escape from and onset of apoptosis of CTLL-2 cells.

These results provide evidence that the intracellular levels of sphingolipids play an important role in the signaling of the escape from and onset of apoptosis of CTLL-2 cells. Several lines of evidence have suggested that sphingosines are involved in apoptosis. Exogenously added cell-permeable ceramides induce the apoptosis of U937 human leukemia cells (1.Obeid L.M.

Later, a natural ceramide was shown to induce apoptosis when added as a cell-permeable form in a mixture of dodecane and ethanol(3.Ji L. Zhang G. Umematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and HL-60 human leukemia cells (12.Ohta H. Sweely E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar), and the intracellular level of sphingosine increased in the cases of tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis of human neutrophils (11.Ohta H. Yatomi Y. Sweeney E.A. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and phorbol ester-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells(12.Ohta H. Sweely E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar). A new potent immunosuppressant, ISP-1, is a fungal product that has a structure very similar to that of sphingosine(13.Fujita T. Inoue K. Yamamoto S. Ikumoto T. Sasaki S. Toyama R. Yoneta M. Hoshino Y. Okumoto T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). ISP-1 inhibited the mouse allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction and allo-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte generation in vivo, exhibiting a potency of 10-100-fold greater than that of cyclosporin A, the most widely used immunosuppressant. Unlike cyclosporin A and FK506 (another popular immunosuppressant), ISP-1 did not interfere with IL-2 ( 1The abbreviation used is: ILinterleukin.) production in the mixed lymphocyte reaction(13.Fujita T. Inoue K. Yamamoto S. Ikumoto T. Sasaki S. Toyama R. Yoneta M. Hoshino Y. Okumoto T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), but instead it suppressed the IL-2-dependent growth of the mouse cytotoxic T cell line, CTLL-2(14.Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 211: 396-403Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This suppression is most probably triggered by a reduction of the intracellular levels of sphingolipids due to the inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, i.e. the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA into ketodihydrosphingosine(14.Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 211: 396-403Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar). interleukin. In this paper, we report that the overall growth suppression of CTLL-2 cells by ISP-1 is not due to inhibition of cell proliferation but to the apoptosis of the cells caused by inhibition of the de novo synthesis of sphingosine. This is the first evidence that apoptosis is caused by a reduction in the intracellular levels of sphingolipids. ISP-1 was obtained as described previously (14.Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 211: 396-403Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and stored as a methanol solution at −20°C. Recombinant human IL-2 was kindly provided by Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Tokyo. All other biological reagents were purchased from Sigma. The mouse cytotoxic T cell line, CTLL-2(15.Gillis S. Smith K.A. Nature. 1977; 268: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar), was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The F7 cell line (16.Shibuya H. Yoneyama M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1992; 70: 57-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. T. Taniguchi, Tokyo University, Tokyo. These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 units/ml IL-2. The administration of ISP-1 and sphingosine to the cells was performed as described previously (14.Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 211: 396-403Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 5 × 104 cells in 500 μl of medium in the presence or absence of ISP-1. After incubation for 48 h, the viable cell number was determined by means of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay (17.Miki I. Ishihara N. Otoshi M. Kase H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 164: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The absorbance increased in proportion to the viable cell number, within the range examined in this experiment. Cells were cultured as indicated, harvested, stained with propidium iodide using a Cycle TEST™ PLUS DNA Reagent Kit (Becton Dickinson), and then subjected to flow cytometry with a FACScan™ flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) for measurement of the cell cycle progression and apoptosis. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Selins and Cohen(18.Selins K.S. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3199-3206PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fragmented genomic DNA was extracted by incubating cells in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM EDTA and 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4°C for 10 min. Under these conditions, intact genomic DNA was not extracted. The cell suspension was centrifuged, and the resultant supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of RNase (400 μg/ml) and then for an additional 1 h in the presence of proteinase K (400 μg/ml). The fragmented DNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. For morphological analysis, cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde overnight and then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (160 μM) and then examined under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX 50). Although ISP-1 was demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, i.e. the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA into ketodihydrosphingosine(14.Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 211: 396-403Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar), the mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell growth by ISP-1 was not clear. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism underlying the suppression of CTLL-2 cell growth by ISP-1, the effect of ISP-1 on cell cycle progression was investigated by the flow cytometric method. As shown in Fig. 1B, incubation of the cells in the presence of 47 nM ISP-1 for 48 h did not affect the cell cycle progression of CTLL-2 cells significantly but instead dramatically increased the hypodiploid DNA peaks, which are commonly found in apoptosis(19.Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the cells were indeed in the process of apoptosis, the chromosomal DNA profiles were investigated. As shown in Fig. 2A, lane 2, genomic DNA obtained from ISP-1-treated cells gave a ladder on agarose gel electrophoresis, which is a characteristic of apoptosis-specific internucleosomal DNA fragmentation(20.Gunji H. Hass R. Kufe D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), while this fragmentation was not seen in mock-treated cells (lane 1). Further confirmation of apoptosis was the morphological changes of nuclei detected in ISP-1-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, ISP-1-treated CTLL-2 cells showed morphological changes typical of apoptosis including condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei revealed upon DNA staining with Hoechst 33342. All these results indicated that the ISP-1-dependent decrease in the number of CTLL-2 cells was not due to inhibition of the proliferation of CTLL-2 cells but to the acceleration of cell death by apoptosis.Figure 2:Agarose gel electrophoresis of the fragmented DNA from CTLL-2 cells. A, CTLL-2 cells were cultured for 48 h with the methanol vehicle (lane 1) or 47 nM ISP-1 (lane 2).

As shown in Fig. 1C, upon the addition of sphingosine (2 μM) to the incubation medium containing 47 nM ISP-1, the hypodiploid DNA peaks disappeared almost completely, which is in good agreement with the almost 100% recovery of cell proliferation with the same treatment previously reported(14.Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 211: 396-403Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar), suggesting again that the inhibition of cell growth by ISP-1 is caused by the progression of apoptosis due to the reagent. The ability of sphingosine to counteract the effect of ISP-1 is stereoselective and cannot be mimicked by dimethylsphingosine(14.Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 211: 396-403Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar); therefore, it is unlikely to be due to inhibition of protein kinase C, which does not show this structural selectivity(21.Merrill A.H. Nimkar S. Menaldino D. Hannun Y.A. Loomis C. Bell R.M. Tyagi S.R. Lambeth D. Stevens V.L. Hunter R. Liotta D.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 22.Khan W.A. Dobrowsky R. Touny S. Hannun Y.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5385-5389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that exogenously added sphingosines did not function as inhibitors of protein kinase C and that ISP-1-induced apoptosis of CTLL-2 cells was triggered by the decrease in the intracellular levels of sphingolipids due to inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase. The chemical nature of the downstream effector that is directly involved in apoptosis has not yet been identified. However, Fumonisin B1, which inhibits the conversion of sphingosine to ceramide(24.Schroeder J.J. Crane H.M. Xia J. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3475-3481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not inhibit the effect of exogenously added sphingosine on the ISP-1 action (14.Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 211: 396-403Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar), suggesting that ceramide is not the downstream effector and that sphingosine derivatives with a free amino group such as sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate are possible candidates. Incidentally, it was reported that exogenously added sphingosine itself induced apoptosis in human neutrophils (11.Ohta H. Yatomi Y. Sweeney E.A. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (12.Ohta H. Sweely E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar) when it was administered at a high concentration of 5-10 μM. This was also true for CTLL-2 cells, as shown in Fig. 1D. Taken together, these results suggest that both hypo- and hyperintracellular levels of sphingolipids induced apoptosis of CTLL-2 cells and that the maintenance of the proper levels of these compounds is critically important for the cells to escape from apoptosis. It is also of interest to note that the sphingosine-induced DNA fragmentation was observed within 6 h after the addition of sphingosine (data not shown), while the ISP-1-induced DNA fragmentation was delayed requiring more than 32 h to occur (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that these two types of apoptosis caused by unusually low and high intracellular levels of sphingolipids took place through distinct biochemical pathways, respectively. The ISP-1-induced apoptosis seemed to occur following one or more cell divisions (data not shown). This type of apoptosis was also reported for hematopoietic cell lines that had been exposed to an equitoxic dose of γ-irradiation and was designated as “delayed mitotic death”(25.Radford I.R. Murphy T.K. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26.Tauchi H. Sawada S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ISP-1 inhibits the proliferation of CTLL-2 cells and mouse splenic lymphocytes induced by allogenic antigen stimulation(13.Fujita T. Inoue K. Yamamoto S. Ikumoto T. Sasaki S. Toyama R. Yoneta M. Hoshino Y. Okumoto T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In both cases IL-2 is responsible for their proliferation as the major growth factor. These results prompted us to suspect a direct linkage between the signal transduction through the IL-2 receptor and the function of ISP-1. In order to test this hypothesis, the effect of ISP-1 on the apoptosis of another IL-2-dependent cell line, F7, which was derived from BAF-B03 cells, and acquired IL-2 dependence through the introduction of mouse IL-2 receptor β subunit cDNA (16.Shibuya H. Yoneyama M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1992; 70: 57-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was studied. However, unlike CTLL-2 cells, F7 cells did not show apoptosis in response to ISP-1, although a high concentration of sphingosine induced the apoptosis of F7 cells (see Fig. 4C). Furthermore, when CTLL-2 cells were cultured in the presence IL-4 instead of IL-2, ISP-1 also induced the apoptosis of CTLL-2 cells (data not shown). These results indicated that there is no one-to-one direct relationship between the signal transduction through the IL-2 receptor and the function of ISP-1. However, the possibility that F7 cells have a specific ability to incorporate sphingolipids from the fetal calf serum in the culture medium could not be ruled out. Since the proliferation of stimulated T-lymphocytes was inhibited by ISP-1(14.Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 211: 396-403Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar), we then tried to identify the type of cells that is susceptible to ISP-1. When mouse splenic T cells were stimulated with concanavalin A in the presence or absence of ISP-1, CD4-negative and CD8-positive cells were much more sensitive to ISP-1 than CD4-positive and CD8-negative cells (data not shown). Taken together, ISP-1-induced apoptosis is not specific for IL-2-dependent cells but may be a characteristic of a CD8-positive and CD4-negative cytotoxic T cell lineage. In sharp contrast to the cell type-specific expression of ISP-1-induced apoptosis, sphingosine-induced apoptosis is observed in many cell types, including Chinese hamster ovary cells(27.Stevens V.L. Owens N.E. Winton E.F. Kinkade J.M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1051: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), human neutrophils (11.Ohta H. Yatomi Y. Sweeney E.A. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and HL-60 cells(12.Ohta H. Sweely E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the CTLL-2 and F7 cells examined in this study. The effect of sphingosine may be associated with the protein kinase C inhibitory activity of sphingosine(27.Stevens V.L. Owens N.E. Winton E.F. Kinkade J.M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1051: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), because dimethylsphingosine, which is also a protein kinase C inhibitor, induced the apoptosis of CTLL-2 cells (data not shown), as reported in human neutrophils (11.Ohta H. Yatomi Y. Sweeney E.A. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and HL-60 cells(12.Ohta H. Sweely E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar). However, the detail mechanism of the involvement of protein kinase C in the sphingosine-induced apoptosis remains to be elucidated.

FGFR-4 was phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro mainly on serine and threonine residues in several peptides and to a lower degree on tyrosine residues. When analyzed further by in-gel kinase assay, immunoprecipitates of ligand-activated FGFR-4 contained a serine autophosphorylated polypeptide doublet of 85 kDa. Analysis of the major autophosphorylation site Y754F mutant of FGFR-4 showed that binding of p85 and its serine phosphorylation were independent of receptor autophosphorylation at this site. Okadaic acid treatment increased the basal autophosphorylation activity of p85 but decreased FGFR-4 tyrosine phosphorylation.

Alternative splicing of transcripts generates further FGFR variants, which differ in their ligand binding capacities. Stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors by their ligands leads to activation of the receptors and consequent phosphorylation of specific tyrosyl residues of the cytoplasmic domain. However, FGFR-4 tyrosine autophosphorylation is substantially weaker than that of the other FGF receptors in stimulated cells(4.Wang J.-K. Gao G. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell.

In contrast to PLC-γ, several signaling molecules have been shown not to interact with FGF receptors. These include SHC, Grb2, Ras GTPase-activating protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and SYP(4.Wang J.-K. Gao G. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell.

Recently, it was reported that a novel 89-kDa protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated in FGF-2-stimulated FGFR-1-expressing cells and binds to Grb2(11.Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It was suggested that p89 couples activated FGFR-1 to the Ras pathway. In this report we have characterized the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of FGFR-4 and show that this receptor associates with a putative novel 85-kDa polypeptide having serine kinase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Altered Sites mutagenesis system (Promega). The EcoRI-HindIII cDNA insert of the expression vector pLTR-FGFR-4 (12.Vainikka S. Partanen J. Bellosta P. Coulier F. Basilico C. Jaye M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) encoding the full-length human FGFR-4 was subcloned to the pAlter vector. Point mutations that changed tyrosine 754 to phenylalanine and lysine 503 to alanine were introduced using the oligonucleotides 5′-gtc tct gag gag ttc ctc gac ctc cgc-3′ and 5′-gtc ttt gag cat cgc gac ggc cac agt gc-3′, respectively. The mutated cDNAs were then transferred back into the LTRpoly expression vector and confirmed by sequencing. Transfected L6 rat myoblasts and NIH3T3 cells (5.Vainikka S. Joukov V. Wennström S.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. Cells were transfected using the lipofection method (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim), and clones positive for wild type (WT) and mutant FGFR-4 were selected as described (5.Vainikka S. Joukov V. Wennström S. Bergman M. Pelicci P.G. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18320-18326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum against FGFR-4 has been described previously(12.Vainikka S. Partanen J. Bellosta P. Coulier F. Basilico C. Jaye M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Cells were starved for 2 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then stimulated for 10 min with 50 ng/ml aFGF. When indicated, the cells were treated prior to stimulation for 30 min with 200 μM sodium orthovanadate or for 2 h with 1 μM okadaic acid, washed with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, scraped from the plates, and lysed on ice for 15 min in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 5.5 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated for 2 h to overnight on ice with specific antisera against FGFR-4. The immune complexes were then absorbed to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using antibodies against phosphotyrosine or FGFR-4. Before reprobing, the filters were treated for 30 min at 50°C in stripping buffer (100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) with occasional agitation. Cells were labeled for 4-5 h in phosphate-free minimum Eagle's medium, supplemented with 1-1.5 mCi/ml [32P]PO4. After aFGF stimulation for 10 min, immunoprecipitation was carried out as described. The proteins were resolved in 7.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose filter. The immunoprecipitations were performed as described, followed by two washes in kinase buffer. For the kinase reaction immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1-3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30°C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer and analyzed in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and the gels or their blotted nitrocellulose replicas were subjected to autoradiography. After autoradiography, the regions of the phosphorylated bands were cut out and soaked in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone K 30 in 0.6% acetic acid at 37°C for 30 min. The pieces of filter were then washed three times with water, 200 μl of freshly made 50 mM NH4HCO3 containing 5 μg of proteinase K was added, and digestion was carried out at 37°C overnight. Digestions and washings of the filters were pooled, lyophilized, dissolved in 400 μl of water, lyophilized again, and subjected to partial hydrolysis according to Boyle et al.(13.Boyle W. van-deer-Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, the washed filters were incubated overnight in 50 mM NH4HCO3 containing 5 μg/ml sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). The supernatants were dried, oxidized in 50 μl of 50 mM performic acid for 1 h, diluted with 500 μl of water, frozen, dried, dissolved in 50 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3, sonicated in a water bath for 10 min, and subjected to overnight digestion with 5 μg/ml trypsin. After the second trypsin digestion, 140 μl of electrophoresis buffer was added, and samples were dried and dissolved again in 7 μl of electrophoresis buffer. Two-dimensional cellulose thin layer analysis was performed according to Boyle et al.(13.Boyle W. van-deer-Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) using the pH 1.9 buffer for electrophoresis and isobutyric acid buffer for chromatography. The chromatography plates were analyzed in a Fuji BAS 1000 Bio-Imager. Kinase immunoprecipitates were incubated in 5 μl of reaction mixture containing 1 mg/ml poly(Glu-Tyr), 3 μM ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32]ATP, 1 μl of 5 × kinase buffer, and 0.2 μl of H2O. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding 4 mM ATP, 40 μM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Two aliquots were spotted to pieces of Whatman filter paper, which were washed in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, 8% Na3VO4 for 15 min, 3-4 times for 15 min each in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and twice in ethanol, dried, and subjected to scintillation counting. In-gel kinase assays were performed basically as described by Hibi et al.(14.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was washed twice for 30 min with 20% isopropyl alcohol, 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 to remove SDS. The gel was then washed twice for 30 min with buffer 1 containing 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol and incubated further in 6 M urea in buffer 1, followed by successive incubations in buffer 1 containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3, 1.5, or 0.75 M urea for 45 min. After washing with buffer 1 containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h, the gel was washed with kinase buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 mM MnCl2. The gel was then incubated for 30 min in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi/ml [γ-32]ATP and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate several times, followed by fixation, drying, and autoradiography. The phosphoamino acid analysis was done as described in (15.Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. Bornstein P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the phosphorylation of FGFR-4 in vivo, we carried out two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of FGFR-4 immunoprecipitated from transfected, [32P]PO4-labeled L6 cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that the phosphoserine to phosphotyrosine ratio of the ligand-stimulated FGFR-4 was about 20:1. As can be seen from comparison of the in vivo phosphopeptide maps shown in Fig. 1, A and B, aFGF stimulation caused an increased phosphorylation of at least four peptides (a, b, e, and f). In addition, there were two constitutively phosphorylated peptides (c and d). Phosphoserine was the major phosphoamino acid residue obtained when the major peptides b, c, d, e, and f were analyzed (data not shown). Spot a corresponds to one of the major in vitro autophosphorylation sites of the receptor (Fig. 1D). The phosphorylation of this site was abolished when the tyrosine 754 was mutated to phenylalanine (Fig. 1E). When cells expressing FGFR-4 were treated with the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase inhibitor, 200 μM orthovanadate, for 30 min prior to ligand stimulation, FGFR-4 tyrosyl phosphorylation assessed by anti-Tyr(P) Western blotting was increased 2-3-fold (Fig. 2A, upper panel). This suggested that the weak tyrosyl phosphorylation of FGFR-4 in comparison with serine phosphorylation was due to tyrosyl phosphatase activity. However, when the cells were first treated for 2 h with 1 μM okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase types 1 and 2A, and then stimulated with ligand, tyrosyl phosphorylation of FGFR-4 was decreased (Fig. 2A). Neither orthovanadate nor okadaic acid inhibited FGFR-4 kinase activity substantially in vitro (Fig. 2B). FGFR-4 phosphorylated by in vitro kinase assay showed a phosphoserine:phosphothreonine:phosphotyrosine ratio of about 2:2:1 (Fig. 3A). To test if the tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR-4 is needed for its serine/threonine phosphorylation in vitro, lysine 503 in FGFR-4, which is critical for ATP binding, was mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. As can be seen from Fig. 3B, this mutant (K503A), expressed in NIH3T3 or L6 cells, had no kinase activity when poly(Glu-Tyr) was used as the substrate. In in vitro kinase assays, the immunoprecipitated WT receptor was prominently phosphorylated, but no phosphorylation of the K503A mutant was detected (Fig. 3A). Thus, the tyrosine kinase catalytic activity of FGFR-4 is required also for its serine/threonine phosphorylation in vitro, suggesting that a serine/threonine kinase coprecipitates with FGFR-4. Our preliminary results indicate that NIH3T3 cells transfected with the K503A mutant show decreased DNA synthesis when stimulated with aFGF, suggesting that the K503A mutant functions as a dominant negative receptor. ( 2S. Vainikka, V. Joukov, P. Klint, and K. Alitalo, unpublished results.) The association of FGFR-4 with a putative serine kinase was further analyzed by in-gel kinase assay. Immunoprecipitates of unstimulated and aFGF-stimulated WT and K503A FGFR-4 from L6 cells were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE, followed by renaturation of the gel and incubation with [γ-32P]ATP. In this analysis, an autophosphorylated doublet of 85 kDa (referred hereafter as p85) was detected in immunoprecipitates of aFGF-stimulated L6 cells expressing WT receptor but not from cells expressing the K503A mutant (Fig. 4A). FGFR-4 was not detected in the in-gel kinase assay, probably because in contrast to many serine/threonine kinases, the activity of tyrosine kinases is easily lost during the assay(16.Hutchcroft J. Anostario Jr., M. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When the in-gel phosphorylated polypeptides were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis, autophosphorylation of p85 was detected only on serine residues (Fig. 4B). As can be seen from Fig. 4C, also FGFR-4 immunoprecipitated from transfected NIH3T3 cells associated with ligand-activated p85 kinase. Similar results were obtained when the previously described phosphorylation mutant Y754F (5.Vainikka S. Joukov V. Wennström S. Bergman M. Pelicci P.G. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18320-18326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was analyzed. These results show that the association of FGFR-4 and p85 kinase occurs at least in two different cell types and this association is not mediated by the previously described autophosphorylation site, Tyr-754. In many cases, phosphorylation is a mechanism to regulate kinase activities. Since p85 was autophosphorylated on serine residues in response to FGFR-4 stimulation, we wanted to see if serine phosphorylation has an effect on its activity. Prior to ligand stimulation, receptor-expressing NIH3T3 cells were treated with 1 μM okadaic acid and FGFR-4 immunoprecipitates were analyzed for p85 autophosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 5, okadaic acid treatment increased the activity of p85 to the level induced by ligand stimulation. However, the activity of p85 was not further increased by aFGF stimulation in the okadaic acid-treated cells. In the present study we have obtained evidence that a serine kinase is associated with FGFR-4. The receptor itself is prominently serine-phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro; a 85-kDa polypeptide having serine kinase activity associates with the receptor, and in vitro autophosphorylation of this p85 protein is induced by FGFR-4 activation. These conclusions are based on in vivo labeling results as well as on in vitro kinase reactions done either directly with FGFR-4 immunocomplexes or after SDS-PAGE. The low tyrosine/serine phosphorylation ratio of FGFR-4 was altered in favor of phosphotyrosine, when cells were treated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthophosphate. Thus, tyrosine phosphatases are at least partly responsible for the weak tyrosine phosphorylation detected. After treatment with the serine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, the tyrosine phosphorylation or FGFR-4 was decreased. However, the receptor was still prominently autophosphorylated in vitro. This suggests that the activity of the tyrosine kinase was not substantially altered and that the decrease of FGFR-4 tyrosine phosphorylation is caused by an inhibition of the turnover of serine phosphorylation. The in-gel kinase assay showed that FGFR-4 associates with a 85-kDa serine kinase. The autophosphorylation activity of p85 was clearly increased when FGFR-4 was stimulated with aFGF, but no such stimulation was seen associated with the kinase-deficient FGFR-4 mutant. Thus, stimulation of FGFR-4 causes the activation of p85 in the system used. However, when cells were treated with okadaic acid, the activity of p85 was increased to the level seen after aFGF stimulation. This shows that serine phosphorylation also apparently regulates the activity of the p85 kinase. It is thus possible that after aFGF stimulation, serine autophosphorylation or tyrosine phosphorylation by FGFR-4 increases the activity of p85. We have previously shown that a tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 85 kDa is detected in FGFR-4 immunoprecipitates from L6 cells(5.Vainikka S. Joukov V. Wennström S. Bergman M. Pelicci P.G. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18320-18326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A very weakly labeled polypeptide of similar mobility is also evident in FGFR-4 immunoprecipitates from cells metabolically labeled with [32P]PO4. However, without specific antisera or molecular cloning it is not possible to establish whether the tyrosine-phosphorylated 85-kDa band is the p85 serine kinase. The C-terminal tyrosine residue Tyr-766 has been previously reported as the major in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation site of FGFR-1 and when phosphorylated, it forms the binding site for PLC-γ(7.Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubistein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This tyrosine residue is conserved within the FGF receptor family, and mutation of this site abolishes most of FGFR-4 autophosphorylation and all detectable PLC-γ binding(5.Vainikka S. Joukov V. Wennström S. Bergman M. Pelicci P.G. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18320-18326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the tyrosine residue Tyr-754 of FGFR-4 is the only reported in vivo phosphorylation site thus far. Therefore, we analyzed if phosphorylation of this site is required for the association of FGFR-4 and p85. The in-gel kinase assay showed that the ligand-stimulated Y754F mutant and WT FGFR-4 induced equally well the autophosphorylation of p85, indicating that phosphorylation of Tyr-754 is not critical for the association. This suggests that the association involves some other tyrosine residue or is mediated by mechanisms where increased receptor tyrosine phosphorylation is not critical. The hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR-4 is not critical for its association with p85 is further supported by the result that p85 activity was detected in immunoprecipitates of unstimulated FGFR-4 after okadaic acid treatment. It has been reported that FGFR-1 activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of a 89-kDa protein and to complex formation between this p89 and the Grb2 docking protein(11.Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). p89 and p85 reported here are distinct proteins, since no autophosphorylation activity was associated with p89.2 It also has been recently shown that a serine/threonine kinase, protein kinase B/Rac, is activated upon basic FGF stimulation in Rat-1 cells. However, it was concluded that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was essential for protein kinase B activation by platelet-derived growth factor and insulin(17.Boudewijn M. Burgering T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 18.Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that the differential signal transduction mechanisms of FGFR-4 involve a serine kinase differing from protein kinase B in molecular weight and properties. The characterization of this kinase will be an important task for further studies.
