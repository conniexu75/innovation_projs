https://openalex.org/W2119744638,"Human activities are releasing tiny particles (aerosols) into the atmosphere. These human-made aerosols enhance scattering and absorption of solar radiation. They also produce brighter clouds that are less efficient at releasing precipitation. These in turn lead to large reductions in the amount of solar irradiance reaching Earth's surface, a corresponding increase in solar heating of the atmosphere, changes in the atmospheric temperature structure, suppression of rainfall, and less efficient removal of pollutants. These aerosol effects can lead to a weaker hydrological cycle, which connects directly to availability and quality of fresh water, a major environmental issue of the 21st century."
https://openalex.org/W1990899433,"Surface winds and surface ocean hydrography in the subpolar North Atlantic appear to have been influenced by variations in solar output through the entire Holocene. The evidence comes from a close correlation between inferred changes in production rates of the cosmogenic nuclides carbon-14 and beryllium-10 and centennial to millennial time scale changes in proxies of drift ice measured in deep-sea sediment cores. A solar forcing mechanism therefore may underlie at least the Holocene segment of the North Atlantic's ""1500-year"" cycle. The surface hydrographic changes may have affected production of North Atlantic Deep Water, potentially providing an additional mechanism for amplifying the solar signals and transmitting them globally."
https://openalex.org/W2117268230,"The adverse metabolic consequences of obesity are best predicted by the quantity of visceral fat. Excess glucocorticoids produce visceral obesity and diabetes, but circulating glucocorticoid levels are normal in typical obesity. Glucocorticoids can be produced locally from inactive 11-keto forms through the enzyme 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta HSD-1). We created transgenic mice overexpressing 11beta HSD-1 selectively in adipose tissue to an extent similar to that found in adipose tissue from obese humans. These mice had increased adipose levels of corticosterone and developed visceral obesity that was exaggerated by a high-fat diet. The mice also exhibited pronounced insulin-resistant diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and, surprisingly, hyperphagia despite hyperleptinemia. Increased adipocyte 11beta HSD-1 activity may be a common molecular etiology for visceral obesity and the metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2024121049,"The mouse small intestinal epithelium consists of four principal cell types deriving from one multipotent stem cell: enterocytes, goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells. Previous studies showed that Math1 , a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is expressed in the gut. We find that loss of Math1 leads to depletion of goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells without affecting enterocytes. Colocalization of Math1 with Ki-67 in some proliferating cells suggests that secretory cells (goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells) arise from a common progenitor that expresses Math1 , whereas absorptive cells (enterocytes) arise from a progenitor that is Math1 -independent. The continuous rapid renewal of these cells makes the intestinal epithelium a model system for the study of stem cell regeneration and lineage commitment."
https://openalex.org/W1993341938,"We examine the climate response to solar irradiance changes between the late 17th-century Maunder Minimum and the late 18th century. Global average temperature changes are small (about 0.3° to 0.4°C) in both a climate model and empirical reconstructions. However, regional temperature changes are quite large. In the model, these occur primarily through a forced shift toward the low index state of the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation as solar irradiance decreases. This leads to colder temperatures over the Northern Hemisphere continents, especially in winter (1° to 2°C), in agreement with historical records and proxy data for surface temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2119471783,"A recent assertion that new neurons are continually added to the neocortex of adult macaque monkeys has profound implications for understanding the cellular mechanisms of higher cognitive functions. Here we searched for neurogenesis in adult macaques by using immunofluorescent triple labeling for the DNA-replication indicator, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and neuronal and glial cell markers. Although numerous BrdU-labeled cells were distributed throughout the cerebral wall, including the neocortex, these were identified as nonneuronal cells; evidence for newly generated neurons was limited to the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Thus, our results do not substantiate the claim of neurogenesis in normal adult primate neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2012657759,"Dendritic cell specific intracellular adhesion molecule–3 (ICAM-3) grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin present on the surface of dendritic cells, mediates the initial interaction of dendritic cells with T cells by binding to ICAM-3. DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, a related receptor found on the endothelium of liver sinusoids, placental capillaries, and lymph nodes, bind to oligosaccharides that are present on the envelope of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), an interaction that strongly promotes viral infection of T cells. Crystal structures of carbohydrate-recognition domains of DC-SIGN and of DC-SIGNR bound to oligosaccharide, in combination with binding studies, reveal that these receptors selectively recognize endogenous high-mannose oligosaccharides and may represent a new avenue for developing HIV prophylactics."

Our initial report on mice lacking caveolin-1 (Cav-1) demonstrated a loss of caveolae and perturbations in endothelial cell function. More recently, however, observation of the Cav-1-deficient cohorts into old age revealed significantly lower body weights, as compared with wild-type controls. These results suggest that Cav-1 null mice may have problems with lipid metabolism and/or adipocyte functioning. To test this hypothesis directly, we placed a cohort of wild-type and Cav-1 null mice on a high fat diet. Interestingly, despite being hyperphagic, Cav-1 null mice show overt resistance to diet-induced obesity. As predicted, adipocytes from Cav-1 null null mice lack caveolae membranes. Early on, a lack of caveolin-1 selectively affects only the female mammary gland fat pad and results in a near complete ablation of the hypo-dermal fat layer. There are also indications of generalized adipose tissue pathology. With increasing age, a systemic decompensation in lipid accumulation occurs resulting in dramatically smaller fat pads, histologically reduced adipocyte cell diameter, and a poorly differentiated/hypercellular white adipose parenchyma. To gain mechanistic insights into this phenotype, we show that, although serum insulin, glucose, and cholesterol levels are entirely normal, Cav-1 null mice have severely elevated triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, especially in the post-prandial state. However, this build-up of triglyceride-rich chylomicrons/very low density lipoproteins is not due to perturbed lipoprotein lipase activity, a major culprit of isolated hypertriglyceridemia. The lean body phenotype and metabolic defects observed in Cav-1 null mice are consistent with the previously proposed functions of caveolin-1 and caveolae in adipocytes. Our results show for the first time a clear role for caveolins in systemic lipid homeostasis in vivo and place caveolin-1/caveolae as major factors in hyperlipidemias and obesity.

As early as the 1950s, at the incipience of ultrastructural cell biology, caveolae were readily observable and morphologically distinct organelles described on the surface of epithelial/endothelial cells (1Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 2Palade G.E. J. Appl. Phys. 1953; 24: 1424-1436Google Scholar). Although a profile of the tissue distribution of caveolae has never been reported, a compilation of various reports to date arrives at one main conclusion: two tissue types have an extremely high abundance of these structures in vivo, adipose tissue (due to the adipocytes) and lung tissue (due to endothelial cells and type I pneumocytes). Based purely on ultrastructural comparisons, the adipocyte seems to have higher concentrations of caveolae than any other cell. Indeed, electron micrographs of adipocytes dating back to 1963 show that caveolae account for ∼ 30% of the surface area of the adipocyte plasma membrane (3Napolitano L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 18: 663-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 4Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.-L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in 3T3-L1 cells, a widely used model system for studying adipogenesis, the number of caveolae increases ∼10-fold during adipocyte differentiation as compared with the undifferentiated fibroblastic state (4Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.-L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important advance in the study of caveolae was the discovery that caveolin-1 (Cav-1)1 is a marker protein for caveolae organelles and that Cav-1 plays an intricate role in caveolar functioning (5Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Research in the past decade has shown that caveolae are specialized membrane microdomains formed as a result of the localized accumulation of cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and caveolin-1 (6Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 7Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1, an integral membrane protein that can directly bind cholesterol, most likely plays a major role in the invagination of caveolae from the plasma membrane proper, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. Although the function of caveolae and caveolins in vivoremains controversial, they have been implicated in endocytosis/transcytosis, cholesterol transport/efflux, regulation of signal transduction, and tumorigenesis (reviewed in Ref. 9Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). True to its description as a “marker of caveolae,” examination of caveolin-1 transcripts and protein levels in a panel of mouse tissues reveals that the two highest expressing tissues are adipose tissue and lung tissue (an endothelial-rich organ) (10Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Also, concomitant with a ∼10-fold increased number of caveolae in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the levels of caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression increase ∼20-fold during differentiation from the fibroblastic to the adipocyte phenotype (10Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). There are possible functional consequences for such high caveolin expression in adipocytes. Photoaffinity labeling has identified caveolin-1 as a major plasma membrane fatty-acid binding protein in adipocytes (11Gerber G.E. Mangroo D. Trigatti B.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 123: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Trigatti B.L. Anderson R.G. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolin-1 moves from the plasma membrane to lipid droplets in response to free fatty acids (13Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Ostermeyer A.G. Paci J.M. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Munro S. Brown D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As such, caveolin-1 is the first known integral membrane protein component of lipid droplets. Based on these studies, it has been proposed that caveolin-1 functions in the transport and/or storage of free fatty acids/triglycerides in lipid droplets. However, no functional data has been presented to support this hypothesis. We and others have recently reported the generation and initial characterization of mice with a disrupted Cav-1 locus. Although these mice are viable and fertile, they show a hyperproliferative lung phenotype and vascular abnormalities due to aberrant endothelial cell function (15Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B.

Perhaps surprisingly, despite the high expression of caveolin-1 in adipose tissue, we and others did not detect any abnormalities on routine histology of abdominal adipose tissue (15Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Di Pestell R.G. Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Knietz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

However, follow-up of these mice till 1 year of age revealed significant differences in body weight, i.e. Cav-1 null mice were smaller than their wild-type counterparts. We now report a detailed analysis of this phenotype with the intriguing finding that a deficiency in caveolin-1 causes a gradual decompensation in several adipose tissues and imparts resistance to diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, we find that these mice have de-ranged metabolism of triglycerides and free fatty acids, thereby implicating caveolae and caveolins for the first time as important factors in lipid homeostasis and obesity.

The strategy used to target the caveolin-1 locus and generate Cav-1 null mice was as previously described (15Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F.

All animals used in these studies (mice homozygous null for the caveolin-1 gene and their wild-type littermates) were of a C57BL/6 × sv129 genetic background and were genotyped by PCR, as previously described (15Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Di Pestell R.G. Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Knietz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Housing and maintenance was provided by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine barrier facility; mice were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle and, except where noted, had ad libitum access to chow (Picolab 20, PMI Nutrition International) and water. All animal protocols used in this study were pre-approved by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institute for Animal Studies. Freshly dissected tissue samples were washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline and either snap-frozen in liquid N2 or immediately homogenized with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 50 mm NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; 60 mm octyl glucoside) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA reagent (Pierce), and the volume required for 10 μg of protein was determined. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (to visualize protein bands) followed by immunoblot analysis. All subsequent wash buffers contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, which was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) for the blocking solution and 1% bovine serum albumin for the antibody diluent. Primary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Pierce) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies with the Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Adipose tissue samples (derived from subcutaneous, peri-epididymal, and peri-renal fat depots) were minced with a razor blade into ∼1 mm2 × 1-cm-long strips fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 m cacodylate, post-fixed with OsO4, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. A cryotome was used to yield sections of 1-μm thickness, and the samples were examined under a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope and photographed at ×16,000 magnification (20Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z.-L. Hermanoski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.-H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Caveolae were identified by their characteristic flask shape, size (50–100 nm), and location at or near the plasma membrane. A cohort of mice (composed of Cav-1(+/+) and Cav-1(−/−) mice) was generated by heterozygous inter-breedings, some of which were placed on a high fat diet (59% of calories derived from fat, Research Diets, D12492), while others were placed on the equivalent chow diet (10% of calories derived from fat, Research Diets, D12450B) (see Fig. 2 A). The diet study was begun upon weaning (3 weeks of age) and continued up to 45 weeks of age. All images were obtained using a 9.4-Tesla magnet (GE Omega vertical wide bore system). Mice were first anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (0.1 ml per 20 g of body weight). To quantitatively assess whole-body fat and water, each mouse was subjected to a 16-scan pulse-acquire sequence in a 40-mm 1H coil, and spectra, including the water and fat peaks, were obtained. For imaging, eight slices of 2-mm thickness spanning the whole body were obtained. Imaging was conducted using a 35-mm 1H coil and a routine spin-echo pulse sequence (18-ms echo time, 600-ms repetition time, and 4-signal averaging per scan). The indicated Cav-1(+/+) or (−/−) mice cohorts were sacrificed at an early age (3 months, when there were insignificant weight differences between wild-type and knockout mice) or at an older age (9 months, when diet-induced weight differences were statistically significant). Several tissues, including the significant white adipose depots (subcutaneous/mammary gland 4, peri-uterine/peri-epididymal, peri-renal/retroperitoneal), the scapular brown adipose depots (inter-scapular and sub-scapular), and the liver were dissected and weighed. For routine histology, similar areas from all tissues were chosen, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All photographs were taken with a Zeiss digital imaging system. VO2, VCO2, body heat, and movements were measured from mice housed individually in Oxymax metabolic chambers (Columbus Instruments) with an air flow of 0.65 liter/min. Measurements were made every 12 min for a 24-h period. Total VO2 (ml/kg/h), VCO2(ml/kg/h), and body heat (kcal/h) are the mean of all measurements made during the 24-h period. Total movements are a tally of the number of times the motion sensors detected movement during the 24-h period. Resting VO2, VCO2, and body heat are the mean of all measurements made during times when mouse movement was limited to <20 per each 12-min measuring period. Respiratory quotient is the ratio of VCO2 to VO2. Mice were placed in individual cages with ad libitum access to both food and water. Food weight was measured, and stool samples were collected daily for a period of 8 days. To collect fresh stools and account for spilled food, cage beddings were changed daily. The fat content of the collected stools was determined as follows: samples (25 mg from each mouse) were ground to a powder form by mortar and pestle and extracted three times with absolute ethanol at 90 °C under reflux. The extracts were dried under a stream of N2 and resuspended in 50% ethanol, and triglyceride content was measured colorimetrically (Sigma). Mouse plasma was drawn from the tail vein and decanted directly into heparinized capillary tubes (Fisher Scientific). Where indicated, fasting blood samples were collected at 7:00 a.m., 12 h after removal of the food, and post-prandial blood samples were collected at 12:00 a.m., 3 h after the beginning of the room's dark cycle. Glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels were measured with standard enzymatic colorimetric assays (Sigma and Wako Biochemicals). Insulin and leptin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (Linco Research), whereas ACRP30 levels were determined by quantitative immunoblotting with an anti-ACRP30 pAb, as we described previously (21Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). For lipoprotein fractionation, plasma samples from 10 mice of the same genotype (150 μl of total plasma) were separated by gel filtration chromatography using two Superose 6HR 10/30 columns in tandem (Amersham Biosciences). A series of 0.5-ml fractions corresponding to the migration of known lipoproteins were collected and subjected to the colorimetric cholesterol and triglyceride assays indicated above. Weight-matched mice were fasted for 8 h before being gavaged with 0.5 ml of olive oil. Blood was collected via the tail vein at baseline and for the indicated times. Due to a rapid initial rise in plasma triglycerides and a slower clearance, blood collection frequency was begun at every 20 min and was gradually tapered over the 24-h time course. Triglycerides were measured with a colorimetric assay (Sigma). Lipase activity was determined essentially as previously described, with minor modifications (22Merkel M. Kako Y. Radner H. Cho I.S. Ramasamy R. Brunzell J.D. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Heparin (1.5 units/g, Sigma) was injected by tail vein, and blood was collected 5 min later from the retro-orbital plexus (control wild-type and knockout mice were injected with saline). A triglyceride emulsion composed of3H-labeled triolein (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cold triolein (Sigma) was prepared, as previously described (23Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 12.5 μl of plasma was incubated with the emulsion in the presence or absence of 1.5 m NaCl (a measure of hepatic lipase and total lipase activity, respectively), and the freely released [3H]oleic acid was measured by scintillation counter. The difference between the two lipase activities above yields the measurable lipoprotein lipase activity. All results are presented as mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of the data was determined via the two-tailed Student's t test using Microsoft Excel. Targeted disruption of exons 1 and 2 of the caveolin-1 locus produces a null mutation (15Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Di Pestell R.G. Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Knietz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38121-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of peri-gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT), one of the sites of highest caveolin expression in the mouse, verified that caveolin-1 expression is ablated in the caveolin-1 knockout animals (Fig.1 A). It should also be noted that, in adipose tissue, the heterozygote mice have nearly the same levels of caveolin as wild-types, indicating that loss of one allele is compensated for by the other. To assess the state of adipocytes ultrastructurally, we also performed transmission electron microscopy on the peri-gonadal WAT. Fig. 1 B shows the characteristically marginalized cytoplasm of the Cav-1(+/+) adipocyte and the extremely high number of plasma membrane-associated and invaginated caveolae (see arrows). In contrast, Cav-1 null adipocytes display barren membrane architecture (loss of caveolae), but interestingly have no other overt structural abnormalities. In our follow-up of the progressively older Cav-1 null cohorts, we noticed a tendency for the Cav-1 null mice to remain smaller than their wild-type littermates. In fact, at around 1 year of age, the difference is quantifiable with both the male and female knockout mice being approximately 5–7 g lighter than the wild-type controls (females: 39.8 ± 2.6 g for Cav-1+/+ versus 33.0 ± 2.1 g for Cav-1−/− mice (n = 10 each,p < 0.05) and males: 45.4 ± 2.1 g for Cav-1+/+ versus 40.1 ± 1.1 g for Cav-1 −/− mice (n = 10 each, p < 0.05)). To assess whether the lack of weight gain was due to adiposity or other age-related changes, we placed a cohort of age-matched male and female mice on a high fat diet (59% of calories from fat) and a corresponding chow diet (10% of calories from fat). The follow up of these cohorts up to 36 weeks of age indicated that Cav-1 deficiency imparts dramatic resistance to diet-induced obesity (Fig.2 A). On a high fat diet, all mice maintained normal growth up to 10 weeks of age, at which point the weight differences between Cav-1(−/−) null mice became statistically significant (p < 0.05). At 36 weeks, there is a difference of ∼ 10 g in body weight between wild-type and Cav-1 knockout mice (Fig. 2 A). It is interesting to note that the Cav-1 null mice on the equivalent chow diet also displayed leaner body weights, although not to the same extent as the high fat cohorts, leading us to conclude that the inability to gain weight is due to reduced adiposity in Cav-1(−/−) mice. We first assessed adiposity non-invasively via MRI. Fig. 2 B shows a representative abdominal cross-section of a 35-week-old wild-type and a Cav-1-deficient mouse placed on a high fat diet. Because lipids are rich in proton content and are present in high quantity in WAT, the majority of the signal observed in MRI is fat mass (indicated as white) and water. The difference in fat content between wild-type and knockout mice is striking, with only the omental fat and portions of the peri-renal/retro-peritoneal WAT remaining intact. Of significance are the highly underdeveloped subcutaneous and peri-gonadal fat pads. We also obtained whole-body proton spectra with the goal of quantifying the relative amounts of total body lipids. As shown in Fig.2 B, Cav-1 null mice have a dramatically attenuated fat peak in relation to the water peak. Quantification of such spectra on a group of four wild-type and four Cav-1 knockout mice reveals a 2-fold reduction in the fat-to-water ratio in Cav-1 null mice (Fig.2 B). To more accurately quantitate the regional fat pad differences in 36-week-old high fat diet mice (where the most overt total body weight differences are observed) and contrast these weights with 12-week-old mice (where total body weights are indistinguishable), we dissected and quantitated the weights of three major fat pads (the mammary gland 4/subcutaneous (M4/subQ), the peri-epididymal/peri-uterine, and the peri-renal/retroperitoneal) (Fig. 2 C). At 12 weeks, only one type of adipose tissue is affected in the Cav-1 null mice, the female mammary gland/subcutaneous WAT, where there is over a 2-fold reduction as compared with the wild-type controls. Interestingly, this reduction does not hold for the male knockout mice; rather, the only regional differences are a slight diminishment of peri-epididymal adiposity. We will further elaborate on this finding with histological analysis (see below). At 36 weeks of age on a high fat diet, the robust increase in adiposity of the wild-type mice is evident with 3- to 9-fold increases over the younger wild-type mice (Fig. 2 C). It is intriguing that the Cav-1(−/−) mice undergo only minor gains in fat mass and have dramatically reduced adiposity relative to the wild-type cohorts in all fat pads examined. It should be noted that the difference of the total weight of these three fat pads alone between wild-type and knockout mice accounts for ∼6–7 g of the body weight difference, indicating that the predominant cause of leanness in Cav-1 (−/−) mice is an inability to gain fat mass. We conducted routine histopathology on the 12- and 36-week-old mice above with a focus on WAT from several regions. At 12 weeks, two striking differences could be observed. The Cav-1(−/−) female M4/subQ adipocytes have significantly reduced lipid droplets thereby explaining the reduction in weight at such an early age (Fig.3 A). Additionally, the mammary ducts are noticeably perturbed: The number of ducts per field is increased, and the ductal epithelia exhibit hyperproliferation (data not shown). We further assessed the mammary gland architecture using whole-mount preparations (Fig. 3 B). Although the size of the Cav-1(−/−) mammary glands is overtly reduced, the overall architecture is intact and the total number of ducts per gland does not seem to be altered (quantification of ductal density is also shown (Fig. 3 B, inset)). We therefore conclude that the reduction in mammary gland size in Cav-1 knockout females is primarily due to reduced adipocyte diameter. A second interesting finding at 12 weeks of age is the near complete ablation of adipocytes in the hypodermal fat layer of both Cav-1(−/−) males and females (Fig. 3 A). Normally, the epidermis overlies a layer of adipocytes ∼3–4 cell layers thick; this layer is notably absent in Cav-1-deficient mice. Obviously, the lack of the hypodermal fat layer does not contribute significantly to the reduced body weight of the knockout animals; nevertheless, it is intriguing that there is a selective early effect on the hypodermal and female mammary/subQ WAT. Histological analysis of similar fat pads in the 36-week-old high fat diet mice indicates a systemic effect on adipose tissue. The most highly affected tissues are the mammary gland/subcutaneous and the peri-gonadal WAT in both Cav-1(−/−) males and females, although all fat pads are affected to some degree (Fig. 3 C shows the female M4/subQ WAT and peri-gonadal tissue). There are several notable observations: The M4/subQ in the Cav-1 null females is so severely perturbed that it no longer resembles mammary tissue. The adipocytes are highly reduced in number and display heterogeneity in size, and there is marked interstitial fibrosis and hypercellularity (Fig.3 C, left panel). All other major fat pads examined (the male M4/subQ, the male/female peri-gonadal, and peri-renal/retroperitoneal) show similar histological abnormalities (Fig. 3 C, right panel). Lipid droplet size in Cav-1 null adipocytes is generally ∼2- to 3-fold smaller than in wild-type adipocytes. Additionally, there is marked extracellular matrix deposition and hypercellularity (possibly of adipocyte precursors) surrounding the existing adipocytes. As mentioned above, the initial characterization of Cav-1 null mice revealed abnormalities in the lung and"

By tagging four chromosomal regions with a green fluorescent protein fusion to lac repressor, we monitored the movement and subnuclear position of specific sites in the yeast genome, sampling at short time intervals. We found that early and late origins of replication are highly mobile in G1 phase, frequently moving at or faster than 0.5 micrometers/10 seconds, in an energy-dependent fashion. The rapid diffusive movement of chromatin detected in G1 becomes constrained in S phase through a mechanism dependent on active DNA replication. In contrast, telomeres and centromeres provide replication-independent constraint on chromatin movement in both G1 and S phases."

https://openalex.org/W2095515726,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and TGF-β-related factors induce apoptosis in a variety of tissues; however, the mechanism underlying this induction is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-β induces the expression of the death-associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase) as an immediate early response in cells that undergo apoptosis in response to TGF-β. DAP-kinase is a positive mediator of apoptosis induced by certain cytokines and oncogenes. We show that the DAP-kinase promoter is activated by TGF-β through the action of Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4. Overexpression of DAP-kinase triggers apoptosis in the absence of TGF-β, whereas inhibition of DAP-kinase activity protects cells from TGF-β-induced apoptosis, blocks TGF-β-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and prevents TGF-β-induced dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Our findings indicate that DAP-kinase mediates TGF-β-dependent apoptosis by linking Smads to mitochondrial-based pro-apoptotic events."

Two isoforms, differing by only one amino acid, are derived from each parental species, white bass (Morone chrysops) and striped bass (Morone saxatilis). Molecular masses (2543 and 2571 Da), amino acid sequences (FFHHIFRGIVHVGKTIH(K/R)LVTGT), cDNA, and genomic DNA sequences were determined for each isoform. A predicted 79-residue moronecidin prepropeptide consists of three domains: a signal peptide (22 amino acids), a mature peptide (22 amino acids), and a C-terminal prodomain (35 amino acids). The synthetic, amidated white bass moronecidin exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity that was retained at high salt concentration. An α-helical structure was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The moronecidin gene consists of three introns and four exons. Peptide sequence and gene organization were similar to pleurocidin, an antimicrobial peptide from winter flounder. A TATA box and several consensus-binding motifs for transcription factors were found in the region 5′ to the transcriptional start site.

Although the primary structure of AMPs are highly heterogeneous, they can be loosely classified into three structural groups: (a) peptides with a disulfide-bonded β-sheet or α-helix/β-sheet (3Dimarcq J.L.

Most AMPs share the following features: (a) broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, yeast, and filamentous fungi and, for some AMPs, parasites and enveloped viruses as well; (b) cationic properties at physiological pH; and (c) an amphipathic secondary structure. Microbial killing is a consequence of the interaction of the AMP with the microbial outer membrane, which leads to membrane destabilization and channel formation. It remains unclear if channel formation alone promotes leakage of cytoplasmic contents resulting in death of the organism or if introduction of AMPs into the cytoplasm and interaction with cellular components also plays a role in microbial killing (7Oren Z.

We describe here our discovery and characterization of a novel α-helical AMP from the skin and gills of hybrid striped bass, which we named moronecidin. Further, we explore the potential role of this antimicrobial peptide in defense against Streptococcus iniae, a serious emerging pathogen of hybrid striped bass and other commercially important aquaculture species (23Eldar A. Bejerano Y. Bercovier H. Curr. Microbiol. 1994; 28: 139-143Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Adult hybrid striped bass were reared at Kent SeaTech Corp. (San Diego, CA). Skin, gill, and blood samples were harvested 12 h after bacterial challenge with an intraperitoneal injection of live Escherichia coli strain D22 and Micrococcus luteus mixture (50 μl of each organism from an overnight culture, ∼109 cfu/ml). Tissues were immediately frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were ground into powder with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Proteins were extracted in 10% acetic acid supplemented with the protease inhibitor, aprotinin (1.5 μm, final concentration) by shaking on an ice-cold water bath for 3 h. After centrifugation (2800 ×g for 20 min), the supernatants were filtered (0.45 μm, Millex™; Millipore Corp.), prepurified, and loaded onto 12-ml Sep-Pak Vac C18 cartridges (Waters) equilibrated with 10% acetic acid. The cartridges were washed with acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid), and two successive stepwise elutions were performed with 30 and 80% acidified acetonitrile (ACN), 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Both effluents were lyophilized and resuspended in water. The 30% ACN effluents from the skin, gill, and blood extracts were subjected to reverse phase (RP)-HPLC purification through a C18 preparative column (10 × 220 mm; Phenomenex) on a 0–50% ACN linear gradient over 50 min (skin extract), 80 min (gill extract), and 60 min (blood extract) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The 80% ACN effluents from the skin and gill were purified as above, using a linear biphasic gradient of acidified ACN (0–20% over 10 min/20–80% over 50 min). Fractions were monitored for absorbance at 220 nm. Each peak was collected, lyophilized, resuspended in water, and screened for antimicrobial activity by the liquid growth inhibition assay. Active fractions were further purified to homogeneity with a second and third round of RP-HPLC. The second purification step was performed on an analytical C18 column (2.5 × 220 mm; Phenomenex), using linear biphasic gradients of acidified ACN (0–15% over 10 min/15–55% over 60 min for the skin antimicrobial fractions and 0–24% over 10 min/24–44% over 80 min for the gill antimicrobial fractions) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The final purification step was performed on the same column as above with a linear biphasic gradient of acidified ACN from 0 to 18% over 10 min and from 18–58% over 70 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After each purification step, fractions were lyophilized, resuspended in sterile water, and tested for antimicrobial activity. The purity of the peptides was confirmed by capillary zone electrophoresis (model 270A-HT Capillary Electrophoresis System; PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems) equipped with a fused silica tube (length, 72 cm; internal diameter, 50 μm) as described previously (24Ehret-Sabatier L.

MALDI-TOF-MS was performed to determine the molecular masses with a Bruker BIFEXIIITM matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany). Samples were analyzed in a linear positive mode using a “sandwich” sample preparation (25Kussmann M. Lassing U. Sturmer C.A. Przybylski M. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sample was deposited at the surface of a thin layer of saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetone. The drop was immediately covered with 0.5 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% ACN. After air drying, the preparation was washed with 1.5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried under gentle vacuum, and analyzed. Peptide microsequencing and detection of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were performed on a pulse liquid automatic Edman sequenator (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, model 473A). The amidated white bass moronecidin (wb-moronecidin) peptide was synthesized using the Fmoc strategies on a Fmoc ring amide resin according to the procedure previously described (26Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Chernysh S. Briand J-P. Roussel J-P. Letellier L. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptide was synthesized according to classical Fmoc chemistry. Assembly of the protected peptide chain was carried out on a 25 μmscale. Following purification by solid-phase extraction and RP-HPLC using a preparative column (Aquapore RP 300 C8, 150 × 10 mm; Brownlee™), peptide purity and identity were established by Edman degradation, capillary zone electrophoresis, and measurement by mass spectrometry. CD spectra of synthetic, amidated wb-moronecidin (20 μm) were measured in 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (8 mm EDTA, pH 7.25) with or without 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol on a CD spectrophotometer, model 202 (Aviv Instruments Inc.) with a cell path length of 0.2 mm. The CD spectra were recorded from 180 to 300 nm. M. luteus (CIPA270, gift from the Pasteur Institute Collection, Paris, France) and E. coli, strain D22 (an Env A1 mutant with a defect in the outer membrane, gift from P. L. Boquet, Center d'Etudes Nucléaires, Saclay, France) were used as reference strains for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. S. iniae K136-01 bB is an isolate from the brain of a farmed hybrid striped bass with streptococcal septicemia (Kent SeaTech Corp.). KST740ak and KSTSi6P are other S. inaie isolates from fish. All other bacterial isolates were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The fungal strains, Neurospora crassa (CBS 327-54) andFusarium culmorum (IMI 1800420) were generous gifts from W. F. Broekaert (Université Catholique of Leuven, Belgium),Fusarium oxysporum (MUCL 909) from the SociétéClause (France) and Aspergillus fumigatus from H. Koenig (Laboratory of Mycology, University of Medicine, Strasbourg, France). Logarithmic phase cultures were used in all experiments. Bacteria and yeast were grown in Todd Hewitt broth. Filamentous fungi were grown in half-strength potato dextrose broth (Difco) supplemented with tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and cephotaxime (100 μg/ml). During the purification procedure, antibacterial activity was monitored by a liquid growth inhibition assay against M. luteus and E. coli D22, as previously described (27Hetru C. Bulet P. Shafer W.M. Antimicrobial Peptide Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 35-49Google Scholar). Briefly, logarithmic phase bacterial cultures were diluted in the broth (1% (w/v) bactotryptone, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl) to an A 600 of 0.001, which is approximately equivalent to 105 cfu/ml. Diluted bacteria (90 μl) were mixed with 10 μl of either water (control) or the RP-HPLC fraction in wells of a microtitration plate. The bacterial growth was monitored, after an overnight incubation at 25 °C, by measuring the change in the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm using a microplate reader. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as previously described (27Hetru C. Bulet P. Shafer W.M. Antimicrobial Peptide Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 35-49Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria, yeast, and filamentous fungi were incubated in Todd Hewitt broth in the presence of 2-fold serial dilutions of synthetic, amidated wb-moronecidin (1.25–20 μm final concentration). Bacterial growth was monitored by a liquid growth inhibition assay. MIC was expressed as a range of the highest concentration of peptide at which bacteria were able to grow and the lowest concentration that inhibited bacterial growth completely (28Casteels P. Ampe C. Jacobs F. Tempst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7044-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the minimal bactericidal concentration, medium containing peptide and organism was incubated for 18 h and then inoculated onto TH agar using a needle transfer device for a 96-well plate. Bacterial growth was assessed after overnight incubation at 37 °C. When the effect of cations on antimicrobial activity was studied, the MIC was determined against Staphylococcus aureus in modified LB broth with no salt or with varying concentrations of NaCl (0–1280 mm), MgCl2 (0–40 mm), or CaCl2 (0–20 mm). To determine the rate of bactericidal activity of moronecidin, the kinetic studies were performed using S. aureus andShigella flexneri. Briefly, synthetic, amidated wb-moronecidin (3 or 6 μm) was added to a log phase culture of S. aureus (2 × 105 cfu/ml) and incubated at 30 and 37 °C. The bacterial viability was assessed at each time point (2–30 min), by plating dilutions of the bacterial suspension on Todd Hewitt agar followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C. The percentage of cfu was defined relative to the cfu obtained in the control (100% cfu at 0 min). Freshly packed human or sheep erythrocytes (5 ml) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) until the supernatant was colorless and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (50 ml) supplemented with glucose (0.2%, w/v). Synthetic, amidated wb-moronecidin (10 μl of 800–3.125 μm, serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to 90 μl of a 1% erythrocyte suspension (1:10 dilution of washed erythrocytes) in microcentrifuge tubes. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rpm at room temperature. The supernatants (70 μl) were transferred to a microtiter plate, and the optical density was determined at 405 nm. The percentage of hemolysis was defined relative to the hemolysis obtained with the erythrocyte suspension treated with 0.1% SDS (100% hemolysis). RNA was extracted from the gill of an unchallenged hybrid striped bass, using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT was performed from total RNA, using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a degenerate primer, poly(T) (see Fig. 2). The poly(T) primer (5′-CCGGAAGATCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTV-3′) contains a 5′BglII restriction site and 20 thymidine residues with a 3′-terminal V (where V represents A, C or G). A degenerate, sense primer F2 (5′-GGHATHGTYCAYGTYGGHAARAC-3′ in which R represents A + G, Y is C + T, and H is A + T + C) was deduced from the amino acid consensus sequence, GIVHVGKT, corresponding to residues 8–15 in the moronecidin mature peptide (see Fig. 2). The 3′ region of the moronecidin mRNA was determined by direct sequencing of the RT-PCR product from cDNA generated with the poly(T) primer and amplified with the primer pair F2 and poly(T) (see Fig. 2). The 5′ region of the RNA was determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (29Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized with primer R1, and a “poly(A) head” was created following incubation with dATP and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Stratagene). The cDNA with the poly(A) head was amplified with the primer pair, 65R (see Fig. 2) and poly(T). PCR was performed using rTth DNA polymerase XL (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems) in the GeneAmp 9600 thermocycler (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were purified from an agarose gel (1–2%) using QiaQuick gel purification kit (Qiagen) and directly sequenced by using a PCR primer and the Applied Biosystems BigDye terminators. DNA was extracted from the skin of striped bass and white bass using DNAzol (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A PCR product was generated by amplifying DNA with the primer pair 8F and R1 (see Fig. 2). The 3′- and 5′-flanking sequences were determined by inverse PCR (30Triglia T. Peterson M.G. Kemp D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA digested withXbaI or DraI was intramolecularly ligated (T4 ligase, Promega) and amplified by the primer pair 65R and 86F (see Fig.2). Amplification and sequence determination of the PCR products were performed as described above. Eight white bass fingerlings (20–30 g) were immersed in either a suspension of the fish pathogen, S. iniae K136-01 bB (1.33 × 108 cfu/liter) or sterile diluted Todd Hewitt broth (control) for 2 min. Three challenged and three mock-challenged fingerlings were randomly selected, anesthetized, and sacrificed 27 h postchallenge. Tissue samples for mRNA analysis (10–100 mg of skin, gill, intestine, liver, spleen, anterior kidney, and whole blood) were immediately homogenized in TRIzol. Brain tissue from each fish was plated on blood agar (tryptic soy agar plus 5% sheep blood) to detect infection with S. iniae. The remaining five challenged and five mock-challenged fish were monitored for mortality for 7 days postchallenge, and brain tissue from deceased fish were also tested for S. iniae. To determine the site and inducibility of moronecidin gene expression, moronecidin mRNA was quantitated in each tissue sample, by kinetic RT-PCR (3131. Kang, J. J., Watson, R. M., Fisher, M. E., Higuchi, R, Gelfand, D. H., Holland, M. J. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res., 28, e2 VI:20075323.Google Scholar). Moronecidin cDNA and cDNA from ribosomal 18 S RNA were synthesized using primers 65R and 18S-R in the same tube and quantitated by kinetic PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems) and the GeneAmp 5700 thermocycler (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems). A primer pair, 331F and 65R, was designed to span an intron and preferentially amplify moronecidin cDNA (amplicon size 99 bp) and not genomic DNA (amplicon size 763 bp). A primer pair, 18S-F (5′-GTTCGATTCCGGAGAGGGAG-3′) and 18S-R (5′-CCTTCCTTGGATGTGGTAGCC-3′), was designed from the 51-bp conserved region of yeast, plant, and mammalian 18 S rRNA genes. Standard curves for the kinetic PCR of moronecidin and 18 S cDNA were generated by amplification of serial dilutions of cDNA prepared from a challenged fish gill. Quantitation of moronecidin and 18 S cDNA for all samples was derived from the standard curves and expressed as relative units. The arbitrary units of moronecidin were normalized by the arbitrary units of 18 S for each sample. The open reading frame was predicted using the BCM Search Launcher (available on the World Wide Web at dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu:9331/seq-util/seq-util.html). The Shiffer-Edmundson helical wheel diagram was predicted by using Protean 3.05 Molecular Biology Applications DNASTAR f. Protein masses, isoelectric points, and aliphatic index were predicted using the Atelier Bioinformatique Web site (www.up.univ-mrs.fr/∼wabim/d_abim/compo-p.html). The hydropathy profile of peptides was calculated by the Kyte-Doolittle method over a window of 7, using the Protein Hydrophilicity/Hydrophobicity Search and Comparison Server at the Bioinformatics Unit, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel (bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/hydroph/). The presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in amino acid sequences were predicted using the SignalP World Wide Web server (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP) (32Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence comparison between white bass and striped bass was performed using a pairwise sequence alignment (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu:9331/seq-search/alignment.html). A homology search was performed using BLASTP 2.1.2 and TBLASTN 2.1.3, in Blast 2 sequence similarity search by the Genome Net WWW Server (www.genome.ad.jp) (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A.

Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Skin, gills, and blood from challenged fish were extracted under acidic conditions and separately prepurified by solid phase extraction onto Sep-Pak. The fractions obtained after elution with 30 and 80% ACN were analyzed by RP-HPLC, and the HPLC fractions were tested for antimicrobial activity. While no activity was found in the HPLC fractions obtained from the 80% Sep-Pak eluate (data not shown), a total of four HPLC fractions from the 30% ACN Sep-Pak eluate from the skin (one fraction) and gills (three fractions), but not blood, had antimicrobial activity (peaks labeled 1–4, Fig. 1, A andB). These four fractions were active against both M. luteus and E. coli D22. In the present study, we focused our attention on the fractions labeled 1 and4 from the skin and gill extracts, respectively. Fractions 1 and 4 were further purified to apparent homogeneity by two additional analytical RP-HPLC purification steps (data not shown). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of fraction 1 (skin) and fraction 4 (gill) revealed, in both cases, two different molecules with molecular masses at ∼2543 Da (2543.73 M1H+ and 2544.70 M1H+ in fractions 1 and 4, respectively) and 2571 Da (2571.70 M2H+ and 2572.72 M2H+ in fractions 1 and 4, respectively) (see Fig. 1, C and D). A common contaminant ∼2491 Da (2491.86 M3H+ and 2492.77 M3H+ in fractions 1 and 4, respectively) was observed in both fractions. The mass differences observed between the three molecules from fraction 1 (Fig. 1 C) and the three molecules from fraction 4 (Fig.1 D) were not considered significant, but rather resulted from experimental variations (i.e. calibration) based on the mass variations for the control peptides (data not shown). This interpretation was further confirmed by capillary zone electrophoresis. Fraction 1 (skin) was subjected to microsequencing by Edman degradation. Unique phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivative signals were observed in all of the Edman degradation cycles except for cycle 18, in which two PTH-derivative signals (PTH-Arg and PTH-Lys) were observed. The mass difference between an arginine residue (175 Da) and a lysine residue (147 Da) perfectly matched the 28-Da mass difference between the two molecules (2571 and 2543 Da). Thus, the two molecules were assumed to correspond to peptide isoforms differing by a single residue at position 18 (arginine or lysine). We named the antimicrobial peptide “moronecidin” after the genus of the fish. Because the measured mass (2571 and 2543 Da) did not match the calculated mass of 19 amino acids identified by sequencing (2314.8 Da and 2286.8 Da), we assumed that the peptide sequences were incomplete. In order to obtain the full peptide sequence, the cDNA sequence was determined. The complete sequence for the moronecidin cDNAs was determined from RNA from the gill of unchallenged, hybrid striped bass (Fig.2). Analysis of the cDNA revealed two sequences with single-nucleotide differences at 11 loci, which resulted in four changes in the predicted amino acid sequence. Analysis of genomic DNA extracted from white bass and striped bass confirmed two distinct sequ"

https://openalex.org/W2137568169,"Using topography collected over one martian year from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, we have measured temporal changes in the elevation of the martian surface that correlate with the seasonal cycle of carbon dioxide exchange between the surface and atmosphere. The greatest elevation change (1.5 to 2 meters) occurs at high latitudes ( above 80 degrees ), whereas the bulk of the mass exchange occurs at lower latitudes (below 75 degrees N and below 73 degrees S). An unexpected period of sublimation was observed during northern hemisphere autumn, coincident with dust storms in the southern hemisphere. Analysis of MGS Doppler tracking residuals revealed temporal variations in the flattening of Mars that correlate with elevation changes. The combined changes in gravity and elevation constrain the average density of seasonally deposited carbon dioxide to be 910 +/- 230 kilograms per cubic meter, which is considerably denser than terrestrial snow."

Here we tested potential interactions between Rho kinase and insulin signaling pathways. In control VSMCs, insulin inactivates ROK-α, the major Rho kinase isoform in VSMCs, and inhibits thrombin-induced increase in ROK-α association with the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1).

Recent studies from our laboratory (17Sandu O.A. Ito M. Begum N. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown that insulin rapidly stimulates myosin-associated phosphatase (MBP) activity by causing a site-specific decrease in MBST695 phosphorylation by inactivating thrombin-stimulated Rho and one of its downstream effectors, Rho kinase. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3-kinase, nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), and cGMP signaling pathways abolished insulin-stimulated MBP activation suggesting the involvement of these signaling pathways in MBP activation (18Begum N. Duddy N. Sandu O.A. Reinzie J. Ragolia L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, insulin stimulates MBP in VSMCs by activating the NO/cGMP signaling pathway that also inactivates Rho/Rho kinase (17Sandu O.A. Ito M. Begum N. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The effects of insulin on MBP activation and vasorelaxation were severely impaired in VSMCs isolated from diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats and spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) due to defective IRS-1/PI3-kinase signaling as well as up-regulation of Rho kinase activity (18Begum N. Duddy N. Sandu O.A. Reinzie J. Ragolia L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Sandu O.A. Ragolia L. Begum N. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to explore in detail potential interactions between Rho signaling and insulin signaling pathways. In the present study, VSMCs were infected with an activated RhoAV14, dominant negative RhoAN19, and cGK Iα. We examined the effects of insulin and thrombin on ROK-α/IRS-1 association, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1/p85PI3-kinase association, and PI3-kinase activation and its impact on MBST695 site-specific phosphorylation and MBP activation. The results of this study indicate that insulin inactivates ROK-α and inhibits thrombin-induced ROK-α/IRS-1 association in VSMCs. Hypertension or expression of activated RhoAV14 increases ROK-α activity and its association with IRS-1, leading to inhibition of downstream insulin signaling in VSMCs via IRS-1 serine phosphorylation that inhibits insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-kinase. Expression of dominant negative RhoA or cGK Iα inactivates Rho kinase, abolishes ROK-α/IRS-1 association, and potentiates insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-kinase activation leading to decreased MBST695 phosphorylation, thereby relieving MBP inhibition.

Unless otherwise indicated, primary cultures of VSMCs were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture. Subcultures of VSMCs at passage five were used in all experiments. Measurements of Rho kinase activity, IRS-1/ROK-α association, MBST695 phosphorylation, and MBP activity were performed on highly confluent cells (7–9 days in culture) of the same passage. Prior to each experiment, cells were serum-starved for 24 h in serum-free α-minimal essential medium containing 5.5 mm glucose and 1% antibiotics. The next day, cells were exposed to insulin (100 nm) alone for 10 min, thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 5 min, or insulin followed by thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 5 min. Rho kinase was immunoprecipitated by incubating equal amounts of precleared lysate proteins (100 μg) with anti-ROK-α antibody (6 μg/tube) at 4 °C with constant shaking, and then kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was assayed using [γ-32P]ATP, recombinant MBS, and GST-MYPT1-(667–1004) as a substrate (21Feng J.

Enzyme concentration was adjusted to ensure first-order kinetics in which reaction rate was linearversus time. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, 25-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted on phosphocellulose paper followed by extensive washing of the paper;32P incorporation was then determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. In some experiments, Rho kinase activity was measured in the IRS-1 immunoprecipitates using the above protocol as detailed in the figure legends. Plasmids carrying active RhoAV14 and dominant negative RhoAT19N were kindly provided by Dr. Van Aelst (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, NY). These constructs were subcloned into BamHI/SalI and EcoRI sites, respectively, of the retroviral vector, pBabe, carrying a puromycin resistance marker. The resulting constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analyses as well as by automated DNA sequencing. pBabe-RhoAV14 and pBabe-RhoAN19 were introduced into a retroviral packaging cell line, LE (a derivative of Bosc23, kindly given by Dr. Hannon, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, NY), by transfection using LipofectAMINE plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The next day cells were fed with complete growth medium (α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture) containing 5 mm sodium butyrate and 1 μm dexamethasone and were incubated at 32 °C. Culture supernatants containing the retroviral recombinant virus particles were collected 48 h post-transfection and used for infection of VSMCs. Briefly, overnight cultures of VSMCs (2 × 104 cells per well at passage 3) were infected with a mixture containing filtered retroviral supernatant and Polybrene (8 μg/ml) in 2 ml of growth medium. The culture plates were centrifuged at 1,700 rpm in a Beckman Table Top Centrifuge (Allegra 6) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 32 °C, and then shifted to 37 °C the next day. At the end of 48 h, VSMCs were trypsinized and plated into five 100-mm dishes containing 2 μg/ml puromycin to generate stably expressing clones. Pools of stable clones expressing constitutively active RhoAV14 or dominant negative RhoAN19were amplified and used at the 5th passage for functional assays to examine the impact of RhoA on the association between IRS-1 and Rho kinase and its downstream signaling components. Western blot analyses revealed a 3-fold increase in RhoA expression. The adenoviral vector for expressing cGK Iα was constructed by first cloning the cDNA of human cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα into the multiple cloning site of the adenoviral transfer plasmid pCMVI/ΔE1sp1A, itself generated by cloning the expression cassette of the pCI expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) into the plasmid pΔE1sp1A containing amino-terminal E1-deleted sequences of Ad5 (Microbix Biosystems, Toronto, Canada). The plasmid pCMVI/cGKIα was then cotransfected with pJM17, a plasmid containing the full-length genome of replication-deficient type 5 adenovirus (Microbix), into the Ad5-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293. E1A-deficient recombinant virus (Ad5.cGK Iα) was generated via homologous recombination between pCMVI/cGK Iα and pJM17, was screened for using the polymerase chain reaction, and then recovered and plaque-purified according to previously used protocols for Ad5.cGK Iβ (22Vaandrager A.B.

Confluent VSMCs (1 × 108 cells/100-mm dish) were rinsed twice with serum-free medium and infected with cGK Iα adenovirus (1 × 1010 virus/ml) for 2 h followed by addition of 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day, medium was changed to complete medium. After 48 h, VSMCs were serum-starved and treated with insulin and thrombin as detailed in Fig. 1, examined for cGK I protein content by Western blot analysis with anti-cGK I antibody, and evaluated for cGK I enzymatic activity as detailed below. The biological activity of the cGK I in VSMCs infected withAd5.cGKIα gene was assayed according to the method described by Francis et al. (23Francis S.H. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts prepared from uninfected and Ad5.cGK Iα-infected VSMCs were assayed in a 50-μl reaction containing 20 μm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 μm ATP, the synthetic peptide, Glasstide (Calbiochem), 20 mm MgCl2, 100 μmisobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm(R p)-cAMP, and 30,000 cpm/μl of [γ-32P]ATP. Assays were performed in the presence or absence of 10 μm cGMP at 30 °C for 10 min and were terminated by transferring samples onto phosphocellulose P-81 paper that was subsequently washed extensively in 75 mmphosphoric acid. Radioactivity bound to the phosphocellulose paper was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. VSMCs were treated with and without insulin (100 nm) or thrombin; cell lysates were then prepared and precleared as detailed (19Sandu O.A. Ragolia L. Begum N. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of lysate proteins (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody (10 μg) overnight. The immunoprecipitates were separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analyses. The top portion of the membrane was probed with either ROK-α antibody or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the bottom portion was probed for p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. To overcome any variations in proteins due to immunoprecipitation, blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-IRS-1 antibody that reacts with IRS-1 protein. The amount of ROK-α and p85 associated with IRS-1 as well as the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 were measured by densitometric analysis of the ECL signals and quantitated by dividing the intensity of ROK-α, p85, and phosphotyrosine signals with the IRS-1 protein signal. To ensure that ECL signals were within the linear range, multiple exposures were taken during the short initial phase of ECL reaction. Only those signals that were in the linear range were used for quantitation. Equal amounts of precleared VSMC lysate proteins (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-IRS-1 antibody. PI3-kinase activity was assayed in the IRS-1 immunoprecipitates by the conversion of phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol phosphate. The lipid products were extracted with chloroform/methanol and were separated by thin layer chromatography as detailed in our recent publication (29Begum N. Ragolia L. Rienzie J. McCarthy M. Duddy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25164-25170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Myosin-enriched fractions of VSMCs were prepared as described previously (17Sandu O.A. Ito M. Begum N. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Begum N. Duddy N. Sandu O.A. Reinzie J. Ragolia L. Mol.

MBP activity in myosin-enriched fractions was assayed using 32P-labeled myosin light chains (MLC) as a substrate (17Sandu O.A. Ito M. Begum N. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid at 1 nmconcentration was included during the enzyme assay to inhibit any residual PP-2A activity (24Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 25Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled MLC was prepared according to the published protocol (26Ishihara H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H.

Proteins in cellular extracts and lysates were quantitated by the bicinchoninic acid (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanso G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimot E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18347) Google Scholar) or by the Bradford technique (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (211941) Google Scholar). The results are presented as means ± S.E. of three to six independent experiments each performed in triplicate. Analysis of variance was used to compare mean basal valuesversus those after various treatments. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Potential interaction between ROK-α and IRS-1 was investigated in VSMCs by immunoprecipitation of equal amounts of VSMC protein lysates with IRS-1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-ROK-α antibody and anti-IRS-1 antibody, respectively (Fig. 1, A andB). As summarized in Fig. 1 C, under basal conditions, a significant amount of ROK-α was found associated with the IRS-1 protein (Fig. 1 A, lane 2, andC). Treatment with thrombin increased ROK-α/IRS-1 association >3-fold when compared with basal values (Fig. 1,A and C). Pre-exposure to insulin for 10 min prevented thrombin-induced increase in ROK-α content in the IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A, compare lane 5 versus lane 4 and C). Insulin treatment alone did not alter ROK-α content in the IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A, lane 3 andC). A 2-fold increase in basal ROK-α/IRS-1 association was observed in VSMCs expressing activated RhoAV14 (Fig.1 A, lane 6 and C). Thrombin stimulation further increased ROK-α/IRS-1 association in RhoAV14-expressing cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 8 and C), which was not prevented by insulin (Fig.1 A, lane 9 and C). In contrast, VSMCs expressing dominant negative RhoAN19 exhibited no thrombin-induced increase in ROK-α/IRS-1 association (Fig.1 A, lane 12 and C); the amount of ROK-α associated with IRS-1 was more or less comparable for control, insulin, thrombin, and insulin + thrombin treatment (Fig.1 A, lanes 10–13, and C). Alterations in ROK-α/IRS-1 association were not due to variations in IRS-1 protein in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B) as changes persisted when the data from all experiments were quantitated and normalized for IRS-1 proteins in the immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 C). Similar results were obtained when a reciprocal experiment was performed in which ROK-α immunoprecipitates were examined for IRS-1 association (data not shown). Total ROK-α levels were comparable between pBabe-, RhoAV14-, and RhoAN19-expressing VSMC lysates. Our recent studies (17Sandu O.A. Ito M. Begum N. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Begum N. Duddy N. Sandu O.A. Reinzie J. Ragolia L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Sandu O.A. Ragolia L. Begum N. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have shown that insulin inhibits basal as well as thrombin-stimulated Rho kinase activity assayed in the ROK-α immunoprecipitates. To examine the activation status of Rho kinase that is bound to IRS-1, we assayed Rho kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates using recombinant MBS, GST-MYPT1-(667–1004), as a substrate. Insulin caused a 20% decrease in IRS-1-associated Rho kinase activity in VSMCs expressing the empty retroviral vector, pBabe (Fig. 2). Exposure to thrombin caused a 20% increase in Rho kinase activity over the basal value. Pretreatment with insulin decreased thrombin-induced Rho kinase activity below basal values and below the level of activity observed in cells treated with insulin alone (Fig. 2). Expression of an activated RhoAV14 caused a 50% increase in basal Rho kinase activity that was further increased upon treatment with thrombin, presumably because of the presence of endogenous wild type RhoA. Insulin did not decrease Rho kinase activity in these cells (Fig.2). In contrast, expression of dominant negative RhoAN19caused a 20% decrease in basal Rho kinase activity when compared with VSMCs expressing pBabe vector (Fig. 2). Furthermore, thrombin treatment failed to increase Rho kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates in these cells. More important, insulin decreased Rho kinase activity in thrombin-treated cells below basal values (Fig. 2). Thus, it appears that insulin is more effective in inhibiting ROK-α when cells were exposed to thrombin in VSMCs expressing RhoAN19. In preliminary experiments, ROK-α immunoprecipitated from thrombin-stimulated cells phosphorylated recombinant IRS-1 protein in an in vitro kinase assay (data not shown). This observation suggests that IRS-1 protein may be an in vivo substrate for ROK-α. We next examined the potential impact of ROK-α/IRS-1 association on insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in VSMCs expressing the active and inactive forms of RhoA. Insulin caused a rapid 6-fold increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in control VSMCs infected with pBabe (Fig.3 A, lane 2 versus lane 1, and D). Thrombin alone caused a 2-fold increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Pretreatment with insulin followed by thrombin further increased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A, lane 4 versus lane 2, and D). In contrast, expression of activated RhoAV14 caused resistance to insulin, a 90% reduction of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in comparison to control VSMCs infected with pBabe (Fig. 3 A,lanes 6 and 8 versus lanes 2 and 4, and D). More importantly, VSMCs expressing dominant negative RhoAN19 exhibited a 5-fold increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the basal state (Fig.3 A, lane 9 versus lane 1, andD) that was not affected by thrombin treatment. Insulin treatment further increased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation over the basal values (Fig. 3 A, lane 10 versus lane 9, and D). In control VSMCs, insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was accompanied by an 11-fold increase in the association of p85 subunit of PI3-kinase with IRS-1 (Fig. 3 B, lane 2 versus lane 1, and E). Alterations in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and p85/IRS-1 association were not due to variations in IRS-1 content (Fig. 3 C) because changes persisted after the data were normalized for IRS-1 content between different treatments and experiments (see Fig. 3, D and E). Thrombin treatment caused a 2-fold increase in basal p85/IRS-1 association when present alone. Insulin-induced p85/IRS-1 association was not altered when thrombin was added after insulin pretreatment (Fig. 3 B,lane 4 and E). VSMCs expressing activated RhoAV14 exhibited 80% reduction in insulin-induced p85PI3-kinase association with the IRS-1 in comparison with control VSMCs expressing vector alone (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6 and 8 versus lanes 2 and 4, andE). In contrast, VSMCs expressing dominant negative RhoAN19 exhibited a 3-fold increase in basal p85/IRS-1 association and an ∼10-fold increase in insulin-mediated p85PI3-kinase/IRS-1 association compared with basal value (Fig. 3 B, lanes 10 versus 9and E). Thrombin alone increased p85/IRS-1 association. Thrombin treatment did not alter insulin-induced p85/IRS-1 association under these conditions (Fig. 3 B, lane 12 andE). Basal and insulin-stimulated P85 association with IRS-1 correlated very we"

The results suggest that unlike today's ocean, sizable vertical gradients in the carbonate ion concentration existed in the glacial-age deep ocean.

RNAi significantly decreased mRNA and protein levels of targeted subunits of both the core 20 S proteasome and the PA700 regulatory complex. Cells deficient in any of several 26 S proteasome subunits (e.g. dβ5, dRpt1, dRpt2, dRpt5, dRpn2, and dRpn12) displayed decreased proteasome activity (as judged by hydrolysis of succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-aminomethylcoumarin), increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation without a specific block of the cell cycle, and accumulation of ubiquitinated cellular proteins. RNAi of many individual 26 S proteasome subunits promoted increased expression of many non-targeted subunits. This effect was not mimicked by chemical proteasome inhibitors such as lactacystin. Reduced expression of most targeted subunits disrupted the assembly of the 26 S proteasome. RNAi of six of eight targeted PA700 subunits disrupted that structure and caused accumulation of increased levels of uncapped 20 S proteasome.

Our data suggest that those cells adapted to grow in conditions of impaired ubiquitin and proteasome-dependent protein degradation. Most intracellular protein degradation in higher eukaryotes is catalyzed by 26 S proteasomes (1Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). With few known exceptions, proteins degraded by the 26 S proteasome must be covalently modified by a polyubiquitin chain (2DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

Rep. 1999; 26: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is attached to the substrate protein via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin and an ε-amino group of a particular lysine of the substrate protein. Ubiquitin monomers within the polyubiquitin chain are likewise linked by isopeptide bonds between the C-terminal carboxyl group and the ε-amino group of Lys-48 of the preceding ubiquitin (4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6791) Google Scholar, 5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat.

Polyubiquitin chains of this structure bind specifically to the 26 S proteasome, which then degrades the protein and releases free ubiquitin monomers.The 26 S proteasome is a 2,100,000-dalton protease complex composed of ∼64 subunits representing at least 32 different gene products. It is assembled from two multisubunit subcomplexes, the 20 S proteasome and PA700 (19 S complex). The 20 S proteasome is a 700,000-dalton protease composed of 28 subunits arranged as a cylinder-shaped stack of four heptameric rings. Both exterior rings contain one copy each of seven different but homologous α-type subunits. Likewise, both interior rings contain one copy each of seven different but homologous β-type subunits (2DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 8Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev.

Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of yeast 20 S proteasome reveals that the complex contains three contiguous interior chambers sealed from the exterior by a polypeptide shell (9Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 10Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). The central chamber, formed by the two β-rings, is lined by two copies each of three catalytic centers with differing specificities for peptide bond hydrolysis (11Orlowski M. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, access of protein substrates to the catalytic sites of the proteasome is normally highly restricted.PA700 is a 700,000-dalton complex composed of 16–18 distinct gene products (12Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). PA700 binds to one or both of the outer α-rings of the 20 S proteasome and promotes protease activation. Binding of PA700 induces a conformational change in proteasome structure that breaks a seal formed by N-terminal portions of four subunits in each outer ring. This conformational change, roughly analogous to the opening of a ligand-gated channel, creates an entry point through which substrates can pass to reach the catalytic sites in the interior of the proteasome (13Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 14Kohler A. Cascio P. Leggett D.S. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The opened pore has a diameter of about 13 Å, which allows unimpeded passage of short peptides, whose hydrolysis is greatly accelerated when PA700 binds to the proteasome. A pore of 13 Å, however, is too small to allow passage of folded proteins known to be degraded by the 26 S proteasome (9Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 10Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to altering proteasome structure by conformational activation, PA700 probably also alters protein substrate structure by promoting substrate unfolding (15Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 16Strickland E. Hakala K. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Finally, PA700 may be involved in the processive translocation of the unfolded polypeptide substrate through the opened proteasome pore and into the central chamber for peptide bond hydrolysis. Protein substrate unfolding and/or translocation may be linked to ATP hydrolysis, an enzymatic activity inherent to PA700 and obligatory for the degradation of proteins by the 26 S proteasome (17Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar,18DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Unlike the 20 S proteasome, whose structure is understood in considerable detail, less is known about the detailed structure of PA700. Nevertheless, the relative arrangement of many subunits within the complex has been mapped. For example, six subunits are distinct but homologous members of the AAA ATPase family (2DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 3Tanahashi N. Kawahara H. Murakami Y. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They probably form a hexameric ring that binds directly to the outer rings of the proteasome and, with 2–3 additional subunits, form a subcomplex of PA700 termed the “base”(19). These subunits mediate ATP-dependent functions of the complex and appear sufficient to promote conformational opening of the substrate entrance pore described above (13Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 14Kohler A. Cascio P. Leggett D.S. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L.

A second group of approximately eight subunits, termed the “lid,” constitute a region of PA700 distal to the base. In yeast, the base and the lid appear to be physically linked by the Rpn10 subunit, which like its mammalian ortholog, S5a, binds to polyubiquitin chains (20Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

These data indicate that other as yet unidentified subunits of 26 S proteasome also must participate in the selective recognition of polyubiquitinated proteins.Despite the impressive progress in understanding the structure and function of the 26 S proteasome, relatively little is known about the functions of and interactions among individual 26 S subunits, especially within PA700. The use of conventional “knock out” technologies to address these issues has been limited by the large number of subunits to be studied as well as the fact that most of the subunits are essential for growth and development.In this report we have used double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) 1RNAiRNA interferenceAMCaminomethylcoumarinZ benzyloxycarbonylRT, reverse transcriptasedsRNAdouble-stranded RNAPBSphosphate-buffered salineMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-diphenyltetrazolium bromideSucsuccinyl 1RNAiRNA interferenceAMCaminomethylcoumarinZ benzyloxycarbonylRT, reverse transcriptasedsRNAdouble-stranded RNAPBSphosphate-buffered salineMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-diphenyltetrazolium bromideSucsuccinyl to block expression of individual subunits of 26 S proteasome in Drosophila S2 cells. Unlike conventional methods, RNAi is simple, rapid, and amenable for the study of reduced expression of even those proteins essential for growth. RNAi is based on the process whereby specific dsRNAs induce a potent and specific interference in protein expression or post-transcriptional gene silencing in some invertebrates, where it functions as an antiviral/antitransposomal defense mechanism. This mechanism was originally exploited for experimental use inCaenorhabditis elegans (23Fire A., Xu, S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11566) Google Scholar) and more recently in culturedDrosophila cells (24Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T.

RNAi significantly and selectively blocked expression of targeted subunits of the 26 S proteasome in S2 cells as judged at the mRNA and protein levels. In some cases, inhibition of expression was probably much greater than was apparent from Western analysis of protein levels because of the relatively long half-life of most proteasome components. Nevertheless, RNAi of proteasome subunits produced significant phenotypic changes in S2 cells, including reduced growth, increased apoptosis, reduced proteasome function, and increased cellular levels of polyubiquitinated proteins, an indicator of inhibition of intracellular protein degradation via the ubiquitin-dependent pathway (43Soldatenkov V.A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3881-3885PubMed Google Scholar, 53Wojcik C. Schroeter D. Wilk S. Lamprecht J. Paweletz N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar,54Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowsky J. Escher C. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar).RNAi of most, but not all, 26 S proteasome subunits interfered with the structure of the complex. RNAi of subunits of the 20 S proteasome reduced the amount of 26 S proteasome by blocking assembly of the 20 S core particle. In contrast, RNAi of most PA700 subunits disrupted PA700 and promoted an increase in the cellular content of free 20 S proteasome. Notable exceptions to the latter effects included RNAi of dRpn10 and dUCH37.Rpn10 is a polyubiquitin chain binding subunit of mammalian, yeast, and plant 26 S proteasomes (20Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of Rpn10 fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae has no effect on cell viability but promotes increased steady state levels of ubiquitin conjugates (21van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M., Fu, H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Accordingly, RNAi of dRpn10 in S2 cells had only modest effects on cell growth but significantly increased accumulation of ubiquitinated S2 cell proteins. In surprising contrast, we have observed an increase in the proteasome-specific peptide-hydrolyzing activity measured in whole cell lysates. This unexpected effect could occur from either increased levels of 26 S proteasomes (perhaps as a consequence of the increased expression and assembly of dRpn10-deficient 26 S proteasomes) or from increased activity of the dRpn10-deficient 26 S proteasomes. Support for the latter possibility was obtained by normalizing proteasome activity in the glycerol gradients to the amount of 26 S proteasomes in corresponding fractions (as determined by quantitative Western blotting). These results indicate that dRpn10-deficient 26 S proteasomes display ∼5-fold higher specific activity compared with controls (data not shown). Nevertheless, an unambiguous conclusion about this issue cannot be made until the purified complexes are compared directly.dUCH37 is an isopeptidase that removes ubiquitin monomers from the distal end of polyubiquitin chains (51Lam Y.A.

Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). It is a bona fide 26 S proteasome subunit in mammals, Drosophila,and Schizosaccharomyces pombe but is not present in S. cerevisiae (28Holzl H. Kapelari B. Kellermann J. Seemuller E. Sumegi M. Udvardy A. Medalia O. Sperling J. Muller S.A. Engel A. Baumeister W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 52Lam Y.A., Xu, W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E.

Commun. 2000; 272: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy suggests that dUCH37 may be located on the periphery of the lid portion of PA700 inDrosophila (28Holzl H. Kapelari B. Kellermann J. Seemuller E. Sumegi M. Udvardy A. Medalia O. Sperling J. Muller S.A. Engel A. Baumeister W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A peripheral location could explain why its deletion has no effect on proteasome activity or structure. In addition, its lack of effect on growth or accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins suggests that it does not play an essential role in the cellular function of the proteasome and that its activity can be compensated for by other isopeptidases of S2 cells.Reduced expression of many individual subunits of the 26 S proteasome by RNAi resulted in increased expression of most other subunits both at the mRNA and protein levels. This phenomenon is similar to that reported previously in yeast, where Rpn4, a protein that associates loosely with the 26 S proteasome, is itself a rapidly degraded proteasome substrate (56Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Rpn4 functions as a transcription factor for many subunits of the proteasome as well as for other components of the ubiquitin pathway (57Mannhaupt G. Schnall R. Karpov V. Vetter I. Feldmann H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 58Kapranov A.B. Kuriatova M.V. Preobrazhenskaia O.V. Tiutiaeva V.V. Shtuka R. Feldmann H. Karpov V.L. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 2001; 35: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of proteasome function increases Rpn4 levels and leads to an increased production of proteasome complexes. Interestingly, the Drosophila genome does not contain a protein with significant overall sequence similarity to Rpn4 (34Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G.

Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4770) Google Scholar), although it may contain an as yet unidentified protein with an equivalent function. In any case, treatment of S2 cells with lactacystin did not promote increased expression of 26 S proteasome subunits, suggesting that inhibition of proteasome activity per se does not account for this response. Thus, the molecular mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of proteasome subunits as a consequence of RNAi remain to be defined. The fate of up-regulated subunits within cells appears to vary from subunit to subunit. For example, the increased 20 S proteasome subunits produced in response to RNAi of PA700 subunits appeared to assemble into functional 20 S proteasomes. In contrast, the increased 20 S proteasome subunits (e.g. dα7) produced in response to RNAi of another 20 S proteasome subunit, dβ5, accumulated as low molecular weight complexes that probably correspond to intermediates of 20 S proteasome assembly (50Schmidt M. Schmidtke G. Kloetzel P.M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 103-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fate of overexpressed PA700 subunits is less clear, although some appear to assemble into heteromultimeric complexes. For example, in response to RNAi of dRpt2, dRpn12 is detected in both the 26 S proteasome and in a low molecular weight complex that sediments more slowly than PA700. Obviously, a comprehensive analysis of the precise cellular fate of all subunits expressed during RNAi for any other subunit will require considerable additional work. dUCH37 is the only examined 26 S proteasome subunit whose targeting by RNAi did not induce up-regulation of at least some other subunits. This is consistent with the lack of effect of this target on other parameters of proteasome structure and function.Although RNAi of many 26 S proteasome subunits examined here had qualitatively similar effects to one another on multiple parameters, the relative magnitudes of these effects differed among the subunits. Such differences could result from different physiological roles of these subunits, but might also reflect differences in the magnitude of reduced expression of different subunits by RNAi. Combined with the functional contribution of residual proteasome activity due to the long half-life of most proteasome components, it is likely that even small differences in proteasome content could account for appreciable differences in given effects. For example, our failure to detect defined blocks in the cell cycle with RNAi may result from residual proteasome activity sufficient to promote cell cycle progression. The observed growth suppression may result from a nonspecific slowing of cell cycle progression in all phases combined with induction of apoptosis. In contrast, lactacystin inhibits proteasome activity rapidly and more completely than RNAi of most subunits, resulting in a clear block of the cell cycle and rapid induction of apoptosis.Despite its general impairment of the degradation of ubiquitin conjugates, RNAi of 26 S proteasome subunits does not completely prevent cell survival and proliferation. Therefore, compensatory mechanism(s) may be activated during RNAi, as indicated by increased resistance of dsRNA-treated cells to proteasome inhibitors. Preliminary experiments have failed to indicate changes in lysosomal function or in the activity of tripeptidylpeptidase II. 3C. Wójcik and G. N. DeMartino, unpublished results. The latter protease has been reported to be up-regulated in a leukemic cell line, adapted to grow in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (59Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari-Hartz M.

Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). With few known exceptions, proteins degraded by the 26 S proteasome must be covalently modified by a polyubiquitin chain (2DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

Rep. 1999; 26: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is attached to the substrate protein via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin and an ε-amino group of a particular lysine of the substrate protein. Ubiquitin monomers within the polyubiquitin chain are likewise linked by isopeptide bonds between the C-terminal carboxyl group and the ε-amino group of Lys-48 of the preceding ubiquitin (4Hershko A.

Polyubiquitin chains of this structure bind specifically to the 26 S proteasome, which then degrades the protein and releases free ubiquitin monomers. The 26 S proteasome is a 2,100,000-dalton protease complex composed of ∼64 subunits representing at least 32 different gene products. It is assembled from two multisubunit subcomplexes, the 20 S proteasome and PA700 (19 S complex). The 20 S proteasome is a 700,000-dalton protease composed of 28 subunits arranged as a cylinder-shaped stack of four heptameric rings. Both exterior rings contain one copy each of seven different but homologous α-type subunits. Likewise, both interior rings contain one copy each of seven different but homologous β-type subunits (2DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2060922035,"Calcium (Ca2+) influx through Ca2+-permeable ion channels plays a pivotal role in a variety of neuronal signaling processes, and negative-feedback control of this influx by Ca2+ itself is often equally important for modulation of such signaling. Negative modulation by Ca2+ through calmodulin (CaM) on cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels underlies the adaptation of olfactory receptor neurons to odorants. We show that this feedback requires two additional subunits of the native olfactory channel, CNGA4 and CNGB1b, even though the machinery for CaM binding and modulation is present in the principal subunit CNGA2. This provides a rationale for the presence of three distinct subunits in the native olfactory channel and underscores the subtle link between the molecular make-up of an ion channel and the physiological function it subserves."

Most of these studies overestimate the advance of spring events, as the calendar date of the vernal equinox shows a trend to become earlier throughout any century, although this bias is small in the examples published so far. However, its magnitude cannot be predicted for any data set that is extended into the twenty-first century, because of long-term changes in the date of the vernal equinox.

To date, 75G6Pase mutations (including 2 reported here) have been identified in GSD-1a patients on the basis of their absence from the normal population and/or their co-segregation with the disease phenotype (reviewed in Refs. 2Chou J.Y. Mansfield B.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and 3Chou J.Y. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 25-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 48 candidate mutations are missense mutations that result in single-amino acid substitutions. Characterization of these mutations will provide critical information on functionally important residues of the protein. In this study, we functionally characterize all 48 missense mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assays. A data base of residual enzymatic activity retained by the G6Pase mutants will serve as a reference for evaluating genotype-phenotype relationships and the minimal G6Pase activity required to correct the GSD-1a phenotype. Sequence alignment suggests that mammalian G6Pases, lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and vanadium haloperoxidases share a conserved phosphatase signature motif, and in G6Pase, this occurs between residues 76 and 180 (12Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase from the plant pathogenic fungusCurvularia inaequalis has been resolved (14Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The results show the active site residues in vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase are contained within the phosphatase signature motif. Based on the crystal structure and mechanism of action of vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase (13Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the amino acids predicted to participate in G6Pase catalysis include Lys76, Arg83, His119, Arg170, and His176. Five mutations that alter active site residues in G6Pase, K76N, R83C, R83H, H119L, and R170Q, have been identified in GSD-1a patients (4Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y.

R83C and R83H were shown to abolish phosphatase activity in transient expression assays (4Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 6Lei K.-J. Chen Y.-T. Chen H. Wong L.-J.C. Liu J.-L. McConkie-Rosell A. Van Hove J.L.K., Ou, H.C.-Y. Yeh N.J. Pan L.Y. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 766-771PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that K76N, H119L, and R170Q also completely abolish G6Pase activity, demonstrating the importance of these residues in G6Pase catalysis. Very little is known about the structural requirements for the correct folding and catalytic activity of G6Pase. We have shown that human G6Pase is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by nine transmembrane helices with the amino terminus in the lumen and the carboxyl terminus in the cytoplasm (18Pan C.-J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21658-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, the large collection of G6Pase mutations can now be studied in the context of their positions with respect to the ER and the cytoplasm. In this study, we undertake structure-function analysis of G6Pase. We show that amino acid residues that comprise the catalytic center and nonhelical regions in G6Pase play no essential role in the stability of the enzyme. On the other hand, the structural integrity of transmembrane helices is critical for the correct folding, stability, and enzymatic activity of G6Pase. Proteins with abnormal conformation are rapidly eliminated through intracellular protein degradation, which represents a quality control system in cells (20Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Cytosolic proteasomes are responsible for rapid degradation of many membrane proteins, including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (21Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

The availability of proteasome inhibitor allows a rapid analysis in intact cells of the possible contributions of protein breakdown by the proteasomes. In this study, we show that wild-type and mutant G6Pases are predominantly degraded in the ER through the proteasome pathway. The G6Pase gene in GSD-1a patients was characterized by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (28Orita M. Iwahana H. Kanazawa H. Hayashi K. Sekiya T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2766-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar) on mutation detection enhancement gels (AT Biochem, Malvern, PA) containing 5% glycerol. Exon-containing fragments were amplified by PCR using primers containing intronic, 5′-, and 3′-untranslated sequences of the human G6Pase gene as described previously (6Lei K.-J. Chen Y.-T. Chen H.

The mutation-containing fragments identified by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis were subcloned and characterized by DNA sequencing. Human G6Pase-DraIII (29Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L.

The eight-amino acid FLAG marker peptide, DYKDDDDK (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak, CT) was used to tag the amino or carboxyl terminus of G6Pase as described previously (18Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The two outside PCR primers for G6Pase mutants that contain mutations upstream of the DraIII site are nucleotides 77–96 (G1; sense) and nucleotides 625–602 of G6Pase-DraIII (I2; antisense) (29Lei K.-J.

The two outside primers for G6Pase R170Q, G184E, G184V, G188D, and G188R mutants are G1 and G2. After PCR, the amplified fragment was ligated into either the pSVLhG6Pase-DraIII-3′ fragment, the pSVLhG6Pase-DraIII-5′ fragment, or the pSVL fragment. The mutant primers are: M5R (nucleotides 83–103), ATG→AGG at position 5; T16A (nucleotides 116–136), ACA→GCA at position 16; Q20R (nucleotides 128–148), CAG→CGG at position 20; Q54P (nucleotides 230–250), CAG→CCG at position 54; W63R (nucleotides 257–277), TGG→CGG at position 63; G68R (nucleotides 272–292), GGA→CGA at position 68; K76N (nucleotides 296–316), AAG→AAC at position 76; W77R (nucleotides 299–319), TGG→CGG at position 77; G81R (nucleotides 311–331), GGA→CGA at position 81; T108I (nucleotides 392–412), ACC→ATC at position 108; T111I (nucleotides 401–421), ACT→ATT at position 111; P113L (nucleotides 407–427), CCA→CTA at position 113; H119L (nucleotides 425–445), CAT→CTT at position 119; G122D (nucleotides 434–454), GGC→GAC at position 122; A124T (nucleotides 440–460), GCA→ACA at position 124; W156L (nucleotides 535–555), TGG→TTG at position 156; V166A (nucleotides 566–586), GTC→GCC at position 166; R170Q (nucleotides 578–598), CGA→CAA at position 170; H179P (nucleotides 605–625), CAT→CCT at position 179; G184E (nucleotides 620–640), GGA→GAA at position 184; G184V (nucleotides 620–640), GGA→GTA at position 184; G188D (nucleotides 632–652), GGC→GAC at position 188; G188R (nucleotides 632–652), GGC→CGC at position 188; L211P (nucleotides 701–721), CTC→CCC at position 211; A241T (nucleotides 791–811), GCC→ACC at position 241; T255I (nucleotides 833–853), ACC→ATC at position 255; P257L (nucleotides 839–859), CCC→CTC at position 257; N264K (nucleotides 860–880), AAC→AAA at position 264; L265P (nucleotides 863–883), CTG→CCG at position 265; G266V (nucleotides 866–886), GGC→GTC at position 266; G270R (nucleotides 878–898), GGC→CGC at position 270; S298P (nucleotides 962–982), TCT→CCT at position 298; F322L (nucleotides 1034–1054), TTC→CTC at position 322; V338F (nucleotides 1082–1102), GTC→TTC at position 338; and I341N (nucleotides 1091–1111), ATC→AAC at position 341. The antisense primer for each mutant has the corresponding complementary sequence. Bold letters indicate nucleotide changes.

D38V-3′-FLAG and P178S-3′-FLAG mutants have been described previously (19Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21658-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum. Cells in 25-cm2 flasks were transfected with 10 μg of wild-type (WT) or mutant construct in a pSVL vector by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method as described previously (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1992: 9.2.1-9.2.6Google Scholar). To correct for transfection efficiency, 2 μg of pCMVβ (BD Biosciences,CLONTECH) was cotransfected with WT or mutant G6Pase cDNA construct. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 days, the transfected cultures were harvested for phosphohydrolase and β-galactosidase assays, Western blot analysis, or RNA isolation. Phosphohydrolase activity was determined essentially as described previously (4Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mmglucose-6-phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, and appropriate amounts of cell homogenates and were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Sample absorbance was determined at 820 nm and is related to the amount of phosphate released using a standard curve constructed by a stock of inorganic phosphate solution. Nonspecific phosphatase activity was estimated by preincubating cell homogenates at pH 5 for 10 min at 37 °C, a condition that inactivates the thermolabile G6Pase (31Hers H.G. Levine R. Luft L. Advances in Metabolic Disorders. 1. Academic Press, London1964: 1-44Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the release ofO-nitrophenol fromO-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.665 mg/mlO-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside. β-Galactosidase activity was estimated by absorbance at 420 nm using a β-galactosidase standard obtained from Promega Biotech. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen), fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde, and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) by electroblotting. The membranes were hybridized with either a G6Pase or β-actin probe labeled by random priming. For Western blot analysis of FLAG-tagged G6Pase, proteins in transfected COS-1 lysates were separated by electrophoresis through a 13% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and trans-blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were first incubated with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Scientific Imaging Systems) and then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Kirkegarrd & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The immunocomplex was detected with the horseradish peroxidase-linked chemiluminescence system containing the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate obtained from Pierce. In vitro transcription-translation of G6Pase cDNA constructs in a pGEM-11Zf(+) vector was performed using the troponin T-coupled reticulocyte lysate system obtained from Promega Biotech (Madison, WI). l-[35S]methionine was used as the labeled precursor. The in vitro synthesized proteins were analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis and fluoro-autoradiography. Single-strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing analyses were used to identify mutations in theG6Pase gene of four GSD-1a patients. Six different mutations were identified, including T255I, 158delC, 836delA, W70X, Q347X, and ΔF327 (Table I).

Glucose-6-phosphate hydrolytic activities of these mutants were examined after transient expression of WT or mutant G6Pase cDNA into COS-1 cells.

Activation of transmembrane Notch receptors results in proteolytic liberation of the intracellular domain of Notch, which translocates into the nucleus, binds a repressor (C promoter binding factor 1/RBP-Jκ, Su(H), and Lag-1 (CSL)), and induces target genes. We found that the intracellular domain of human Notch-1 (NIC-1) represses activator protein-1 (AP-1)-mediated transactivation. Because numerous genes that control immune and inflammatory responses are AP-1-dependent and Notch regulates immune cell function, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. Repression of AP-1 by NIC-1 did not represent a general inhibitory effect on transcription because nuclear factor κB-dependent transcription and transcription driven by a constitutive promoter and enhancer were not affected by NIC-1. The physiological relevance of the repression was supported by the facts that repression was apparent in multiple cell lines, endogenous AP-1 target genes were repressed, and similar concentrations of NIC-1 were required for CSL-dependent activation and AP-1 repression. The RBP-Jκ-associated molecule domain of NIC-1 that mediates CSL binding and distinct sequences necessary for transactivation were required for repression. However, there was not a strict correlation between the sequence requirements for CSL-dependent activation and AP-1 repression. Repression correlated with predominant nuclear localization of NIC-1 and was not accompanied by disruption of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase-dependent signaling events required for AP-1 activation or by defective AP-1 DNA binding activity. These results provide evidence for negative cross-talk between Notch and AP-1, which may have important consequences for controlling diverse biological processes.

Indeed, Notch signaling interacts with multiple signaling pathways including Ras (13Zecchini V. Brennan K. Martinez-Arias A. Curr.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2803-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence support the existence of physiological cross-talk between the Notch and Ras pathways. Notch mutants inDrosophila have elevated levels of the Ras-regulated stress-activated kinase JNK (13Zecchini V. Brennan K. Martinez-Arias A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 460-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting negative cross-talk between Notch and JNK pathways. In addition, Notch-1 and Notch-2 inhibit the E47 transcription factor, and this involves inhibition of Ras signaling, which is required for E47 activity (21Ordentlich P. Lin A. Shen C.P. Blaumueller C. Matsuno K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2230-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Moreover, during vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans, Notch-mediated transcriptional activation of the MAPK phosphatase LIP-1, which counteracts Ras-dependent MAPK signaling, establishes the basis for opposing Notch and Ras signals (23Berset T. Hoier E.F. Battu G. Canevascini S. Hajnal A. Science. 2001; 291: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ras signals are required for anchorage-independent growth of cancer cell lines derived from Notch-4-expressing transgenic mice (22Fitzgerald K. Harrington A. Leder P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although the consequences of interactions between Notch and Ras are just beginning to be investigated, such interactions would likely affect the activity of the transcription factor AP-1, a major nuclear target of Ras. AP-1 consists of homodimers of Jun family members or heterodimers of Jun and Fos proteins (33Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 401-412Crossref Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Growth factors, cytokines, and tumor promoters activate AP-1 as an integral step in their mechanism of action (34Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar), establishing a crucial role for AP-1 in many cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Dysregulation of AP-1 is a prototypical mechanism of tumor promotion (35Young M.R., Li, J.J. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Disruption of Notch signaling can also transform cells (36Capobianco A.J. Zagouras P. Blaumueller C.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

The mechanism of Ras-dependent AP-1 activation involves phosphorylation of c-Jun and Jun family members on amino-terminal serines (serines 63 and 73 for c-Jun) (40Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). These modifications are often mediated by JNK (41Derijard B. Hibi M., Wu, I.H. Barrett T., Su, B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar), but p38 can also catalyze phosphorylation at these sites (42Carter A.B. Tephly L.A. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33826-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of threonine 231 and serine 249 near the DNA binding domain of c-Jun represses DNA binding, and dephosphorylation confers high-affinity binding (43Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). c-Jun phosphorylated at serines 63 and 73 interacts with the coactivator CBP/p300 (44Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 confers transcriptional activation via histone and nonhistone protein acetylation (45Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which AP-1 utilizes CBP/p300 is unclear. An additional AP-1 coactivator is Jab1 (47Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toba T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), a component of the COP9 signalsome complex (48Wei N. Deng X.W.

Thus, AP-1 is a dynamically regulated nuclear effector of Ras and integrates diverse cellular signals. Here, we show that the intracellular domain of human Notch-1 (NIC-1) strongly represses AP-1-mediated transactivation. Given the growing array of biological processes that Notch controls, cross-talk between Notch and AP-1 is likely to have important physiological and pathophysiological implications.

HeLa cells (2.5 × 106) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 2 μg of the indicated NIC-1 construct. Cells were transfected using 8 μl of LipofectAMINE in a total volume of 2 ml of Optimem; 24 h after transfection, cells were plated at 5.0 × 104cells/well on 4-chamber glass slides. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (37Jeffries S. Capobianco A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3928-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using bTAN15A (54Zagouras P.S. Stifani C.M. Blaumueller M.L. Carcangiui M.L. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6414-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) for the primary antibody, followed by incubation with a donkey anti-rat Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were photographed on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope with a Hamamatsu digital camera at ×400 magnification. K562 cells were stably transfected by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene pulser electroporator. Cells (5 × 106) were washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS, mixed with 5 μg of linearized plasmid DNA, and subjected to electroporation (960 microfarads; 220 V) in a 0.4-cm-wide electroporation cuvette (BTX). pBabe and pNIC-1 were linearized with NotI. Cells were then added to 20 ml of complete IMEM, grown for 48 h, and diluted in complete IMEM containing 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (pools of K562-Babe and K562-NIC-1 cells). Stably transfected cells were analyzed for erythroid differentiation by benzidine staining as soon as the pools were generated to reduce the probability of phenotypic changes that may result from prolonged growth. Modified 293 human embryonic kidney cells were grown in 10-cm dishes until they were subconfluent, and then they were cotransfected with plasmid DNA (15 μg) and pMD.G (6 μg) by the calcium phosphate transfection method as described previously (55Miyamoto S. Seufzer B.J. Shumway S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was changed once after 10 h of transfection to remove the calcium phosphate. The pMD.G expression vector encodes the viral envelope protein vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The modified 293 cells were previously stably transfected withpol and gag genes (gift of Shigeki Miyamoto, University of Wisconsin Medical School). After incubation for an additional 12 h, the medium was removed, and K562 cells (10 ml; 3 × 105 cells/ml) were added with polybrene (4 μg/ml) in complete IMEM and incubated for 36 h. The infected cells were separated from adherent 293 cells and then subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. K562 cells (5 × 105) were collected by centrifugation at 240 ×g for 8 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 4 ml of complete IMEM. Plasmid DNAs (1 μg of reporter and 2 μg of effector) were added to 150 μl of IMEM, incubated with Superfect (4 μl/1 μg DNA; Qiagen) for 10 min at room temperature, and then added to cells. For transient transfection of HeLa cells, cells (2 × 105) were seeded in a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection. On the day of transfection, medium was removed, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and 600 μl of complete DMEM was added. Plasmid DNAs (1 μg of reporter and 2 μg of effector) were added to 150 μl of DMEM, incubated with 12 μl of Superfect (Qiagen) for 10 min at room temperature, and then added to cells. After a 3-h incubation, the mixture was removed, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and 4 ml of fresh complete DMEM was added. For each transfection, cells were incubated for 26 h after transfection and then treated with TPA (final concentration, 5 nm) or the vehicle (Me2SO). After incubation for another 12 or 16 h, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was normalized by the protein content of the lysates, as determined by Bradford assay using γ-globulin as a standard. Total RNA from K562-Babe and K562-NIC-1 cells was extracted with Triazol (Invitrogen). Ten μg of RNA per sample was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose, 6.6% formaldehyde gel and then transferred overnight to a Magnacharge nylon membrane (Osmonics). RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. Membranes were prehybridized for 30 min at 60 °C in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). Hybridization was performed using high specific activity 32P-labeled probes generated by random priming cDNA fragments. Blots were washed three times in 2× SSC/1% SDS and then washed three times in 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS (30 min per wash). Radioactivity was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). To detect the expression of Myc-tagged wild-type NIC-1 and NIC-1 mutants, whole cell lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were split into two aliquots and immunoprecipitated with either preimmune serum or anti-NIC 925 polyclonal antibody. Anti-NIC is a rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against amino acids 1759–2095 of human Notch-1 (37Jeffries S. Capobianco A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3928-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were collected by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on an 8% acrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) and detected by immunoblotting with the anti-Myc tag monoclonal antibody 9E10. CBF1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CBF1 polyclonal antisera. 2L. T. Lam and E. H. Bresnick, unpublished data. To measure the phosphorylation state of components of the MAPK pathway, K562-Babe and K562-NIC-1 cells (1 × 106) were collected after treatment with 5 nm TPA or Me2SO for 30 min. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and cell pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of ice-cold PBS and immediately boiled in 70 μl of SDS sample buffer for 10 min. Proteins (10 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). After blocking membranes in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST, membranes were incubated with primary antibody (diluted 1:1000 in dry milk/TBST). The following antibodies were used: (a) ERK1/2 and phospho-specific antibodies for ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun (Ser73) (product numbers 9102, 9101, 9211, and 9260, respectively; New England BioLabs), and (b) p38, JNK1, c-Jun, c-Fos, and phospho-specific antibody for JNK (product numbers sc-535, sc-474, sc-45, sc-253, and sc-6254, respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) was added at a dilution of 1:2500 in 5% dry milk/TBST to membranes incubated with anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added at a 1:3500 dilution to membranes incubated with anti-JNK1. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:5000 dilution for membranes incubated with anti-phospho-JNK. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:5000 dilution for membranes incubated with other antibodies. Antigen·antibody complexes were detected with ECL PlusTM (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (56Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). K562-Babe and K562-NIC-1 cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 150 ×g. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 1.5 volumes of nuclei lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) on ice for 3 min. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 × g. Nuclei were washed by gentle resuspension in 1.5 volumes of nuclei wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2) and then collected by centrifugation for 4 min at 600 × g. Nuclei were immediately resuspended in an equal volume of low KCl extract buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2,"
https://openalex.org/W1975417481,"A ligand binding to its transmembrane receptor can activate several different signaling pathways that indirectly switch on the transcription of target genes in the nucleus. As [Heldin and Ericsson][1] explain in their Perspective, new findings reveal that some receptors such as ErbB-4 can also take a more direct approach to activating gene transcription ([ Ni et al .][2]). Once bound to ligand, ErbB-4 is proteolytically cleaved twice. First the ectodomain is released, then intramembrane cleavage releases a cytoplasmic fragment, which moves to the nucleus where it may affect gene expression.

In the present study, we explored roles of tyrosine kinase Pyk2 in angiogenesis of pulmonary endothelial cells. We found that tyrosine kinase Pyk2 was particularly enriched in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and lung, a major organ site for tumor metastasis. By using adenovirus-mediated expression of various Pyk2 mutants, we demonstrated that Pyk2 tyrosine kinase activity was essential for the pulmonary vascular endothelial cell spreading, migration, morphogenesis, as well as pulmonary vein and artery angiogenesis ex vivo. We further showed that Pyk2 kinase activity was required for the expression of focal adhesion kinase, p130Crk-associated substrate, and its homologue human enhancer of filamentation 1, thus regulating formation of focal adhesions and cytoskeletal reorganization.

These results indicate that Pyk2 plays a crucial role in the pulmonary endothelial cell motility such as spreading and migration necessary for angiogenesis. Intensive studies have indicated that both tumor growth and metastasis to distant organs are dependent on angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. Anti-angiogenic therapy is currently believed to be a promising approach to cancer treatment (1Folkman J. Ann. Surg. 1972; 175: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 2Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is promoted by angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. Because tumor cells produce a wide array of angiogenic factors, it has been suggested that the best strategy for blocking angiogenesis is to repress the ability of endothelial cells to participate in the angiogenic process such as endothelial cell spreading and migration, rather than to prevent tumor cells from producing one particular angiogenic factor (3Zetter B.R. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 407-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar).

These findings suggest that Pyk2 plays a crucial role in the pulmonary endothelial cell motility such as spreading and migration necessary for angiogenesis. Monoclonal antibodies against Pyk2, FAK, phosphotyrosine (PY20), p130Cas and its homologue HEF1, paxillin, integrin β1, integrin β2, and caspase-3 were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibodies against integrins α2, α5, tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, caspase-3, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and monoclonal antibodies against FAK (H-1) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to actin and vinculin were purchased form Sigma. Monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin (AB-1) was obtained from Oncogene (Boston, MA). CyTM3-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and reagents for chemiluminescence detection were purchased from New England Biolabs. Rat pulmonary vein endothelial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and grown in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C as described previously (17Tang H. Zhao Z.J. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8389-8396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Pulmonary vein smooth muscle cells were prepared from the pulmonary vein of 12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) by the explant method and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin as described previously (18Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Imai T. Kanno K. Marumo F. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subcultured smooth muscle cells from passages 3 to 15 were used, which showed >99% positive immunostaining of smooth muscle α-actin antibody. B16 mouse melanoma cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells, NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured according to the supplier’s directions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). The rat Pyk2/CAKβ cDNA constructs including wild type, Pyk2-Y402F (tyrosine 402 to phenylalanine), and catalytically inactive Pyk2 mutant K457A (lysine 457 to alanine) were prepared as described previously (19Ishino M. Aoto H. Sasaski H. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A BstUI-DraIII fragment of wild type Pyk2 cDNA andBstUI-EcoRI fragments of Y402F and K457A Pyk2 mutant cDNAs, all containing the entire coding sequence, were blunted and inserted into the SwaI site of the adenovirus cosmid cassette, pAxCAwt (20Kanegae Y.

The pAxCAwt is a cassette cosmid containing a nearly full-length Ad5 genome with E1 and E3 deletions. Replication-defective recombinant adenovirus for expression of wild type, Y402F, and K457A Pyk2 mutants as well as control cosmid pAxCAwt alone were obtained by transfecting 293 cells with the above cosmids together with adenoviral DNA cut with EcoT221 according to the COS-TPC method (21Miyake S.

Viral clones were isolated and propagated further to assess restriction analysis, and expression of inserted genes and virus stocks were prepared by a standard procedure. Subconfluent cells were infected with the above replication-defective recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10–20 plaque-forming units/cell as described previously (19Ishino M. Aoto H. Sasaski H. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tissues of adult rats (Sprague-Dawley) were homogenized on ice in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain clarified lysates. For preparing cell lysates, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), containing 1 mmNa3VO4, and then lysed on ice in the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min as described previously (17Tang H. Zhao Z.J. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8389-8396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Tissue extracts or whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was probed with various primary antibodies as indicated and detected using the ECL system with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol. Pyk2 kinase activity was determined using exogenous substrate poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) (Sigma) as described previously (22Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of lysates from recombinant adenovirus-infected NIH-3T3 cells were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Pyk2 antibody. The immune complexes were collected and washed three times with the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 100 μm Na3VO4). The immunoprecipitates were then incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μg of poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction mixture (10 μl) was spotted on P81 Whatman paper. The papers were washed once with 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 10% trichloroacetic acid, twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and once with acetone, dried, and then counted in a scintillation counter. Cell culture plates (12-well) were pre-coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were then blocked by incubation with 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. PVECs infected with replication-defective recombinant adenovirus were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, washed once with serum-free medium, and resuspended in serum-free medium. The resuspended cells were passed through a 70-μm cell strainer (Falcon) to remove aggregated cells. Cells were then replated at a density of 2 × 105cells/well on fibronectin-coated 12-well plates and incubated in serum-free medium for indicated times at 37 °C in CO2incubator. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing twice with PBS, and the attached cells were then stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol. After washing with PBS, crystal violet staining was eluted with 0.1 n sodium citrate, pH 4.2, and optical absorbancy was measured at 595 nm using a microplate reader as described previously (23Zhang Z. Morla A.O. Vuori K. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). PVECs infected with replication-defective recombinant adenovirus were collected by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended and then replated on fibronectin-coated 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well as described above. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for indicated times at 37 °C in a CO2incubator and viewed under a phase-contrast microscope, and random fields were photographed. Spread cells were defined as cells with extended processes, not exhibiting a rounded morphology and not phase-bright, whereas nonspread cells were rounded and phase-bright. The numbers of spread cells were counted in at least five fields. Cell migration assay was determined employing a Boyden chamber assay. Polycarbonate filters (8 μm pore size, Costar) were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin overnight at 4 °C. The coated filters were air-dried and placed over the lower chambers that have been filled with 210 μl of serum-free medium or medium supplemented with 10% FBS or 25 ng/ml epithelial growth factor (EGF). The gasket and upper part of the chamber were then assembled. Cells infected with replication-defective recombinant adenovirus were collected by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in serum-free medium. To obtain clear data, the resuspended cells should be passed through a 70-μm cell strainer (Falcon) to remove aggregated cells. Cells at 105 cells in 0.2 ml were added to the upper chamber. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, cells on the upper side of the filters were mechanically removed, and the filters were fixed in methanol. Migrated cells on the under side of filters were stained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) and enumerated under a microscope at a total magnification of ×200. Five random microscopic fields were counted; all experiments were performed in duplicate. The in vitroangiogenesis was determined by measuring the formation of capillary-like structures of endothelial cells in Matrigel (Becton Dickinson Labware). Endothelial cells infected with replication-defective recombinant adenovirus were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in serum-free medium as described above. The resuspended cells were passed through a 70-μm nylon filter (Falcon) to remove aggregated cells. Cells were then replated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well on Matrigel (10 mg/ml)-coated 12-well plates and incubated in a medium supplemented with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 10% FBS for 4 h at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. The formation of endothelial cell tube-like structures was viewed under a phase-contrast microscope, and random fields were photographed. Tissue culture plates (12-well) were covered with 250 μl of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson Labware) and allowed to gel for 30–45 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Pulmonary vein and artery were excised from 12-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, and the fibroadipose tissue was removed. The vein and artery were sectioned into 1–2-mm-long cross-sections and rinsed 6 times with serum-free EBM medium (Clonetics Corp.). One vein or artery ring was placed with the lumen oriented horizontally on the center of each Matrigel-coated well, covered with an additional 250 μl of Matrigel, and allowed to gel for 30–45 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The rings were cultured for 24 h in 2 ml of serum-free EBM supplemented with penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml). After the 24-h incubation, the medium was removed, and the rings were infected with replication-defective recombinant adenovirus (1 × 109 plaque-forming units) on days 1 and 3. The cultures were kept incubated in EBM containing 2% FBS and 10 μg/ml gentamicin with medium changes every 2–3 days. Endothelial sprouts were observed and photographed on day 5 at a magnification of ×40. PVECs grown overnight on glass coverslips in a 6-well plate were infected with replication-defective recombinant adenovirus, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were extracted in ice-cold acetone at −20 °C for 5 min, washed, and preincubated in PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. For F-actin staining, coverslips were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with BODIPY® FL phallacidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1.2 units per coverslip in PBS containing 1% BSA. For vinculin stainings, coverslips were incubated with monoclonal antibody to vinculin (1:120 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 1% BSA, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with CyTM3-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 1% BSA. Control stainings were performed without either primary or secondary antibodies. After washing three times with PBS, coverslips were mounted on slides with the cell side down with CytosealTM and examined and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Unlike the nearly widespread distribution of FAK, Pyk2 expression is highly cell type- and tissue-specific (6Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 24Mitaka T. Shindoh M. Mochizuki Y. Sasaki H. Ishino M. Matsuya M. Ninomiya T. Sasaki T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the highest amount of Pyk2 was detected in rat pulmonary vein endothelial cells (PVEC). A high level of Pyk2 protein was also detected in pulmonary vein smooth muscle cells (PVSMC). Moreover, Pyk2 was detected in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In agreement with previous reports (6Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 24Mitaka T. Shindoh M. Mochizuki Y. Sasaki H. Ishino M. Matsuya M. Ninomiya T. Sasaki T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar), Pyk2 was barely detectable in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, B16 mouse melanoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). In contrast, a similar amount of FAK was detected in all cell types (Fig.1 A). Thus, Pyk2 was highly expressed in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells such as PVEC. To gain possible insight into the pathophysiologic significance of Pyk2, we determined the protein level of Pyk2 in adult rat tissues. As shown in Fig. 1 B (top), the Pyk2 protein level was particularly abundant in lung and brain. Pyk2 protein level was very low in aorta, adrenal gland, and kidney and was below the detectable threshold in heart and liver. In contrast, FAK was detected in all tissues except liver (Fig. 1 B, 2nd panel). Immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody, which recognizes p130Cas and its homologue HEF1 (9Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), revealed that p130Cas and HEF1 were highly expressed in lung and brain (Fig. 1 B, 3rd panel). On the other hand, the cell survival kinase Akt and a similar amount of the cytoskeletal protein vinculin were detected in all tissues. Thus, Pyk2 and focal adhesion proteins p130Cas and HEF1 are most abundant in the lung and brain. Because data obtained from a “gain of function” study by expressing a signaling molecule in cells lacking the protein may not really reflect the molecular physiological function, we performed a “loss of function” study by expressing Pyk2 dominant negative mutants in PVEC expressing endogenous Pyk2. To gain a sufficient expression level of Pyk2 mutants, we generated replication-defective recombinant adenovirus expressing catalytically inactive Pyk2 mutant K457A (AdPyk2-K457A), Pyk2-Y402F (AdPyk2-Y402F), Pyk2 wild type (AdPyk2), as well as control cosmid pAxCAwt only (Ad vector) according to the COS-TPC method (21Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The mutants were then characterized and confirmed in NIH-3T3 cells that do not express endogenous Pyk2. We found that mutation of the ATP-binding site lysine 457 to alanine completely abolished Pyk2 kinase activity as assessed by phosphorylation of the substrate poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1), confirming that Pyk2-K457A is a catalytically inactive mutant. Mutation of the principal autophosphorylation site tyrosine 402 to phenylalanine only slightly inhibited (22%) Pyk2 kinase activity toward poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1). These results are consistent with a recent report (22Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) using 293 cells. PVECs at subconfluence were then infected with AdPyk2-Y402F, AdPyk2-K457A, AdPyk2, or Ad vector for 16 h, and cell morphology was observed. As shown in Fig.2 A, expression of Pyk2 wild type did not affect PVEC morphology but slightly increased the rate at which cells reach confluence as compared with cells infected with Ad vector control. Overexpression of Pyk2-Y402F slowed the rate at which cells reach confluence but did not affect cell morphology, probably due to inhibition of cell growth (5Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 25Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the catalytically inactive mutant Pyk2-K457A was overexpressed, PVECs were aggregated, became small in size, and showed a rounded morphology (Fig.2 A). We also found that the aggregated PVECs adhered to a culture dish at a low strength because they can be relatively easily detached by aspiration compared with control cells. The effect was dependent on the infection dose or expression level of Pyk2-K457A and can be observed as early as 4 h post-infection and reached the maximal level between 12 and 24 h after infection (data not shown). As expected, overexpression of Pyk2-K457A did not affect cell morphology and cell confluence in NIH-3T3 and HUVEC cells that lack endogenous Pyk2 (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 C shows expression levels of the Pyk2 mutants in PVEC, NIH-3T3, and HUVEC. These data suggest that the physiological function of Pyk2 kinase activity is to regulate PVEC motility or cell-cell adhesion. We then investigated the effect of Pyk2-K457A on PVEC motility. We first examined PVEC viability. We found that over 99% PVECs treated with replication-defective recombinant adenovirus expressing Pyk2-K457A and other Pyk2 mutants were stained negative with trypan blue, indicating that they were alive. We also found that none of the Pyk2 mutants affected the activity of caspase-3, a critical enzyme in the process of apoptosis. These data indicate that none of the Pyk2 mutants affect the viability of PVEC. PVEC adhesion to fibronectin and spreading were then determined. Overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant K457A markedly suppressed (78%) PVEC spreading, whereas it had only a minor effect on PVEC adhesion at 5 and 10 min (Fig. 3, A andB). Neither the Pyk2 wild type nor Y402F mutant affected PVEC adhesion and spreading. Because cell adhesion-mediated spreading is a basis for cell migration, we determined the effect of Pyk2-K457A on PVEC migration. Cell migration was determined employing a Boyden chamber assay. As shown in Fig. 3 C, PVEC migration evoked by 10% FBS and EGF (25 ng/ml) were almost completely inhibited by overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant Pyk2-K457A. We also found that overexpression of Pyk2-K457A markedly inhibited cell migration of PVSMCs, which are the important component of vascular wall and express endogenous Pyk2. As expected, Pyk2-K457A did not affect the migration of NIH-3T3 lacking endogenous Pyk2 (data not shown). These results indicate that Pyk2 kinase activity is essential for PVEC spreading and migration. Endothelial cell adhesion and migration are essential for multiple steps of the angiogenic process. Later stages of angiogenesis require morphological alterations of endothelial cells, which result in lumen formation (26Yang E.Y. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We performed an in vitro model of angiogenesis in which PVECs are induced to form a network of capillary-like tubes by angiogenic factors, and we determined the effect of Pyk2 kinase activity on this process. As shown in Fig. 4 A, treatment with an angiogenic factor PMA (100 nm) for 4 h clearly induced a network of capillary-like structure in PVEC infected with Ad vector. However, the PMA-induced capillary-like tube formation was virtually abolished by overexpression of Pyk2-K457A in PVEC (Fig. 4 A). Similar capillary-like structure formation stimulated by 10% FBS for 4 h was also virtually abolished by the Pyk2 catalytically inactive mutant (data not shown). We next determined the effects of Pyk2 kinase activity on angiogenesis using an ex vivo model with intact vascular explants, which may be closer to the in vivocondition than that with isolated endothelial cells. We investigatedex vivo angiogenesis using rings of rat pulmonary vein or artery as a source of vasoformative endothelial cells. Pulmonary vein rings are soft and readily collapse; thus it is hard to place them with the lumen oriented horizontally in Matrigel. As shown in Fig.4 B, dense vessel sprouting was observed from pulmonary vein rings infected with the Ad vector control. However, the vessel sprouting from the vein ring was markedly suppressed by infection with AdPyk2-K457A. A similar effect was observed when pulmonary artery angiogenesis assay was employed. Pulmonary arterial rings are rigid and can be placed with the lumen oriented horizontally in Matrigel. As shown in Fig. 4 B (bottom), the vessel sprouting from pulmonary artery rings was also clearly suppressed by overexpression of Pyk2-K457A. These data indicate that Pyk2 kinase activity is critical for endothelial"

All 39 VH elements (with their adjacent heptamer/nonamer signal) were tested for site-specific cleavage with purified human core RAG1 and RAG2, and HMG1 proteins in a 12/23-coupled cleavage reaction. Both nicking and hairpin formation were measured. The individual VH cleavage efficiencies vary over nearly a 30-fold range. These measurements will be useful in considering the factors affecting the generation of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor repertoires in the adult humans. Interestingly, when these cleavage efficiencies are summed for each of the VH families, the six VHfamily efficiencies correspond closely to the observed profile of unselected VH family usage in the peripheral B cells of normal adult humans. This correspondence raises the possibility that the dominant factor determining VH element utilization within the 1-megabase human genomic VH array is simply the individual RAG cleavage efficiencies.

This correspondence raises the possibility that the dominant factor determining VH element utilization within the 1-megabase human genomic VH array is simply the individual RAG cleavage efficiencies. The antigen receptor repertoire is a composite of many factors (1Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 2Lieber M.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1323-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One major factor is the efficiency with which the V, D, and J elements are cleaved by the recombinase complex. This complex contains RAG1 and RAG2 proteins (recombination activating genes), along with HMG1 (or HMG2). The RAG complex binds to the heptamer/nonamer signal sequences (also called RSS 1The abbreviations used are:RSSrecombination signal sequenceIgimmunoglobulinGSTglutathioneS-transferaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are:RSSrecombination signal sequenceIgimmunoglobulinGSTglutathioneS-transferaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid for recombination signal sequences) associated with each V, D, or J element. The RAG complex makes an initial nick adjacent to the heptamer of each signal and then generates a hairpin configuration at that site at the coding end terminus of the V, D, or J element (4McBlane J.F. Gent D.C. v. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The hairpin formation at the coding end results in a blunt-ended double-strand break at the end of the signal (4McBlane J.F. Gent D.C. v. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). A single recombination event involves two elements, such as a V and a J, or a D and a J, or a V and a DJ. The two elements always have recombination signal sequences (RSS) that are different in the spacing between their heptamer and nonamer (12 or 23 base pairs), and this is known as the 12/23 rule (5Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). The 12/23 rule is enforced at the hairpin formation step by the RAG complex (6vanGent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Gellert M.

The two coding ends (a D and a J, or a V and a DJ, for example) are joined by the nonhomologous DNA end joining repair pathway (2Lieber M.R. Am. J.

The two signal ends are also joined together by nonhomologous DNA end joining to form a signal joint. recombination signal sequence immunoglobulin glutathioneS-transferase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid recombination signal sequence immunoglobulin glutathioneS-transferase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid There is a consensus sequence for the heptamer (CACAGTG) and for the nonamer (ACAAAAACA). This consensus appears to be the optimal one for V(D)J recombination. However, the actual RSS associated with each V, D, and J element usually deviates considerably from the consensus. The variations affect recombination efficiency over several orders of magnitude (10Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Mizuuchi K. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1053-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 11Akira S. Okazaki K. Sakano H. Science. 1987; 238: 1134-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, the terminal two or three coding end nucleotides also influence the efficiency of nicking at the adjacent signal, and this coding end effect can influence the efficiency of recombination by an additional one to two orders of magnitude (12Gerstein R.M. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Boubnov N.V. Wills Z.P. Weaver D.T.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4191-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Of the more than 109 possible combinations of heptamer and nonamer variations, only a small number (fewer than 100) of the possible variations have been tested (10Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Mizuuchi K. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1053-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 11Akira S. Okazaki K. Sakano H.

Hence, although some of the principles have been established concerning how signal and coding end sequence can influence V(D)J recombination, the recombination or cleavage efficiencies of the actual V, D, and J elements relative to one another have not been systematically determined for any of the human or murine loci. Therefore, the actual efficiencies cannot be deduced from the current literature, and direct experiments are required to determine the efficiencies that generate the repertoire of the antigen receptor loci. Another factor that is known to influence V(D)J recombination is chromatin structure (17Alt F.W. Blackwell T.K. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1987; 238: 1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). There are six antigen receptor loci, and they do not undergo recombination simultaneously because of differences in chromatin structure. CpG methylation is one major factor that determines the accessibility of any vertebrate genetic locus (18Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Engler P. Haasch D. Pinkert C.A. Doglio L. Glymour M. Brinster R. Storb U.

Biol. 1993; 13: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the antigen receptor loci are no exception. CpG methylation is typically accompanied by histone deacetylation, which results in a tighter association between the nucleosome and the DNA wrapped around it. When RAG cleavage assays have been done on short DNA fragments that accommodate one nucleosome, cleavage is suppressed (21Kwon J. Imbalzano A.N. Matthews A. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22Kwon J. Morshead K.B. Guyon J.R. Kingston R.E. Oettinger M.A. Mol.

Although chromatin structure clearly determines the RAG complex accessibility differences between the six antigen receptor loci, it has been uncertain whether such effects influence the differential V, D, or J element utilization within any one locus. Individual active antigen receptor loci that have been examined have acetylated histones throughout the locus (25McMurry M.T. Krangel M.S. Science. 2000; 287: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), consistent with much earlier data indicating that active antigen receptor loci are hypomethylated (26Storb U. Arp B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Mather E.L. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4689-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In neonatal mice, it has been observed that VH segments in proximity to the JH cluster are used more frequently than the distal VH segments (28Jeong H.D. Komisar J.L. Kraig E. Teale J.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2436-2441PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jeong H.D. Teale J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Wu G.E. Atkinson M. Ramsden D. Paige C.J.

Komisar J.L. Kraig E. Teale J.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2436-2441PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jeong H.D. Teale J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Wu G.E.

Ramsden D. Paige C.J. Semin. Immunol. 1990; 2: 207-216PubMed Google Scholar). If there is a small bias in fetal human, it might suggest that in mouse and, to a lesser extent, in human, the locus opening (chromatin change) emanates from the intron enhancer during early development and that this proximity effect dissipates with progression to adulthood. This is especially obvious in humans where it is clear that, in adults, there is no proximity preference within the Ig heavy chain locus (30Wu G.E. Atkinson M. Ramsden D. Paige C.J. Semin. Immunol. 1990; 2: 207-216PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schroeder H.W. Hillson J.L. Perlmutter R.M. Science. 1987; 238: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 34Gokmen E. Raaphorst F.M.

Once the primary repertoire is generated as a result of recombination and overlying chromatin effects, positive and negative selective forces shape the repertoire into its observed profile in the peripheral blood. Here, we have examined each of the VH elements in the six human VH families for their efficiency in the initial stages of V(D)J recombination by using human core RAG complexes to cleave oligonucleotide fragments encompassing the signal and the adjacent coding end nucleotides. We find that the cleavage efficiency of each of the six families corresponds very closely to data for the nonproductive VH usage observed in the peripheral B cells of normal adult humans. This significant similarity suggests that the initial (unselected) VH repertoire in the adult human adult is determined to a significant extent by the recombination cleavage efficiency. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). Cleavage substrates were made by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides to form a blunt-ended double-stranded DNA. Each cleavage substrate contains a 15-bp (base pair) coding flank and a 5-bp flank on the nonamer side. The sequences of each VH are listed in Fig. 1. The substrate with the 12-bp spacer RSS that was chosen for pairing with each VHelement was derived from the left (upstream) side of the human DH4-4 substrate (also called DA4). It is made by annealing oligonucleotides KY106 (5′-GGT AGT TAC TGT AGT CAC ACA GTA GGA GGA CCC TTC ACA AAA AGC CCC TG-3′) and KY107 (5′-CAG GGG CTT TTT GTG AAG GGT CCT CCT ACT GTG TGA CTA CAG TAA CTA CC-3′). The pre-nicked DH4-4 substrate is composed of ML126, ML127, and KY107, which were annealed (see below) in molar ratios of 1:1:2. The sequences are as follows. ML126 (5′-GGT AGT TAC TGT AGT CA-3′) and ML127 (5′-pC ACA GTA GGA GGA CCC TTC ACA AAA AGC CCC TG-3′). We polyacrylamide gel-purified the full-length form of each oligonucleotide. We then determined the concentration spectrophotometrically. Each cleavage substrate was labeled at the 5′-end of the coding flank with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unincorporated radioisotope was removed by using G-25 Sephadex (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) spin-column chromatography. It is important to note that labeled oligonucleotides were mixed with twice the molar amount of unlabeled complementary oligonucleotides in a buffer containing 10 mmTris-hydrochloride, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl (37Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool down to room temperature for more than 1 h. The amount of unannealed labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide was less than 5% in all cases (and was typically at undetectable levels (less than 2%)). Human RAG expression plasmids (core RAG1: amino acids 383–1008 and full-length RAG2) were kindly provided by Dr. Sadro Santagata and Dr. Patricia Cortes. The core RAG2 (amino acids 1–383) expression vector was made by inserting the corresponding PCR fragment into the pEBG vector (38Weis-Garcia F. Besmer E. Sawchuk D.J., Yu, W., Hu, Y. Cassard S. Nussenzweig M. Cortes P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6379-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sequence was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Recombinant human RAG proteins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins by cotransfection of RAG1 (core) and RAG2 (core) expression vectors into the human epithelial cell line 293T. (Previous work demonstrates the similar kinetics of nicking and hairpin formation for GST versus maltose binding protein RAG fusion proteins (8West R.B. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6408-6415Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).) The coexpressed human core RAG proteins were then purified with glutathione-agarose (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). C-terminal truncated mouse HMG1 was expressed in bacteria as a six-histidine-tagged protein and purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Protein concentration was determined against known concentrations of bovine serum albumin (fraction V) on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel with a densitometer (Model GS710, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and quantified with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A 5-μl reaction mixture containing 10 fmol of a 32P-labeled VH substrate, 10 fmol of unlabeled DH4-4 (DA4), and 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm potassium chloride, 30 mm potassium glutamate, 1 pmol of HMG1, and 20 ng of RAGs was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of formamide and immediately heated to 100 °C for 5 min before plunging into ice water. At least two independent cleavages on two independent gels were done for every VH. In addition, independent annealings were done on a subset of VH segments that deviated more than expected relative to the most similar VH elements. The independent annealings were indistinguishable. Five femtomoles of each substrate of the two specified substrates was used (see Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 6). Ten femtomoles was used when only one substrate is involved. The difference in band intensity for equal molar amounts of substrate is simply due to labeling efficiency differences. Such labeling efficiency differences are not a complication, because equal molar amounts are used, and the conversion to nicked and hairpin products is expressed as a percentage of the substrate input in that reaction. Reaction products were separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 7m urea in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were visualized by autoradiography with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445SI (Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified with ImageQuaNT software (version 5). Evaluations of the correlation between RAG nicking (or hairpin formation) and published values for nonproductive rearrangements were done as follows. The RAG nicking contribution (expressed as a percentage) for each VH family relative to the total was calculated as described in TableI. The nonproductive rearrangement frequencies are taken from Refs. 37Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar and 38Weis-Garcia F. Besmer E. Sawchuk D.J., Yu, W., Hu, Y. Cassard S. Nussenzweig M. Cortes P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6379-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar. The RAG nicking percentage was plotted versus the nonproductive rearrangement frequency for each of the six families. The correlation coefficient was determined, and a probability value, p, was calculated, as given in Table I.Table IFrequencies for VH family in vitro RAG cleavage and for nonproductive rearrangements in human peripheral bloodRAG nickingRAG hairpinningNonproductive rearrangements1-aThe data for VH usage among nonproductive rearrangements in human peripheral B cells is from Table III of Ref. 49 and Table I of Ref.50 by the Lipsky laboratory.Percentage if all VH used equally1-bThe theoretical VH usage, if each VH has equal usage frequency, and the repertoire is merely a reflection of the family size.VH19.88.71023.1VH25.79.94.67.7VH348.953.74548.7VH427.820.53315.4VH55.24.94.52.6VH62.62.23.02.6For RAG nicking, we summed the percentages of nicked product (at 30 min) for all 39 VH substrates (this sum is 462.4). We then took the percentage nicked (at 30 min) for each individual VH and divided it by 462.4. This gives the percentage that each individual VH would be expected to contribute to the repertoire.

The sequence alignment of all 39 functional human VH elements in the region relevant to V(D)J recombination (the heptamer and nonamer of the recombination signal sequence and the 15 bp of coding flank) illustrates that only five of the heptamer/nonamer signals conform to the CACAGTG/ACAAAAACC consensus (Fig.1) (39Matsuda F. Ishii K. Bourvagnet P. Kuma K. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Honjo T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These five are VH3-9, 3-43, 4-34, 4-39, and 4-59. The most common sequence of the VH elements is shown in the top line, and this sequence differs from the optimal heptamer/nonamer in the fourth position of the nonamer. Five of the 39 VH elements have heptamers that deviate from the optimal sequence, and 33 VHelements have nonamers that deviate from the optimal sequence. The effects of these deviations on recombination efficiency cannot be reliably estimated from the current knowledge of the limited number of tested signal sequence variations. The VH elements have previously been grouped into six families based on the VH coding sequence (39Matsuda F. Ishii K. Bourvagnet P. Kuma K. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Honjo T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Within each of the six VH families, the 23-bp spacer region between the heptamer and the nonamer is highly homologous. The most distinct deviation is seen for the nine members of family 1, which, by comparison, have unique nonamer sequences and spacers relative to members from the other VH families. Previous work has demonstrated that the RAG cleavage efficiency of each substrate is determined by its similarity to the optimal signal sequence (40Ramsden D.A. McBlane J.F. Gent D.C. v. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 41vanGent D.C. McBlane J.F. Ramsden D.A. Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Cell. 1995; 81: 925-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) as well as for the coding end sequence adjacent to the signal (42Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8094-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These biochemical cleavage efficiencies correspond very well with cellular V(D)J substrate quantitation, in those cases where equivalent substrates have been compared (12Gerstein R.M. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 42Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8094-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We determined the RAG cleavage efficiency of each human VH element by using oligonucleotide-based DNA substrates, synthesized to correspond to the published sequences of human functional VH elements. Each VH substrate contains a 15-bp flank on the heptamer side (coding flank) and a 5-bp flank on the nonamer side. Previous studies have documented that these lengths of extension beyond the heptamer/nonamer signal are sufficient to recapitulate any surrounding sequence effects (42Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8094-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Kim D.R. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4679-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One strand of each double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled such that the nicked product and the hairpin product could be distinguished from the substrate on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (42Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8094-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 44Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cleavage was carried out with purified human RAG proteins with Mg2+ as the divalent cation. A 12-bp RSS partner substrate is necessary for the 12/23 coupling at the hairpin formation step (8West R.B. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6408-6415Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and this must be the same partner for all of the VH substrates to allow comparison. We chose DH4-4 (also called DA4), which is efficiently cleaved by the human RAG complex (data not shown). However, it is important to note that the nicking step is independent of the presence or absence of a partner signal (44Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Each VH substrate was assayed in replicate sets of experiments. To compare the different sets, an optimal 23-bp spacer substrate (KY36/37) was included in each set as a standard to normalize for any slight variations of cleavage efficiency. Human core RAG1 and RAG2 were used rather than the more commonly used murine core RAG1 and 2, because we were interested in establishing the relative cleavage efficiencies of the human VH repertoire. The reaction time courses conformed to the expected kinetics for nicking and hairpin formation (41vanGent D.C. McBlane J.F. Ramsden D.A. Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Cell. 1995; 81: 925-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 44Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 45Eastman Q.M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4370-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the products increased over the initial 50 min when incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 2). Cleavage efficiency was determined as the percentage of the substrate that is converted to the nicked or hairpin product at the 30-min time point. Although we used initial reaction rates in our previous study (44Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the 30-min time point permits greater precision when comparing 39 different substrates. The nicking and hairpin formation of a subset of the human VH elements are illustrated in Fig.3. Each VH element was analyzed in two independent experiments in duplicate, and the degree of concordance between measurements was quite good, as reflected in the standard deviations (Fig. 1).Figure 3In vitro RAG cleavage of VH substrates.

When monitored by protein intrinsic fluorescence or circular dichroism spectral changes, an unfolding of the enzyme in urea at 25 °C and pH 7.4 revealed a biphasic phenomenon with an intermediate state detected at 4–5m urea. The enzyme activity was activated by urea up to 1 m but was completely lost before the intermediate state was detected. This suggests that the active site region of the enzyme was more sensitive to chemical denaturant than other structural scaffolds. In the presence of 4 mm Mn2+, the urea denaturation pattern of malic enzyme changed to monophasic. Mn2+ helped the enzyme to resist phase I urea denaturation. The [urea]0.5 for the enzyme inactivation shifted from 2.2 to 3.8 m. Molecular weight determined by the analytical ultracentrifuge indicated that the tetrameric enzyme was dissociated to dimers in the early stage of phase I denaturation.

Pigeon liver malic enzyme ((S)-malate:NADP+oxidoreductase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating), EC 1.1.1.40) is a homotetrameric enzyme with a double dimer quaternary structure. It catalyzes the divalent metal ion-dependent reversible oxidative decarboxylation of l-malate to yield CO2 and pyruvate with a concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. Cytosolic malic enzyme was first discovered in pigeon liver by Ochoaet al. (1Ochoa S. Mehler A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 871-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was later found to be widespread in nature, from bacteria to human, in both cytosol and mitochondria. In animals and human, the major physiological function of the enzyme is in providing NADPH for the de novo biosynthesis of long chain fatty acids (2Frenkel R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regulat. 1975; 9: 157-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 3Goodridge A.G. Klautky S.A. Fantozzi D.A. Baillie R.A. Hodnett D.W. Chen W. Thurmond D.C., Xu, G. Roncero C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 89-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In tumor cells, the mitochondrial malic enzyme is involved in the glutamine metabolism. This provides an energy source for the malignant cells (4Kovacevic Z. Morris H.P. Cancer Res. 1972; 32: 326-333PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sauer L.A. Dauchy R.T. Nagel W.O. Morris H.P. J. Biol.

Rutter and Lardy (7Rutter W.J. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 374-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first characterized the requirement of an externally added metal ion in the catalytic mechanism of the malic enzyme. Detailed electron spin resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance studies have delineated the fundamental role of Mn2+ in the malic enzyme-catalyzed reaction (8Hsu R.Y. Mildvan A.S. Chang G.G. Fung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6574-6583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the crystal structure of both mitochondrial and cytosolic malic enzyme having been solved (9Xu Y. Bhargava G., Wu, H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure. 1999; 7: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Yang Z. Floyd D.L. Loeber G. Tong L. Nat. Struct.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the role of the metal ion in the reaction mechanism of malic enzyme has become clearer. The metal ligands of the enzyme include Asp-258, Glu-234, Asp-235, C-1 carboxylate and C-2 hydroxyl of the substratel-malate, plus a water molecule at the active site. The metal ion in the enzymatic reaction serves as a bridge betweenl-malate and the enzyme and functions to properly position the substrate l-malate at the active center as well as helping to polarize of the C-2 hydroxyl group in the initial stage. Subsequent decarboxylation of oxaloacetate is also catalyzed by the metal ion, which acts as a Lewis acid. The metal ion here plays a vital role in chelating the negatively charged enolate pyruvate intermediate (10Yang Z. Floyd D.L. Loeber G. Tong L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12O'Leary M.H. Stigman D.S. The Enzymes. Third Ed. Academic Press, New York1992: 236-269Google Scholar, 13Chou W.Y. Kuo C.C. Hung H.C. Huang T.M. Chang G.G. J. Med. Sci. 2001; 21: 201-206Google Scholar). The effect of metallation on the structural integrity of the malic enzyme, however, has never been explored. In the present work, we examined the urea-induced conformational changes of pigeon liver malic enzyme in the presence or absence of manganese ion. The structural role of metal ion was elucidated by utilizing various mutants with a defective metal binding ability. Site-directed mutagenesis of pigeon liver malic enzyme was carried out according to the procedures of Kunkel et al. (14Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotides used as mutagenic primers were: E234Q, 5′-CATTCAGTTTCAGGATTTTGC-3′; D235N, 5′-CAGTTTGAGAACTTTGCTAATG-3′; E234Q/D235N, 5′-CATTCAGTTTCAGAACTTTGC-3′; in which the mutation positions are highlighted and underlined in the oligonucleotide sequence. The pET21-ME recombinant phagemids were amplified in the ung − anddut − CJ236 Escherichia coli strain with helper phage R408 for preparation of the uracil-containing DNA template. The latter was then annealed with phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotides and in vitro extended and ligated by T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase, respectively. The mutated DNA was screened by transforming it into the ung + anddut + JM109 E. coli strain, and the surviving colonies were further identified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing (15Sanger F. Nicklen D. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52865) Google Scholar). The entire cDNA was also sequenced to exclude any unexpected mutations resulting from the in vitro DNA polymerase extension. The wild type and mutated plasmids were transformed into BL21 bacteria. The transformants were incubated in LB medium and induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and then cultured overnight. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min. Following sonication, the recombinant enzymes were purified by two chromatographic steps according to Chou et al. (16Chou W.Y. Huang S.M. Chang G.G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When subjected to SDS-PAGE, all purified enzyme preparations show a single protein band with a molecular weight of ∼62,000. This is consistent with the molecular weight (62,061) calculated from the amino acid sequence of the enzyme subunit (17Chou W.Y. Huang S.M. Liu Y.H. Chang G.G. Arch. Biochem.

The recombinant WT 1The abbreviations used are:WTwild typeANS1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acidCDcircular dichroism malic enzyme has an identical amino acid sequence and thus has the same physicochemical properties as those of the natural malic enzyme as characterized previously (16Chou W.Y.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). wild type 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid circular dichroism Malic enzyme activity was assayed according to the published procedure (16Chou W.Y. Huang S.M. Chang G.G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the protein-dye binding method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). Apparent Michaelis constants for the substrate and cofactors were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate (or cofactors) around its K m value and maintaining the other components constant at the saturation level. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting experimental data to appropriate kinetic models. The calculation was carried out with the EZ-FIT (19Perrella F.W. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) or Sigma Plot 5.0 program (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). The urea solutions were freshly prepared daily. WT or mutant malic enzymes preincubated with or without 4 mm Mn2+ were denatured with various concentrations of urea in Tris acetate buffer (0.1m, pH 7.4) at 25 °C for 1 h. The unfolding of the enzyme was monitored by fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectra, and enzyme activity loss. For the equilibrium urea denaturation experiments, the fluorescence spectrum was also recorded at various times between 0 and 3 h to detect any time-dependent spectrum change. One hour of incubation was found to be enough for the denaturation to reach equilibrium. Fluorescence spectra of the recombinant malic enzymes were analyzed with a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer at 25 °C. All spectra were corrected for the buffer absorption. The Raman spectrum of water was also corrected. Both the red shift and the fluorescence intensity changes were analyzed together using the average emission wavelength method (cf. 20). The average emission wavelength (<λ>) was calculated according to Equation 1,<λ>=∑Fiλi/∑FiEquation 1 in which Fi is the fluorescence intensity at the specific emission wavelength (λi). CD measurements were made with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length cell and averaging the three repetitive scans between 250 and 200 nm. Parallel spectra of urea without protein were also recorded and subtracted from the sample spectra. Mean residue ellipticity (Φ) was obtained by Equation 2,[Φ]222=ΦMMRW/10dcEquation 2 in which 111.42 was used for MMRW, the mean amino acid residue weight. d is the cell path in cm, andc is the enzyme concentration in mg/ml. In the enzyme activity measurements, control experiments were performed simultaneously with the same amount of urea added into the assay mixture. The sensitivity of WT and various mutant malic enzymes to thermal denaturation was examined by CD, for which an automatic programmable thermal control of the circulating water bath was used (Neslab, model RTE 111, Newington, NH). The enzyme in borate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) was preincubated with or without 4 mm Mn2+, and the enzyme solution was heated from 30 to 95 °C with a 0.5 °C interval increment. The enzyme conformational change was monitored by ellipticity at 222 nm. Quenching titrations with acrylamide were performed at 25 °C by sequentially adding aliquots of the concentrated quencher stock solution (6 m, pH 7.4) to the enzyme solution. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm and the fluorescence emission spectra were scanned from 300 to 400 nm. The integration area between 330 and 360 nm was used for data analysis. The inner filter effect due to acrylamide absorption was corrected according to the method of Calhoun et al. (21Calhoun D.B. Vanderkooi J.M. Englander S.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The fluorescence quenching data in the presence of acrylamide was analyzed by the Stern-Volmer equation shown in Equation 3 (22Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar),Fo/F=1+Ksv·[Q]Equation 3 in which F o and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence or presence of the quencher, respectively. K sv is the dynamic Stern-Volmer quenching constant, and [Q] is the quencher concentration. When the Stern-Volmer plot displayed an upward curvature, the static quenching concept was used and the experimental data were fitted to a revised Stern-Volmer equation shown in Equation 4 (22Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar),Fo/F=(1+Ksv[Q])exp(V[Q])Equation 4 in which V is the static quenching constant measuring the complex formation between acrylamide and the enzyme. Binding of ANS with the unfolded enzyme was accessed by measuring the fluorescence enhancement of ANS. The excitation wavelength was set at 370 nm, in which ANS has an extinction coefficient of 5,620 m−1cm−1 (23Hung H.C. Chang G.G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3456-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The emission spectra were integrated from 420 to 560 nm. All measurements were corrected for the background intensity of the buffer. The molecular mass of the enzyme under various conditions were estimated by a Beckman-Coulter XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with an An60Ti rotor. Sedimentation velocity was performed at 20 °C and 40,000 rpm with standard double sectors aluminum centerpieces. The UV absorption of the cells was scanned every 5 min for 2 h. The data were analyzed with the SedFit program (24Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium was performed at 20 °C with six-channel epon centerpieces and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 12 h. The data was analyzed with software provided by Beckman-Coulter. The solvent density and viscosity in the presence of urea were corrected with the UltraScan II (website: www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu/). The partial specific volume of malic enzyme was 0.7403 (25Nevaldine B.H. Bassel A.R. Hsu R.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 283-293Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All samples were visually checked for clarity after ultracentrifugation, and no indication of precipitation was observed. The intrinsic fluorescence is a sensitive probe to monitor the conformational change of a protein. We have examined the fluorescence of the native malic enzyme (26Lee H.J. Chen Y.H. Chang G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 955: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Almost identical results were obtained with the recombinant malic enzymes. When excited at 280 nm, the recombinant WT malic enzyme showed a fluorescence spectrum with a maximum at 324 nm (Fig. 1 A,closed circles). After denaturing with urea, there was a large red-shifting of the fluorescence to 356 nm (Fig. 1 A,open triangles). The fluorescence intensity decreased as the urea concentration increased. Under the same conditions but excited at 295 nm, the maximum emission wavelength of the enzyme changed from 333 to 359 nm (not shown). Analysis of the secondary structure of the enzyme by CD spectrum also showed a decreasing signal as the urea concentration increased (Fig. 1 B). The fluorescence and CD signals thus provide excellent tools in monitoring the conformational changes of malic enzyme during the unfolding process. When the enzyme was incubated with various concentrations of urea and the unfolding reached an equilibrium, a gradual red shift of the fluorescence spectrum, change of CD spectrum, and loss of enzymatic activity were observed (Fig.2 A). Both the shifting of fluorescence wavelength and ellipticity at 222 nm with varying urea concentrations indicated a highly reproducible biphasic denaturation curve, suggesting a three state-unfolding model. The [urea]0.5 corresponding to the N ↔ I and I ↔ U processes were estimated to be 3.1, 5.6, and 3.4, 5.5m, respectively, for the fluorescence and CD data. The integrated area of the fluorescence profile showed a steady state in low urea concentrations (<1.2 m), followed by a decreasing signal along with the inactivation of enzyme activity. Interestingly, there was a peak between 2.5 and 6 m urea, which coincided exactly with the transition region of the biphasic phenomenon observed in the fluorescence and CD spectra as described above. When the enzyme denaturation was monitored by enzyme activity loss, concentrations of urea of less than 1.2 m activated the enzyme activity. The [urea]0.5 corresponding to the activation and inactivation processes were estimated to be 1.0 and 2.2m, respectively. The malic enzyme catalyzed reaction is metal-dependent with Mn2+ as the most effective cofactor. When malic enzyme was preincubated with an excess of Mn2+ and then treated with various concentrations of urea, there was a remarkable change of the unfolding pathway as shown in Fig.2 B. The unfolding of the malic enzyme shifted from a biphasic three-state phenomenon to a sigmoid two-state process detected by both fluorescence and CD measurements. The prominent peak observed around 4–5 m urea by the integrated fluorescence area also disappeared (Fig. 2 B, closed circles). The [urea]0.5 corresponding to the change of fluorescence wavelength and 222 nm ellipticity were estimated to be 4.5 and 4.7m, respectively. The enzyme activity was protected by Mn2+. [Urea]0.5 shifted from 2.2 (Fig.2 A) to 3.7 m in the presence of Mn2+(Fig. 2 B). The above results indicate that Mn2+increases the structural stability and prevents the formation of an intermediate form during urea denaturation. To further characterize the role of metal ion in the structural stabilization of the malic enzyme, some of the metal binding ligands of pigeon liver malic enzyme were mutated to eliminate the metal effect. The metal binding ability of E234Q was decreased by ∼100-fold whereas the D235N or E234Q/D235N had little effect onK m,Mn and K m,Mal. The K m,NADP values for all mutants were indistinguishable from that of the WT enzyme. On the other hand, the catalytic constants (k cat) were reduced by 754-, 117-, and 2752-fold, respectively, for the E234Q, D235N, and E234Q/D235N mutants. These results indicated the importance of Glu-234 and Asp-235 in the catalytic mechanism of malic enzyme as suggested by the crystal structure (11Yang Z. Zhang H. Hung H.C. Kuo C.C. Tsai L.C. Yuan H.S. Chou W.Y. Chang G.G. Tong L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the absence of Mn2+, the mutants E234Q, D235N, and E234Q/D235N displayed a similar urea-induced biphasic unfolding pathway with that of the WT enzyme as monitored by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3). However, unlike the WT, when the mutant malic enzymes were preincubated with 4 mm Mn2+, a biphasic unfolding phenomenon persisted and the denaturation curves almost overlapped with the curves without any Mn2+ being added. Comparing the average emission wavelength of the intrinsic fluorescence of the mutants yielded the same results (Fig. 4). Finally, we examined the unfolding pathway of the mutants by the integrated fluorescence area (Fig. 5). The characteristic peak observed between 2.5 and 6 m urea, disappearing in the presence of Mn2+ for the WT, did not change with the mutants E234Q and D235N. This characteristic peak, however, became less prominent in the single mutants and disappeared in the E234Q/D235N double mutant (Fig. 5 D).Figure 4Average emission fluorescence wavelength changes of the wild type and mutant pigeon liver malic enzymes during urea denaturation. The wild type (A) and mutants (B, E234Q; C, D235N; and D, E234Q/D235N) were treated with Mn2+ and urea under the same conditions as described in Fig. 3. The enzyme concentration was 27.6 μg/ml. The average emission wavelength was collected at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Comparison of the fluorescence integrated area changes of the wild type and mutant pigeon liver malic enzymes. The wild type (A) and mutants (B, E234Q; C, D235N; and D, E234Q/D235N) were treated with Mn2+ and urea under the same conditions as described in Fig. 3. The fluorescence emission integrated area between 320 and 370 nm was calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The thermostability of these mutants was similar to that of the WT enzyme (Fig. 6). All recombinant malic enzymes had a Tm value of around 56 °C. Mn2+had a significant impact on the secondary structure of the enzyme as revealed by the CD spectra. The above results clearly indicated that an intermediate state was detected during the urea denaturation of the malic enzyme. To further characterize this intermediate state, the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme was examined by quenching it with acrylamide. This is a non-selective quencher of protein molecules that can penetrate into the interior of the protein matrix (21Calhoun D.B. Vanderkooi J.M. Englander S.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). WT malic enzyme gave linear Stern-Volmer plot with or without Mn2+ (Fig.7 A). At 1 m urea, in which the enzyme activity was activated, a slight upward curve Stern-Volmer plot indicated conformational differences that were prevented by Mn2+. At 2.5m urea, where the fluorescence and CD spectra were insensitive to the conformational changes of the enzyme, a large quenching constant clearly indicated the structural difference. Mn2+ provided complete protection against this conformational change (Fig. 7 C). The conformational changes induced by a further increase in urea concentration were only partially prevented by Mn2+ (Fig. 7, D and E). The various quenching constants are summarized in TableI.Table IQuenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of pigeon liver malic enzyme by acrylamideUrea concentrationVK sv−Mn2++Mn2+−Mn2++Mn2+mm−1s−1m−10—1-aNot detectable, linear Stern-Volmer plot.—2.095 ± 0.0222.245 ± 0.0231.01.205 ± 0.116—2.237 ± 0.0762.360 ± 0.0112.51.615 ± 0.036—6.252 ± 0.0672.360 ± 0.0114.52.136 ± 0.1251.183 ± 0.0695.411 ± 0.2035.004 ± 0.1026.00.645 ± 0.0520.733 ± 0.0388.735 ± 0.1327.163 ± 0.0801-a Not detectable, linear Stern-Volmer plot. Open table in a new tab The exposure of the hydrophobic area of the enzyme during urea denaturation was accessed by measuring the ANS binding. ANS binds with a high affinity to hydrophobic patches, which enhances the fluorescence of the reagent (27Labowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Plenum, New York1999: 237-266Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 8 shows a clear peak corresponding to the intermediate state and indicates the hydrophobic nature of this state. The quaternary structural changes of the malic enzyme were examined by analytical ultracentrifugation. The WT tetrameric malic enzyme has a molecular mass of 248 kDa, and sediments at 9 S as a single peak (Fig.9 A), in agreement with the value reported in the literature (25Nevaldine B.H. Bassel A.R. Hsu R.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 283-293Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In 6 m urea, the 9 S peak disappeared and was displaced by low molecular weight species. The intermediate state observed at 4–5 m urea did not show a discrete peak. Instead, there were species with S-values from 5 to 25 (Fig. 9 B). These results clearly indicated polymerization of the enzyme. In the presence of 4 mm Mn2+, the polymer forms disappeared, and most of the enzyme existed as dimers (Fig. 10). Including 12 mmNaCl in the enzyme solution gave exactly the same result as the control (no metal added). The specific effect of Mn2+, therefore, is not that of salt. The randomly distributed residual values shown in the middle panels of Fig. 9 indicated an acceptable model for the sedimentation velocity experiments. We thus explored the sedimentation coefficient distribution in the whole range of urea denaturation for the malic enzyme (Fig. 10).Figure 10Quaternary structural changes of pigeon liver malic enzyme during urea denaturation. The enzyme (0.64 mg/ml) without (open circles, scales at the left axis) or with (connected solid lines, scales at the right axis) preincubation of 4 mm Mn2+ was mixed with various concentrations of urea at 25 °C for 1 h and then examined for quaternary structural changes by the sedimentation velocity. Only the distribution of the S values is reported. From A to H, the urea concentrations used were: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, and 6m, respectively. Please note that some of the panels have an enlarged y axis scale to highlight the distribution of various polymerization forms. For best results, the rotor speed and sedimentation duration were set at 40,000 rpm for 2 h (panels A and B) or for 5 h (panel C); 15,000 rpm for 5 h (panels D–G); and 50,000 rpm for 6.6 h (panel H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) WT malic enzyme sedimented at 9 S with or without Mn2+ in the solution (Fig. 10 A). In the presence of urea, the tetrameric peak shifted to lower S values and a monomeric peak appeared in the absence of Mn2+. Manganese ion could protect the enzyme from dissociation (Fig. 10, B and C). At urea concentrations starting from 3 m, the enzyme polymerized. This was prevented by Mn2+ in the whole range of the phase I transition (Fig. 10, D–F). The second phase of the denaturation process involved a depolymerization and unfolding of the monomers, which was not protected by Mn2+ (Fig. 10,G and H). Polymerization of the enzyme in the intermediate state was also demonstrated by sedimentation equilibrium analysis (TableII), which registered the average molecular weight of all species at a specific urea concentration. The E234Q, D235N, and E234Q/D235N mutants had molecular mass distribution similar to that for the WT (not shown). Due to the heterogeneity of the species, no further modeling was attempted for the sedimentation equilibrium data.Table IIAverage molecular weight distributions of pigeon liver malic enzyme during urea denaturation2-aAverage molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation.
