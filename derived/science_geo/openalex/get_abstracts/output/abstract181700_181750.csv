https://openalex.org/W2055335169,"The effects of multiple stress stimuli on the cellular utilization of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase (Sgk) were examined in NMuMg mammary epithelial cells exposed to hyperosmotic stress induced by the organic osmolyte sorbitol, heat shock, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, or to dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid that represents a general class of physiological stress hormones. Each of the stress stimuli induced Sgk protein expression with differences in the kinetics and duration of induction and in subcellular localization. The environmental stresses, but not dexamethasone, stimulated Sgk expression through a p38/MAPK-dependent pathway. In each case, a hyperphosphorylated active Sgk protein was produced under conditions in which Akt, the close homolog of Sgk, remained in its non-phosphorylated state. Ectopic expression of wild type Sgk or of the T256D/S422D mutant Sgk that mimics phosphorylation conferred protection against stress-induced cell death in NMuMg cells. In contrast, expression of the T256A/S422A Sgk phosphorylation site mutant has no effect on cell survival. Sgk is known to phosphorylate and negatively regulate pro-apoptotic forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1. The environmental stress stimuli that induce Sgk, but not dexamethasone, strongly inhibited the nuclear transcriptional activity and increased the cytoplasmic retention of FKHRL1. Also, the conditional IPTG inducible expression of wild type Sgk, but not of the kinase dead T256A mutant Sgk, protected Con8 mammary epithelial tumor cells from serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our study establishes that induction of enzymatically active Sgk functions as a key cell survival component in response to different environmental stress stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1980439311,"Glucose is the major source of brain energy and is essential for maintaining normal brain and neuronal function. Hypoglycemia causes impaired synaptic transmission. This occurs even before significant reduction in global cellular ATP concentration, and relationships among glycolysis, ATP supply, and synaptic transmission are not well understood. We demonstrate that the glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (3-PGK) are enriched in synaptic vesicles, forming a functional complex, and that synaptic vesicles are capable of accumulating the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate by harnessing ATP produced by vesicle-bound GAPDH/3-PGK at the expense of their substrates. The GAPDH inhibitor iodoacetate suppressed GAPDH/3-PGK-dependent, but not exogenous ATP-dependent, [<sup>3</sup>H]glutamate uptake into isolated synaptic vesicles. It also decreased vesicular [<sup>3</sup>H]glutamate content in the nerve ending preparation synaptosome; this decrease was reflected in reduction of depolarization-induced [<sup>3</sup>H]glutamate release. In contrast, oligomycin, a mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor, had minimal effect on any of these parameters. ADP at concentrations above 0.1 mminhibited vesicular glutamate and dissipated membrane potential. This suggests that the coupled GAPDH/3-PGK system, which converts ADP to ATP, ensures maximal glutamate accumulation into presynaptic vesicles. Together, these observations provide insight into the essential nature of glycolysis in sustaining normal synaptic transmission."

In many cells, PPARγ agonists increase glucose uptake and metabolism. Because astrocytes store glucose and provide lactate to neurons on demand, we tested effects of PPARγ agonists on astroglial glucose metabolism. Incubation of cortical astrocytes with the PPARγ thiazolidinedione (TZD) agonist pioglitazone (Pio) significantly increased glucose consumption in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with maximal increase of 36% observed after 4 h in 30 μm Pio. Pio increased 2-deoxy-glucose uptake because of increased flux through the type 1 glucose transporter. However, at this time point Pio did not increase type 1 glucose transporter expression, nor were its effects blocked by transcriptional or translational inhibitors. Pio also increased astrocyte lactate production as soon as 3 h after incubation. These effects were replicated by other TZDs; however, the order of efficacy (troglitazone > pioglitazone > rosiglitazone) suggests that effects were not mediated via PPARγ activation. TZDs increased astrocyte cAMP levels, and their glucose modifying effects were reduced by protein kinase A inhibitors. TZDs inhibited state III respiration in isolated brain mitochondria, whereas in astrocytes they caused mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization. Pio protected astrocytes against hypoglycemia-induced cell death. Finally, glucose uptake was modified in brain sections prepared from Pio-fed rats. These results demonstrate that TZDs modify astrocyte metabolism and mitochondrial function, which could be beneficial in neurological conditions where glucose availability is reduced.

Three major subtypes have been identified (α, δ (or β), and γ) with distinct actions on cell physiology and different specificity in their ligand-binding properties (7Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Google Scholar). PPARγ is widely expressed in the adipose tissue where it controls adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism (8Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Google Scholar). The agonists of PPARγ include fatty acids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (9Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3406-3410Google Scholar), the natural ligand 15-deoxy-Δ-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (10Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Google Scholar). TZDs were originally designed as antidiabetic drugs because of their insulin-sensitizing effects, and several are in clinical use (12Gillies P.S. Dunn C.J.

Thus, PPARγ activation contributes to reduce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic substances from activated monocytes (19Ricote M. Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Glass C.K. J.

Our previous studies showed that PPARγ agonists are able to down-regulate neuronal inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression and to reduce cerebellar granule cell death in vitro (23Heneka M.T. Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Gleichmann M. Wullner U. Klockgether T. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 100: 156-168Google Scholar) andin vivo (24Heneka M.T. Klockgether T. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6862-6867Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that PPARγ agonists reduced the development of clinical symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a commonly used animal model for multiple sclerosis (25Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Gavrilyuk V. Brosnan C.F. Whitacre C.C. Dumitrescu-Ozimek L. Landreth G.E. Pershadsingh H.A. Weinberg G. Heneka M.T. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 694-702Google Scholar). These findings have led to the possibility that PPARγ agonists could provide protection in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (26Heneka M.T. Landreth G.E. Feinstein D.L.

Furuta K. Suzuki M. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 50-53Google Scholar) and inducing myelin gene expression (33Saluja I. Granneman J.G. Skoff R.P.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5034-5041Google Scholar) showed that in periphery, PPARγ regulates glucose metabolism by increasing glucose uptake through facilitative glucose transporter proteins (GLUTs). Delivery of glucose in the central nervous system is mainly mediated by GLUTs present on the brain-blood barrier, on glial cells, and on neurons (41Maher F. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1003-1011Google Scholar, 42Vannucci S.J. Maher F. Simpson I.A. Glia. 1997; 21: 2-21Google Scholar). However the primary energy source in brain is provided by astrocytes. These cells are able to store glucose in the form of glycogen and provide lactate to neurons on demand (43Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10625-10629Google Scholar). Because glucose metabolism could be adversely affected in some neurodegenerative disorders (44Blass J.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 851-856Google Scholar, 45Joseph J. Shukitt-Hale B. Denisova N.A. Martin A. Perry G. Smith M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 131-146Google Scholar, 46Hoyer S. Exp.

Gerontology. 1999; 45: 289-297Google Scholar), we hypothesized that one mechanism of PPARγ agonists protection during disease could be related to an increase of cerebral metabolism of glucose. To test this hypothesis we examined the effects of TZDs on glucose uptake and metabolism in primary enriched cultures of rat cortical astrocytes. Incubation with these drugs increased glucose utilization (assessed as loss of glucose from the incubation media), 2-deoxy-glucose uptake, and lactate production. These effects did not appear to be mediated by activation of PPARγ or to changes in gene expression but instead because of a rapid effect on other cellular signaling systems possibly related to changes in mitochondrial respiration. Our results demonstrate that TZDs can increase astroglial glucose metabolism, suggesting that this class of drugs may be therapeutically useful in conditions in which brain glucose levels or availability are limited. Cell culture reagents (DMEM and antibiotics) and LPS (Salmonella typhimurium) were from Sigma. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was from Invitrogen. Pio was from Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America (Lincolnshire, IL). Rosi was from GlaxoSmithKline. Trog was from Parke-Davis. GW347845 was a gift of Tim Willson (GlaxoSmithKline). Polyclonal antibodies directed against GLUT-1 (AB-1340, which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of rat GLUT-1) and GLUT-3 (AB-1344, which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of the mouse GLUT-3) were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit secondary antibodies were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Pierce. Taq polymerase and cDNA synthesis reagents were from Promega. Cell viability was assessed by measurement of released lactate dehydrogenase according to the manufacturer's procedures, using the CytoTox-96 kit from Promega. Primary astrocytes were from cerebral cortices of postnatal day 1–2 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (48Galea E. Reis D.J. Feinstein D.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 406-414Google Scholar). Media were changed every 3 days. After 2 weeks growth in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% FCS, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) the cultures consisted of 95–98% astrocytes and 2–3% microglia. Glucose and lactate concentrations in the incubation media was assessed by a quantitative enzymatic colorimetric kit, according the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Briefly, 5-μl aliquots of media were incubated with 100 μl of Sigma Diagnostic Glucose Trinder reagent for 10 min at 37 °C, and the absorbance was read at 492 nm. For lactate, samples were incubated with 90 μl of Sigma Diagnostic Lactate reagent for 20 min at room temperature, and absorbance was read at 550 nm. In each assay, a standard curve was prepared in the range of 0 to 100 mg/100 ml of d-glucose or 0 to 50 mg/100 ml ofl-lactate in DMEM. Levels in each sample were calculated by interpolation from standard curves. For glucose uptake experiments, astrocytes were pre-incubated in low glucose (5 mm instead of 25 mm) DMEM with 1% FCS containing different concentrations of Pio. During pre-incubation, aliquots were collected at different time points for subsequent glucose and lactate assessments. After 6 h of pre-incubation, the medium was replaced by 250 μl of glucose-free DMEM to which was added increasing concentrations of d-glucose (0.05–1 mm) and 1 μCi/ml of 2-deoxy-d-[2,6-3H]glucose (2-DG;Amersham Biosciences), final concentration 24 nm, and cells were further incubated for 10–90 min. At the end of the uptake experiment the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by adding 250 μl of 200 mm NaOH. An aliquot of 200 μl was assayed for 3H by liquid scintillation counting. Protein content was measured in the same samples by Bradford's method in 50 μl of the remaining lysates. [3H]2-DG uptake was expressed in pmol/mg of protein or nmol of glucose/mg protein. Cells were grown to 90–95% confluency, the growth media were removed, the cells were washed in serum-free media, and incubations were carried out in fresh DMEM containing antibiotics and 1% FCS. NOS2 was induced by incubation with bacterial endotoxin LPS (1 μg/ml). Induction of NOS2 was assessed indirectly by nitrite production in the cell culture media. An aliquot of the cell culture media (80 μl) was mixed with one-half volume of Griess reagent (49Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Google Scholar), and the absorption was measured at 550 nm. Solutions of NaNO2 dissolved in DMEM/1% FCS served as standards. Total cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from cells using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), aliquots were converted to cDNA using random hexamer primers, and mRNA levels were estimated by real time, quantitative RT-PCR (50Gavrilyuk V. Dello R.C. Heneka M.T. Pelligrino D. Weinberg G. Feinstein D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29662-29668Google Scholar). The primers used for GLUT-1 detection were 939F (5′-TGA AAG AAG AGG GTC GGC AGA TAA-3′), corresponding to bases 939–960, and 1301R (5′ AGA TGG CCA CGA TGC TCA GAT AGG-3′), complementary to bases 1278–1301 of the rat GLUT-1 cDNA sequence, which yield a 363-bp product. The primers used for GLUT-3 were 978F (5′-GGA GCG GGC AGG AAG GAG AA-3′) and 1305R (5′-AGA AAA CGA GGA AGG CAG CGA AGA-3′), which correspond to bases 978–998 and 1281–1305, respectively, and which yield a 328-bp product. The primers used for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase detection were 796F (5′ GCC AAG TAT GAT GAC ATC AAG AAG) and 1059R (5′ TCC AGG GGT TTC TTA CTC CTT GGA), which yield a 264-bp product. The primers used for PPARγ were 642F (5′-GCC TTG CTG TGG GGA TGT CTG-3′) and 995R (5′-CGA AAC TGG CAC CCT TGA AAA ATG-3′) from the rat PPARγ sequence NM_013124.1, and they yield a 354-bp product. Cycling conditions were 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 10 s, annealing at 61 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 20 s, followed by 2 min at 72 °C, in the presence of SYBR Green (1:10,000 dilution of stock solution from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) carried out in a 20-μl reaction in a Corbett Rotor-Gene (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). Relative mRNA concentrations were calculated from the relative take-off point of the PCR reactions using the manufacturer's software included in the unit. Correct product synthesis was confirmed by melting curve analysis, which yielded a single melting point, and by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide of the PCR products. Astrocytes were grown until confluent and then incubated in DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and 30 μm Pio or the equivalent amount of Me2SO for 6 or 24 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, collected by centrifugation (700 × g for 10 min), and placed on ice. Subcellular fractionation was carried out as described (51Yonemitsu S. Nishimura H. Shintani M. Inoue R. Yamamoto Y. Masuzaki H. Ogawa Y. Hosoda K. Inoue G. Hayashi T. Nakao K.

Briefly, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm NaN3, 2 mm EGTA, 1/100 protease inhibitor mixture (P8320; Sigma), and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 760 ×g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei; the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 31,000 ×g for 60 min to pellet the crude plasma membrane and collect the supernatant as cytoplasmic fraction. Protein content was determined by Bradford's method using bovine serum albumin as standard. Ten μg of protein of each sample were mixed 1:3 with 3× gel sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 7.5% SDS, 45% glycerol, 7.5% bromphenol blue, 15% β-mercaptoethanol), denatured at 70 °C for 5 min, and separated through SDS-10% acrylamide gels. Denaturation at 70 °C versus boiling reduces aggregation of GLUT-1 in gels. 2C. Dello Russo and D. L. Feinstein, unpublished observations. Apparent molecular weights were estimated by comparison to BenchMarkTM prestained protein ladder standards (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry electrophoretic transfer. The membranes were blocked with 10% (w/v) low-fat milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 1 h and incubated in the presence of antibody (anti-GLUT-1 at 1:5000 dilution, anti-GLUT-3 at 1:1000 dilution) overnight with gentle shaking at 4 °C (53Cidad P. Garcia-Nogales P. Almeida A. Bolanos J.P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 17-24Google Scholar). The primary antibody was removed, and the membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody diluted 1:40,000 for GLUT-1 and 1:8,000 for GLUT-3. After four washes in TBST, bands were visualized by incubation in enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for 1 min and exposure to x-ray film for 1 min (for membranes) or 5–10 min (for cytosolic). Band intensities were determined using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) from autoradiographs obtained from at least two different exposure times, and background intensities (determined from an equal-sized area of the film immediately below the band of interest) were subtracted. Cells were incubated in 1% FCS in DMEM in the presence of indicated drugs. An initial time course (10–90 min) was carried out in the presence of 10 μm Pio, and a 30-min incubation time was chosen for the experiments. After incubation, cells were washed three times with physiological saline (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free) and then flooded with 100 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid. After 5 min, the supernatant was removed, and cells were washed again with 100 μl of water. Trichloroacetic acid supernatant and wash water were combined and extracted with ether. cAMP was assessed using an enzymatic immunoassay kit purchased from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Staughton, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sample concentrations were calculated using a standard curve constructed by plotting relative binding values (B/Bo = cAMP bound/cAMP total) versus log of concentration (pg/ml). Rat brain mitochondria were isolated as described (54Anderson M.F. Sims N.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 2000; 5: 95-101Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were homogenized in isolation buffer using 10 ml per gram of brain, in a 50-ml centrifuge tube with a tight fitting pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was re-extracted with isolation buffer. The two supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 16,700 ×g. The upper half from this was discarded, and the lower portion combined 1:1 with 15% Percoll and mixed gently. The resulting material was layered onto a Percoll step gradient (23% on top of 40%) and centrifuged at 30,700 × g. The fraction accumulating at the interface was collected, slowly diluted 1:4 with isolation buffer, and centrifuged at 16,700 × g for 10 min to yield the final mitochondrial pellet. Mitochondrial respiration was carried out at 30 °C and monitored as described previously (55Weinberg G.L. Palmer J.W. VadeBoncouer T.R. Zuechner M.B. Edelman G. Hoppel C.L. Anesthesiology. 2000; 92: 523-528Google Scholar). Respiratory control ratios measured as the ratio of state III (ADP-supported) to state IV (resting) were consistently above ten. Respiration was initiated by the addition of substrate (pyruvate, 10 mm final concentration). Calculations of respiratory rates, in units of ng atoms oxygen per min per mg, were derived from the slopes of oxygen consumption in the reaction chamber, which were linear for over 10 min. Primary rat astrocytes were grown in 25-cm2 Petri dishes at a density of about 200,000 cells/cm2 in DMEM containing 1% FCS. When confluent, cells were treated with 10 μm of Pio or Trog or the corresponding amount of vehicle (Me2SO). After 6 h, the medium was removed, and cells were trypsinized and used for measurements of JC-1 aggregate fluorescence as described (56Almeida A. Almeida J. Bolanos J.P. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15294-15299Google Scholar). For each sample, the measurements were made three times, and the S.D. values were within 10% of the means. The ratios of FL2 (fluorescence because of JC-1 aggregation) to FL1 fluorescence (because of monomeric JC-1) were determined and normalized to the values obtained for incubation in vehicle alone. Complete mitochondrial depolarization was obtained by addition of carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (5 μm for 5 min) to the cells, and that value was assigned as 0%. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington MA), weighing 250–300 g were housed in groups of four at 22 °C and in a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Pio was added to Purina chow 5002 at 0 or 100 ppm. Rats were provided free access to diets for different days as indicated. On the day of the experiment, the animals were killed by decapitation. The brains were quickly removed from the skull, and the cortices were dissected under aseptic conditions. Coronal slices were made across the cortex to produce sections with two cut surfaces and having approximately the same weight, as assessed by protein measurement at the end of each experiment. All slices from the same animal were collected in a 35-mm Petri dish containing 7 ml of DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and 1% FCS and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After 45 min of pre-incubation, during which the incubation medium was replaced twice, the slices were transferred to a 48-well plate containing 500 μl/well of low glucose DMEM and further incubated for 4 h. Aliquots of 5 μl were collected after different times to assess glucose levels. At the end of each experiment measurements of lactate dehydrogenase showed no differences in lactate dehydrogenase released between control and Pio-treated slices. Experiments were done at least in triplicate unless noted otherwise. Data were analyzed by one- or two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison or Bonferroni post hoc tests, and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. PCR analysis showed that the mRNA corresponding to PPARγ is present in unstimulated confluent primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes (Fig.1). Incubation with the PPARγ agonist Pio (30 μm) did not significantly modify steady state PPARγ mRNA levels measured after 24 h. Inflammatory activation with bacterial endotoxin LPS significantly reduced (by about 50%) PPARγ steady state mRNA levels measured after 24 h, and this decrease was not significantly affected by co-incubation with Pio. These results demonstrate that as reported previously (57Zander T. Kraus J.A. Grommes C. Schlegel U. Feinstein D. Klockgether T. Landreth G. Koenigsknecht J. Heneka M.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1052-1060Google Scholar), rat astrocytes express PPARγ mRNA and that its levels, although responsive to inflammatory stimuli, are not significantly altered upon incubation with a selective PPARγ agonist. Cortical rat astrocytes were incubated in low glucose (5 mm) containing medium, and glucose consumption, assessed as loss of glucose from the incubation media, was measured after different times up to 24 h in the presence of increasing amounts of Pio (0–30 μm). Control cells used glucose from the media (8.1 ± 1.0% per h), most likely because of maintenance of basal energetic needs. Pio time- and dose-dependently increased the rate of glucose utilization (9.0 ± 0.9 and 12.8 ± 0.5% per h, at 10 and 30 μm, respectively; see Fig.2), and this effect was significant at 30 μm Pio as soon as 4 h of incubation. After 24 h, Pio-treated cells continued to show an increased amount of glucose utilization (control, 80.0 ± 1.6% compared with 30 μm Pio with almost 100% of the available glucose used) (data not shown). In control astrocytes, uptake of 2-DG was linear during 90 min of incubation (Fig.3 A). Pre-treatment with Pio (30 μm for 6 h) increased subsequent 2-DG uptake by ∼33% (from 151 ± 9 to 196 ± 3 fmol per min per mg of protein; p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA). To characterize which glucose transporter(s) were involved in this increase, a similar experiment was performed in the presence of different amounts of coldd-glucose, and the amount of 2-DG taken up was measured after 45 min (Fig. 3 B). The stimulatory effect of Pio was observed primarily at the higher doses of cold d-glucose (0.5–1 mm), suggesting an increased glucose flux through GLUT-1, which has a lower affinity for glucose than does GLUT-3 (53Cidad P. Garcia-Nogales P. Almeida A. Bolanos J.P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 17-24Google Scholar). The effects of Pio on astrocyte glucose utilization measured after 6 h were not significantly reduced by co-incubation with either a transcriptional (5 μg/ml actinomycin D) or translational (10 μg/ml cycloheximide) inhibitor (Fig. 4), suggesting that effects on gene transcription or protein translation were not involved in this process. Consistent with this, we found that Pio treatment (6 h with 30 μm) did not modify the steady state mRNA levels of either GLUT-1, which is mainly expressed in glial and endothelial cells, or GLUT-3, which is mainly expressed in neurons (Fig. 5, A andB). Similar results were obtained after longer incubation periods (up to 24 h) (data not shown) suggesting that increases in GLUT mRNA levels were not responsible for increased glucose uptake.Figure 5Effec"

This process can be error-prone in its early stages, and any incorrect disulfides that form must be rearranged to their native configuration. When the second cysteine (CGHC) in the PDI active site is mutated to Ser, the isomerase activity drops by 7–8-fold, and a covalent intermediate with the substrate accumulates. This led to the proposal that the second active site cysteine provides an escape mechanism, preventing PDI from becoming trapped with substrates that isomerize slowly (Walker, K. W., and Gilbert, H. F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 8845–8848). Escape also reduces the substrate, and if it is invoked frequently, disulfide isomerization will involve cycles of reduction and reoxidation in preference to intramolecular isomerization of the PDI-bound substrate. Using a gel-shift assay that adds a polyethylene glycol-conjugated maleimide of 5 kDa for each sulfhydryl group, we find that PDI reduction and oxidation are kinetically competent and essential for isomerization.

Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), including the correct formation of disulfide bonds. Disulfides that form early in the folding process are often incorrect; cysteines can be mispaired (2Rothwarf D.M. Li Y.J. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3760-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), or disulfides can be formed in the wrong temporal order, making it difficult to oxidize buried cysteines (3Creighton T.E. Goldenberg D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 497-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To rectify these errors, the incorrect disulfides must be broken and new ones formed in a different configuration. The endoplasmic reticulum contains folding assistants that help proteins achieve their correct disulfide arrangement. Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI)1 is a 55-kDa protein of the endoplasmic reticulum which catalyzes disulfide formation (oxidase activity) as well as the rearrangement of incorrect disulfide pairings (isomerase activity) (4Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 26-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), accelerating both processes without drastically altering the refolding pathway (1Helenius A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PDI catalyzes the chemical changes but does not appear to guide the process or unfold misfolded substrates actively (5Huth J.R. Perini F. Lockridge O. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16472-16482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Nature. 1993; 365: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PDI has two active sites, one near the amino terminus and the other near the carboxyl terminus (7Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Each active site contains two cysteines in the sequence WCGHCK which mediate the catalytic activities. The oxidase activity of the enzyme clearly requires the reaction of an oxidized PDI active site with a reduced substrate to introduce a substrate disulfide. Isomerization results in no net redox state change, but a substrate disulfide must be broken to initiate rearrangement. The first step of isomerization involves a reduced PDI active site attacking a substrate disulfide (8Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After the initial reaction, two different mechanisms could result in substrate isomerization (Fig.1). In the first mechanism, the sulfhydryl of the substrate cysteine that was released from a disulfide reacts intramolecularly with a different substrate disulfide, resulting in a different disulfide configuration. The intramolecular rearrangement concludes when a substrate cysteine displaces PDI from the covalent complex, forming another disulfide in the substrate and regenerating reduced PDI for another round of catalysis. In the second model, reduced PDI could simply engage in cycles of reducing substrate disulfides and reoxidizing them in a different orientation, much in the same way that the ATP-dependent chaperonin, GroEL/ES provides a folding substrate with numerous attempts at reaching the native state through cycles of substrate binding and release (9Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To account for the observation that PDI active sites lacking the carboxyl cysteine (CGHS) are deficient in catalyzing disulfide isomerization unless supported by a glutathione redox buffer, Walker and Gilbert (10Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8845-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) proposed the scanning and escape model for PDI-assisted disulfide isomerization of scrambled ribonuclease. In this model, the first (more amino-terminal) active site cysteine of PDI initiates a disulfide rearrangement by attacking a reactive disulfide within the substrate and forming a covalent complex (scanning). The resolution of this complex depends on the relative rates of an intramolecular isomerization pathway versus the escape of PDI from the covalent complex using the second active site cysteine (Fig. 1). By this model, escape serves as an internal clock providing some time for an intramolecular substrate isomerization to occur but limiting the time PDI spends tied up in rearranging complexes. However, the escape pathway releases the substrate from the covalent complex forming a reduced RNase and oxidized PDI. To complete the substrate isomerization, oxidized PDI must then locate and reoxidize the reduced sRNase molecule in an alternate configuration to generate the rearranged substrate and recycle PDI to the reduced state to initiate further rounds of substrate reduction and oxidation. The scanning and escape model predicts that both oxidized and reduced PDI are necessary for the efficient catalysis of isomerization, even when there is no net disulfide reduction or oxidation. We have monitored the redox state of PDI during steady-state disulfide isomerization and found that both reduced and oxidized PDI are essential to observe net isomerization. Rapid reduction-reoxidation cycles accompany the isomerization of sRNase. They are kinetically competent to account for substrate isomerization, and intramolecular substrate isomerization is a relatively rare event during the PDI-assisted isomerization of sRNase A. These reduction-reoxidation cycles can also balance the redox state of PDI in a nonequilibrium steady state because of the relatively slow reaction between PDI and a glutathione redox buffer. Ribonuclease A, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), glutathione (GSH), cCMP, DTT, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), glutathione reductase, and NADPH were obtained from Sigma. Mal-PEG was obtained from Shearwater Corporation (Huntsville, AL). PDI was purified as described (11Gilbert H.F. Kruzel M.L. Lyles M.M. Harper J.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 1991; 2: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an E0.1% of 0.94 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 (12Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Mutation of the two noncatalytic cysteines of PDI was performed using the QuikChange® Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis kit purchased from Stratagene. The mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The production and isolation of other mutants have been described previously (13Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Scrambled ribonuclease was prepared by the method of Hillson et al. (14Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with minor changes. PDI activity was measured by observing the activity caused by the formation of native RNase using cCMP as a substrate (12Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 15Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The cCMP at an initial concentration of 4.5 mm was monitored continuously at 296 nm using a Δε of 0.19 mm−1 cm−1. The active RNase concentration at any time was calculated from the first derivative of the absorbance versus the time curve. The assay was performed at pH 8.0, 25.0 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl containing various components of a glutathione redox buffer and PDI as described in the figure legends. The reaction was initiated by the addition of sRNase. In experiments where it was necessary to exclude GSSG, the rate of refolding of sRNase was measured in the presence of 0.75 unit/ml glutathione reductase and 0.27 mm NADPH. Assays were performed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. At higher concentrations of GSH, the background oxidation of NADPH caused absorbance changes at 296 nm which interfered with continuously monitoring the cCMP concentration over the time course of native RNase formation. Consequently, we monitored the partitioning between sRNase reduction and isomerization to native RNase. The rate of reduction of 27 μm sRNase was determined at various concentrations of GSH ranging from 0 to 7 mm. All assays were done in the presence of 0.75 unit/ml glutathione reductase and 0.27 mmNADPH to reduce any GSSG present. The PDI concentration was as indicated in the figure legends. Assays were conducted in a buffer of 90 mm Tris-HCl, 1.8 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. The rates of reduction were determined from the slope of absorbance at 340 nm versus time using an extinction coefficient of 6.23 mm−1cm−1. To measure the partitioning between sRNase reduction and refolding, the amount of native RNase was determined by measuring its enzymatic activity after an overnight incubation of sRNase with PDI, various concentrations of GSH, and 0.75 unit/ml of glutathione reductase and 0.27 mm NADPH. After overnight incubation at room temperature, cCMP was added to a concentration of 4.5 mm,and the initial rate of hydrolysis was measured. A small background rate of NADPH oxidation caused by GSH oxidation by air was subtracted from the observed rate. Reduced PDI was prepared by incubating PDI with 0.5 mm DTT overnight at room temperature. The DTT was removed by centrifugal gel filtration over Sephadex G-50 coarse from Amersham Biosciences. Oxidized PDI was prepared by incubating PDI with 10 mm GSSG overnight at room temperature. The GSSG was removed by centrifugal gel filtration over Sephadex G-50 coarse from Amersham Biosciences. Controls showed no significant carryover of DTT or GSSG during gel filtration. To capture the redox state of PDI during steady-state turnover or in equilibrium with a glutathione redox buffer, the reaction mixture was quenched at the appropriate time with an equal volume of ice-cold 40% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate the proteins and stop further thiol/disulfide exchange. After a 1-h incubation on ice, the precipitated proteins were isolated by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed twice with acetone to remove the trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was dissolved in 30 μl of nonreducing 2× SDS sample buffer and split into two equal portions. One portion immediately received 5 mm Mal-PEG (final concentration), and the other received an equivalent amount of buffer only. This provides an internal recovery control for each sample. Controls in which the trichloroacetic acid pellet was dissolved directly into Mal-PEG showed that the short time before the addition of Mal-PEG to the split samples did not result in any redox changes. The unbound Mal-PEG in the sample buffer resulted in distortion of the protein migration so it was removed by dialysis (1 h at room temperature) of the split samples against sample buffer using 10,000 MWCO microdialysis devices from Pierce. SDS-PAGE was performed on a nonreducing 4–20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue, or the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected using a monoclonal anti-PDI antibody (Stress-Gen) or a polyclonal anti-PDI antibody. One distinction between an intramolecular mechanism of disulfide rearrangement and a mechanism involving cycles of substrate reduction and reoxidation lies in the consequences of releasing a reduced substrate and forming a molecule of oxidized PDI. If reductive escape happens frequently, increasing the concentration of an oxidized substrate such as sRNase would tend to oxidize more and more of the PDI. As the concentration of sRNase rises, it should also become more difficult for this oxidized PDI to locate an appropriately reduced substrate to complete the catalytic cycle. A large excess of fully oxidized substrate should compete with the much lower concentration of partially reduced substrate for binding to oxidized PDI. Consequently, substrate inhibition at high concentrations of sRNase would be expected if reductive escape is a frequent phenomenon, but simple saturation behavior would be characteristic of an exclusively intramolecular mechanism. When the isomerization of sRNase (four disulfides) is initiated by the addition of reduced PDI, isomerization proceeds rapidly when the concentration of sRNase is low (8 μm). Under these conditions, a glutathione redox buffer has little effect on the isomerization rate (Fig. 2), suggesting that there is no large imbalance in the PDI redox state. However, when the substrate concentration is increased to 32 μm, the initial velocity of native RNase formation actually falls 7-fold (Fig.2), even though the Km for this substrate is high (40 μm), and the rate would have been expected to increase by almost 4-fold. If the excess substrate is preventing the oxidized PDI that is formed from locating a reduced substrate, adding more oxidized PDI should increase the rate of RNase oxidation and help restore the isomerization activity by increasing the rate of substrate oxidation and by generating more reduced PDI in the process. Adding oxidized PDI to the assay, along with reduced PDI, does increase the isomerase activity, but the increase is still significantly less than that produced by adding a redox buffer (Fig. 2). The depletion of reduced PDI during the early stages of the reaction could also compromise initiating new rounds of substrate reduction. To visualize the redox state of PDI during steady-state turnover, a gel-shift assay was developed to detect the number of available sulfhydryl groups present on PDI under turnover conditions. The basis of the assay is the modification of the available PDI sulfhydryl groups by a PEG-conjugated maleimide (Mal-PEG) with an average molecular weight of 5,000 (16Wu H.H. Thomas J.A. Momand J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because disulfides are not maleimide-reactive, only reduced PDI molecules show a shift. PDI normally has two cysteines outside the active site (in the b′ domain). They do not contribute to catalysis (17Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but their presence creates ambiguity in the site(s) of modification. Consequently, the initial experiments were performed with a mutant PDI (internal mutant, ImPDI) in which the two internal, nonactive site cysteines are mutated to serines. This restricts the location of the modification by Mal-PEG to the active site cysteines. The mutation of the internal cysteines to serine has no effect on the catalytic activity compared with wild-type PDI (data not shown). The ability of Mal-PEG to trap the cysteines of reduced PDI and capture the PDI redox state accurately was examined by incubating ImPDI with glutathione redox buffers designed to set the active site redox state at various extents of reduction. It is essential to quench redox changes rapidly and to remove small molecule thiols before trapping the free cysteines with Mal-PEG. Consequently, after equilibration, the PDI was precipitated with cold trichloroacetic acid, washed extensively with acetone to remove traces of trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitates were dissolved under denaturing conditions in the presence of Mal-PEG. If Mal-PEG is added directly to the isomerization reaction mixture without trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the competing reactions of PDI disulfide reduction by the GSH and the modification of the PDI thiols with Mal-PEG shift the PDI redox state toward more reduced PDI (data not shown). As the redox buffer is varied, individual bands corresponding to zero, one, two, three, and four Mal-PEG shifts are observed (Fig. 3). The most predominant bands are at zero, two, and four SH groups. Bands visible at one and three modified cysteines are weaker because of the difficulty of modifying both cysteines within a single active site (CGHC) with this bulky reagent. Prolonging the reaction time causes these bands to disappear but at the risk of reaction at residues other than cysteine. A molecular mass shift of ∼15 kDa/Mal-PEG addition is observed (Fig. 3), consistent with the addition of a bulky PEG molecule that is highly solvated and interacts weakly with SDS. The presence of two active sites means that a shift of one or two SH groups identifies a molecule where one of the two active sites is oxidized, whereas a shift of three or four SH groups indicates a completely reduced PDI. The two independent active sites have similar redox potentials and are expected to titrate together. When the active sites are half-oxidized, a statistical distribution of redox states would generate 25% unshifted PDI (both sites oxidized), 25% fully shifted PDI (both sites reduced), and 50% shifted by two modifications (one site oxidized, one site reduced). From integrating the band intensities and calculating the fraction of the active sites that were reduced, the average redox potential Kox=[PDIox][GSH]2/[PDIred][GSSG]Equation 1 of the two sites at pH 8.0 is 0.7 ± 0.2 mm(n = 9), comparable with the values of 1.3 mm (at pH 7.4) reported by Darby and Creighton (18Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and 3 mm (at pH 7) found by Lundstrom and Holmgren (19Lundstrom J. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6649-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Allowing for variation of the equilibrium constant with pH, the trapping procedure accurately captures the PDI redox state. Using this gel-shift assay, the redox state of PDI was examined during sRNase isomerization. Reduced ImPDI was incubated for a short time (1 min) with high or low concentrations of sRNase in the presence or absence of a glutathione redox buffer (Fig.4 A). As predicted, reduced PDI was oxidized more extensively by 40 μm sRNase in the absence of a redox buffer, but the presence of a redox buffer helps maintain a higher concentration of reduced PDI without eliminating the oxidized PDI. In the absence of a glutathione redox buffer, changing the substrate concentration from 10 to 40 μm shifts the PDI redox state from 48 ± 4% reduced (n = 4) to 28 ± 4% reduced (n = 4). A glutathione redox buffer (1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm GSSG) also increases the amount of PDI in its reduced form (74 ± 4%,n = 4), suggesting that depletion of the amount of reduced PDI contributes to the inhibition by high concentrations of the sRNase substrate. Control experiments without PDI verify that sRNase does not shift significantly under these conditions so that sRNase multimers are distinguishable from PDI (Fig. 4 A). Western blots to visualize only the PDI (data not shown) confirm that the indicated bands contain PDI. The Mal-PEG assay was also performed during isomerization catalyzed by wild-type PDI (Fig. 4 B) with comparable results. Oxidized PDI shifts ∼30 kDa upon the addition of Mal-PEG-MAL, suggesting that the two internal, nonactive site cysteines are still reduced (Fig.4 B). PDI in the completely reduced control shifts the equivalent of six Mal-PEG additions, as expected. As with ImPDI, the active site cysteines become more oxidized as the sRNase concentration increases. For a reduction-reoxidation mechanism of isomerization, both oxidized and reduced PDI would have to participate in the reaction. By contrast, an intramolecular isomerization would only require reduced PDI. If oxidized PDI is necessary to complete a redox cycle during isomerization, one might expect that eliminating the oxidant, GSSG, from the redox buffer would inhibit isomerization. To eliminate even small amounts of GSSG, the GSSG was rapidly recycled to GSH using NADPH and glutathione reductase. Under these conditions, GSH by itself can relieve the substrate inhibition (Fig. 5), without a requirement for GSSG. Although GSH with an NADPH trap will completely reduce PDI in the absence of substrate, low concentrations of GSH (< 0.5 mm) are not sufficient to deplete the steady-state concentration of oxidized PDI in the presence of high concentrations of sRNase (Fig. 6). Thus, the reduction of PDI by GSH must be slower than the formation of oxidized PDI through substrate reduction. At even higher GSH concentrations (>0.5 mm) a substantial fraction of the PDI becomes reduced. A technical limitation of the isomerization assay precludes continuously monitoring the RNase-catalyzed hydrolysis of cCMP at GSH concentrations >0.5 mm. The background oxidation of NADPH as the reduction of the sRNase substrate produces absorbance changes at 296 nm which are too large to permit an accurate assessment of the isomerization rate during a continuous assay. Although sRNase is reduced by GSH and NADPH, native RNase is sufficiently stable that once formed, it is resistant to reduction by the highest GSH used (data not shown). The partitioning between reduction and isomerization will depend on the ratio of the velocities of the two alternative pathways. By measuring the velocity of sRNase reduction from the absorbance change caused by NADPH oxidation (Fig. 6 A) and the amount of native RNase that is formed when the reaction is complete (Fig.6 B), we can determine how higher concentrations of GSH influence the isomerization of sRNase (Fig. 6 C). At low GSH concentrations, all of the sRNase that can fold to the native structure does so (typically 50–70% of the sRNase present, varying among sRNase preparations). As the GSH concentration increases, the sRNase partitions more and more completely toward reduction so that less and less of the sRNase is converted to the native molecule. The sRNase partitions equally between reduction and isomerization when the GSH concentration is 1.2 mm (Fig. 6 A). The rate of reduction (Fig. 6 A) increases linearly with increasing GSH concentrations in the presence and absence of PDI. Because the isomerization pathway has to at least keep up with the increasing reduction rate at low GSH (where the extent of isomerization is constant and large) the rate of isomerization must increase as well. When the isomerization pathway lags behind and more of the sRNase is reduced, the velocity of isomerization must either stay constant or drop as the GSH concentration increases further. Relative to the velocity of sRNase reduction, the velocity of the competing isomerization reaction will be given by vi50=vredFiso(1−Fiso)Equation 2 where v iso is the velocity of isomerization, v red is the velocity of reduction, and F iso is the fraction of the total RNase that partitions to native RNase through the isomerization pathway. To account for the observed partitioning between reduction and isomerization, the isomerization rate must actually decrease with increasing GSH concentration (Fig. 6 C). The PDI redox state is also changing over this range of GSH concentrations from almost fully oxidized to almost fully reduced (Fig. 6 D), showing that as the amount of oxidized PDI is depleted further and further, the isomerization rate slows down. Both oxidized and reduced PDI are required to effect the isomerization of sRNase. Two mechanisms can be envisioned for the PDI-catalyzed disulfide isomerization of sRNase (Fig. 1). In the intramolecular rearrangement mechanism, a free thiol is generated in the misoxidized substrate by attack of the more amino-terminal thiolate of the PDI active site. The free thiol of the substrate would then be required to attack another disulfide of the substrate, leading eventually to rearrangement and release of the substrate by reforming a different disulfide and expelling PDI. There is precedence for such a rearrangement in the uncatalyzed, intramolecular rearrangement of folding intermediates of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (20Creighton T.E. Darby N.J. Kemmink J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The alternative is that disulfide isomerization results from cycles of reduction and oxidation, simply trying again and again until isomerization leads to a product that is resistant to further rearrangement (10Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8845-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Walker and Gilbert (10Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8845-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) suggested that the loss in activity resulting from mutation of the second (more carboxyl-terminal) cysteine in either active site could be most easily accommodated by a reduction-reoxidation mechanism because this cysteine does not participate in the intramolecular isomerization pathway. The timing of the intramolecular clock provided by the second active site cysteine will govern the partitioning between intramolecular isomerization and reduction-reoxidation pathways. If intramolecular substrate isomerization takes too long, the second active site cysteine will initiate escape and reduce the substrate. Using equilibrium and rate constants for the equilibration of the PDI active site with glutathione, Darby and Creighton (18Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) estimated the half-time for the intramolecular expulsion of glutathione to be ∼50 ms, although the rate constant could be different for protein substrates. Whether or not reductive escape is an important feature of the mechanism depends on how frequently it occurs during substrate turnover and whether or not redox cycling of the substrate and catalyst are essential during catalysis of isomerization. Substrate reduction and oxidation by PDI are both kinetically competent to participate in a reduction-reoxidation mechanism of isomerization. When reduced PDI and sRNase (40 μm) are mixed, the redox state changes are finished within 1 min (k obsfor reducing sRNase is >8 μm substrate reduced/min/μm PDI) (Fig. 6 A), and at high substrate, most of the PDI is quickly converted to its oxidized form (Fig. 4 A). The oxidation of reduced substrate by PDI is also fast. Lyles and Gilbert (15Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) found that a catalytic amount of PDI will convert a reduced RNase substrate to an oxidized RNase within 1 min after 0.1 mm GSSG is added. This places a lower limit of >26 μm substrate formed/min/μm PDI on the rate constant for oxidation of a reduced substrate by PDI. Because the turnover number for sRNase isomerization is 1 μmnative RNase formed/min/μm PDI, both substrate oxidation and substrate reduction are sufficiently fast that they would be catalytically competent to participate in an isomerization mechanism composed of reduction-reoxidation cycles. A reduction-reoxidation mechanism also predicts that high concentrations of an oxidized substrate should inhibit the isomerization reaction by competing with the low concentration of reduced substrate for binding to oxidized PDI. The accumulation of oxidized PDI resulting from a rapid reaction of reduced PDI with the oxidized substrate is verified by a gel-shift assay designed to monitor the redox state of PDI during substrate turnover under inhibiting conditions (Fig. 4). The substrate inhibition is decreased by either dropping the concentration of the substrate (Fig. 4), adding oxidized PDI (Fig. 2), or by making more reduced PDI available by adding GSH (Figs. 5 and 6). These diverse effects on the rate of isomerization are more easily accounted for by a reduction-reoxidation mechanism than by intramolecular isomerization (Fig. 1). Increasing concentrations of GSH (in the presence of an NADPH/glutathione trap to remove GSSG), initially stimulate isomerization as they convert some of the PDI active site back into the reduced state (Fig. 6), but at higher concentrations significant inhibition is observed concomitant with the loss of oxidized PDI during steady-state turnover. A simple intramolecular isomerization mechanism would predict that there should be no requirement for oxidized PDI and that increasing the extent of PDI reduction should only stimulate isomerization, not inhibit it. A reduction-reoxidation cycle also requires that the PDI active site disulfide be able to survive long enough to reoxidize the reduced substrate. In the presence of GSH and NADPH, redox equilibrium would predict complete reduction of the PDI active site. However, under steady-state conditions, the rapid reduction of the substrate by PDI and the relatively slow reaction of the PDI active site with GSH permit a significant steady-state accumulation of oxidized PDI, sufficient to support the reoxidation of the reduced substrate. The rate constant for the reduction of the PDI active site by 1 mm GSH is 12 min−1 (22Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7298-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that the survival of the oxidized PDI active site during steady-state isomerization is caused by the relatively slow reduction of PDI by GSH and the rapid oxidation of protein substrates. At higher GSH, the rate of active site reduction by GSH becomes competitive with protein substrate oxidation, and the rate of isomerization falls. The observation of rapid cycles of reduction and reoxidation does not exclude the occurrence of intramolecular isomerization reactions during the formation of native RNase. In fact, the reduction-reoxidation cycles may serve only to set up the formation of a critical intermediate during sRNase refolding which isomerizes through an intramolecular pathway. Shin et al. (23Shin H.C. Song M.C. Scheraga H.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have recently elaborated specific pathways for PDI-dependent conversion of an ensemble of RNase species with three disulfides into native RNase. Some of these critical interconversions on the pathway to the native structure may occur by intramolecular isomerizations; however, our data would suggest that if their conversion occurs by an intramolecular mechanism, their formation must be dependent on reduction-oxidation cycles. The disulfide isomerization of sRNase is accompanied by numerous reduction-reoxidation cycles, but the isomerization of other substrates may be dominated by intramolecular rearrangements. As a result there may be no “universal” mechanism for catalysis of disulfide isomerization. PDI may simply provide multiple mechanisms that can be used differently by different substrates. The contribution of intramolecular isomerization of the substrate compared with cycles of reduction-reoxidation will be governed by how fast the intramolecular rearrangement of the substrate occurs compared with the clock that is set by the PDI second active site cysteine. This path will invoke escape (reduction-reoxidation) if the intramolecular rearrangement it too slow. In addition, preferential covalent or noncovalent interactions between PDI and various sites on individual substrates might also influence this partitioning by affecting differentially the rates of the various ways in which the PDI-substrate complex is resolved. The occurrence of cycles of reduction and oxidation may also have implications toward the mechanism of disulfide formation in vivo. Previously we reported that the PDI redox state could be maintained in a steady state that was effective for catalysis of disulfide isomerization by using a sulfhydryl oxidase to catalyze oxidation of a reduced RNase substrate and GSH to maintain PDI in a reduced state (24Hoober K.L. Sheasley S.L. Gilbert H.F. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22147-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The GSH was required to offset the oxidation of the PDI active site by either the sulfhydryl oxidase or through oxidation of the reduced substrate. Thus, the PDI redox state can be maintained by a nonequilibrium, steady-state balance between the kinetics of transfer of oxidizing and reducing equivalents to the substrate. Frand and Kaiser (25Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) along with Pollard et al. (26Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) have found that PDI is oxidized in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum by an oxidase, Ero1p. Interestingly, a mutant allele of this gene is suppressed by a mutation in the GSH1 gene (21Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), responsible for the biosynthesis of glutathione, suggesting that GSH may be used to balance the oxidase activity of Ero1p.

Fringe is a fucose-specific β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that modifiesO-fucose moieties on the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of Notch. To investigate how the change in sugar structure caused by Fringe modulates Notch activity, we have analyzed the sites of O-fucose and Fringe modification on mouse Notch1. The extracellular domain of Notch1 has 36 tandem EGF repeats, many of which are predicted to be modified with O-fucose. We recently proposed a broadened consensus sequence forO-fucose, C2 X 3–5(S/T)C3(where C2 and C3 represent the second and third conserved cysteines), significantly expanding the potential number of modification sites on Notch. Here we demonstrate that sites predicted using this broader consensus sequence are modified withO-fucose on mouse Notch1, and we present evidence suggesting that the consensus can be further refined to C2 X 4–5(S/T)C3. In particular, we demonstrate that EGF 12, a portion of the ligand-binding site, is modified with O-fucose and that this site is evolutionarily conserved. We also show that endogenous Fringe proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Lunatic fringe and Radical fringe) as well as exogenous Manic fringe modifyO-fucose on many but not all EGF repeats of mouse Notch1. These findings suggest that the Fringes show a preference forO-fucose on some EGF repeats relative to others. This specificity appears to be encoded within the amino acid sequence of the individual EGF repeats. Interestingly, our results reveal that Manic fringe modifies O-fucose both at the ligand-binding site (EGF 12) and in the Abruptex region. These findings provide insight into potential mechanisms by which Fringe action on Notch receptors may influence both the affinity of Notch-ligand binding and cell-autonomous inhibition of Notch signaling by ligand.

Recently, defects in Notch signaling have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (5John G.R. Shankar S.L. Shafit-Zagardo B. Massimi A. Lee S.C. Raine C.S. Brosnan C.F. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1115-1121Google Scholar). Whereas there is only one Notch in Drosophila, four Notch homologues exist in mammalian systems. Notch becomes activated upon binding to its ligands (members of the Delta, Serrate/Jagged families) on the surfaces of adjacent cells, initiating a series of proteolytic events resulting in release of the Notch intracellular domain from the membrane (reviewed in Ref. 6Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Google Scholar). The Notch intracellular domain translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to members of the CSL (CBF1/suppressor of hairless/Lag-1 family of transcriptional regulators, activating transcription of downstream gene products. The Notch receptor is a large, cell surface membrane glycoprotein containing multiple domains (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Google Scholar, 6Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of Notch1 and Notch2 consist largely of 36 tandem epidermal growth factor-like (EGF)1 repeats. Notch3 and Notch4 contain 34 and 29 EGF repeats, respectively. EGF repeats are defined by the presence of six conserved cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds (7Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Google Scholar). Many of the EGF repeats on Notch1 contain evolutionarily conserved consensus sites for two unusual forms of glycosylation: O-fucose and O-glucose (8Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar). The consensus sites for these modifications were determined by comparison of sites of glycosylation from the EGF repeats of several serum glycoproteins (9Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Google Scholar). Based on these analyses, O-glucose modifications were shown to occur between the first and second conserved cysteine (C1 and C2, respectively) of the EGF repeat at the sequence C1 X S XPC2, andO-fucose modifications occurred between the second and third conserved cysteines (C2 and C3, respectively) at the sequence C2 XXGG(S/T)C3 (9Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the Notch1 protein from Chinese hamster ovary cells is modified with both O-fucose and O-glucose, suggesting that these consensus sites can be used to accurately predict whether a protein will bear the modifications (8Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar). In similar studies, we have shown that Notch ligands (Drosophila Delta and Serrate, mammalian Jagged1 and Delta1), which also containO-fucose consensus sites, are modified withO-fucose (10Panin V.M. Shao L. Lei L. Moloney D.J. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29945-29952Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutation of all of the predicted O-fucose sites on Drosophila Serrate failed to eliminate O-fucosylation, suggesting thatO-fucose was modifying sites not predicted using the original consensus sequence (10Panin V.M. Shao L. Lei L. Moloney D.J. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29945-29952Google Scholar). Based on these results, we proposed a broadened consensus site for O-fucosylation: C2 X 3–5(S/T)C3. Mutation of these sites on Drosophila Serrate eliminatedO-fucosylation completely. Thus, the number of EGF repeats in Notch and other proteins predicted to bear O-fucose has increased. Nonetheless, individual O-fucosylation sites have not been mapped on either Notch or its ligands. Recent studies have demonstrated that O-fucose modifications play an essential role in Notch function. Reduction ofO-fucosyltransferase expression in Drosophilausing RNAi (11Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Google Scholar) or in mice by gene ablation 2S. Shi and P. Stanley, submitted for publication. causes Notch-like phenotypes, suggesting that O-fucose modifications are essential for Notch function. In addition, we and others have shown that Notch activation is modulated by extension of O-fucose on Notch with the fucose-specific β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Fringe (for recent reviews, see Refs. 12Haltiwanger R.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 593-598Google Scholar and 13Haltiwanger R.S. Stanley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 328-335Google Scholar). Fringe was first identified inDrosophila and shown to inhibit Notch's ability to respond to Serrate but to potentiate its ability to respond to Delta (14Irvine K.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 434-441Google Scholar). Three Drosophila Fringe homologues have been identified in mammals: Lunatic fringe (Lfng), Manic fringe (Mfng), and Radical fringe (Rfng) (15Johnston S.H. Rauskolb C. Wilson R. Prabhakaran B. Irvine K.D. Vogt T.F. Development. 1997; 124: 2245-2254Google Scholar). The β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity of Fringe proteins is essential for their biological activity in Drosophila (16Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R.

A. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Google Scholar), and the O-fucose residues are required for Fringe to modulate Notch activity (16Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y.

Thus, Fringe mediates its effects on Notch signaling by the addition of GlcNAc toO-fucose moieties. Nonetheless, neither the specific role ofO-fucose in Notch function nor the mechanism of how a change in sugar structure alters Notch function is known. To better understand the mechanism of how the O-fucose structures modulate Notch function, we have begun to map sites of bothO-fucose and Fringe modification on mouse Notch1. Here we used fragments of the mNotch1 extracellular domain to identify sites ofO-fucose modification and subsequent elongation by Mfng. We show that the broadened O-fucose consensus sequence (C2 X 3–5(S/T)C3) (10Panin V.M. Shao L. Lei L. Moloney D.J. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29945-29952Google Scholar) can be used to accurately predict sites ofO-fucosylation, and we observed that Fringe modifiesO-fucose on EGF repeats that have important biological roles, including ligand binding and cell-autonomous inhibition by ligand. These findings suggest specific mechanisms for how the change in O-fucose glycan structure can modulate Notch function.

Tetrasaccharide and trisaccharide forms ofO-fucose were confirmed using exoglycosidase digestions essentially as described (8Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar), although theN-acetylneuraminidase I (α2,3-specific sialidase) (10 milliunits) and β-galactosidase (Diplococcal pneumoniae) digestions were done concurrently. The disaccharide GlcNAcβ1,3Fucitol was confirmed using high pH anion exchange chromatography as described previously (8Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar). Fringe assays were performed as described (16Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D.

Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Google Scholar) using His6-tagged Drosophila Fringe as the enzyme, UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as the donor substrate, and factor VII EGF repeat (modified withO-fucose) as acceptor substrate. Factor VII EGF-O-fucose was reduced and alkylated in 8 murea with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide as described previously (23Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Google Scholar). Both the control EGF repeat and the reduced and alkylated EGF repeat were repurified on reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described (23Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and fluorography with En3Hance (DuPont) and Western blots with anti-Myc epitope antibodies were performed as described (8Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar, 10Panin V.M. Shao L. Lei L. Moloney D.J. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29945-29952Google Scholar). The mouse Notch1 extracellular domain contains 36 tandem EGF repeats, 10 of which contain the O-fucose consensus sequence C2 XXGG(S/T)C3 (EGF repeats 3, 5, 16, 18, 20, 24, 26, 27, 31, and 35) and five of which are evolutionarily conserved (EGF repeats 3, 20, 24, 26, and 31) (Fig.1 b). To simplify the analysis of O-fucose and Fringe modification sites, we divided the mouse Notch1 extracellular domain into fragments. Constructs encoding EGF 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–18, 19–23, 24–28, and 29–36 were generated from mouse Notch1 by PCR. The desired fragments were obtained by PCR and cloned into a mammalian expression vector encoding a signal sequence for secretion and C-terminal Myc epitope and His6tags (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each of the fragments was expressed transiently in Lec1 cells and metabolically radiolabeled with [3H]fucose. Although several constructs encoding EGF 6–10 were generated, no protein was detected when transfected into cells, so no further experiments were performed with these constructs. In Lec1 cells, no complex-type N-glycans are synthesized (24Robertson M.A. Etchison J.R. Robertson J.S. Summers D.F. Stanley P. Cell. 1978; 13: 515-526Google Scholar), and the majority of [3H]fucose is incorporated intoO-fucose structures (25Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of [3H]fucose on a fragment suggestsO-fucosylation (as shown previously (8Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar)). Notch extracellular fragments were purified from medium using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 2). Each of the fragments expressed in Lec1 cells was labeled with [3H]fucose, indicating that they were all modified withO-fucose. Interestingly, the extent of fucosylation varied from fragment to fragment. For instance, much more of the EGF 16–18 fragment needed to be loaded onto a gel than any of the other fragments to be readily detected by Western blot (Fig. 2), indicating that EGF 16–18 was more heavily radiolabeled than the other fragments. These results suggest that the stoichiometry of O-fucosylation on different EGF repeats may differ.Figure 2Expression andO-fucosylation of EGF fragments from mouse Notch1. Plasmids encoding fragments (EGF 1–5, 11–15, 16–18, 19–23, 24–28, and 29–36) of mouse Notch1 extracellular domain were transfected into Lec1 cells, the cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [3H]fucose, and the expressed fragments were purified from medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equivalent amounts of each purified fragment (based on radioactivity) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (left) or Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibodies (right). To more clearly detect the protein species for EGF 16–18, a second Western blot was performed with a larger amount of protein (lane marked EGF 16–18* has approximately 3 times more protein). The migration position of molecular weight standards (× 10−3) is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate which EGF repeats actually bear O-fucose residues, site mutants were generated at sites predicted using both the original consensus (C2 XXGG(S/T)C3) and the broadened consensus (C2 X 3–5(S/T)C3) (Fig. 3 a). EGF 19–23 has one C2 XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus site at EGF 20 (C2VNGGTC3). Mutation of the threonine to alanine at EGF 20 (T20A) caused significant reduction, but not the elimination, in the fucosylation of this fragment (Fig. 3, b and c), suggesting that the broader sites are utilized. Mutation of the site at EGF 23 (S23A) also resulted in a reduction in fucosylation (Fig. 3, b andc). A double mutant where the sites at both 20 and 23 were eliminated (20A/23A) lost the majority of the fucosylation, although some residual fucosylation remained. The residual radioactivity on the double mutant is probably on EGF 21 (C2LNQGTC3). Attempts at expressing and analyzing the triple mutant (EGF 20A/21A/23A) were unsuccessful. These data demonstrate that both the C2 XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus sites and the broader sites (C2 X 3–5(S/T)C3) are modified with O-fucose. To further refine the broader consensus sites, mutants were generated on EGF 11–15. Although no C2 XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus sites exist in this fragment, both EGF 12 and 15 contain C2 X 3–5(S/T)C3sites (Fig. 3 a). Mutation of the site at EGF 12 completely eliminated the fucosylation of the fragment (Fig. 3, b andc), suggesting that EGF12 is modified withO-fucose. Interestingly, the site in EGF 12, believed to be a portion of the ligand binding site (26Rebay I. Fehon R.G. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1993; 74: 319-329Google Scholar), is conserved in all Notch homologues in data bases (Fig. 1 b and data not shown). These data also suggest that the site at EGF 15 is not modified withO-fucose. Since the site at EGF 15 has only three amino acids between the second cysteine and the modified serine or threonine (Fig. 3 a), these results indicate that a minimum distance in this space is necessary for efficient fucosylation. Thus, theO-fucose consensus may be refined to C2 X 4–5(S/T)C3(Fig. 1). To analyze which EGF repeats contain O-fucose that can be modified by Fringe, the mouse Notch1 extracellular domain fragments (Fig. 2) were expressed in Lec1 cell lines stably expressing Mfng or the corresponding empty vector (16Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Google Scholar). These cell lines were used previously in cell-based Notch signaling assays to demonstrate that Mfng inhibits Notch activation by Jagged1 (16Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Google Scholar, 19Chen J. Moloney D.J. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Google Scholar). Interestingly, CHO cells (including Lec1) have been shown to possess transcripts encoding Lfng and Rfng but not Mfng (19Chen J. Moloney D.J. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Google Scholar, 27Shimizu K. Chiba S. Saito T. Kumano K. Takahashi T. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25753-25758Google Scholar). The presence of endogenous Lfng and/or Rfng explains the presence of elongated O-fucose structures seen previously on Notch isolated from Lec1 cells (8Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the different fragments from mouse Notch1 were transiently transfected into both Lec1 cell lines, the cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [3H]fucose, and the fragments were purified from the medium using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography. To determine whether any of the Fringes had elongated O-fucose on the fragments, the O-linked sugars were released by alkali-induced β-elimination and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex peptide column (8Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar, 16Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Google Scholar). The structures of the resulting tetra-, tri-, and disaccharide species were confirmed to be Siaα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Fucitol, Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Fucitol, and GlcNAcβ1,3Fucitol, respectively, by a combination of exoglycosidase digestions and high pH anion exchange chromatography analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) (8Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Google Scholar). Since the synthesis of di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharide is dependent on the action of Fringe (16Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Google Scholar), the effect of Fringe can be quantified by calculating the ratio of the elongated, multisaccharide species (multisaccharide includes di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharide) to the total amount of O-fucose saccharides (sum of multisaccharide and monosaccharide species) from each fragment (Fig. 4). Interestingly, O-fucose was elongated by Mfng to some extent on most EGF repeats (EGF 11–15, 16–18, 19–23, 24–28, and 29–36) but not on EGF 1–5 (Fig. 4). The extent of elongation varied significantly, from 15% on EGF 19–23 to 80% on EGF 29–36. These results suggest that Fringe shows a preference for O-fucose on some EGF repeats relative to others. In addition, several fragments showed significant elongation in the absence of Mfng (EGF 16–18, 24–28, and 29–36), presumably due to the action of the endogenous Fringes. Significantly, O-fucose on EGF 11–15 was elongated to a small extent by the endogenous Fringes but significantly by Mfng. Since EGF 12 is the only site bearing O-fucose in EGF 11–15 (Fig. 3), these results suggest that EGF 12 is a substrate for Mfng modification. The data in Fig. 4 suggest that Fringes show a preference for O-fucose on some EGF repeats over others. To begin addressing the basis of this preference, we first analyzed whether Fringe recognizes O-fucose in the context of a simple primary amino acid sequence or in the context of a properly folded EGF repeat. Bacterially expressed EGF repeat-1 from factor VII modified with O-fucose was unfolded by reduction and alkylation (see “Experimental Procedures”), and both the native and unfolded EGF-O-fucose were analyzed as substrates for Fringe in an in vitro assay (Fig.5 a). The denatured EGF-O-fucose was a very poor substrate for Fringe compared with the folded EGF-O-fucose, showing that a correctly folded EGF is the optimal substrate for Fringe, as it is for proteinO-fucosyltransferase (28Wang Y.

However, whether β-arrestin 2 has any effect on the function of Mdm2 is still unclear. Our current results demonstrated that the binding of Mdm2 to β-arrestin 2 was significantly enhanced by stimulation of GPCRs. Activation of GPCRs led to formation of a ternary complex of Mdm2, β-arrestin 2, and GPCRs and thus recruited Mdm2 to GPCRs at plasma membrane. Moreover, the binding of β-arrestin 2 to Mdm2 suppressed the self-ubiquitination of Mdm2 and consequently reduced the Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation and ubiquitination. Further experiments revealed that overexpression of β-arrestin 2 enhanced the p53-mediated apoptosis while suppression of endogenous β-arrestin 2 expression by RNA interference technology considerably attenuated the p53-mediated apoptosis. Our study thus suggests that β-arrestin 2 may serve as a cross-talk linker between GPCR and p53 signaling pathways. Oncoprotein Mdm2 is a master negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 and has been recently shown to regulate the ubiquitination of β-arrestin 2, an important adapter and scaffold in signaling of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).

Our study thus suggests that β-arrestin 2 may serve as a cross-talk linker between GPCR and p53 signaling pathways. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a potent inhibitor of cell growth that can induce growth arrest and apoptosis (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Google Scholar, 2Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Google Scholar, 3Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Google Scholar). Oncoprotein Mdm2 is a key negative regulator of p53 function, which has been demonstrated by many studies including allelic knockout mice. Mice possessing homozygous deletions of Mdm2 die at around day 5 of embryogenesis; whereas mice possessing a homozygous deletion of both Mdm2 and p53 are viable and develop normally (4Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Google Scholar, 5Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of Mdm2 leads to the loss of p53 and tumor development (6Momand J. Wu H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Google Scholar). Transcription of the Mdm2 gene is strongly stimulated by the activated p53. The Mdm2 protein, in turn, binds to p53 and conceals its transactivation domain. Moreover, Mdm2 functions as a RING finger-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase and promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 by the proteasome (6Momand J. Wu H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Google Scholar, 7Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Google Scholar). Thus, Mdm2 and p53 form an autoregulatory feedback loop between the expression and function of p53 and Mdm2. It has been well established that the feedback loop connected Mdm2 and p53 is significantly activated in response to stress such as DNA damage or activation of oncogenes (6Momand J. Wu H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Google Scholar, 8Colman M.S. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Mut. Res. 2000; 462: 179-188Google Scholar). However, other important signaling may also potentially influence the Mdm2/p53 pathway. Mdm2 interacts with several cellular proteins in addition to p53 and some of them can regulate the Mdm2/p53 feedback loop by a change in the cellular distribution of Mdm2, alternation of the stability of Mdm2, or inhibition the E3 ligase activity of Mdm2 (6Momand J. Wu H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Google Scholar, 7Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Google Scholar, 8Colman M.S. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Mut. Res. 2000; 462: 179-188Google Scholar, 9Daujat S. Neel H. Piette J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 459-464Google Scholar). The distribution and shuttling of Mdm2 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (10Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Google Scholar, 11Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Google Scholar, 12Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Google Scholar) are greatly modulated by its association with the regulators, such as ARF, which assists the sequestering of Mdm2 in nucleoli and prevents its export to the cytoplasm (13Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Google Scholar, 14Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 579-591Google Scholar). Moreover, Mdm2 regulates its own stability by autoubiquitination via the interaction with its partner. For example, the direct binding of Tsg101 or MdmX to Mdm2 leads to the inhibition of the degradation and autoubiquitination of Mdm2 (6Momand J. Wu H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Google Scholar, 9Daujat S. Neel H. Piette J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 459-464Google Scholar,15Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Google Scholar). Recently, β-arrestin 2 has been identified as a novel partner of Mdm2, which targets β-arrestin 2 for ubiquitination (16Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Google Scholar). But whether β-arrestin 2 has any effect on the function of Mdm2 is still to be investigated. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DOR, δ opioid receptor; nt, nucleotide; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DOR, δ opioid receptor; nt, nucleotide; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference a large superfamily of seven transmembrane cell-surface receptors, are responsible for many physiological processes. Stimulation with agonist causes the phosphorylation of the receptor by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (17Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351Google Scholar). Then β-arrestin translocates from cytoplasm to cell membrane and binds to the phosphorylated GPCRs. Binding of β-arrestin to GPCRs causes receptor desensitization and internalization and thus regulates signaling of GPCRs (18Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Google Scholar, 19Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 729-733Google Scholar). Recent discoveries indicate that the β-arrestin also plays important roles as scaffold-linking GPCRs to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, such as JNK3 (20McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Google Scholar). β-Arrestin 2 recruits ASK1 and JNK3 together and enhances the GPCR-mediated activation of JNK3, which has been reported to be tightly associated with cell apoptosis (21Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). More interestingly, it is demonstrated that the stable recruitment of visual arrestin to the activated rhodopsin in the fly leads to retinal cell apoptosis (22Kiselev A. Socolich M. Vinos J. Hardy R.W. Zuker C.S. Ranganathan R. Neuron. 2000; 28: 139-152Google Scholar,23Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 129-138Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that arrestin may function as a potential linker of GPCR signaling to apoptotic pathways, which, however, remains to be further explored. In the current study, we demonstrate that activation of GPCRs stimulates the association of β-arrestin 2 with oncoprotein Mdm2 and thus regulates the function of Mdm2. Our results suggest that β-arrestin 2 play a potential role in mediating GPCR signaling to p53 pathway. The ProQuest two-hybrid system and the mouse fetal brain cDNA library were purchased from Invitrogen. The bait for library screening was the full-length of human β-arrestin 2. Two-hybrid screening was carried out according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Normal liver L02 and HepG2 cells were cultured in 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. p53-null human osteosarcoma Saos2 and lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method as described previously (24Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Google Scholar). For all transfection experiments, CMV-β-gal was used to compensate the total DNA input. Full-length Mdm2, MdmX, and p53 were cloned from mouse brain into modified pcDNA3 vector in-frame with HA or FLAG tag at the N terminus. GFP-Mdm2 and the Mdm2 mutants were subcloned by PCR from HA-Mdm2 into pcDNA3 with the GFP tag at the N terminus. β-Arrestin 2 and its mutant V54D clones were generated as described (24Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Google Scholar). Ubiquitin plasmid was obtained from Dr. Dirk Bohmann (University of Rochester Medical Center). The authenticity of the DNA sequences was confirmed by sequencing. Construction of RNAi plasmid for β-arrestin 2 was performed as described (25Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Google Scholar). The BS/U6 vector was a generous gift from Dr. Yang Shi (Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). A 22-nt oligonucleotide (oligo1) corresponding to nucleotides 216–237 of the β-arrestin 2 coding region was first inserted into the BS/U6 vector with ApaI andXhoI. The inverted motif that contains the 6-nt spacer and 5 Ts (oligo2) was then subcloned into the XhoI andEcoRI sites of the intermediate plasmid to generate BS/U6/β-arrestin 2. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding β-galactosidase or β-arrestin 2 were prepared as described previously (26Craig R. Larkin A. Mingo A.M. Thuerauf D.J. Andrews C. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23814-23824Google Scholar). Briefly, β- galactosidase or β-arrestin 2 was cloned into shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV using standard cloning protocol, and the shuttle vectors were recombined with pAdEasy-1, which harbors a CMV-driven GFP, to form the viral constructs. The adenoviral plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells to generate recombinant adenovirus. The L02 or Saos2 cells were infected with the adenovirus for 12 h, and then the virus was removed to let cells recover. The infection efficiency was determined by observing GFP fluorescence, and the quantity of virus that afforded at least 80% transfection efficiency was selected for the experiments. The cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1.5 h at 4 °C 48 h after transfection. Cell extracts were cleared, and the supernatant was incubated at 4 °C with anti-HA (1 μg; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-FLAG (1 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody or anti-β-arrestin egg yolk IgY produced with recombinant β-arrestin 2 from chicken (1:1000) for 2 h. Immune complexes were immobilized on protein A (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-chicken IgY Sepharose beads (Promega) for 3 h, washed three times with Lysis Buffer, heated in SDS sample buffer in a 50 °C water bath for 20 min. Western analysis was performed as previously described (24Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Google Scholar). HA-tagged proteins were detected with anti-HA antibody and GFP-tagged protein with anti-GFP antibody. Endogenous Mdm2 was detected with antibody specific to Mdm2 (Ab3, Oncogene Research Products) or SIMP14 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with indicated plasmids. 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% polyformaldehyde for 20 min and incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. HA-tagged fusion proteins were detected with anti-HA antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (green) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Endogenous Mdm2 were detected with anti-Mdm2 SIMP14 antibody and a Texas Red-conjugated IgG (red). Coverslips were analyzed on Leica TCSNT laser confocal scanning microscope. 44 h after transfection, the cells were treated with the cell-permeable proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 (10 μm, Sigma), for 4 h and then lysed in Lysis Buffer. The Mdm2-ubiquitin and p53-ubiquitin complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibody and anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody to detect ubiquitinated proteins. Endogenous Mdm2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Mdm2 antibody (H-221, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and p53 with anti-p53 antibody (FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blotting analysis with ubiquitin-specific antibody (Ub P4D1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Saos2 cells were cultured in 6-well plates and transfected with indicated plasmids along with the plasmid of CMV-EGFP. After 48 h, the cultures were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope, and the transfected cells were marked by the presence of green fluorescence. Apoptotic cells were identified and accounted by their rounded morphology, in contrast to the spreaded-out morphology of nonapoptotic cells (27Zeng X. Li X. Miller A. Yuan Z. Yuan W. Kwok R.P. Goodman R. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1299-1310Google Scholar). The assay for cell death was performed by trypan blue staining (28Chan P.C. Lai J.F. Cheng C.H. Tang M.J. Chiu C.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation analysis was performed as described (29Zhang Y.G. Mattjus P. Schmid P.C. Dong Z. Zhong S. Ma W.Y. Brown R.E. Bode A.M. Schmid H.H. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11775-11782Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after infection with indicated virus, the cells were treated with UV (10 J/m2) and cultured for additional 24 h. Both floating and adherent cells were harvested and lysed with buffer containing 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100, and left on ice overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the fragmented DNA in the supernatant fraction was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isopropyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) and once with chloroform and then precipitated overnight at −20 °C. The DNA fragments were separated by 1.4% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The full-length human β-arrestin 2 was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a mouse fetal brain complementary DNA library, and Mdm2 was thus identified as a binding partner of β-arrestin 2. Their interaction in mammalian cells was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). These results were consistent with the recent report by Shenoy et al. (16Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Google Scholar). The interaction between β-arrestin 2 and MdmX, a Mdm2-related protein, was also examined in expressed HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, β-arrestin 2 interacted well with Mdm2 whereas the interaction between MdmX and β-arrestin 2 was hardly detected under the same conditions. Moreover, the presence of MdmX did not interfere with the interaction between Mdm2 and β-arrestin 2. When the presence Mdm2, MdmX could be coimmunoprecipitated with β-arrestin 2, indicating β-arrestin 2, Mdm2, and MdmX can form a ternary complex. Agonist stimulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor could increase the association of β-arrestin 1 and its partner Src (30Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della-Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of GPCR activation on the interaction between β-arrestin 2 and Mdm2 was examined. The HEK293 cells coexpressing β-arrestin 2, Mdm2, and δ opioid receptor (DOR), which has been shown to interact with β-arrestin 2 well (31Cen B. Yu Q. Guo J. Wu Y. Ling K. Cheng Z. Ma L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1887-1894Google Scholar), were stimulated with DOR-specific agonist DPDPE, and then β-arrestin 2 was immunoprecipited. As shown in Fig.2 A, Mdm2 was present in the β-arrestin 2 immunoprecipitates, and an increase in β-arrestin 2-bound Mdm2 was clearly detected after 2 min of agonist exposure and peaked at 5 min. Stimulation of another GPCR, the β2adrenergic receptor, could also lead to the increase in the association of these two proteins (data not shown). Then we tested the effect of endogenous GPCR activation on the interaction between the endogenous β-arrestin 2 and Mdm2. As shown in Fig. 2 B, DPDPE treatment apparently increased the association of endogenous Mdm2 and β-arrestin in neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and pretreatment with DOR antagonist naloxone blocked the effect of DPDPE. Stimulation with bradykinin, which stimulates the endogenous bradykinin receptors, for 30 min also enhanced the interaction of endogenous Mdm2 and β-arrestin in HepG2 cells (Fig.2 C). These results provide clear evidence that stimulation of GPCRs can regulate the interaction between β-arrestin 2 and Mdm2. Then we asked whether β-arrestin 2 could bring Mdm2 to the activated receptors through its binding to Mdm2. DOR was coexpressed with Mdm2 in the presence or absence of β-arrestin 2 in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3,A and B, in the absence of coexpressed β-arrestin 2, DOR could not coprecipitate Mdm2 (this may be due to a low level of endogenous β-arrestin 2 in HEK293 cells). In the presence of β-arrestin 2 but without stimulation of DOR, only weak binding of Mdm2 to DOR was observed. This binding was significantly enhanced after a 10-min exposure to DOR agonist. These data demonstrate that β-arrestin 2 can recruit Mdm2 to DOR, and suggest that DOR, β-arrestin 2, and Mdm2 form a ternary complex in an agonist-dependent manner. We further examined whether Mdm2 could colocalize with the activated GPCRs under more physiological conditions. When DOR was expressed in HEK293 cells, endogenous Mdm2 was predominantly distributed in nucleus and scarcely colocalized with DOR at the plasma membrane. After the cells were exposed to DPDPE, a proportion of Mdm2 was found to translocate to the plasma membrane where it colocalized with DOR (Fig.3 C). Similar results were also obtained when the β2 adrenergic receptor was stimulated (data not shown). Moreover, pretreatment with naloxone completely blocked the translocation of Mdm2 induced by DPDPE (Fig. 3 C). Thus, our data suggest that the subcellular distribution of endogenous Mdm2 can be modulated by GPCR activation. To map the Mdm2 interaction region in β-arrestin 2, we used β-arrestin 2 deletion mutants in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The wild type or mutant β-arrestin 2 was expressed in HEK293 cells along with Mdm2, and coimmunoprecipitation of Mdm2 with β-arrestin 2 was monitored by immunoblotting. Deletion of amino acids 1–185 from the N terminus of β-arrestin 2 resulted in the complete loss of Mdm2 binding. Conversely, a β-arrestin 2 fragment containing amino acids 1–185 associated with Mdm2 as efficiently as the full-length β-arrestin 2, strongly indicating that Mdm2 binds to the β-arrestin 2 N terminus (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, an N-terminal point mutation of β-arrestin 2, Val54 → Asp (V54D), which inhibits the internalization of GPCRs (32Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Google Scholar), also failed to interact with Mdm2 (Fig. 4 B). This further supports that the N terminus of β-arrestin 2 contains the Mdm2 binding sites. Because the shortest Mdm2 clone identified in our yeast two-hybrid system-encoded fragment comprised amino acids from 358 to 489 in the C terminus of Mmd2, we further tested the importance of this region to the Mdm2 binding to β-arrestin 2. A series of Mdm2 deletion mutants (Fig. 4 C) were used in coimmunoprecipitation assays, and the results showed that among them the mutants of Mdm2-(1–358) and Mdm2-(1–383) lost their ability to bind to β-arrestin 2 (Fig.4 D). In contrast, Mdm2-(1–410) and Mdm2-(1–435) still associated with β-arrestin 2 to an extent comparable to the full-length Mdm2 (Fig. 4 D). These data indicate that the region from 383 to 410 of Mdm2 is essential for β-arrestin 2 binding. Mdm2 is a RING finger-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 and targets p53 for ubiquitination and degradation in a ubiquitin-dependent pathway. It has been reported that degradation of p53 mediated by Mdm2 is regulated by several binding partners of Mdm2 (13Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Google Scholar, 15Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Google Scholar). We therefore questioned whether binding of β-arrestin 2 to Mdm2 could interfere with Mdm2-directed p53 degradation. In a standard assay that tests the potential effect of Mdm2 partner on Mdm2/p53 feedback loop, coexpression of Mdm2 resulted in a significant reduction of p53 protein level in Saos2 cells, which lack p53 (Fig.5, A and B). Further coexpression of increasing amounts of β-arrestin 2 could effectively restore the protein level of p53 (Fig. 5, A andB), indicating the reduction of the Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation by β-arrestin 2. Furthermore, the coexpression of β-arrestin 2-(1–185), which binds to Mdm2, could restore p53 level while β-arrestin 2-(186–409), which does not bind to Mdm2, failed to do so (Fig. 5 D). The above data demonstrate that binding of β-arrestin 2 with Mdm2 functionally regulates Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. In support of this notion, our results showed that coexpression of β-arrestin 2 or β-arrestin 2-(1–185) but not β-arrestin 2-(186–409) also increased the protein level of Mdm2 since the binding of β-arrestin 2 with Mdm2 regulates the stability of Mdm2 (Fig. 5, A and C). In all cases, the expression levels of the control protein GFP cotransfected were not affected by cotransfection of other plasmids, β-arrestin 2, Mdm2, and p53 (Fig. 5 A), indicating that coexpression of β-arrestin 2 unlikely interferes with the protein synthesis of Mdm2 or p53. To further investigate β-arrestin 2-mediated stabilization of the Mdm2 and p53, the effect of β-arrestin 2 on ubiquitination of Mdm2 and p53 was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, coexpression of β-arrestin 2 significantly reduced the self-ubiquitination of Mdm2 and the Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. In contrast, coexpression of V54D β-arrestin 2 mutant, which does not bind to Mdm2, had no effect on Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination (Fig.6 B). In L02 cells, a normal liver cell line that expresses wild type p53 (32Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Google Scholar), infection with adenovirus expressing β-arrestin 2 could similarly reduce the ubiquitination of both endogenous Mdm2 and p53 as compared with that with the control virus (Fig. 6, Cand D). Taken together, these data indicate that β-arrestin 2 negatively regulates self-ubiquitination of Mdm2 and Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 via its binding with Mdm2. Since overexpression of β-arrestin 2 could effectively reduce the Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation, its consequence on the p53 function was next examined in Saos2 cells. As shown in Fig.7 A, introduction of p53 into Saos2 cells resulted in apoptosis in 60% of the transfected cells and coexpression of Mdm2 significantly inhibited the apoptotic function of p53. Further coexpression of β-arrestin 2 strongly restored p53-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 7 A), consistent with its reduction of p53 degradation. Similar results were also observed in another p53-null cell line H1299 (data not shown). Then we used double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi), which has recently emerged as a powerful reverse genetic tool to silence gene expression in multiple organisms, to test the effect of endogenous β-arrestin 2 on p53-induced apoptosis. We transfected Saos2 cells with RNAi plasmid of β-arrestin 2 or the control vector, and the expression of endogenous β-arrestin 2 was remarkably reduced compared with the control level as detected by Western blotting (Fig.7 B), while the expression of actin was not affected under the same conditions. Further experiments showed that when β-arrestin 2 expression was reduced by RNAi, the p53-mediated apoptosis was also attenuated (Fig. 7 C). The effect of β-arrestin 2 overexpression was examined using another independent assay that measures cell death. In L02 cells that express wild type p53, the infection with β-arrestin 2 adenovirus caused a significantly higher ratio of cell death than that with the comparable level of β-galactosidase adenovirus (Fig. 7 D). It has been known that Mdm2/p53 loop is regulated by UV irradiation, and our results from DNA fragmentation assays showed that overexpression of β-arrestin 2 significantly enhanced the apoptosis in both UV-irradiated or control L02 cells. In contrast, overexpression of β-arrestin 2 exerted no effect on apoptosis in p53-null Saos2 cells (Fig. 7 E). These data clearly show that β-arrestin 2 affects cell apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. To further test the effect of β-arrestin 2 expression on p53-mediated apoptosis, the expression level of p21, which is strongly transactivated by p53, was analyzed under the same conditions. In Saos2 cells, transfection of p53 strongly induced the expression of endogenous p21, and this could be inhibited by cotransfected Mdm2. Further coexpression of β-arrestin 2 was able to restore the protein levels of p21 transactivated by p53 while V54D β-arrestin 2 mutant failed to do so, as shown in Fig. 7 F. β-Arrestin 2 has been established as an important modulator of GPCR signaling and Mdm2 as the master regulator of p53 function, but little is known regarding cross-talk between GPCR pathways and p53 apoptotic apparatus. Under normal circumstances, the cellular concentration of Mdm2 is maintained at low levels and most are distributed in the nucleus to control the function of p53 (33Liao C. Zhao M. Song H. Uchida K. Yokoyama K.K. Li T. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 721-727Google Scholar, 34Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1-7Google Scholar). Mdm2 in the cytoplasm is present at much lower levels compared with the nucleus, and little Mdm2 is detected at the plasma membrane to regulate GPCRs (35Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that under physiological conditions β-arrestin 2 not only physically interacted with oncoprotein Mdm2 but also functionally modulated the subcellular distribution of Mdm2, thus providing a solid basis for the functional consequence of β-arrestin 2-Mdm2 interaction. Our study further revealed that the association of β-arrestin and Mdm2 was greatly promoted by activation of GPCRs and thus led to reduction of Mdm2 function in the feedback loop of Mdm2/p53. According to the results of this study and Shenoy et al. (16Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Google Scholar), which demonstrates that Mdm2 functionally regulates GPCR trafficking by interacting with and ubiquitinating β-arrestin 2, a bi-directional regulatory model of β-arrestin 2/Mdm2 interaction can be proposed as following. Activation of GPCRs by various extracellular signals significantly increases the binding of β-arrestin 2 and Mdm2 and thus effectively shifts the equilibrium of Mdm2 subcellular distribution from nucleus to plasma membrane. The functional consequences of the enhanced β-arrestin 2/Mdm2 interaction are in one direction to promote ubiquitination of β-arrestin 2 and assist internalization of GPCRs and in the other direction to modulate Mdm2/p53 feedback loop and reduce the ubiquitination and degradation of p53. In summary, the current study strongly suggests a potential role for GPCR signaling in modulation of p53-mediated apoptosis and clearly indicates that β-arrestin 2 may serve as a signaling linker between the GPCR and p53 pathways. Accumulating evidence indicates that residues 220–437 of Mdm2 are critical for its function since the mutant of Mdm2 lacking this region is incapable of mediating p53 degradation (36Strous G.J. Schantl J.A. Sci. STKE. 2001; 110: PE41Google Scholar). Many partners of Mdm2 are known to bind to this region of Mdm2 and thus exert their indirect effects on p53 (6Momand J. Wu H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Google Scholar). For instance, Rb and ARF proteins, both of which bind to Mdm2 in this region, are able to inhibit the ability of Mdm2 to target p53 for degradation though different mechanisms may exist (6Momand J. Wu H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-29Google Scholar, 9Daujat S. Neel H. Piette J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 459-464Google Scholar,37Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Google Scholar, 38Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Google Scholar). A recent study (39Hsieh J.K. Chan F.S. O'Connor D.J. Mittnacht S. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 181-193Google Scholar) shows that ATM kinase phosphorylates Mdm2 at serine 395 in this region in response to DNA damage and reduces the capability of Mdm2 to promote p53 degradation. Our current results demonstrate that the β-arrestin 2 binding site on Mdm2 (residues 383–410) was also located in this important region, and the interaction of β-arrestin with this small segment was critical to functionally inhibit Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation as in the case of Rb (Mdm2-(272–320)) or ARF (Mdm2-(210–244)). The β-arrestin 2 binding site on Mdm2 identified in this study is a little different from the β-arrestin 2 binding site on Mdm2 reported previously (16Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Google Scholar) (which may be due to the different source of Mdm2), but both these sites are in this important region. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the β-arrestin 2 binding site is adjacent to the RING finger domain of Mdm2 (435–489), which is necessary for its ubiquitin ligase activity for itself and p53 (40Maya R. Balass M. Kimm S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Google Scholar). One of the Mdm2 regulators, Mdmx, is demonstrated to bind to the RING finger domain of Mdm2 and to stabilize both p53 and Mdm2 (41Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N. Grivell S. Attema J. van Der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 36: 28039-28044Google Scholar). Thus one of the molecular mechanisms for β-arrestin 2 to inhibit Mdm2 function could be hypothesized as that the binding of β-arrestin 2 to Mdm2 somehow interferes with its ubiquitin ligase activity and thus consequently attenuates the self-ubiquitination of Mdm2 and ubiquitination of p53, as observed in this study. Moreover, our previous report shows that the -(S/T)X 4–5(S/T)- motif is critical for β-arrestin 2 to bind to DOR (42Cen B. Xiong Y. Ma L. Pei G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 758-764Google Scholar). Interestingly, the β-arrestin 2 binding region in Mdm2 identified in this study also contains several such motifs, and this may provide the structural basis for β-arrestin 2/Mdm2 interaction. MdmX is structurally homologous to Mdm2 and has been demonstrated to function as another critical negative regulator of p53 functionin vivo. Loss of MdmX results in p53-dependent embryonic lethality in mice (43Migliorini D. Denchi E.L. Danovi D. Jochemsen A. Capillo M. Gobbi A. Helin K. Pelicci P.G. Marine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5527-5538Google Scholar, 44Finch R.A. Donoviel D.B. Potter D. Shi M. Fan A. Freed D.D. Wang C.Y. Zambrowicz B.P. Ramirez-Solis R. Sands A.T. Zhang N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3221-3325Google Scholar). MdmX can directly bind to the RING finger domain of Mdm2 and thus stabilizes both Mdm2 and p53 via inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 (40Maya R. Balass M. Kimm S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Google Scholar). In addition, MdmX can directly interact with p53 and inhibit the acetylation of p53 induced by CBP/p300 (45Sabbatini P. McCormick F. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 519-525Google Scholar) and inhibit the p53-mediated transcription. Recent evidence shows that MdmX is also a ubiquitin ligase and mediates the ubiquitination of p53 (46Badciong J.C. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49668-49675Google Scholar). Although MdmX has similar structure and function with Mdm2, our results showed that the interaction between MdmX and β-arrestin 2, if any, should be much weaker than that between Mdm2 and β-arrestin 2. Moreover, our data also revealed that the presence of MdmX did not interfere with the interaction between the β-arrestin 2 and Mdm2. Taken together, the current study indicates that MdmX is unlikely involved in the β-arrestin 2 regulation of Mdm2 function. Several lines of evidence from this study clearly demonstrated that the association of β-arrestin 2 and Mdm2 was significantly enhanced by specific stimulation of GPCRs. The enhancement of β-arrestin 2/Mdm2 interaction by GPCR activation has greatly shifted the distribution equilibrium of Mdm2 from nucleus to cytoplasm and thus effectively reduces the Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. There exist at least two possible explanations on how β-arrestin 2/Mdm2 interaction is enhanced by GPCR activation. It has been well established that stimulation of GPCRs leads to the phosphorylation of receptors and the subsequent enhancement of β-arrestin binding to the phosphorylated GPCRs. Moreover, the association of β-arrestin with its partner, such as dishevelled protein (Dvl), is also significantly augmented by phosphorylation of Dvl (47Chen W. Hu L.A. Semenov M.V. Yanagawa S. Kikuchi A. Lefkowitz R.J. Miller W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14889-14894Google Scholar). Since Mdm2 can be phosphorylated by several protein kinases such as ATM or Akt, and importantly Akt can be activated efficiently by GPCR stimulation (48Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 338-344Google Scholar). So one possibility may be that the potential phosphorylation of Mdm2 stimulated by GPCR signaling enhances the β-arrestin 2/Mdm2 interaction. In addition, the current study demonstrated that Mdm2, mediated by β-arrestin 2, could be recruited to the activated GPCRs at cytoplasm membrane where they were colocalized and that the activated receptor, β-arrestin 2, and Mdm2 could be precipitated together in an agonist-dependent manner. Therefore, the other possibility may be that after stimulation of GPCRs the activated receptor, β-arrestin 2, and Mdm2 form a ternary complex that greatly enhances the association between β-arrestin 2 and Mdm2. This may also explain why stimulation of either Gi-, Gs-, or Gq-coupled receptors can enhance the β-arrestin 2-Mdm2 interaction. However, the actual scenario, in which both mechanisms described above may work simultaneously or other unknown ones may be involved, remains to be further investigated. We thank Dr. D.

https://openalex.org/W2014968902,"G protein βγ dimers can be phosphorylated in membranes from various tissues by GTP at a histidine residue in the β subunit. The phosphate is high energetic and can be transferred onto GDP leading to formation of GTP. Purified Gβγ dimers do not display autophosphorylation, indicating the involvement of a separate protein kinase. We therefore enriched the Gβ-phosphorylating activity present in preparations of the retinal G protein transducin and in partially purified Gi/oproteins from bovine brain. Immunoblots, autophosphorylation, and enzymatic activity measurements demonstrated enriched nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) B in both preparations, together with residual Gβγ dimers. In the retinal NDPK B-enriched fractions, a Gβ-specific antiserum co-precipitated phosphorylated NDPK B, and an antiserum against the human NDPK co-precipitated phosphorylated Gβγ. In addition, the NDPK-containing fractions from bovine brain reconstituted the phosphorylation of purified Gβγ. For identification of the phosphorylated histidine residue, bovine brain Gβγ and Gtβγ were thiophosphorylated with guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate, followed by digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C and trypsin, separation of the resulting peptides by gel electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography, respectively, and sequencing of the radioactive peptides. The sequence information produced by both methods identified specific labeled fragments of bovine Gβ1 that overlapped in the heptapeptide, Leu-Met-Thr-Tyr-Ser-His-Asp (amino acids 261–267). We conclude that NDPK B forms complexes with Gβγ dimers and contributes to G protein activation by increasing the high energetic phosphate transfer onto GDP via intermediately phosphorylated His-266 in Gβ1 subunits. G protein βγ dimers can be phosphorylated in membranes from various tissues by GTP at a histidine residue in the β subunit. The phosphate is high energetic and can be transferred onto GDP leading to formation of GTP.

For identification of the phosphorylated histidine residue, bovine brain Gβγ and Gtβγ were thiophosphorylated with guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate, followed by digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C and trypsin, separation of the resulting peptides by gel electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography, respectively, and sequencing of the radioactive peptides. The sequence information produced by both methods identified specific labeled fragments of bovine Gβ1 that overlapped in the heptapeptide, Leu-Met-Thr-Tyr-Ser-His-Asp (amino acids 261–267). We conclude that NDPK B forms complexes with Gβγ dimers and contributes to G protein activation by increasing the high energetic phosphate transfer onto GDP via intermediately phosphorylated His-266 in Gβ1 subunits. nucleoside diphosphate kinase guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate guanosine-5′-O-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate rod outer segment N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine high pressure liquid chromatography molecular mass Heterotrimeric G proteins play a pivotal role in many signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells. They consist of a guanine nucleotide-binding α subunit (40–52 kDa), a β subunit (33–43 kDa), and a γ subunit (6–10 kDa). The latter two act as a functional unit and only dissociate upon denaturation. Both Gα and Gβγ are required for receptor-induced G protein activation and can trigger effector functions (for reviews see Refs. 1Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 177-198PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wieland T. Schulze R.A. Jakobs K.H. Wirtz K.W.A. Molecular Mechanisms of Signalling and Targeting.

Heterotrimeric G proteins are activated by a GDP/GTP exchange catalyzed by G protein-coupled receptors. Furthermore, we and other laboratories provided evidence that phosphotransfer reactions can participate in G protein activation in vitro by formation of GTP. There is amble evidence that nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK)1 contributes to G protein activation by replenishment of GTP from ATP and GDP (for reviews see Refs. 4Piacentini L. Niroomand F. Mol.

Also complex formation of NDPK with G proteins and channeling of NDPK-formed GTP into Gα (10Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 731-735PubMed Google Scholar,11Orlov N.Y. Orlova T.G.

A phosphotransfer reaction that uses Gβ subunits as phosphorylated intermediates has been observed in various tissues (12Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Wieland T. Nürnberg B. Ulibarri I. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol.

Seavey S.E. Rhodes C.J. Metz S.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the γ-(thio)phosphate group of GTP or its analog GTPγS is transferred onto a histidine residue of Gβ. Apparently, a membrane-bound, so far unknown co-factor is required to achieve this phosphorylation (14Hohenegger M. Mitterauer T. Voss T. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 73-78PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nürnberg B. Harhammer R. Exner T. Schulze R.A. Wieland T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Out of the labile high energy phosphoamidate bond, the phosphate can be retransferred onto GDP to form GTP, which then can activates Gi and Gs proteins and thus regulates, for example, adenylyl cyclase activity (17Wieland T. Ronzani M. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20791-20797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the exact significance of this phosphotransfer reaction remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that NDPK may represent the unknown co-factor and contributes to the phosphate transfer via Gβ. We report here that by the attempts to purify the co-factor from the retinal G protein transducin (Gt) or bovine brain membranes, we specifically enriched the NDPK B isoform. We will further provide evidence for a complex formation of Gβγ with NDPK B and for a specific phosphorylation of His-266 of Gβ1 in this complex. Rod outer segment (ROS) membranes were prepared from illuminated bovine retina according to Papermaster and Dreyer (18Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). NDPK was purified to homogeneity from the cytosol essentially as described (19Abdulaev N.G. Karaschuk G.N. Ladner J.E. Kakuev D.L. Yakhyaev A.V. Tordova M. Gaidarov I.O. Popov V.I. Fujiwara J.H. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Gilliland G.L. Ridge K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13958-13967Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Gt was eluted from the membranes by repeated washing with the GTP analog, GppNHp (100 μm), as described (12Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Gt-containing eluate was concentrated by pressure filtration with a PM 10 membrane (Amicon, Witten, Germany), and unbound GppNHp was removed by a gel PD-10 gel filtration column (AmershamBiosciences) (12Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). About 2 mg of purified Gt was applied onto a Blue-Sepharose CL6B column (10-ml bed volume) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and separated into Gtβγ and Gtα as described (12Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Gtα-containing fractions were pooled and applied onto a 5-ml hydroxyapatite column (Econo Cartridge CHTII; Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was washed with 20 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. Bound proteins were eluted with a KH2PO4 gradient (0–400 mm). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for the content of Gt subunits, Gβ-phosphorylating activity, and NDPK activity. Fractions containing the Gβ-phosphorylating activity were pooled and stored at −80 °C. Membranes from bovine brain were prepared as described (20Sternweis P.C. Pang I.-H. Hulme E.J. Receptor-Effector Coupling. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 1-30Google Scholar). Proteins were solubilized from membranes (4 g of protein) by stirring for 1 h at 4 °C in 800 ml of TEM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm2-mercaptoethanol) containing 1% (w/v) 1-octyl-1-β-d-thioglucopyranoside (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany). After centrifugation for 40 min at 110,000 ×g, ethylene glycol was added to the supernatants to a final concentration of 30%. 900 ml of this extract, i.e. ∼800 mg of protein, were used for three subsequent steps of liquid chromatography, carried out at 4 °C, using a fast protein liquid chromatography device. Elution was monitored by continuous measurement of absorbance at 280 nm. The extract was first loaded onto a column (10 × 13 cm) containing 1 liter of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After washing with TEMEC (TEM buffer containing additionally 30% ethylene glycol and 0.9% (w/v) sodium cholate), elution was performed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–800 mm, volume 2.2 liters). Fractions of 12 ml were collected. Gi/o proteins eluted from the column at about 450 mm NaCl were further purified and separated into their subunits as described (20Sternweis P.C. Pang I.-H. Hulme E.J. Receptor-Effector Coupling. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 1-30Google Scholar, 21Nürnberg B. Spicher K. Harhammer R. Bosserhoff A. Frank R. Hilz H. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fractions capable of phosphorylating Gβ subunits were identified in the phosphorylation assay (see below), using 0.3 μg of bovine brain Gβγ as substrate. Positive fractions eluting at 220–270 mm NaCl were pooled and concentrated by pressure filtration using a PM 10 membrane. This pool (about 35 mg of protein) was then loaded onto a column (3 × 14 cm) containing 100 ml of hydroxyapatite (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was washed with TEMEC. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (0–400 mm, pH 8, volume 300 ml), collecting fractions of 5 ml. Phosphorylation-positive fractions eluting at phosphate concentrations of 270–290 mm were pooled and concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged into HEMEC (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 30% ethylene glycol, 0.9% sodium cholate). This pool (about 6 mg of protein) was then loaded onto a XK16/20 column (Amersham Biosciences) containing 25 ml of EMD SO3 650(S) (E. Merck), at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column was washed with HEMEC. Elution from the cation exchange column was performed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m, volume 80 ml) in HEMEC. Fractions of 2 ml were collected. Positive fractions eluting between 350 and 400 mm NaCl were concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon-30 device (Amicon). Chromatography media were regenerated according to the respective manufacturer's recommendations. The indicated amounts of bovine brain or transducin Gβγ dimers and column fractions of the purification procedures were phosphorylated with 10 nm [γ-32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for the indicated periods of time at 30 °C in a reaction buffer containing 50 mmtriethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 20 μl. For thiophosphorylation of Gβ, 20 nm[35S]GTPγS was used, and incubation was for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of one volume of sample buffer, followed by 1 h of incubation at room temperature. Proteins were separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE on gels containing 10–12% (w/v) acrylamide and autoradiographed. The determination of the NDPK activity in preparations obtained from solubilized bovine brain membranes or Gt was performed in a reaction mixture (50 μl total volume) containing 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 1 μm [8-3H]GDP (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was started by addition of 20 μl of the protein-containing solutions and conducted for 30 min at room temperature. Termination of the reaction and analysis of GTP formation were performed essentially as described (22Klinker J.F. Seifert R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10–12% polyacrylamide in the resolving gel or modified gel) (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 166: 368-379Crossref Scopus (10470) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were washed with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl), incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3% skim milk in TTBS (TBS + 0.05% Tween 20), washed with TTBS, and incubated with the respective antisera (anti-Gβ (T-20; 1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-NDPK (C-20; 1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti Gαi,o,t,z (D-15; 1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit IgG anti-human NDPK A (1:500) (kind gift of Dr. Ioan Lascu), and rabbit IgG anti human NDPK B (1:500) (kind gift of Dr. Ioan Lascu)) for 3 h at room temperature. Horse radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG-antibody (1:10,000) was used as secondary antibody. Specific bands were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The pooled fractions (60 μl) from the hydroxyapatite column, containing the peak activity of NDPK from Gt, were phosphorylated in a final volume of 80 μl at 30 °C for 7 min. The reaction was terminated by placing the mixture on ice and adding an equal volume of 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Precipitation buffer (280 μl), containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, and 0.2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, was added, followed by the addition of 10 μl of the same buffer containing 1 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads. After incubation on ice for 20 min and centrifugation (26,000 × g, 15 min), the clear supernatant was taken and supplemented with 0.6 μg of anti-Gβ (T-20) or 4 μg of anti-NDPK (C-20) antiserum and 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads. The mixture was gently shaken for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed three times with precipitation buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads by adding 50 μl of SDS buffer. The samples were kept at room temperature for at least 1 h before loading onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Purified Gtβγ (30 μg) was incubated for 10 min at room temperature in a buffer (100 μl) containing 10 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, and 10 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 mm EDTA. Free diethyl pyrocarbonate and EDTA were subsequently removed by repeated buffer exchange into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm2-mercaptoethanol using a Microcon-10 device (Amicon). Bovine brain Gβγ (15 μg of protein) was thiophosphorylated with 100 nm[35S]GTPγS and 1 μg of NDPK B-enriched co-factor as described above, in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μl of 3-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer and 10 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were digested for 3 h at 37 °C, and the proteolytic fragments were separated on a Tris-Tricine-based system (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 166: 368-379Crossref Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). After electrotransfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane, the labeled fragment was identified by autoradiography and excised. The peptide was eluted, and its amino acid sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems, Inc. (Foster City, CA) model 476A protein sequencer. Unmodified Gtβγ (5 μg) was thiophosphorylated with 100 nm [35S]GTPγS and 1 μg of co-factor as described above for 30 min in a total volume of 40 μl. Thereafter, 10 μg (20 μl) of unlabeled thiophosphorylated Gtβγ (12Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 35 μl of 50 mm NH4CO3, pH 7.7, 5 μl acetonitrile, and 2.5 μg of trypsin were added. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, the digest was injected directly into an analytical (2 × 250 mm) Ultrasep Es 100 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) C18 reverse phase HPLC column, equilibrated with a mixture of 90% Solution A (0.2% hexafluoroacetone, NH3, pH 8.6) and 10% Solution B (0.02% hexafluoroacetone, 84% methylcyanide). The gradient was run from 10 to 80% Solution B at an increase rate of 1%/min with a flow rate of 80 μl/min. The absorbance was monitored at 215 and 295 nm, and peak fractions were collected. 35S-Labeled peptides were detected by liquid scintillation counting of 3 μl of each fraction. The sequence of the peptide in the fraction containing the radioactivity peak was determined by automated Edman degradation. The β subunits of the retinal G protein Gt can be transiently (thio)phosphorylated by GTP or GTPγS and an enzymatic activity present in ROS membranes (12Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that soluble preparations of Gt contain NDPK activity and that GTP phosphorylates a 36-kDa protein, most likely Gβ (22Klinker J.F. Seifert R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to identify the putative co-factor present in the Gt preparations and investigated whether NDPK is involved in this reaction. For this purpose, Gt was eluted from ROS membranes with 100 μm of the stable GTP analog, GppNHp, which does not modify Gtβγ (12Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Gtβγ and Gtα can be resolved from each other by affinity chromatography on Blue-Sepharose (12Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Klinker J.F. Seifert R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whereas Gtβγ has little affinity to the matrix, elution of Gtα requires high salt concentrations (500 mm KCl). Single protein bands at the apparent molecular weights of Gtβγ and Gtα were detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (not shown) of the fractions from the first and second peak, respectively. In search for the Gtβ-phosphorylating activity, the fractions were subjected to phosphorylation with [γ-32P]GTP. In the Gtα-containing fraction, two phosphorylated proteins (Mm 18 and 36 kDa; see Fig. 1) were detected. Measurement of NDPK activity revealed a formation of 0.2 nmol GTP per mg of protein per min in this fraction. In line with data reported previously (12Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,22Klinker J.F. Seifert R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), no phosphorylated proteins and no NDPK activity was detected in the Gtβγ-containing fractions. To separate the two phosphoproteins from Gtα, ∼1 mg of protein from the second peak was applied onto a hydroxyapatite column, and proteins were eluted with increasing concentrations of potassium phosphate (0–400 mm). Gtα eluted from the column in a single peak at about 10 mm phosphate (fractions 23–26; see Fig.1 A). No NDPK activity and no phosphorylation by [γ-32P]GTP were detected in the Gtα peak. The NDPK activity eluted from the column at ∼250 mmphosphate (Fig. 1 B). As shown in the inset of Fig. 1 B, this fraction contained both the 18- and 36-kDa proteins phosphorylated by [γ-32P]GTP. Immunoblot analysis showed that this fraction contained NDPK protein, Gtβγ, and traces of Gtα. To identify the two proteins phosphorylated by [γ-32P]GTP, we immunoprecipitated Gβ and NDPK with specific antisera after phosphorylation. Identical amounts of IgG were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 2, the NDPK-specific antiserum precipitated NDPK as a doublet migrating at 18–20 kDa and an additional phosphoprotein at 36 kDa. The Gβ-specific antiserum precipitated phosphorylated Gβ (36 kDa) and an additional phosphoprotein at 18–20 kDa. Some minor phosphorylated bands in the range of 28 to 30 kDa most likely represent degradation products of phosphorylated Gβ. As Gt differs from other G proteins by its solubility without detergent, we attempted to purify the Gβ-phosphorylating activity from another tissue. Because heterotrimeric G proteins are abundant in bovine brain membranes, and the extent of Gβ phosphorylation is rather high compared with membranes of other tissues available in sufficient amounts (15Nürnberg B. Harhammer R. Exner T. Schulze R.A. Wieland T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we first passed a detergent extract from bovine brain membranes over a DEAE column. G proteins that elute from the column at about 450 mm NaCl could no longer be phosphorylated with [γ-32P]GTP (15Nürnberg B. Harhammer R. Exner T. Schulze R.A. Wieland T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (not shown). Apparently, the co-factor that promotes phosphorylation had been separated from the majority of G proteins. Addition of the fraction eluting at about 250 mm NaCl to the G protein-containing fraction or purified bovine brain Gβγ reconstituted the phosphorylation. The fraction that promoted Gβ phosphorylation was further purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography, followed by cation exchange chromatography using an EMD SO3 650(S) column. After each step, positive fractions were identified by their potential to phosphorylate Gβ. Equal amounts of protein (1 μg) were used after each step to reconstitute the phosphorylation of purified bovine brain Gβγ (0.5 μg). Phosphorylated Gβ subunits were excised from SDS-PAGE gels, and the amount of radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting, to estimate the specific activity after each purification step. The data are summarized in Table I. A small decrease in specific activity after the EMD SO3 cation exchange column was noted. However, the chromatogram showed that 97% of total protein could be removed during this step. Thus, the decrease in specific activity might have been because of decaying enzymatic activity in the diluted protein fraction during longer storage at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE and silver staining revealed that the fractions contained four to five faint protein bands in the molecular range from 20 to 50 kDa (not shown). Similar to the Gβ-phosphorylating activity prepared from Gt, NDPK activity (1.8 nmol of GTP formed per mg protein per min) and NDPK protein (immunoblot, autophosphorylation) could be detected (Fig.3 A). To test whether this preparation is able to reconstitute the phosphorylation of bovine Gβγ, increasing amounts of the EMD SO3 650(S) pool (0.04–0.4 μg of protein) were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]GTP in the absence and presence of purified Gβγ (0.5 μg) for 5 min at 30 °C (Fig. 3 B). Conversely, the phosphorylation of increasing amounts of purified bovine brain Gβγ dimers promoted by a constant quantity of partially purified factor (200 ng of protein) was studied (Fig.3 C). The phosphorylation of Gβ increased with the amount of added co-factor fraction or Gβγ dimer. Maximal phosphorylation was observed with 1–3 μg of Gβγ dimer. Similar data were obtained when Gtβγ was used as substrate (Fig.3 D). Previous results showed that pretreatment of membranes with diethyl pyrocarbonate prevents the phosphorylation of Gβ because of the ethoxycarbonylation of histidine residues (13Wieland T. Nürnberg B. Ulibarri I. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18111-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Similarly, Gtβγ pretreated with diethyl pyrocarbonate (10 mm) prior to phosphorylation with the co-factor-containing fraction exhibited no increase in phosphorylation of the ethoxycarbonylated Gtβ (Fig. 3 D). In addition, phosphorylated Gβ was sensitive to treatment with hydroxylamine (data not shown) that cleaves phosphohistidine (25Hokin L.S. Sastry P.S. Galsworthy P.R. Yoda A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 E, the co-factor-containing fraction also reconstituted the thiophosphorylation of Gβ by [35S]GTPγS. When higher amounts of the co-factor pool were used, the phosphorylated Gβ was detected also in the absence of added Gβγ (Fig. 3, A,B, and D). Indeed, small amounts of Gβ could be identified in the co-factor pool by Western blot analysis (Fig.3 A).Table ISummary of the enrichment of the Gβ-phosphorylating activity from bovine brain membranesPurification stepVolumeProtein concentrationTotal protein contentcpm/μg proteinSpecific activitymlμg/mlDetergent extract930889826.8 mg82.81DEAE17020334.5 mg725.98.8Hydroxyapatite361676.3 mg1823.722.0EMD SO34.542189 μg1506.818.2 Open table in a new tab Two major isoforms of NDPK, NDPK A (nm23-H1) and NDPK B (nm23-H2), are present in the bovine retina ROS (19Abdulaev N.G.

We therefore investigated whether one or both forms had been enriched during the purification procedures for the Gβ-phosphorylating activity by Western blot analysis with subtype-specific antisera (kindly provided by Dr. Ioan Lascu, Bordeaux, France) (Fig. 4). Purified recombinant human NDPK A and B (also kindly provided by Dr. Ioan Lascu) and purified NDPK from the cytosol of bovine ROS served as positive controls. Although the anti-NDPK A antiserum was more sensitive than the anti-NDPK B antiserum, only NDPK B was detected in the Gβ-phosphorylating fractions obtained from Gt and bovine brain membranes. Endoproteinase Glu-C cleaves proteins at the C-terminal end of glutamate residues and can additionally be used for in gel digests of proteins in a SDS-containing buffer. Complete digest of Gβ1 by endoproteinase Glu-C would produce several peptides in the range of 1000 to 13,500 kDa. Each contains not more than three histidine residues. We therefore asked whether we could detect a labeled phosphopeptide after in gel digest with endoproteinase Glu-C and separation of the peptides by high resolution SDS-PAGE (19Abdulaev N.G.

The cAMP-dependent lipid efflux in J774 mouse macrophages was decreased by ∼80–92% by apoA-I[Δ(185–243)], only by 15% by apoA-I[Δ(1–41)] or apoA-I[Δ(1–59)], and was restored to 75–80% of the wild-type apoA-I control value by double deletion mutants apoA-I[Δ(1–41)Δ(185–243)] and apoA-I[Δ(1–59)Δ(185–243)]. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells transfected with an ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression plasmid. The double deletion mutant of apoA-I had reduced thermal and chemical stability compared with wild-type apoA-I. Sequential carboxyl-terminal deletions showed that cAMP-dependent cholesterol efflux was diminished in all the mutants tested, except the apoA-I[Δ(232–243)] which had normal cholesterol efflux. In cAMP-untreated or in mock-transfected cells, cholesterol efflux was not affected by the amino-terminal deletions, but decreased by 30–40% and 50–65% by the carboxyl-terminal and double deletions, respectively. After adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in apoA-I-deficient mice, wild-type apoA-I and apoA-I[Δ(1–41)] formed spherical high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, whereas apoA-I[Δ(1–41)Δ(185–243)] formed discoidal HDL. The findings suggest that although the central helices of apoA-I alone can promote ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux, residues 220–231 are necessary to allow functional interactions between the full-length apoA-I and ABCA1 that are required for lipid efflux and HDL biogenesis.

Four different kinds of interaction between extracellular acceptors have been proposed to cause cholesterol efflux. (a) Natural or reconstituted HDL particles or other lipophilic acceptor particles can cause a passive diffusion of cholesterol from cholesterol-poor membrane domains through the aqueous phase (2Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M.

(b) Interaction of cellular proteins (e.g. scavenger receptor B-I) with HDL facilitates the efflux of unesterified cholesterol to extracellular cholesterol acceptors (7Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J.

Activation of the cholesterol-esterifying enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase by apoA-I also facilitates this process (10Fielding C.J. Shore V.G. Fielding P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

(c) Lipid-free apolipoproteins with a high content of amphipathic α-helices, such as apoA-I, can associate with multiple molecules of cellular phospholipids and free cholesterol by a process that was termed microsolubilization (12Gillotte K.L.

It has been proposed that initial interactions of apoA-I and ABCA1 promote efflux of membrane phospholipids, which results in the gradual extracellular lipidation of apoA-I and in the formation of pre-β1-HDL.

Because apoA-I can be cross-linked with ABCA1, a direct physical interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1 has been postulated as important for mediating the ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux. On the other hand it has also been suggested that ABCA1 does not interact physically with apoA-I but changes the membrane lipid microenvironment so that apoA-I can associate with the cell membrane and acquire phospholipids by binding in the proximity of ABCA1 (20Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Analysis of five naturally occurring ABCA1 mutants, in the first and fourth extracellular domains, that are defective in cholesterol efflux showed that four of the five mutants failed to cross-link to apoA-I. The findings suggest that either direct binding of apoA-I to ABCA1 or insertion of apoA-I in the plasma membrane in close proximity to ABCA1 is necessary but not sufficient to promote cholesterol efflux (31Fitzgerald M.L.

It has also been shown that ABCA1-mediated binding and lipid efflux are not specific for apoA-I but may also occur with other apolipoproteins that contain multiple amphipathic helical domains (27Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Duverger N.J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Previously, deletion mutants of apoA-I have been analyzed to unravel the structural requirements of apoA-I for inducing cholesterol efflux. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal helices 8–10 in apoA-I (apoA-I[Δ(187–243)] or apoA-I[Δ(210–243)]) reduced the ability of the mutant protein to bind to macrophages and to promote efflux of cholesterol and phospholipid (32Burgess J.W.

Likewise, deletion of amino acid residues 211–243 and 222–243 impaired the ability of apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux from cultures of hepatocytes and fibroblasts (13Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M.

In the present study we have analyzed the ability of various recombinant apoA-I mutants lacking amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains to promote efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid from J774 mouse macrophages in the presence of a cAMP analog (i.e.ABCA1-catalyzed) or in the absence of a cAMP analog (i.e. at least partially independent of ABCA1). We have performed similar analysis in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells following transient transfection with an ABCA1 expression plasmid. Thereby we found evidence that the ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux by the full-length apoA-I requires a carboxyl-terminal domain in apoA-I, which encompasses amino acid residues 220–231. The analysis of apoA-I mutants containing deletions in the amino-terminal region, carboxyl-terminal region, or both domains suggests that although there is ligand specificity of the full-length apoA-I, the central helices of apoA-I alone are capable of promoting ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux and the formation of discoidal HDL in vitro and in vivo. DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides for PCR, DH10Bac competent cells, cell culture reagents, recombinant Tobacco Etched Viral (rTEV) protease, and LipofectAMINE-2000 were purchased from Invitrogen. 1,2-[3H]Cholesterol (1 mCi/ml, specific activity range 40–60 Ci/mmol), methyl[3H]choline chloride (1 mCi/ml, specific activity range 60–90 Ci/mmol), and materials for PCR were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was purchased from Qiagen, Inc. (Valencia, CA). HiTrap Q HP columns, HiPrep Sephacryl S-200 column, Sepharose 6 PC column, and Q-Sepharose high performance resin were from Amersham Biosciences. 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (cpt-cAMP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, Bio-Rad, Fisher, or other standard commercial sources. To generate baculoviruses expressing wild-type (WT) and mutant apoA-I forms, a BamHI-SalI fragment containing human apoA-I cDNA was cloned into the polylinker region of pFASTBAC donor plasmid that contains the ampicillin and gentamycin resistance genes (Invitrogen). This recombinant plasmid also contains a histidine (His) tag and the TEV protease cleavage site. The apoA-I containing plasmid was used to transform DH10Bac Escherichia colicells. These cells had been transformed previously with the baculovirus genome containing the lacZ and kanamycin resistance genes, along with a helper plasmid containing the tetracycline resistance gene and the transposase genes. Transposition of theapoA-I gene into the lacZ gene disrupts the expression of the lacZ and provides a recombinant plasmid named bacmid. The generation of the donor plasmid expressing WT apoA-I and of plasmids expressing apoA-I[Δ(1–59)], apoA-I[Δ(185–243)], and apoA-I[Δ(1–59)Δ(185–243)] mutants was described previously (35Liadaki K.N.

Briefly, the human apoA-I cDNA was mutagenized by PCR, using a set of flanking universal primers containing the restriction sites BamHI and SalI, using the pBluescript-AI cDNA plasmid as template. The set of specific primers used in mutagenesis, and the set of universal primers 5′(AIWC-5) and 3′(AIWC-3) are shown in Table I. Specifically, we used 5′(AIM1–5) and 3′(AIM1–3) primers for the generation of apoA-I[Δ(1–41)], and 5′(AIM1–5) and 3′(AIM3–3) primers for the generation of apoA-I[Δ(1–41)Δ(185–243)]. The DNA fragment containing the mutation of interest was digested with BamHI and SalI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pFASTBAC donor plasmid. Cells containing recombinant bacmids were selected by kanamycin, tetracycline, and gentamycin resistance as white colonies due to the disruption of lacZ sequence in the recombinant bacmid. Recombinant bacmid DNA was isolated from minipreps and used to transfect a monolayer of Sf-9 insect cells (38Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J.

Recombinant viruses were isolated, amplified, titrated, and used to infect larger Sf-9 cell cultures grown in suspension at 27 °C. Sf-9 cells were pelleted and resuspended in a lysis buffer.

Open table in a new tab Construction of plasmids expressing WT pro-apoA-I and pro-apoA-I[Δ(198–243)] has been described previously (44Gorshkova I.N. Liadaki K. Gursky O. Atkinson D. Zannis V.I.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13670-13680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The pro-apoA-I[Δ(209–243)] deletion mutant was constructed in a similar manner. Briefly, the fourth exon of the human apoA-Igene was amplified and mutagenized by PCR, using a set of specific mutagenic primers (209S and 209A) containing the mutation of interest (a stop codon at nucleotide 209) and a set of flanking universal primers (AINotI and AIXhoI) containing the restriction sites NotI and XhoI. The sequences of the primers are shown in Table I. The pUCA-IN* vector, which contains a NotI site in intron 3 and a XhoI site in the 3′-end of the apoA-I gene, was used as a template in the amplification reactions (43Laccotripe M. Makrides S.C. Jonas A. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17511-17522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment containing the mutation of interest was digested with NotI and SalI and cloned into the NotI andXhoI sites of the pBMT3X-AI vector. Permanent cell lines in mouse mammary tumor C127 cells expressing the WT pro-apoA-I and the carboxyl-terminal truncation pro-apoA-I[Δ(198–243)] and pro-apoA-I[Δ(209–243)] were generated as described previously (43Laccotripe M. Makrides S.C. Jonas A. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17511-17522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). C127 cell clones overproducing the WT and the variant apoA-I forms were grown in roller bottles on collagen-coated lead microspheres (Verax Corp.), and the proteins were purified from the serum-free medium as described previously (43Laccotripe M. Makrides S.C. Jonas A. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17511-17522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the medium collected from the roller bottles was dialyzed against 0.01 m Tris, pH 8, and filtered. Up to 350 ml of the medium were passed through a 5-ml HiTrap Q HP column or up to 1200 ml were passed through a 25-ml Q-Sepharose high performance column at a rate of 1 ml/min. Both columns had been equilibrated with the Tris buffer. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1 m NH4HCO3 in the Tris buffer (15 volumes of elution buffer for HiTrap Q column and 5 volumes for Q-Sepharose high performance column) at the same flow rate. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing the apoA-I protein were pooled and further concentrated down to 2 ml, using a Centriplus concentrator (Amicon) with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000. The concentrated sample was applied to a gel filtration column HiPrep Sephacryl S-200 and eluted with 1 column volume (120 ml) of 0.15m NH4HCO3 buffer at a rate of 0.4 ml/min. The purity of the apoA-I preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions greater than 95% pure were recovered. The construction of recombinant adenoviruses carrying the genomic sequence for the WT pro-apoA-I and pro-apoA-I[Δ(220–243)] has been described before (45Reardon C.A. Kan H.Y. Cabana V. Blachowicz L. Lukens J.R. Wu Q. Liadaki K. Getz G.S. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13670-13680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The adenovirus expressing pro-apoA-I[Δ(232–243)] was generated in a similar way. The DNA fragments containing the mutations of interest were produced as described in the previous paragraph, using the 220S and 220A primers for the mutagenesis of pro-apoA-I[Δ(220–243)] and the 232S and 232A primers for pro-apoA-I[Δ(232–243)] (Table I). The recombinant adenoviruses expressing pro-apoA-I[Δ(1–41)] and pro-apoA-I[Δ(1–41)Δ(185–243)] were generated using cDNAs for apoA-I deletion mutants. The human apoA-I cDNA was mutagenized by PCR, using a set of primers containing the restriction sitesBamHI and SalI and using the pBluescript-AI cDNA plasmid as template. The set of specific primers used in mutagenesis and the set of primers containing the restriction sitesBamHI and SalI, designated AI(1–59)F and AI(1–59)R, are shown in Table I. Specifically, we used AI(1–41)DF and AI(1–41)DR primers for the generation of pro-apoA-I[Δ(1–41)] and AI185F and AI185R primers for generating the pro-apoA-I[Δ(185–243)] form. For the generation of pro-apoA-I[Δ(1–41)Δ(185–243)], AI(1–41)DF and AI(1–41)DR primers were used to further mutagenize the apoA-I cDNA using pBluescript-AI[Δ(185–243)] as template. Following amplification and mutagenesis, the DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and SalI and subcloned into the pCA13 vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Microbix Biosystems Inc.). Recombinant adenovirus constructs carrying this cDNA were prepared following co-transfection of E1 transformed 911 cells with the plasmid pJM17 (Microbix Biosystems Inc.) and the appropriate pCA13 plasmid (45Reardon C.A. Kan H.Y. Cabana V. Blachowicz L. Lukens J.R. Wu Q. Liadaki K. Getz G.S. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13670-13680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Human HTB13 cells (SW 1783, human astrocytoma grown to 80% confluence in Leibovitz's L-15 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) in roller bottles) were infected with adenoviruses expressing WT pro-apoA-I, pro-apoA-I[Δ(220–243)], and pro-apoA-I[Δ(232–243)] at a multiplicity of infection of 20. After 24 h of infection, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and preincubated in serum-free medium for 30 min, and fresh serum-free medium was added. After 24 h the medium was harvested, and fresh serum-free medium was added to the cells. The harvests were repeated 8–10 times. The proteins were purified from the serum-free medium by ion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration, as described above for C127 cells. The expression plasmid of human ABCA1 was a generous gift of Dr. M. W. Freeman and was constructed as described (46Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Anderson L.P. Panjeton H.A. Freeman M.W. J.

By observing the presence and degree of site-specific positive selection for change between divergent paralogs, residue positions responsible for functional changes can be identified. We applied this analysis to genes encoding Mu class glutathione transferases, which differ widely in substrate specificities. Approximately 3% of the amino acid residue positions, both near to and distant from the active site, are under statistically significant positive selection for change. Relevant human glutathione transferase (GST) M1-1 and GST M2-2 codons were mutated. A chemically conservative threonine to serine mutation in GST M2-2 elicited a 1,000-fold increase in specific activity with the GST M1-1-specific substrate trans-stilbene oxide and a 30-fold increase with the alternative epoxide substrates styrene oxide and nitrophenyl glycidol. The reverse mutation in GST M1-1 resulted in reciprocal decreases in activity. Thus, identification of hypervariable codon positions can be a powerful aid in the redesign of protein function, lessening the requirement for extensive mutagenesis or structural knowledge and sometimes suggesting mutations that would otherwise be considered functionally conservative.

Evolution by Gene Duplication. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1970Google Scholar, 2Ohta T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10676-10680Google Scholar, 3Lynch M. Conery J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1151-1155Google Scholar). Most positive selections for change have been observed in genes involved in host-pathogen interactions (4Hughes A.L. Nei M. Nature. 1988; 335: 167-170Google Scholar, 5Hughes A.L. Ota T. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1990; 7: 515-524Google Scholar), where pathogen antigenic determinants and their complementary host recognition molecules drive continuous adaptation. Thus, the concept of hypervariable codon positions is recognized as a reasonable explanation of evolutionary change in some biological systems. In other gene families, however, the role of positive selection is unclear (6Messier W. Stewart C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 151-154Google Scholar), and direct experimental support for predictions of positions driving diversification in protein evolution is weak, although positive selection for change was recently observed at amino acid positions associated with DNA binding in Pax family proteins (7Sun H. Merugu S. Gu X. Kang Y.Y. Dickinson D.P. Callaerts P. Li W.-H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1490-1500Google Scholar). The glutathione transferases (GSTs)1 are a family of multifunctional proteins that provide cellular defense against toxic electrophiles of both exogenous and endogenous origins. The enzymes catalyze the conjugation of electrophiles to the reactive thiol of GSH, converting the electrophile into a more water-soluble product, which can be metabolized into a mercapturic acid for urinary excretion (8Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Google Scholar). The GSTs are grouped into different classes primarily based on protein sequence similarities, and the genes of the GSTs are clustered on different chromosomes in a manner consistent with their evolutionary relationship (9Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. Pacifici G.M. Pelkonen O. Interindividual Variability in Human Drug Metabolism. Taylor & Francis, London2001: 460-519Google Scholar). The cytosolic GSTs are dimers (see Fig. 1), each subunit having an active site consisting of a GSH binding site (the G-site) and a hydrophobic substrate-binding site (the H-site). Whereas the structure of the G-site is well conserved among GSTs, the H-site varies widely in different classes, leading to differences in substrate selectivities. Within a class, both homodimeric and heterodimeric structures occur (10Mannervik B. Widersten M. Pacifici G.M. Fracchia G.N. Advances in Drug Metabolism in Man. European Commission, Luxembourg1995: 408-459Google Scholar). The human Mu class is one of the largest GST classes, with five genes clustered on chromosome 1p13.3 (11Xu S. Wang Y. Roe B. Pearson W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 237: 3517-3527Google Scholar, 12Patskovsky Y.V. Huang M.Q. Takayama T. Listowsky I. Pearson W.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 85-93Google Scholar). Different Mu class GSTs are expressed to varying extents in different tissues, and, despite high sequence identity (80–90%), they display major differences in their substrate selectivities. For example, GST M1-1 is expressed at the highest level in the liver and has distinctive high activity with the epoxide trans-stilbene oxide (tSO). In contrast, GST M2-2 is not detectable in the liver (13Rowe J.D. Nieves E. Listowsky I. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 481-486Google Scholar) and has negligibletSO activity (10Mannervik B. Widersten M. Pacifici G.M. Fracchia G.N. Advances in Drug Metabolism in Man. European Commission, Luxembourg1995: 408-459Google Scholar). GST M2-2 occurs at a high level in the brain and is uniquely active with aminochrome, a toxicortho-quinone derived from dopamine, and with other oxidation products of catecholamines (14Baez S. Segura-Aguilar J. Widersten M. Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 25-28Google Scholar). The evolution of the Mu class of GSTs has involved multiple gene duplications, such that orthologous relationships between Mu class GSTs from primates and rodents are difficult to infer. However, the multiplicity of homologous sequences (see Fig. 2 A) offers the possibility to identify hypervariable amino acid positions. Previous attempts to rationally redesign the substrate selectivities of GSTs have relied upon structural comparisons of homologous proteins, predicting functionally important H-site residues based on stereochemical principles (15Pettersson P.L. Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30019-30022Google Scholar, 16Nilsson L.O. Gustafsson A. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9408-9412Google Scholar). Here we use an evolutionary approach, asking whether positive selection can be observed within Mu class GST genes, by first observing the naturally occurring mutations at positions identified to be under positive selection and then directly testing whether these mutations confer altered substrate selectivity. An ungapped protein alignment of class Mu GSTs was assembled from 11 rodent, 7 primate, and 1 chicken amino acid sequence. The coding DNA sequences for each of the 19 GST genes were collected into a multiple alignment, using the protein sequence alignment as a guide. The PHYLIP utility dnaml was used to construct the phylogenetic tree from the DNA multiple alignment. 1,000 bootstraps on the tree. Codon-aware resamplings were used to generate 1,000 bootstrapped trees via the fastDNAml variant of dnaml. The DNA multiple alignment and the phylogenetic tree were used as input to the codonml program of the PAML version 3.1 package (17Yang Z. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 555-556Google Scholar), with CodonFreq = 3 (all 61 codon frequencies estimated) and site-specific rate variation models PAML M3 (two freely estimated categories of ω, the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratio) versus PAML M3 (three categories of freely estimated ω), PAML M1 (two categories of ω = [0 or 1]) versus PAML M2 (three categories of ω = [0, 1, and one freely estimated ω category]), and PAML M7 (continuous distribution of ω values, defined by a Beta distribution, 0 < ω < 1) versus PAML M8 (Beta distributed ω, plus one freely estimated ω category) (18Yang Z. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 423-432Google Scholar). All of the GST M2-2 mutants were constructed by inverted polymerase chain reaction usingPfu DNA polymerase and custom synthesized oligonucleotides primers (Interactiva Virtual Laboratory). The GST M1-1/S210T variant was constructed as previously described (19Hansson L.O. Bolton-Grob R. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2742-2750Google Scholar). GST M2-2/T210S was made using the GST M2-2 clone (20Johansson A.-S. Bolton-Grob R. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 105-112Google Scholar) as template. The GST M2-2/T210S/A130E and GST M2-2/T210S/A130E/F104T variants were then constructed sequentially. The PCRs contained 10 ng of DNA template, 0.25 mm dNTPs, 1.5 μm concentration of each primer, 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 50 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. The PCR was conducted using the following temperature cycle: 1) 95 °C for 5 min, 2) 95 °C for 1 min, 3) 55 °C for 1 min, 4) 72 °C for 9 min, and 5) 72 °C for 30 min. Steps 2–4 were repeated 25 times. The PCR product was purified on agarose gel and blunt end-ligated. Escherichia coli XL1 Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were transformed with the ligation mixture by electroporation. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. E. coli XL1 Blue carrying the expression vector pKK-D with wild-type GST DNA (M1-1, M2-2) or mutant GST DNA (GST M2-2/T210S, GST M2-2/T210S/A130E, GST M2-2/T210S/A130E/F104T, or GST M1-1/S210T) was grown in 2TY (1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) NaCl) at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted 250-fold in 2TY and were allowed to grow at 37 °C to A 600 ≈ 0.3. Protein expression was induced via the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the cells were grown overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by ultrasonication. GST M2-2, GST M1-1, and the mutant GST proteins, respectively, were purified from lysates by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose affinity gel (Amersham Biosciences) (21Simons P.C. Vander Jagt D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 235-237Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme samples was confirmed using SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm, using, for GST M2-2 and the mutant GST M2-2 proteins, an extinction coefficient of 81,680 m−1 cm−1 and a molecular mass of 51 kDa and, for GST M1-1 and the M1-1 mutant, an extinction coefficient of 78,000 m−1 cm−1and a molecular mass of 51 kDa. Six alternative electrophiles were used to monitor the effect of the substitutions in GST M1-1 and GST M2-2 (see Fig. 3). Specific GST activities with tSO were determined spectrophotometrically at 235 nm (Δε235 = −20,300 m−1 cm−1) in 250 mm Tris-HCl containing 5% EtOH (v/v) (pH 7.2), using 4 mm GSH and 150 μm tSO. The specific activities with SO were measured in the same buffer at 234 nm (Δε235 = 760 m−1cm−1) using 5 mm GSH and 1.6 mmSO. Specific activities with CDNB, cyanoDMNG, NPG (10Mannervik B. Widersten M. Pacifici G.M. Fracchia G.N. Advances in Drug Metabolism in Man. European Commission, Luxembourg1995: 408-459Google Scholar), and aminochrome (22Dagnino-Subiabre A. Cassels B.K. Baez S. Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. Segura-Aguilar J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 32-36Google Scholar) were determined by spectrophotometric assays at 30 °C under standard conditions. Kinetic constants were determined using steady-state kinetic analysis at a saturating concentration of glutathione (5 mm); tSO was used in the concentration range 7.5–150 μm, and CDNB was used in a concentration range of 0.05–1.5 mm. All kinetic data were obtained at 30 °C. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data points using Prism 2.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The values ofk cat were expressed per subunit (25,600 Da). To test for the presence of positively selected residues among the Mu class GST, both maximum likelihood-based (17Yang Z. Comput. Appl.

Yang Z. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 1585-1592Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2 B and TableI) and Bayesian (25Huelsenbeck J.P. Ronquist F. Nielsen R. Bollback J.P. Science. 2001; 294: 2310-2314Google Scholar) (data not shown) analyses of mutational rate variability among codons were applied. Both types of analysis suggested that about 3% of the codon positions exhibit a higher rate of nonsynonymous mutation than synonymous mutation, consistent with positive selection for change. Under different models of positive selection (18Yang Z. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 423-432Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”), residues 130, 210, and 214 (numbered with respect to Mu class glutathione transferase 1, denoting the initiator methionine as number 1) were consistently identified as likely to be under positive selection (see Fig. 2 and Table I), whereas residues 104, 205, and 206 were less strongly indicated. Comparison of human GST subunits M2 and M3 shows that their primary structures differ in all of these six hypervariable positions (Figs. 1 and2). Between GST M1-1 and GST M2-2, residues 205, 206, and 214 are identical and can consequently not be responsible for the distinct substrate selectivities of the two enzymes.Table IMaximum log likelihood scores, parameter estimates, and likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistics of models for positive selection within GST genesEvolutionary modelParameter estimatesaFree parameters estimated by maximum likelihood are in boldface type; fixed or derived parameters within each model are shown for reference. ω is the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation rates; f is the proportion of sites assigned to each class of ω. p andq are location and scale parameters of the Beta distribution.Positively selected sitesbBayesian posterior probability (p) that a site is under positive selection (p ≥ 0.50); sites in italics have p ≥ 0.85, and those in boldface have p ≥ 0.98.Log likelihoodLRTcTwice the improvement in maximum log likelihood between the current and previous models. p(LRT)dp(LRT = χ2, df = 2).

Open table in a new tab Single, double, and triple mutations were made to human GST M2-2 at positions 210, 130, and 104 (T210S, A130E, F104T), sequentially replacing the original GST M2-2 residues with the corresponding human GST M1-1 residues. The effect of the reverse mutation of GST M1-1 at residue 210 (S210T) was also studied. The recombinant enzymes were successfully purified fromE. coli XL1 Blue. A single band on SDS-PAGE confirmed the purity of the samples. The GST M2-2 wild-type and M2-2 mutants were obtained in yields ranging between 40 and 90 mg/liter. The yield of GST M1-1 protein was 11 mg/liter, and the yield of the mutant GST M1-1 S209T was 1.6 mg/liter. All enzymes could be stored on ice for several months without loss of activity. The specific activities of the purified enzymes were determined with six alternative substrates (Fig.3). Two of these compounds, aminochrome and cyanoDMNG, are distinctive GST M2-2 substrates, whereas the epoxides used (tSO, SO, and NPG) are preferred GST M1-1 substrates, and CDNB is a general GST substrate (10Mannervik B. Widersten M. Pacifici G.M. Fracchia G.N. Advances in Drug Metabolism in Man. European Commission, Luxembourg1995: 408-459Google Scholar). A 1,000-fold increase in the specific activity of GST M2-2 by the mutation T210S was obtained with tSO, the epoxide substrate characteristic for GST M1-1 (Table II). The reverse mutation S210T in GST M1-1 caused a 100-fold loss in specific activity with the same substrate. The specific activities with the alternative epoxide substrates (SO oxide and NPG) increased 30-fold in the GST M2-2 mutant. In contrast, no major effects of the mutations were seen with the GST M2-2-specific substrates aminochrome and cyanoDMNG or with CDNB, which give activities of the same magnitude with both GST M1-1 and GST M2-2 (Table II). Mutation of residues 104 and 130 in GST M2-2 did not result in marked alterations of the catalytic properties of the T210S mutant.Table IISpecific activities of wild-type and mutant human Mu class GSTs with alternative electrophilic substratesElectrophileGSHSpecific activityGST M2-2 wild typeGST M2-2 T210SGST M2-2 T210S/F104TGST M2-2 T210S/F104T/A130EGST M1-1 wild typeGST M1-1 S210Tmmμmol min−1 mg−1Epoxide substratestSO (0.15 mm)4.00.00020 ± 0.000030.17 ± 0.030.19 ± 20.28 ± 13.00 ± 0.020.026 ± 0.001SO (1.6 mm)5.00.037 ± 0.0011.28 ± 0.061.24 ± 0.081.23 ± 0.042.7 ± 0.080.10 ± 0.01NPG (1.0 mm)2.00.12 ± 0.013.5 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.20.05 ± 0.006Other substratesAminochrome (0.3 mm)1.0120 ± 7108 ± 682 ± 7132 ± 80.73 ± 0.020.94 ± 0.05CyanoDMNG (1.0 mm)1.0208 ± 4116 ± 2181 ± 4135 ± 30.47 ± 0.010.36 ± 0.02CDNB (1.0 mm)1.0426 ± 5482 ± 14547 ± 12600 ± 16136 ± 6112 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined with the two alternative substrates CDNB and tSO at a saturating concentration of GSH (5 mm). Due to the low solubility of tSO, onlyk cat/K m values could be determined accurately (Table III). The catalytic efficiencies of the mutant enzymes with CDNB were in the same range as those of the wild-type GSTs. Wild-type GST M1-1 has a uniquely high catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m value) withtSO; wild-type GST M2-2 has ∼3,000-fold lower efficiency. The catalytic efficiencies of the GST M2-2 mutants had increased more than 200-fold to 8–13% of the value characterizing GST M1-1 withtSO as the electrophilic substrate.Table IIICatalytic efficiencies (kcat /Km) of wild-type and mutant human Mu class GSTs with CDNB and tSOEnzymek cat/Km of CDNBaSteady-state kinetics were studied with CDNB at pH 6.5 and 30 °C using 5.0 mm GSH, and concentrations of CDNB varied between 50 μm and 1.5 mm.k cat/K mof tSObSteady-state kinetics were studied with tSO at pH 7.2 and 30 °C using 5.0 mmGSH, and concentrations of tSO varied between 7.5 and 150 μm.mm−1 s−1GST M2-2/wild type860 ± 1200.0044 ± 0.0006GST M2-2/T210S580 ± 1000.9 ± 0.1GST M2-2/T210S/F104T710 ± 901.3 ± 0.1GST M2-2/T210S/F104T/A130E1,490 ± 2101.5 ± 0.2GST M1-1/wild type240 ± 3012 ± 2a Steady-state kinetics were studied with CDNB at pH 6.5 and 30 °C using 5.0 mm GSH, and concentrations of CDNB varied between 50 μm and 1.5 mm.b Steady-state kinetics were studied with tSO at pH 7.2 and 30 °C using 5.0 mmGSH, and concentrations of tSO varied between 7.5 and 150 μm. Open table in a new tab In this investigation, nonsynonymous/synonymous evolutionary rate analysis was used to identify positions within Mu class GSTs likely to be under positive selection for change. Six residues (104, 130, 205, 206, 210, and 214; numbered with respect to Mu class glutathione transferase M1-1) were identified as hypervariable, three of which (205, 206, and 214) are identical between GST M1-1 and GST M2-2. These results complement those of a recent study of Pax gene family members, where two of three hypervariable positions were found to drive changes of differences in site-specific DNA binding (7Sun H. Merugu S. Gu X. Kang Y.Y. Dickinson D.P. Callaerts P. Li W.-H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1490-1500Google Scholar). The three hypervariable residues distinguishing GST M1-1 and GST M2-2 were mutated in order to evaluate their significance for the differential substrate selectivities of the two enzymes. Of the three positions targeted for mutation in GST M2-2, only residue 210 markedly influenced the measured catalytic activity (Table II). This is also the one of the variable residues that appears to be capable of contacting the substrate in the H-site, based on crystal structures (26Raghunathan S. Chandross R.J. Kretsinger R.H. Allison T.J. Penington C.J. Rule G.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 815-832Google Scholar). The observed difference between GST M1-1 and GST M2-2 at residue 210 is a serine/threonine interconversion (Fig. 2), which normally would be considered a conservative, function-conserving exchange. The T210S mutation in GST M2-2 elicited a 1,000-fold increase in specific activity with tSO and a parallel, somewhat smaller, increase with the alternative epoxides substrates SO and NPG. The CDNB activity, which is high for both GST M2-2 and GST M1-1, was also largely unchanged. In contrast, mutation of residue 210 did not markedly alter the activity of GST M1-1 or GST M2-2 with aminochrome, an ortho-quinone substrate distinguishing GST M2-2 from other GSTs (19Hansson L.O. Bolton-Grob R. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2742-2750Google Scholar), or with cyanoDMNG, another GST M2-2-specific substrate (Table II). The six alternative electrophilic substrates monitor the effect of the mutations on four different types of reaction: Michael addition to aminochrome, denitrosation of cyanoDMNG, aromatic substitution of CDNB, and conjugation of the three epoxide substrates (Fig. 3). The functional consequences of the mutations are highly selective and depend on the chemical mechanisms of the catalyzed reaction. Apparently, the different reaction chemistries require different structural complements in the active site. The structure of the homologous rat GST M1-1 (27Ji X. Johnson W.W. Sesay M.A. Dickert L. Prasad S.M. Ammon H.L. Armstrong R.N. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1043-1052Google Scholar) has revealed a role of Tyr116 in the protonation of the oxygen of epoxide substrates and an auxiliary function of Ser210, which forms a hydrogen bond to the phenolic oxygen of Tyr116 (Fig.4 B). Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations suggest that Ser210 may also interact directly with the oxirane oxygen of the substrate (28Ridder L. Rietjens I.M. Vervoort J. Mulholland A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9926-9936Google Scholar). The primary hydrogen bond donor Tyr116, as well as another active site tyrosine residue (Tyr7), is conserved in the Mu class GSTs. A structure of human GST M2-2 in complex with an appropriate active site ligand is not available. However, it is likely that the side chain methyl group of Thr210 interferes with the formation of a hydrogen bond from Thr210 that would facilitate protonation of the oxirane ring of epoxide substrates, thus explaining the effects of the T210S exchange. In addition, the simulations indicate that the number of hydrogen bonds from active site water molecules decreases to the glutathione thiolate and increases to the oxirane oxygen along the reaction coordinate (28Ridder L. Rietjens I.M. Vervoort J. Mulholland A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9926-9936Google Scholar). This dynamic process contributes to catalysis by desolvation of the nucleophilic sulfur and stabilization of the nascent oxyanion. The proximity of the Thr210 methyl substituent in GST M2-2 may sterically hinder rate-contributing interactions of water molecules with the reactants that are possible with Ser210. In enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the specificity constantk cat/K m reflects catalytic efficiency. Further, the ratio of specificity constants for alternative substrates is a measure of the substrate selectivity of the enzyme (29Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. Freeman, New York1999: 377-400Google Scholar). The value of k cat/K mfor the substrate tSO increases by almost 3 orders of magnitude by the mutations in GST M2-2 (Table III), and the discrimination against alternative substrates increases by a similar factor (cf. Table II). Thus, the substrate selectivity is drastically altered in parallel with the increased catalytic efficiency with epoxide substrates. The enhanced catalytic efficiency is clearly not a general increase of catalytic activity in the mutated GST M2-2 but a reflection of preferential transition state stabilization of reactions between epoxides and the nucleophilic sulfur of glutathione. The T210S mutation in GST M2-2 affords a decrease in the transition state energy (ΔΔG‡) of ∼14.7 kJ/mol for thetSO reaction. There are several approaches to the redesign of protein function: rational protein redesign, stochastic methods, and combinations of these methods. In rational design, the residues targeted for mutagenesis are selected on the basis of detailed knowledge of protein structure, function, and mechanism (15Pettersson P.L. Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30019-30022Google Scholar, 16Nilsson L.O. Gustafsson A. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9408-9412Google Scholar, 30Cedrone F. Menez A. Quemeneur E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 405-410Google Scholar). Thus, rational design requires an understanding of the function of residues in the active site, information that partly can be obtained from crystal or solution structures. The stochastic approach uses random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling, followed by screening or selection (31Stemmer W.P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Google Scholar, 32Evolutionary Protein Design.in: Arnold F.H. Adv. Protein Chem.55. Academic Press, New York2001Google Scholar). In the present study, evolutionary rate analysis served as the basis for redesigning the substrate selectivity of human Mu class GSTs. The remarkable change in activity with epoxide substrates caused by the interchange of serine and threonine in position 210 provides experimental support for the notion that hypervariable codons can drive divergent protein evolution. Furthermore, this is the first example of protein redesign based on mutations of hypervariable codons. This approach is not dependent on any structural information about the active site or other functional regions. However, it requires knowledge of DNA sequences for a number of closely related proteins, and it relies on a phylogenetic relationship among the analyzed sequences. The evolutionary approach to the engineered diversification of protein function will become more practical as larger numbers of closely related (diverged in the past 100 million years) genomes are sequenced and dozens of orthologous and paralogous sequences become available for additional gene families. We thank Dr. Ziheng Yang for advice on PAML and Dr. Lars O. Hansson for making the GST M1-1/S210T mutant available."

However, previous approaches have not identified the physiologic roles of individual subtypes in these processes. We used a gene knockout approach to demonstrate a unique role for the G protein γ7-subunit in mice. Notably, deletion ofGng7 caused behavioral changes that were associated with reductions in the αolf-subunit content and adenylyl cyclase activity of the striatum. These data demonstrate that an individual γ-subunit contributes to the specificity of a given signaling pathway and controls the formation or stability of a particular G protein heterotrimer.

These data demonstrate that an individual γ-subunit contributes to the specificity of a given signaling pathway and controls the formation or stability of a particular G protein heterotrimer. The heterotrimeric G proteins control diverse biological processes by conveying signals from cell-surface receptors to intracellular effectors. Although function was originally ascribed to the GTP-bound α-subunit, it is now well established that the βγ-dimer plays active roles in the signaling process through upstream recognition of receptors and downstream regulation of effectors (1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Google Scholar). Molecular cloning has identified at least 5 β- and 12 γ-subunit genes in the mouse and human genomes. Structurally, γ-subunits are the most diverse, with four subgroups that show less than 50% identity to each other (2Balcueva E.A. Wang Q. Hughes H. Kunsch C. Yu Z. Robishaw J.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 310-319Google Scholar). Moreover, γ-subunits exhibit very different temporal (3Morishita R. Shinohara H. Ueda H. Kato K. Asano T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2369-2374Google Scholar, 4Schuller U. Lamp E.C. Schilling K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 149-159Google Scholar) and spatial (5Betty M. Harnish S.W. Rhodes K.J. Cockett M.I. Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 475-486Google Scholar) patterns of expression. These characteristics suggest that γ-subunits have heterogeneous functions. However, comparison of their biochemical properties has revealed only modest differences (6Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Google Scholar, 7Lim W.K.

Pharmacol. 2002; 365: 231-241Google Scholar), perhaps because of the inherent limitations of transfection and reconstitution approaches. Gene ablation in mice has proven to be a powerful approach to identifying the functional roles of several G protein α-subunits (9Offermanns S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1635-1642Google Scholar). We report the first use of a gene targeting strategy to identify a unique function for a member of the γ-subunit family. The G protein γ7-subunit (Gγ7) was originally cloned from bovine brain (10Cali J.J. Balcueva E.A. Rybalkin I. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24023-24027Google Scholar). In situhybridization of rat brain sections revealed that mRNA for Gγ7 is most highly expressed in the striatum (5Betty M. Harnish S.W. Rhodes K.J. Cockett M.I. Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 475-486Google Scholar), where it is found in 40–50% of medium sized neurons in the caudate putamen (11Watson J.B. Coulter P.M. Margulies J.E. de Lecea L. Danielson P.E. Erlander M.G. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 108-116Google Scholar). The regional expression of mRNA for Gγ7 in the brain mirrors that of the striatum-enriched D1 dopamine receptor (D1R), 1The abbreviations used are: D1R, dopamine D1 receptor; Gγ7, G protein γ7-subunit; MANOVA, multivariate analysis of variance; RT, reverse transcriptase; CLAMS, comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system; CMV, cytomegalovirus; olf, olfactory; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid Gαolf, and adenylyl cyclase Type V (12Zhuang X.

Single cell RT-PCR analysis confirms that D1R and Gγ7 are expressed in the same subset of rat neurons (13Wang Q. Jolly J.P. Surmeier J.D. Mullah B.M. Lidow M.S. Bergson C.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol.

The animal facility is maintained as virus antibody-free and parasite-free. Animal research protocols were approved by the Geisinger Clinic institutional animal care and use committee. Southern blot analysis was performed on genomic tail DNA cut with KpnI. The probe used for this analysis was an 0.8-kb fragment 5′ of the modified Gng7 allele. Alternatively, PCR analysis was performed using primers (Invitrogen) shown in Table I. Briefly, primers flanking the 3′ loxP site (JR385 and JR387) were used competitively to amplify the wild type and Gng7 fl alleles, and a third primer upstream of the 5′ loxP site (JR413) was included to amplify simultaneously the wild type and deleted Gng7 alleles.

Membranes were then isolated by centrifugation (65 min at 100,000 × g) onto a cushion of Buffer A with 44.5% (w/v) sucrose. The membranes at the interface were transferred to a new tube, washed twice with Buffer A, and collected by centrifugation (30 min at 100,000 ×g). Protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie Plus (Pierce). Adenylyl cyclase activity (18Johnson R.A. Alvarez R. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 31-56Google Scholar) was determined by incubating membrane protein (20 μg) at 30 °C for 10 min in 0.1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and various agonists as indicated in Fig. 3. For stimulation of striatal membranes with dopamine agonists, more consistent results were obtained using buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.3, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (19Friedman E. Jin L.Q. Cai G.P. Hollon T.R. Drago J. Sibley D.R. Wang H.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 6-11Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1n HCl, 1 mm EDTA. The cAMP concentrations were determined by automated radioimmunoassay using a Gamma-Flo instrument (Atto Instruments, Inc., Potomac, MD) as described previously (20Krupinski J. Lehman T.C. Frankenfield C.D. Zwaagstra J.C. Watson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24858-24862Google Scholar). A functional observational battery was used to assess the behavior of mice outside of their home cages. On 5 successive days, mice were placed in the center of a translucent polypropylene box (45 × 30 × 60 cm). The behavior of each mouse was observed for 2 min by a researcher who was unaware of the genotypes of the mice. The latency to first step in seconds was recorded. The number of times the mouse reared was counted. The fraction of the box floor explored by the mouse was estimated. The startle response of the mouse to the sound of a latex glove being snapped was graded. After the mouse was removed from the box, the fecal boli and urine pools left in the box were counted, and the box was wiped clean with a contact disinfectant. Locomotor activities were quantified in CLAMS cages (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The cages were clear plastic boxes (20 × 10 × 12.5 cm) fitted with three rows of eight photoelectric sensors (x, y and z directions). The mice were placed in the CLAMS cages at 11 a.m. and remained in the cages for 3 h. During this time the mice had ad libitum access to water. Every minute the number of total and consecutive photobeam breaks for each of the three sensor arrays and the number of contacts with the sipper tube were recorded. Acoustic startle was measured using an SR-Lab startle reflex system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). A speaker delivered a continuous background noise of 65 db. During each trial a 40-ms pulse of broadband noise at 110 db was delivered. In prepulse trials, 20 ms of broadband noise at 70, 80, or 90 db was administered at 100 ms before the pulse. Each mouse received six consecutive pulse trials followed by six of each prepulse, pulse, or no stimulation trial, in random order. The interval between trials varied from 12 to 30 s. Data were collected at 1-ms intervals starting 50 ms before the first stimulus. The startle magnitude was calculated by summing the voltage from the startle chamber (minus the base-line voltage) over the 100 ms after the onset of the pulse. A single chamber was used for all mice. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by t test, chi square, or repeated measures MANOVA using JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). To investigate the physiologic function of Gγ7, we targeted Gng7, the murine gene encoding Gγ7, using a Cre/Loxstrategy to provide the potential for conditional inactivation of the gene in future studies (Fig. 1 A). The complete coding region of Gng7 was contained within an ∼10-kb mouse genomic clone (21Wattler S. Kelly M. Nehls M. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 1150-1160Google Scholar). This included the two coding exons split by an ∼1.1-kb intron. A targeting vector was designed to flank the coding region of Gng7 with loxPsites. Targeted embryonic stem cells, chimeric mice, and F1heterozygotes with the floxed Gng7 allele (Gng7 fl/+) were produced at Lexicon Genetics, Inc., The Woodlands, TX. Gng7 fl/+ mice were mated with mice carrying the Cre recombinase driven by the CMV promoter, BALB/c-TgN(CMV-Cre)#Cgn (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine). This resulted in deletion of the coding region of Gng7 following Crerecombinase-mediated excision (Fig. 1 B). Heterozygous mice with the deleted Gng7 allele (Gng7 +/−) were back-crossed with C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) for up to five generations, to eliminate the CMV-Cre transgene and to obtain a more homogeneous genetic background, and then were intercrossed to obtain the mice used in the following experiments (Fig. 1 C). To confirm the effectiveness of the gene knockout, expression of Gng7 was examined in brain, where the gene is most highly expressed (10Cali J.J. Balcueva E.A. Rybalkin I. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24023-24027Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the Gγ7 mRNA was absent in brains from Gng7−/− mice (Fig. 1 D). Likewise, immunoblot analysis with Gγ7 antisera (17Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15758-15761Google Scholar) showed that the Gγ7 protein was reduced by 50 ± 6% in cholate-solubilized membrane extracts of brains fromGng7 +/− mice and was not detectable in brains from Gng7 −/− mice (Fig. 1 E). Genotype analysis of offspring of heterozygous (Gng7 +/−) intercrosses revealed the expected numbers of wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice, indicating that disruption of Gng7 did not affect survival to weaning. There were no significant differences in the weights ofGng7−/− mice and their wild type littermates. Moreover, no increased mortality was seen inGng7−/− mice over a 6-month median observation time. Finally, in two homozygous crosses,Gng7−/− mice were fertile and weaned litters of apparently normal size. These observations are in stark contrast to mice with a deficiency of other components of the D1R signal transduction pathway. Mice with a homozygous deletion ofGnas, the gene encoding Gαs, die in utero before implantation (22Yu S. Yu D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Google Scholar). Most mice with a homozygous deletion of Gnal (23Belluscio L. Gold G.H. Nemes A. Axel R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 69-81Google Scholar), the gene encoding Gαolf, fail to thrive and die in the neonatal period. Moreover, although Gnal −/− mice are fertile, dams lack fostering skills and none of their litters survive. Similar failure to thrive is observed in mice with a homozygous deletion ofDrd1a (24Drago J. Gerfen C.R. Lachowicz J.E. Steiner H. Hollon T.R. Love P.E. Ooi G.T. Grinberg A. Lee E.J. Huang S.P. Bartlett P.F. Jose P.A. Sibley D.R. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12564-12568Google Scholar, 25Xu M. Moratalla R. Gold L.H. Hiroi N. Koob G.F. Graybiel A.M. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 79: 729-742Google Scholar), the gene encoding the D1R. These feeding and fostering deficits may be related to loss of the sense of smell inGnal −/− mice (23Belluscio L. Gold G.H. Nemes A. Axel R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 69-81Google Scholar) and impaired motivated behavior in Drd1a −/− mice (26Smith D.R. Striplin C.D. Geller A.M. Mailman R.B. Drago J. Lawler C.P. Gallagher M. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 135-146Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, Gng7−/− mice display a more circumscribed phenotype than mice with a deficiency of Gnas,Gnal, or Drd1a; and offer a more robust animal model for behavioral studies. Behavior reflects the underlying function of the brain, making it a sensitive indicator of alterations induced by genetic manipulation (27Tarantino L.M. Bucan M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 953-965Google Scholar). Anecdotal reports of increased handling reactivity from the animal care technicians provided the first evidence for a behavioral phenotype. More systematic screens of their behavior were carried out using a functional observational battery (28Moser V.C. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 1990; 12: 483-488Google Scholar). For this purpose, mice were observed outside of their home cages; measurements of neuromuscular function (gait abnormalities), sensorimotor defects (auditory startle), autonomic responses (fecal boli and urine pools), and activity levels (latency to first step, rears, and exploration) were scored on predefined rating scales by a trained observer who was unaware of the genotypes of the animals. Using this test battery, the most striking observation was that the Gng7 −/−mice exhibited an increased startle response as compared with their wild type littermates. To quantify this effect, a Startle Reflex System (San Diego Instruments) was used to measure the startle reactivity ofGng7 −/− mice and their wild type littermates. Notably, the Gng7 −/− mice displayed a greater startle amplitude than their wild type littermates for each stimulus tested (Fig. 2 A). Prepulse inhibition refers to the reduction in startle response that occurs when the startling stimulus is preceded by a stimulus of lower intensity and is often used as a measure of sensorimotor gating. Despite the enhanced startle response, the Gng7 −/− mice showed a similar degree of prepulse inhibition compared with their wild type littermates for each stimulus tested (Fig. 2 A,inset). The finding of increased startle response but normal prepulse inhibition of the startle response is a phenotype that has been observed previously in mice with mutations in the glycine binding site of the N1-subunit of the NMDA receptor,Grin1 D481N/D481N (29Kew J.N. Koester A. Moreau J.L. Jenck F. Ouagazzal A.M. Mutel V. Richards J.G. Trube G. Fischer G. Montkowski A. Hundt W. Reinscheid R.K. Pauly-Evers M. Kemp J.A. Bluethmann H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4037-4049Google Scholar) andGrin1 D481N/K483Q (30Ballard T.M. Pauly-Evers M. Higgins G.A. Ouagazzal A.M. Mutel V. Borroni E. Kemp J.A. Bluethmann H. Kew J.N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6713-6723Google Scholar). This is intriguing because earlier studies had shown that dopamine acting through cAMP to stimulate protein kinase A, and through DARPP-32 (32-kDa dopamine- and cAMP-responsive phosphoprotein) to inhibit protein phosphatase 1, increases the phosphorylation state of the N1-subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor and potentiates NMDA responses (31Snyder G.L. Fienberg A.A. Huganir R.L. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10297-10303Google Scholar). This suggests that Gγ7may be involved in the signal transduction pathway that regulates the response of striatal γ-aminobutyric acid-producing (GABAergic) neurons to glutamate, a pathway that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (32Mohn A.R. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Koller B.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 427-436Google Scholar). Alternate mechanisms by which a deficiency of Gγ7 may increase the startle response are suggested by other mouse models. Mice with a deficiency of adrenergic α2c-receptors demonstrate an increased startle response; however, these mice have diminished prepulse inhibition (33Sallinen J. Haapalinna A. Viitamaa T. Kobilka B.K. Scheinin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3035-3042Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing a dominant mutant of the human inhibitory glycine receptor α1-subunit, TgN(GLRA1R271Q), as well as mice with the recessive mutation spasmodic(Glra spd/spd), display a complex neuromuscular phenotype that includes increased startle response and mimics the human disease of hyperekplexia (34Becker L. von Wegerer J. Schenkel J. Zeilhofer H.U. Swandulla D. Weiher H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2505-2512Google Scholar). The abundant expression of Gng7 in the striatum suggests a possible role in control of locomotor activity. As a quantitative test of this activity, Gng7−/− mice and their wild type littermates were placed in CLAMS cages (Columbus Instruments), which are equipped with photobeams to measure movement in thex, y, and z directions. Both wild type and Gng7−/− mice exhibited elevated horizontal and vertical locomotor activity when introduced into this new environment. Gng7 −/− mice showed less horizontal (Fig. 2 B) and vertical activity (not shown) than their wild type littermates at all time points, but these differences were not statistically significant. Habituation refers to the tendency for the increased locomotor activity to decline upon repeated or sustained exposure to a new environment, which is often used as a measure of a learned response. Importantly, both groups of mice displayed comparable levels of habituation between and within sessions. On the basis of pharmacologic studies showing D1 dopamine agonists produce a strong stimulatory effect on locomotor activity (35Cabib S. Castellano C. Cestari V. Filibeck U. Puglisi-Allegra S. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1991; 105: 335-339Google Scholar), one might have expected a more marked decrease in locomotor activity in Gng7 −/− mice. In this regard, however, other gene knockout studies have not provided strong support for the pharmacologic studies. For example,Drd1a −/− mice have been variously reported as being either hypoactive (24Drago J. Gerfen C.R. Lachowicz J.E. Steiner H. Hollon T.R. Love P.E. Ooi G.T. Grinberg A. Lee E.J. Huang S.P. Bartlett P.F. Jose P.A. Sibley D.R. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12564-12568Google Scholar, 26Smith D.R. Striplin C.D. Geller A.M. Mailman R.B. Drago J. Lawler C.P. Gallagher M. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 135-146Google Scholar), hyperactive (25Xu M. Moratalla R. Gold L.H. Hiroi N. Koob G.F. Graybiel A.M. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 79: 729-742Google Scholar), or neither but showing an altered pattern of activity (36Clifford J.J. Tighe O. Croke D.T. Sibley D.R. Drago J. Waddington J.L. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1595-1602Google Scholar). Moreover,Gnal −/− mice have increased locomotor activity in an open field (12Zhuang X. Belluscio L. Hen R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC91Google Scholar), which is the opposite of the result expected based on pharmacologic studies. This variability may reflect the complex nature of locomotor activity (37Waddington J.L. Clifford J.J. McNamara F.N. Tomiyama K. Koshikawa N. Croke D.T. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 25: 925-964Google Scholar), the confounding effects of olfactory deficits in Gnal −/− mice (23Belluscio L. Gold G.H. Nemes A. Axel R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 69-81Google Scholar), or unidentified compensatory changes that may occur in knockout mice (38Sibley D.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 313-341Google Scholar). Further study will be needed to clarify this issue, including more a restricted disruption of Gng7 within specific regions of the brain that is made possible by our floxed mouse model. Finally, the expression of Gng7 along withDrd1a in a subset of neurons within the striatum suggests a possible role in regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity (13Wang Q. Jolly J.P. Surmeier J.D. Mullah B.M. Lidow M.S. Bergson C.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39386-39393Google Scholar). To evaluate this possibility, adenylyl cyclase activity was compared between those regions of the brain that normally expressGng7, such as striatum, and other regions that do not normally express Gng7, such as cerebellum (Fig.3 A). Intriguingly, dopamine and the D1-specific agonist 6-chloro-PB had stimulatory effects on adenylyl cyclase activity in the striatum from wild type mice, but the responses were virtually abolished in the striatum from Gng7 −/− mice (Fig.3 B). By contrast, dopamine had no effect on adenylyl cyclase activity in the cerebellum, but the response to isoproterenol was comparable in both wild type and Gng7 −/− mice (Fig. 3 C). These results establish a functional link between the expression of Gγ7 and adenylyl cyclase activity. Forskolin is a potent activator of adenylyl cyclase activity. Remarkably, forskolin had a potent stimulatory effect on adenylyl cyclase activity in the striatum from wild type mice, but the response was reduced by 50% in the striatum fromGng7 −/− mice (Fig. 3 D). By contrast, response to forskolin was comparable in the cerebellum from both groups of mice (Fig. 3 E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Gγ7 has an important but regionalized role in the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in the brain. Because the striatal adenylyl cyclase Type V isoform (39Glatt C.E. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 536-538Google Scholar) is synergistically activated by a combination of forskolin and Gαs (40Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Google Scholar), one mechanism that could account for defects in both receptor-mediated and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity is a reduced level of the stimulatory G protein α-subunit in the striatum of Gng7 −/− mice. To test this possibility, the levels of Gαs and Gαolf, the two known activators of adenylyl cyclase activity, were determined. Notably, the levels of Gαs were comparable in the striatum from both groups of mice level, but the amount of Gαolf was reduced by 82 ± 3% in the striatum (n = 8) from Gng7 −/− mice (Fig. 4 A). To provide additional evidence for a specific reduction in Gαolf, we examined the levels of representative members of other G protein α-subunit subunit families. Notably, the levels of Gαo, Gα13, and Gαq/11 were not significantly reduced in the striatum of Gng7 −/− mice (Fig.4 B). These results provide the first evidence that loss of a γ-subunit can result in loss of its α-subunit partner. In summary, this paper provides several novel insights. First, Gγ7 plays a unique role in regulation of adenylyl cyclase signaling in certain regions of the brain. This is demonstrated by the finding that loss of Gγ7 produces both a behavioral and a biochemical phenotype, indicating that other types of γ-subunit are not able to substitute for this function. Thus, members of the γ-subunit family are not functionally interchangeable in the context of the whole animal. Second, Gγ7 plays a role in the stabilization or formation of a G protein heterotrimer (αolfβγ7) that is required for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in the striatum. This is substantiated by the finding that loss of Gγ7 reduces the level of Gαolf in the striatum in a specific and coordinate fashion. Further studies are needed to address the underlying mechanisms and to determine whether this process is applicable to other γ-subunits. If widespread, these results will reveal an important new signaling paradigm, namely, the level of a specific γ-subunit controls the stability or assembly of a particular G protein heterotrimer. This, in turn, provides a probable basis for the selectivity of the multitude of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways that are now known to exist. Finally, the production of mice lacking Gγ7 provides a unique mouse model for the study of numerous diseases in which dysfunction of the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway in the striatum has been implicated, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia.

https://openalex.org/W2113826963,"The acetylcholine receptor (AChR)-associated protein rapsyn is essential for neuromuscular synapse formation and clustering of AChRs, but its mode of action remains unclear. We have investigated whether agrin, a key nerve-derived synaptogenic factor, influences rapsyn-AChR interactions and how this affects clustering and cytoskeletal linkage of AChRs. By precipitating AChRs and probing for associated rapsyn, we found that in denervated diaphragm rapsyn associates with synaptic as well as with extrasynaptic AChRs showing that rapsyn interacts with unclustered AChRs in vivo. Interestingly, synaptic AChRs are associated with more rapsyn suggesting that clustering of AChRs may require increased interaction with rapsyn. In similar experiments in cultured myotubes, rapsyn interacted with intracellular AChRs and with unclustered AChRs at the cell surface, although surface interactions are much more prominent. Remarkably, agrin induces recruitment of additional rapsyn to surface AChRs and clustering of AChRs independently of the secretory pathway. This agrin-induced increase in rapsyn-AChR interaction strongly correlates with clustering, because staurosporine and herbimycin blocked both the increase and clustering. Conversely, laminin and calcium induced both increased rapsyn-AChR interaction and AChR clustering. Finally, time course experiments revealed that the agrin-induced increase occurs with AChRs that become cytoskeletally linked, and that this precedes receptor clustering. Thus, we propose that neural agrin controls postsynaptic aggregation of the AChR by enhancing rapsyn interaction with surface AChRs and inducing cytoskeletal anchoring and that this is an important precursor step for AChR clustering.

At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ),1 the 43-kDa scaffolding protein rapsyn plays a pivotal role in clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). This is best illustrated by rapsyn −/− mice, which lack differentiated NMJs and fail to cluster both AChRs and cytoskeleton-interacting components such as utrophin and dystroglycan (1Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in rapsyn can lead to congenital myasthenic syndrome in humans and gradual loss of synaptic AChRs (2Ohno K. Engel A.G. Shen X.M. Selcen D. Brengman J. Harper C.M. Tsujino A.

In these cells rapsyn forms aggregates in the absence of AChRs and, upon coexpression, colocalizes with AChRs, MuSK, and β-dystroglycan in clusters (3Froehner S.C. Luetje C.W. Scotland P.B. Patrick J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Phillips W.D. Kopta C. Blount P. Gardner P.D. Steinbach J.H. Merlie J.P.

These observations have led to the concept that rapsyn recruits AChRs into cytoskeleton-bound clusters, and that rapsyn interacts with AChRs only in clusters (reviewed in Refs. 7Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar and 8Huh K.H. Fuhrer C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 25: 61-94Google Scholar).In muscle cells, however, several observations indicate that AChR aggregation is a precisely regulated process. First, AChR clustering in muscle is regulated by the motor nerve in a process that requires neural agrin (9Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F. Scheller R.H. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Agrin acts via the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK, and initiates a signaling mechanism that leads to rapsyn-dependent AChR clustering (13Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 586-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rapsyn colocalizes with these spontaneous clusters in myotubes (11Gordon H. Lupa M. Bowen D. Hall Z. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 586-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, consistent with this, can also be detected in complexes with the AChR (15Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, unlike in heterologous cells, rapsyn does not cluster in the absence of AChRs in muscle but needs some form of association with the AChR in order to form aggregates (16Ono F. Higashijima S. Shcherbatko A. Fetcho J.R. Brehm P. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5439-5448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Marangi P.A. Forsayeth J.R. Mittaud P. Erb-Vögtli S. Blake D.J. Moransard M. Sander A. Fuhrer C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7060-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thirdly, in myotubes, the relative expression levels of rapsyn and AChRs are critical parameters for clustering. Transfected myotubes that slightly overexpress rapsyn form more (although smaller) AChR clusters, whereas strong overexpression of rapsyn abolishes clustering (18Han H. Noakes P.G. Phillips W.D. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Yoshihara C.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although these studies establish the importance of the general rapsyn to AChR expression ratio, they do not address the ratio and regulation of rapsyn-AChR interaction and the possible importance of this in receptor clustering.Regulation of AChR-rapsyn interactions could involve secretory mechanisms, because in Torpedo electric organ, rapsyn and AChRs are co-transported in post-Golgi vesicles suggesting that the secretory pathway may deliver rapsyn with AChRs to the plasma membrane (20Marchand S. Bignami F. Stetzkowski-Marden F. Cartaud J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 521-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unknown, however, whether rapsyn actually interacts with these intracellular AChRs and whether the post-Golgi vesicles deliver rapsyn and AChRs directly into the postsynaptic membrane or rather into extrasynaptic membrane areas.Thus, it is currently unclear where rapsyn interacts with AChRs within developing mammalian muscle, and whether rapsyn binds only to clustered receptors or also to unclustered surface AChRs. It is further unclear how rapsyn-AChR interactions are modulated by agrin in the process of clustering and how such modulation may contribute to the formation of a cluster.We have therefore investigated the interaction of rapsyn with unclustered AChRs at the muscle surface and its regulation by agrin. We find that rapsyn associates with extrasynaptic, unclustered surface AChRs, that synaptic AChRs are associated with more rapsyn, and that these interactions are much more prominent than intracellular interactions. Interestingly, we find that agrin increases the amount of rapsyn associated with surface AChRs in myotubes in vitro. The agrin-induced increase in the rapsyn-AChR interaction requires tyrosine kinase activity, occurs independently of the secretory pathway, parallels the rapid cytoskeletal linkage of AChRs, and correlates highly with the subsequent clustering of the AChR. Thus, our data suggest that the enhanced interaction of rapsyn with surface AChRs is a crucial precursor step in the clustering process triggered by agrin.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have investigated how rapsyn-AChR interactions relate to clustering. We show that, in vivo, extrasynaptic (unclustered) AChRs are associated with rapsyn and that synaptic AChRs are associated with more rapsyn. We therefore investigated how rapsyn-AChR interactions are regulated in myotube cultures, and find that neural agrin rapidly induces an increase in the interaction of rapsyn with surface AChRs. This increase requires tyrosine kinase activity, parallels enhanced cytoskeletal linkage of the AChR, correlates strongly with subsequent receptor clustering, and (along with clustering) occurs independently of the secretory pathway. These observations suggest that agrin-induced increases in rapsyn-AChR interactions trigger cytoskeletal anchoring and clustering of AChRs.Rapsyn and the AChR Form Pre-assembled ComplexesA long-standing question in synapse formation concerns the sequence of events in which postsynaptic components are assembled. At the NMJ much evidence suggests that MuSK forms a primary synaptic scaffold to which rapsyn is recruited followed by AChRs and other proteins, implying that rapsyn interacts with AChRs only in clusters at the synapse (7Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 8Huh K.H. Fuhrer C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 25: 61-94Google Scholar). However, we recently reported that, in cultured C2 myotubes that were not treated with agrin, AChRs already interact with several postsynaptic proteins including rapsyn (15Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such interactions may have originated from spontaneously clustered AChRs or from diffusely distributed receptors. We investigated this issue and show here that rapsyn interacts with unclustered AChRs at the surface of S27 myotubes, a mutant derivative of C2 that completely lacks clusters. The comparable extent of the rapsyn-receptor interaction between C2, S26, and S27 cells strongly suggests that the majority of surface AChR-rapsyn complexes in non-agrin-treated C2 are unclustered. We also find that rapsyn interacts with unclustered AChRs in diaphragm in vivo. Based upon the predominant association of rapsyn with surface AChRs in C2 and S27 myotubes, it seems likely that the extrasynaptic rapsyn-AChR complexes in diaphragm reside at the plasma membrane rather than intracellularly. Taken together, these data show for the first time that rapsyn interacts with AChRs outside of clusters in pre-assembled, diffusely distributed complexes, both in cultured myotubes and in diaphragm muscle.These unclustered, pre-assembled surface complexes appear to be important for clustering for the following reasons: Firstly, rapsyn does not aggregate in the absence of AChRs in ectopically injected myofibers in vivo (17Marangi P.A. Forsayeth J.R. Mittaud P. Erb-Vögtli S. Blake D.J. Moransard M. Sander A. Fuhrer C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7060-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Secondly, we recently estimated that in cultured C2 myotubes ∼50% of total cellular rapsyn are constitutively bound to AChRs while the residual 50% represent free rapsyn (17Marangi P.A. Forsayeth J.R. Mittaud P. Erb-Vögtli S. Blake D.J. Moransard M. Sander A. Fuhrer C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7060-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that pre-assembled rapsyn-AChR complexes are very prominent. The pool of free rapsyn, which remains after treating C2 myotubes with AChR-antibodies to down-regulate surface AChRs and surface AChR-rapsyn complexes, is unable to form aggregates in response to agrin (17Marangi P.A. Forsayeth J.R. Mittaud P. Erb-Vögtli S. Blake D.J. Moransard M. Sander A. Fuhrer C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7060-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This illustrates that rapsyn requires some kind of constitutive association with the AChR for subsequent clustering driven by agrin in C2 myotubes. Our experiments shown here demonstrate that constitutive rapsyn-AChR interactions mostly occur with unclustered AChRs at the surface. Thus, the antibody treatment by Ref. 17Marangi P.A. Forsayeth J.R. Mittaud P. Erb-Vögtli S. Blake D.J. Moransard M. Sander A. Fuhrer C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7060-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholardown-regulated mostly unclustered AChRs and unclustered AChR-rapsyn complexes. Therefore, our present results, combined with these earlier studies, indicate that rapsyn is extensively pre-assembled with unclustered surface AChRs in non-agrin-treated C2 myotubes (Fig.9, step 1), and that this pre-assembly is necessary for subsequent clustering of rapsyn and AChRs in response to agrin.We find that rapsyn also interacts with intracellular AChRs. The much lower extent of the intracellular association implies that rapsyn interacts with only a subpopulation of intracellular AChRs. In support of this idea are the co-localization of rapsyn and AChRs in post-Golgi transport vesicles, the association of some rapsyn with the Golgi in Torpedo electrocytes (20Marchand S. Bignami F. Stetzkowski-Marden F. Cartaud J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 521-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our preliminary results that rapsyn is preferentially associated with AChRs late in the secretory pathway, at the level of late Golgi or TGN. 3M. Moransard and C. Fuhrer, unpublished data. The intracellular interaction may facilitate AChR and/or rapsyn exocytosis, a hypothesis we are currently investigating.Agrin Increases the Interaction of Rapsyn with Surface AChRs, and This Correlates with AChR Clustering and AnchoringWe show that in denervated muscle fibers in vivo, in which agrin remains concentrated at NMJs (25McMahan U.J. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1990; 55: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), AChRs isolated from synaptic areas have more (∼70%) rapsyn associated than extrasynaptic AChRs. The higher amount of rapsyn bound to synaptic AChRs most likely stems from the action of motorneuron-derived agrin, as we find that neural agrin elicits the same increase in rapsyn-AChR interaction in cultured myotubes. The agrin-induced increase in interaction occurred only on surface AChR and was not blocked at 20 °C, indicating that it does not require the secretory pathway. At 20 °C, AChRs were clustered in response to agrin, albeit in less densely packed aggregates, showing that clustering per se does not depend on continuous surface delivery of rapsyn and AChRs. The functional relevance of co-transport of rapsyn and AChR through the secretory pathway (20Marchand S. Bignami F. Stetzkowski-Marden F. Cartaud J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 521-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Marchand S. Stetzkowski-Marden F. Cartaud J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 221-229PubMed Google Scholar) thus remains to be established. While it may maintain a high density of pre-assembled surface rapsyn-AChR complexes, it is as such not required for agrin-induced clustering. Rather, our present data show that the critical events for AChR clustering occur independently of secretion at the plasma membrane, where agrin regulates the extent of interaction between a free pool of rapsyn (17Marangi P.A. Forsayeth J.R. Mittaud P. Erb-Vögtli S. Blake D.J. Moransard M. Sander A. Fuhrer C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7060-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and surface AChRs (Fig. 9).The agrin-induced increase in rapsyn-AChR interaction could potentially reflect de novo formation of more rapsyn-AChR complexes, higher affinity binding between rapsyn and the AChR, or more rapsyn molecules bound per individual AChR. The formation of additional 1:1 rapsyn-AChR complexes (or the stabilization of such complexes) seems possible, as the AChR and rapsyn have been shown to be present in approximately equimolar amounts in Torpedo electric organ and in cultured muscle cells (34LaRochelle W.J. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8190-8195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrastructural studies also support a 1:1 stoichiometry and a direct interaction between rapsyn and AChRs (35Mitra A.K. McCarthy M.P. Stroud R.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 755-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,36Toyoshima C. Unwin N. Nature. 1988; 336: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the precise ratio of rapsyn to AChR in clusters remains to be determined and our increased rapsyn-AChR interaction may reflect binding of more rapsyn molecules to each AChR. If this is the case, the additional rapsyn would necessarily bind at a different site on the AChR, creating a distinct form of rapsyn-AChR complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry (see Fig. 9). Interestingly, it has been shown that the expression ratio of rapsyn to AChR is critical for clustering (19Yoshihara C.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that this expression ratio is lower extrasynaptically than at the NMJ (37Tsui H.C. Cohen J.B. Fischbach G.D. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with these studies and indicate that it is an increase in the association ratio of rapsyn to AChR at the surface that is likely to trigger clustering.This notion is supported by our observation that the agrin-induced increase in rapsyn-AChR interaction correlated strongly with AChR clustering in several different experimental conditions. First, in S27 cells, agrin, even at high concentrations, failed to induce increased interaction as well as clustering. Second and third, herbimycin and staurosporine blocked both the agrin-induced increase in the rapsyn-AChR interaction and AChR clustering in C2 cells. Herbimycin inhibits agrin-induced phosphorylation of MuSK, while staurosporine blocks a kinase downstream of MuSK, possibly a member of the Src-family (21Mittaud P. Marangi P.A. Erb-Vögtli S.E. Fuhrer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that such a kinase may regulate rapsyn-AChR interactions downstream of MuSK activation. Fourth, the agrin-induced increase in rapsyn interaction occurs rapidly (within 40 min in C2), and parallels early signaling events that are important for the subsequent clustering of the AChR, such as tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR β subunit (22Borges L.S. Ferns M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This temporal correlation raises the possibility that rapsyn binding to the AChR is regulated by β subunit phosphorylation, and that they are linked precursor steps in the clustering pathway, a hypothesis we are currently investigating. Fifth, laminin-1, which is thought to act independently of MuSK in AChR clustering (27Montanaro F. Gee S.H. Jacobson C. Lindenbaum M.H. Froehner S.C. Carbonetto S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1250-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sugiyama J.E. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), also leads to increased rapsyn-AChR interaction. Sixth, extracellular Ca2+, which acts via MuSK to induce AChR β-subunit phosphorylation and receptor clustering (29Grow W.A. Ferns M. Gordon H. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), induces a similar increase in rapsyn-AChR binding. Finally, agrin-induced rapsyn-AChR interactions and clustering still occur at 20 °C, when secretion and new AChR insertion into the plasma membrane are blocked. This shows that the events critical for clustering occur at the cell surface and suggests that increased interaction of rapsyn with surface AChRs may be sufficient to drive clustering in the absence of secretion.Rapsyn has long been proposed to mediate a cytoskeletal link of the AChR. For example, extraction of rapsyn from clusters on rat myotubes or from Torpedo electrocytes increases AChR mobility in the membrane (38Rousselet A. Cartaud J. Devaux P.F. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 39Bloch R.J. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rapsyn mediates interaction of AChRs with the dystrophin/utrophin glycoprotein complex, which binds to F-actin (15Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that rapsyn is preferentially associated with AChRs that are bound to the cytoskeleton, and that the agrin-induced increase in interaction of rapsyn with AChRs correlates strongly with increased cytoskeletal linkage of the AChR. This increased cytoskeletal linkage occurs in parallel with AChR-associated signaling events (such as tyrosine phosphorylation of AChRs, of AChR-bound MuSK, and Src-type kinases (21Mittaud P. Marangi P.A. Erb-Vögtli S.E. Fuhrer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)), and precedes detectable clustering of the AChR. The emerging picture is thus that the AChR acts as a scaffold onto which anchoring proteins like rapsyn and several signaling proteins are rapidly recruited by agrin. Within the resulting AChR-protein complexes, rapsyn appears as the most abundant postsynaptic protein based on its high expression level (34LaRochelle W.J. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8190-8195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its much higher extent of binding to the AChR relative to other postsynaptic components (15Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these observations strongly imply that it is the increased rapsyn-AChR interaction that enhances the cytoskeletal anchoring of the AChR in the postsynaptic membrane, and so promotes AChR clustering.In summary, the data presented here, together with our previous studies (17Marangi P.A. Forsayeth J.R. Mittaud P. Erb-Vögtli S. Blake D.J. Moransard M. Sander A. Fuhrer C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7060-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggest a model for AChR clustering in which pre-assembled, unclustered AChR-rapsyn complexes occur at the plasma membrane and are required for subsequent clustering (Fig. 9, step 1). Neural agrin, released by the nerve terminal, then signals through MuSK and further increases the interaction of rapsyn and the AChR in the postsynaptic membrane, either by increasing the number of AChR-rapsyn complexes or by increasing the amount of rapsyn interacting with an individual AChR. This occurs through a kinase-dependent step, independently of the secretory pathway, and by recruitment of rapsyn from a free pool. We propose that the increased rapsyn-AChR association then leads to enhanced cytoskeletal linkage, and to the progressive postsynaptic clustering of the AChR (Fig. 9, step 2).Pre-assembly of postsynaptic complexes may also play a role in formation of central synapses. At excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons, clusters of PSD-95 first appear in dendritic shafts or dynamic spine precursors before moving, through cytoskeletal rearrangement, to their final position in the mature spine head (40Marrs G.S. Green S.H. Dailey M.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). At inhibitory synapses, much like AChRs and rapsyn at the NMJ, gephyrin and γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors are mutually important for clustering, most likely by forming interdependent components of a protein complex (41Essrich C. Lorez M. Benson J.A. Fritschy J.M. Luscher B. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Our data substantiate the possibility that postsynaptic specializations of synapses are in general constructed from pre-assembled complexes of their components. Such pre-assembly may ensure that postsynaptic membranes can be formed and modified rapidly according to physiological needs. Clustering of neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic membrane is a fundamental aspect of synapses and is thought to originate from receptor interactions with scaffolding proteins that mediate binding to the cytoskeleton. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ),1 the 43-kDa scaffolding protein rapsyn plays a pivotal role in clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). This is best illustrated by rapsyn −/− mice, which lack differentiated NMJs and fail to cluster both AChRs and cytoskeleton-interacting components such as utrophin and dystroglycan (1Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in rapsyn can lead to congenital myasthenic syndrome in humans and gradual loss of synaptic AChRs (2Ohno K. Engel A.G. Shen X.M. Selcen D. Brengman J. Harper C.M. Tsujino A. Milone M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Rapsyn's mode of action remains unclear, although rapsyn is sufficient to drive clustering of AChRs upon expression in heterologous cells. In these cells rapsyn forms aggregates in the absence of AChRs and, upon coexpression, colocalizes with AChRs, MuSK, and β-dystroglycan in clusters (3Froehner S.C. Luetje C.W. Scotland P.B. Patrick J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Phillips W.D. Kopta C. Blount P. Gardner P.D. Steinbach J.H. Merlie J.P.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the concept that rapsyn recruits AChRs into cytoskeleton-bound clusters, and that rapsyn interacts with AChRs only in clusters (reviewed in Refs. 7Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar and 8Huh K.H. Fuhrer C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 25: 61-94Google Scholar). In muscle cells, however, several observations indicate that AChR aggregation is a precisely regulated process. First, AChR clustering in muscle is regulated by the motor nerve in a process that requires neural agrin (9Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F. Scheller R.H. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Agrin acts via the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK, and initiates a signaling mechanism that leads to rapsyn-dependent AChR clustering (13Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J.

Under normoxia, VHL recognizes HIF-1α as a substrate due to the enzymatic modification of HIF-1α by prolyl hydroxylases, whose function is inhibited during hypoxia (7Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M.

Hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α is accompanied by its nuclear translocation, heterodimerization with HIF-1β, and transcription of genes encoding proteins that function to increase O2delivery, allow metabolic adaptation, and promote cell survival (9Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). HIF-transactivated genes such as iNOS, IGF, and VEGF play an important role in tumor metastasis and invasion (10Feng C. Wang L. Jiao L. Liu B. Zheng S. Xie X.

One of the major components of the cytoskeleton is the microtubule network. Because of the dynamic instability of tubulin dimers, microtubules are subject to constant remodeling (13Cassimeris L.U. Walker R.A. Pryer N.K. Salmon E.D. Bioessays. 1987; 7: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). MDAs are potent anti-tumor agents that associate with microtubules and disrupt the microtubular system, thereby blocking cell division (14Correia J.J. Lobert S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 1213-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 52: 35-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 16Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The action of MDAs is thought to loosely mimic a wide range of cellular responses involving cytoskeletal rearrangement, such as wound healing, tumor cell metastasis, and invasion (17Sammak P.J.

NFκB is an ubiquitous transcription factor known to be activated by a wide variety of stimuli including infection, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the aforementioned microtubule disruption (29Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3462) Google Scholar). NFκB transactivates a number of proinflammatory, apoptotic and oncogenic genes that collectively function to foster cellular adaptation to stress (29Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3462) Google Scholar, 30Sun Z. Andersson R. Shock. 2002; 18: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of activation depends on the stimulus, most stimuli initiate various intracellular signaling cascades that result in the phosphorylation of inhibitory protein κB (IκB) by IκB kinases (IKKs) (31Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). NFκB is normally associated with IκB in the cytoplasm, where it is kept in an inactive state (32Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Stimulus-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent proteolytic degradation of IκB (33Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 34Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A.

The pathways involved in the nonhypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α remain unclear but are thought to be regulated by growth factor signaling cascades such as PI 3-kinase/AKT (35Zhong H. Chiles K.

Interestingly, HIF-1α has been reported to be highly expressed in cells during physiological processes that entail massive microtubule reorganization (12Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M.

However, there are no reports demonstrating a direct relationship between changes in microtubule dynamics and HIF-1α protein regulation. Therefore, in this study, we specifically investigated this connection. We show that reagents interfering with tubulin polymerization are able to induce NFκB transcription and we further show that this activation is necessary for the subsequent increase in HIF-1α protein expression. These results demonstrate a novel aspect of HIF-1α regulation and suggest that HIF-1α may play a broader role in sensing cytoskeletal change. The MDAs vinblastine, colchicine, and nocodazole, and the microtubule stabilizing agent paclitaxel were purchased from Sigma. The colchicine deriviative γ-lumicolchicine and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and the transcriptional inhibitors actinomycin D (AcD) and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside were also purchased from Sigma. Cobalt chloride and the iron chelator phenanthroline were obtained from the same supplier. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) was from Sigma. A549 cells (human lung cancer cell line obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in F12-K (Kaighn's modification) medium (Invitrogen). Colchicine-resistant CHO (10193) and wild type CHO (10001) (a gift from Dr. M. M. Gottesman, National Institutes of Health) were grown in α-modified minimal essential medium (Sigma). Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Biofluids). Unless specified, all other cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Biofluids). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (for DMEM), Hepes, and penicillin/streptomycin. For transient transfections of NFκB super-repressor plasmid (40Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar) or HIF-1α plasmids (41Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Mimnaugh E.G. Martinez A. Cuttitta F. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29936-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), cells were plated in 6-cm dishes and transfected with NFκB super-repressor plasmid (5 ug) or HIF-1α plasmids (3 ug) in the presence of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 24 h, cells were subjected to the indicated drug treatments, lysates were harvested, and HIF-1α levels determined by Western blotting. HIF-1 protein stability was determined by treatment of cells with 200 μm CHX, followed by immunoblot and densitometric analysis. For transient transfection of reporter plasmids, cells were plated in 12-well plates and the following day cells were cotransfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing either 3× NFκB binding sites (0.4 μg, a gift from Dr. M. Birrer, NCI) or 3× hypoxia response element (0.4 μg, a gift from Dr. G. Melillo, NCI), in combination with the internal control CMV Renilla luciferase plasmid (1:100 the amount of reporter plasmid, Promega). Luciferase activities of reporter plasmids were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Transfection efficiency was evaluated using green fluorescence protein expression plasmid and determined to be 35–45% under these experimental conditions. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. Cell viability was unchanged in each experimental condition. Cells were lysed and nuclear and cytosolic extracts prepared as described (42Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were electrophoretically separated using either 4–20 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels (BioRad). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell) and imunoblottted with either monoclonal anti-HIF-1α, polyclonal anti-iNOS antibodies (1:300 and 1:500, respectively, Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:1000, Covance) or monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HIF-1α in human cell lines was detected in 20 μg of nuclear extracts and HIF-1α in non-human cell lines was detected in 30–40 μg of nuclear extracts using monoclonal HIF-1α antibody (1:750, Novus). iNOS protein was detected in 40 μg of cytosolic extracts. All blots were developed with SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) using anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were treated with MDAs for 3 h and lysed and total mRNA was extracted using Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The real-time quantification of HIF-1α mRNA was carried out using SYBR Green I dye (Applied Biosystems) with the following primer pairs: human HIF-1α forward, 5′-TCCAGTTACGTTCCTTCGATCA-3′; human HIF-1α reverse, 5′-TTTGAGGACTTGCGCTTTCA-3′. SYBR Green I, double-stranded DNA binding dye, was detected using the laser-based ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplification was performed using an optical 96-well reaction plate and caps. The final reaction mixture of 25 μl consisted of 200 nm each primer, 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) containing a reference dye, and cDNA at the following conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The cDNAs were prepared from each RNA sample using a TaqMan Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Overexpression of HIF-1α and large scale changes in microtubule organization are common events associated with embryonic development, wound healing, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We therefore sought to investigate whether a correlation existed between microtubule disruption and HIF-1α expression. To examine this question, A549 cells were treated with the MDAs vinblastine, colchicine, or nocodazole, or with the microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel, and HIF-1α protein expression was monitored. The concentrations used represent those required for maximal microtubule disruption (43Remy-Kristensen A. Duportail G. Coupin G. Kuhry J.G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, HIF-1α protein levels were similarly induced by all of the MDAs tested, while HIF-1α protein remained unchanged following treatment with paclitaxel, indicating that increased HIF-1α protein expression correlated with microtubule depolymerization, and not with stabilization. In Fig.1 B, the kinetics of vinblastine-mediated HIF-1α induction were investigated. The data indicate that the increase in HIF-1 levels is somewhat transient, with maximal induction occurring between 4–5 h and rapidly declining by 7 h. To determine whether the effect of MDAs on HIF-1α expression was a general phenomenon, we assessed the ability of MDAs to induce HIF-1α levels in a variety of cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1 C, MDAs induced HIF-1α protein in cells derived from multiple lineages, irrespective of tumorigenicity or cell adherence, thereby demonstrating that this is a general signaling pathway shared by many, if not all, cell types. We previously found that the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β induce HIF-1α protein expression via NFκB activation. 2Y.-J. Jung, J. S. Isaacs, S. Lee, J. Trepel, Z.-G. Liu, and L. Neckers, submitted manuscript. Coincidentally, MDAs are reported to activate NFκB gene transcription (24Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to determine whether the HIF-1 induction following MDA treatment was potentially mediated by an NFκB-dependent pathway. First, we tested whether MDAs were capable of inducing NFκB activation in A549 cells, as assessed with transiently transfected NFκB-responsive luciferase constructs. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the MDAs, but not paclitaxel, which promotes microtubule polymerization and stabilization, induced NFκB-responsive luciferase activity. Interestingly, MDA-induced NFκB activity correlated with the ability of these agents to induce HIF-1α protein levels (Fig. 1). We therefore explored the apparent correlation between MDA-induced NFκB activation and HIF-1α protein induction. To investigate this association, transiently transfected A549 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of either vinblastine or colchicine and NFκB activity was measured in parallel with HIF-1α protein expression. As shown in Fig. 2 B, treatment of A549 cells with these agents resulted in a maximal level of NFκB activity, followed by a decline in activity at higher concentrations. When HIF-1α protein levels were examined from identically treated cells, the MDA-dependent increase in NFκB activity mirrored the increase in HIF-1α levels and maximal HIF-1α expression correlated with maximal NFκB activity. Similarly, at higher doses, HIF-1α protein levels declined in parallel with decreasing NFκB activity. We sought to determine whether the NFκB activation induced by MDAs was responsible for mediating the increase in HIF-1α protein. First, we examined the requirement for general transcription in the MDA pathway. Cells were treated with MDAs in the presence of the transcription inhibitors AcD or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DCB) and HIF-1α levels were examined. As shown in Fig. 3 A(upper panel), HIF-1 induction by MDAs was completely inhibited by either of these agents. To confirm that the effect of transcriptional inhibitors upon HIF-1α levels was specific for the MDA-mediated pathway, these agents were added in combination with hypoxia mimetics. Cobalt chloride and phenanthroline (an iron chelator) are known to stabilize HIF-1α by preventing prolyl hydroxylases from modifying the protein, thereby rescuing HIF-1α from the destabilizing effects of VHL. As shown in Fig. 3 A (lower panel), the transcriptional inhibitors did not interfere with the ability of hypoxia mimetics to induce HIF-1α protein. This result demonstrates a requirement for cellular transcription in MDA-mediated HIF-1 induction, thus defining this pathway as distinct from the hypoxia-mediated pathway. We next examined whether the NFκB pathway was specifically implicated in the MDA-mediated induction of HIF-1α. To test this, A549 cells were transiently transfected with an NFκB super-repressor plasmid (expressing IκB mutated to resist proteasome-mediated degradation) that effectively inhibits NFκB transcription (40Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar), and these cells were subsequently subjected to treatment with MDAs. As shown in Fig.3 B (upper panel) MDA-mediated HIF-1 induction is severely impaired in the presence of NFκB repressor, thereby demonstrating a requirement for NFκB transcription in this pathway. To ensure that this result was not a nonspecific effect related to the transfections, the NFκB-inhibiting drug pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) was used to confirm these observations. As shown in Fig.3 B (lower panel), similar to the NFκB repressor effects, PDTC abrogated MDA-mediated HIF-1 induction. However, it had no effect upon the ability of hypoxia mimetics to induce HIF-1α, thereby validating the specificity of this pathway and emphasizing the crucial role of NFκB. To examine the effect of transcriptional inhibition upon MDA-stabilized HIF-1α protein, A549 cells were pretreated with vinblastine for 3 h, followed by either a 1 or 2 h treatment of actinomycin D (in the continued presence of vinblastine). As shown in Fig 3 C, transcription inhibition was able to moderately reduce, but not eliminate, already stabilized HIF-1 protein. These data demonstrate that while constitutive transcription is needed for MDA-mediated up-regulation of HIF-1α, persistence of the stabilized protein is not dependent on transcription. In addition to the NFκB pathway, it has been reported that MDAs can also activate the transcription factor AP-1 in a c-Jun-dependent manner (27Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H. Giannakakou P. Foster J.S. Fojo T. Wimalasena J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4928-4936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the potential contribution of AP-1 in the MDA-mediated HIF-1 induction using MCF-7 cells stably transfected with a dominant negative c-Jun construct (dn c-Jun) that inhibits c-Jun-dependent AP-1 activity (44Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 D, cells expressing dn c-Jun induced HIF-1α in response to MDAs to a degree comparable with wild type cells, thereby discounting an involvement of c-Jun-dependent AP-1 activity in this process. It was of interest to determine whether the HIF-1α protein induced by MDAs was transcriptionally active. To test this, A549 cells were transfected with a HIF-1 responsive reporter plasmid that contains 3 hypoxia response elements of the iNOS gene (45Melillo G. Taylor L.S. Brooks A. Musso T. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12236-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, consistent with our Western results (Fig. 1), HIF-1-dependent luciferase activity was induced by treatment with MDAs. To confirm that HIF-1 reporter activity was induced in a HIF-1-specific manner, this experiment was repeated in hepa1c1c7 cells that contain wild type Arnt, and in matched hepa1c4 cells that are unable to transactivate HIF-1-dependent genes due to a genetic defect in Arnt (46Li H. Dong L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28098-28105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,47Li H. Ko H.P. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21262-21267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). First, we determined that MDAs induce over a 2-fold induction of HIF-1α protein in hepa1c1c7 (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, this increase in HIF-1α protein correlated with over a 2-fold increase in HIF-1 reporter activity. However, in Arnt-deficient hepa1c4 cells, MDA treatment failed to increase HIF-1-dependent luciferase activity, thereby demonstrating that MDA-mediated HIF-1 activation is dependent upon and accurately represents transcriptionally active HIF-1. We reasoned that the ability of MDAs to increase the population of transcriptionally active HIF-1 would result in the up-regulation of HIF-1 target proteins. Therefore, we examined whether the MDA-dependent increase in HIF-1 reporter activity correlated with an increase in endogenous iNOS protein, which is known to be a transcriptional target of HIF-1α (45Melillo G. Taylor L.S. Brooks A. Musso T. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12236-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 C, HIF-1α levels in hepa1c1c7 cells were induced following a 5-h treatment with the MDAs vinblastine or colchicine. However, these same agents were unable to elicit any iNOS induction in the Arnt-defective hepa1c4 cells. Therefore, the ability of MDAs to induce HIF-1 reporter activity in these cell lines reflects their ability to induce endogenous iNOS protein and is consistent with up-regulation of transcriptionally active HIF-1. While the dependence for NFκB in MDA-mediated HIF-1 induction was definitive, it remained to be determined whether microtubule disruption itself was required for HIF-1 induction. To examine this issue, MDA-mediated HIF-1 induction was assessed in both wild type and colchicine-resistant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The colchicine-resistant cells contain a mutation in tubulin that alters the association of MDAs with microtubules (48Whitfield C. Abraham I. Ascherman D. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1422-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 49Cabral F. Sobel M.E. Gottesman M.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, while the wild type CHO cells exhibited a marked increase in HIF-1 protein following MDA treatment, the colchicine-resistant cells failed to respond to this treatment. To further verify that microtubule disruption is a component of the signaling pathway of MDAs, A549 cells were treated with γ-lumicolchicine, a structurally similar, but catalytically inactive analog of colchicine. As shown in Fig. 5 B, this analog failed to induce HIF-1α protein, thereby demonstrating that MDA interaction with microtubules is required for MDAs to induce HIF-1α. Our data suggested that NFκB up-regulated HIF-1α at the transcriptional level, and we therefore examined whether HIF-1α mRNA levels were induced by MDAs. As shown in Fig.6 A (upper panel) RT-PCR analysis reveals that HIF-1α mRNA levels in A549 cells remain unchanged in response to a 3-h treatment of the indicated MDAs. The lower panel shows the RT-PCR of β-actin, which was used as an internal control. This result indicates that MDAs up-regulate HIF-1α at the post-transcriptional level. One of the main regulators of HIF-1α protein under normoxia is VHL. Therefore, we examined whether VHL played a role in the MDA-mediated induction of HIF-1α. The effect of MDAs upon HIF-1α expression was examined in a matched pair of renal carcinoma lines either lacking VHL function, or with VHL replaced by stable transfection. As shown in Fig.6 B, vinblastine up-regulated HIF-1α protein in the cell line containing functional VHL protein (UMRC2/VHL). However, HIF-1α was not further up-regulated in the VHL-mutated parental line containing stable HIF-1α protein. To confirm these results, transfections were performed in the well-characterized A549 cell line. As shown in Fig. 6 C, vinblastine up-regulated the levels of transfected wild type HIF-1α expressed in A549 cells, while this agent failed to upregulate a mutated form of HIF-1α that is VHL-resistant. These results suggested that MDA treatment stabilized HIF-1α protein to the effects of VHL. To test this hypothesis, the stability of endogenous HIF-1α protein in A549 cells was determined either in the presence or absence of vinblastine. As shown in Fig.6 D, while endogenous HIF-1α was extremely labile in normoxic cells, with a half-life of less than 4 min, vinblastine treatment significantly stabilized the protein and extended its half-life by more than 5-fold to 20 min. In this report, MDAs were used to simulate cellular responses activated by microtubule change. We demonstrate that cytoskeletal alteration mediated by a variety of microtubule-depolymerizing agents elevate protein levels of transcriptionally active HIF-1α in a pathway dependent upon NFκB activation in a variety of cell lines, suggesting that this is a basic mode of signaling universally employed by most, if not all, cell types. While MDA-mediated HIF-1 induction is not as pronounced as that elicited by hypoxia, it is significant enough to result in more than a 2-fold increase in HIF-1-regulated iNOS reporter activity and in a severalfold up-regulation of endogenous iNOS protein expression. By comparison, hypoxic stimulation of this same reporter was on the order of 3–4-fold (data not shown). Our data conclusively demonstrate that transcription, likely mediated by NFκB activation, is a requirement for the ability of MDAs to induce HIF-1α. First, we show that transcription inhibitors interfere with the ability of MDAs to induce HIF-1α protein. Second, we demonstrate that MDAs induce NFκB activity, which correlates with the ability of these agents to induce HIF-1α levels. Third, and most compelling, treatment of cells with either a drug that inhibits NFκB or transfection with the NFκB super-repressor plasmid both abrogated the ability of MDAs to up-regulate HIF-1α protein. Finally, we demonstrate that the MDA signaling pathway for HIF-1 induction is distinct from the hypoxia-mediated pathway, in that NFκB inhibitors had no effect on reducing HIF-1α levels induced by a hypoxia mimetic, further emphasizing the unique transcriptional dependence of this mechanism. Several reports demonstrate that drugs capable of microtubule disruption elevate NFκB activity (24Rosette C. Karin M. J.

However, the precise mechanism of MDA-induced NFκB activation remains unclear. In one model, MDAs are proposed to stimulate IκB degradation, resulting in the nuclear accumulation and subsequent activation of NFκB (24Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 52Das K.C. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14914-14920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In accordance with this model, we observed a slight increase in nuclear NFκB upon MDA treatment (data not shown). In a second model, mechanisms potentially independent of nuclear NFκB protein levels play a role. These mechanisms include posttranslational modification of the NFκB protein, such as phosphorylation or acetylation of p65 (53Boone D.L. Lee E.G. Libby S. Gibson P.J. Chien M. Chan F. Madonia M. Burkett P.R. Ma A. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2002; 8: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although high doses of either vinblastine or colchicine resulted in decreased NFκB activity, no such corresponding decrease in nuclear protein levels was observed (data not shown), consistent with other reports (52Das K.C. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14914-14920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, although our data do not preclude the possibility that MDA-mediated nuclear translocation of NFκB is an important initial event, the down-regulation of NFκB activity without corresponding changes in nuclear p65 suggests that MDAs also initiate additional signaling events culminating in the post-translational modification of NFκB. Although a definitive signaling pathway remains elusive, it is notable that MDAs modulate the activities of a variety of kinases, such as protein kinases A and C, PI 3-kinase, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), that regulate NFκB activity by phosphorylation of the p65 subunit (18Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 54Garg A. Aggarwal B.B.

Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, MDAs at low, but not high concentrations, increase tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins such as FAK and paxillin (56Haier J. Nicolson G.L. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been demonstrated that microtubule-stabilizing agents such as paclitaxel are unable to promote activation of these same kinases (51Spencer W. Kwon H. Crepieux P. Leclerc N. Lin R. Hiscott J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 57Kadi A. Berthet V. Pichard V. Abadie B. Rognoni J.B. Marvaldi J. Luis J. Bull. Cancer. 2002; 89: 227-233PubMed Google Scholar), correlating with their inability to activate NFκB and upregulate HIF-1α. Our data demonstrate that the MDA-mediated pathway for HIF-1α induction is distinct from the hypoxia-mediated stabilization of HIF-1α. This is most clearly illustrated by data showing the dependence upon NFkB activation for the former, but not the latter pathway. However, similar to the hypoxia-mediated pathway, we find that MDAs induce HIF-1α protein at the posttranscriptional level. While we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility of increased translation of HIF-1α as an explanation of this phenomenon, in a manner similar to the effect of various growth factors (35Zhong H. Chiles K. Feldser D. Laughner E. Hanrahan C. Georgescu M.M. Simons J.W. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1541-1545PubMed Google Scholar, 58Fukuda R. Hirota K. Fan F. Jung Y.D. Ellis L.M. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38205-38211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), we suggest that MDAs act by partially protecting HIF-1α protein from VHL-dependent degradation. MDA-mediated stabilization does not render the protein completely resistant to VHL, but rather appears to engender a less efficient degradation, resulting in a 5-fold increase in half-life. Compelling evidence for this notion is provided by our finding that HIF-1α levels in a cell line lacking VHL function remained unchanged upon exposure to vinblastine. However, in a matched line with stably expressed VHL, HIF-1α accumulated in response to vinblastine, suggesting that the MDA-stabilizing effect is dependent upon VHL expression. Similarly, vinblastine elevated the level of transiently expressed wild type HIF-1α protein in A549 cells, while these agents had no effect upon a transiently expressed proline-mutated, VHL-resistant HIF-1α protein. Finally, the ability of MDAs to activate NFkB was independent of VHL status (data not shown), supporting our hypothesis that NFkB activation by MDAs occurs prior to HIF-1 accumulation. Although the complete mechanism of MDA-induced HIF-1α accumulation remains unclear, the transcriptional dependence of this pathway suggests that the mediator(s) involved may be labile. Evidence for a labile mediator is further provided by our data (Fig.3 C) demonstrating that transcriptional inhibition of MDA-stabilized HIF-1 results in a moderate decrease in protein levels within the first hour. This labile mediator(s) may modify HIF-1α, or another protein involved VHL-HIF association, so as to render HIF-1α less susceptible to VHL-mediated degradation. Tumor cell invasion and metastasis, hallmarks of the tumorigenic process, involve microtubule reorganization. We demonstrate that MDA-mediated activation of NFκB and subsequent induction of HIF-1α is initiated by and depends upon microtubule depolymerization. While the specific role NFκB may play in invasion and metastasis is unclear, several reports document overexpression and/or hyperactivity of NFκB in cancer lines (59Patel N.M. Nozaki S. Shortle N.H.

The SR-A mediated 65 and 85% of macrophage adhesion to the extracellular matrix in the presence and absence of serum, respectively. When EDTA was added to chelate divalent cations, the SR-A mediated 90 and 95% of the macrophage adhesion without and with serum, respectively.

The type I and type II class A scavenger receptors (SR-A)1 were the first to be cloned (6Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M.

These receptors are trimeric integral membrane glycoproteins generated by alternative splicing of a single gene product (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev.

They both bind a wide variety of molecules, including certain chemically modified lipoproteins such as oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL) and acetylated LDL (AcLDL), certain polysaccharides such as fucoidin and dextran sulfate, and polyribonucleotides such as poly I and poly G (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). In addition, the SR-A binds a limited number of native proteins. We recently showed that the α-secretase cleavage products of the three main isoforms of the amyloid precursor protein (APP695, APP751, and APP770) are ligands for the SR-A (8Santiago-Garcia J.

The SR-A also binds the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide (9Paresce D.M. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), another enzymatic cleavage product of APP and a major component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Macrophage scavenger receptors have been postulated to contribute to the internalization of modified lipoproteins, intracellular cholesterol ester accumulation, foam cell formation, and atherogenesis (10Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have suggested that the SR-A is critically involved in the deposition of cholesterol in arterial wall macrophages during the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Elimination of SR-A expression in mice significantly reduces the uptake of modified LDL by peritoneal macrophages from these animals and inhibits atherogenesis (11Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M.

Although reduced atherosclerosis inSR-A −/− mice is widely assumed to result from reduced uptake of modified lipoproteins and reduced accumulation of cholesterol esters in macrophages of the arterial wall, this mechanism has not been proved experimentally. SR-A may, in fact, contribute to atherogenesis in ways distinct from the function of SR-A in the uptake of modified lipoproteins (14de Winther M.P.J. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H.

In fact, it has been suggested that the SR-A may interact with components of the subendothelial space, thereby contributing to the adhesion and retention of macrophages in the artery wall (11Suzuki H.

To examine this possibility further, we tested the hypothesis that the SR-A contributes to the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. We found that biglycan and decorin, components of the extracellular matrix, as well as aggrecan, a proteoglycan that is similar to versican (a prominent matrix component) are ligands of the SR-A and that the SR-A contributes significantly to the divalent cation-dependent and -independent adhesion of macrophages to extracellular matrix derived from both smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Bovine aggrecan, bovine biglycan, bovine decorin, hyaluronan, and fucoidin were obtained from Sigma. Collagen IV was obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). PD-10 columns and Na125I were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, F12 medium, RPMI 1640 medium, trypsin-EDTA solution, and penicillin-streptomycin solution were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Tissue culture dishes and other plastic ware were obtained from Falcon (Franklin Lakes, NJ), Corning (Acton, MA), and Nalge Nunc International (Rochester, NY). Human LDL (d= 1.02–1.05 g/ml) were isolated from the plasma of normal fasted donors by sequential ultracentrifugation at 4 °C (21Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5454-5460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LDL were radiolabeled by the iodine monochloride method (22Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 150–350 cpm/ng of protein. AcLDL was prepared by treating LDL with acetic anhydride (23Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins were dialyzed against 0.15m NaCl and 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.2, before use. Aggrecan, biglycan, and decorin were labeled with 125I using iodobeads (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. The specific activities were 200–400 cpm/ng. Control Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in 95% air/5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO cells stably transfected to express the type I SR-A were grown in the same medium containing 400 μg/ml of G418. The preparation and properties of CHO cells stably expressing the SR-A have been described previously (24Dejager S. Mietus-Snyder M. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to confluence either in untreated 35- or 60-mm tissue culture plates or in plates coated with the extracellular matrix from human smooth muscle cells (HSMCs). The extracellular matrix was prepared as described below. The plates were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA solution at room temperature on an orbital platform. Trypsin activity was stopped at the times indicated with 1 ml of serum-containing medium. An aliquot of the medium was taken, and the number of cells released was determined with a cell counter (Coulter). HSMCs and bovine aortic endothelial cells were grown to confluence in 96-well plates, and the extracellular matrix was prepared as described (25Zvibel I. Brill S. Halpern Z. Papa M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in H2O for 10 min at room temperature. The wells were then washed three times with PBS and dried. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from SR-A +/+ orSR-A −/− mice (11Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y.

Macrophages (3 × 104) were seeded in wells coated with extracellular matrix, incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C under the conditions indicated, and washed three times with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS and their nuclei stained with Sitox green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS. Fluorescence images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope equipped with a digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments SPOT RT, Sterling Heights, MI). Image processing was used to isolate the nuclei from background fluorescence produced by the extracellular matrix, and then the nuclei in each image (a standard field captured using a ×10 objective) were counted. Five or six images were captured for each condition from triplicate wells of a 96-well plate. The images were processed and quantitated with FoveaPro Version 1.0 (Reindeer Graphics, Asheville, NC), running with PhotoShop 6.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA) on a Macintosh G4 computer. Control CHO cells and CHO cells expressing the SR-A were grown in 12-well plates as indicated above, washed three times with serum-free medium, and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 125I-aggrecan, -biglycan, or -decorin (1 μg/ml) alone or with the indicated competitors. Experiments were also performed with 125I-AcLDL (2 μg/ml) alone or with the indicated concentrations of competitors. Cell-associated ligands (i.e. bound and internalized protein) and degraded ligands (trichloroacetic acid-soluble protein degradation products in the medium) were quantitated as described (26Arnold K.S. Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Converse C.A. Skinner E.R. Lipoprotein Analysis. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 145-168Google Scholar,27Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). We observed that SR-A-expressing cells were more resistant to trypsin release than control cells. To quantitate this effect, cells were grown to confluence in 35- or 60-mm plates, washed, treated with trypsin/EDTA solution for different periods of time, and counted. CHO cells expressing the SR-A were more resistant to trypsin release than control CHO cells, which do not express the SR-A. Starting at 5 min of incubation with trypsin, a striking difference in trypsin release of the SR-A-expressing and nonexpressing cells was evident (Fig.1). All control cells were released at 6 min of incubation with trypsin/EDTA, whereas it took 11–12 min for the release of all of the SR-A expressing cells. This difference was even greater when the experiment was performed with cells grown on plates coated with extracellular matrix from HSMCs (Fig. 1 B). Expression of the SR-A therefore contributes to adhesion of the cells either to the cell culture dishes or to the matrix elaborated by the cells. We examined thioglycollate-elicited macrophages fromSR-A +/+ andSR-A −/− mice for their ability to adhere to the extracellular matrix produced by HSMCs. Under all conditions tested, macrophages fromSR-A −/− mice were less effective in adhering to the coated wells than macrophages fromSR-A +/+ mice (Fig.2). In the absence of serum, the adhesion of SR-A −/− macrophages to the HSMC extracellular matrix was 10% of the adhesion ofSR-A +/+ macrophages in the presence of EDTA (to chelate divalent cations) and 16% in the absence of EDTA. In the presence of serum, the adhesion ofSR-A −/− macrophages to the HSMC extracellular matrix was ∼35% of the adhesion ofSR-A +/+ macrophages in the absence of EDTA and ∼5% in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained when experiments were performed with an extracellular matrix from bovine aortic endothelial cells (data not shown). The SR-A antagonist fucoidin inhibited 70–90% of the adhesion of theSR-A +/+ macrophages (Fig. 2). Taken together these results demonstrate that the SR-A contributes significantly to the divalent cation-dependent and -independent adhesion of thioglycollate-elicited macrophages to extracellular matrix, both in the presence and absence of serum. We next identified two components of extracellular matrix that are SR-A ligands. Soluble biglycan and decorin were radioactively labeled and tested for their ability to bind to the SR-A. Compared with control cells, CHO cells stably expressing the SR-A showed a 5- to 6-fold greater cell association (which represents bound and internalized ligand) of 125I-labeled decorin and biglycan (Fig.3). We also found that aggrecan, a proteoglycan found in cartilage that is similar to the extracellular matrix component versican, is a ligand for the SR-A. SR-A-expressing cells showed an ∼8-fold greater cell association of125I-labeled aggrecan than control cells (Fig. 3). To examine further the specificity of interaction of the proteoglycans with the SR-A, the cell association and degradation of aggrecan, biglycan, and decorin were tested in competition experiments with unlabeled proteoglycan and fucoidin (Fig.4). A 10-fold molar excess of aggrecan or fucoidin competed for 80–90% of the cell association and 80–85% of the degradation of 125I-aggrecan. Biglycan or fucoidin (10-fold molar excess) also competed for 80–90% of the cell association and ∼80% of the degradation of125I-biglycan, whereas a 10-fold excess of decorin or fucoidin competed for only 50–60% of the cell association and ∼50% of the degradation of 125I-decorin. Higher concentrations (as high as a 100-fold excess) of competitor did not result in a substantially higher competition. Aggrecan, biglycan, and decorin also competed for the cell association and degradation of 125I-AcLDL by CHO cells expressing the SR-A (Fig. 5). Aggrecan, a high molecular weight proteoglycan, was the most effective competitor for the SR-A-mediated cell association and degradation of AcLDL, whereas biglycan was as effective as AcLDL and fucoidin (Fig. 5). Decorin was a less potent competitor. We also examined the ability of hyaluronan and collagen IV, other components of extracellular matrix, to compete for the SR-A-mediated cell association and degradation of AcLDL. We found that hyaluronan and collagen IV did not compete with AcLDL even at concentrations of 100 μg/ml (data not shown). This study shows that the SR-A contributes to the divalent cation-dependent and -independent adhesion of macrophages to extracellular matrix from HSMC and endothelial cells in the presence and absence of serum. This adhesion was inhibited by the SR-A antagonist fucoidin. Expression of SR-A by CHO cells delayed the release of cells from tissue culture dishes and from HSMC extracellular matrix by trypsin. Furthermore, we identified soluble biglycan and decorin, proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix, as ligands for the SR-A. In competition experiments, biglycan competed as effectively as AcLDL and fucoidin for the SR-A-mediated cell association and degradation of 125I-AcLDL. Decorin was less effective, suggesting that it has a lower affinity for the SR-A than biglycan or AcLDL. Unlabeled decorin or fucoidin competed only partially for binding of 125I-decorin to CHO cells expressing the SR-A. The binding of versican, another prominent component of the extracellular matrix, was not examined directly. However, we determined that aggrecan, a predominant proteoglycan in cartilage that is analogous to versican (28Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 29Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), is a ligand for the SR-A and a better competitor for the cell association and degradation of AcLDL than either biglycan or decorin. In contrast to biglycan and decorin, the core proteins of both aggrecan and versican are extensively substituted with chondroitin sulfate (28Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Macrophages exhibit both Ca2+-dependent and -independent adhesion. Unlike other cell types, macrophages attach to tissue culture plastic in the absence of divalent cations. In the presence of EDTA, which chelates Ca2+ and Mg2+, macrophages lose their spread morphology but remain adherent. The first indication that the SR-A contributes to adhesion was the observation that a monoclonal antibody to the SR-A (2F8) totally inhibits the divalent cation-independent adhesion of murine macrophages to tissue culture plastic in the presence but not in the absence of serum, suggesting that a component of serum is necessary for this adhesion (15Fraser I. Hughes D. Gordon S. Nature. 1993; 364: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16Hughes D.A. Fraser I.P. Gordon S. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Studies usingSR-A −/− andSR-A +/+ macrophages showed that the SR-A mediates 50–60% of the adhesion of macrophages to tissue culture plastic in the presence of serum (11Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M.

Cell Res. 1999; 250: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the presence of EDTA to chelate divalent cations, more than 85% of the adhesion is SR-A dependent (11Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S. Noda T.

Cell Res. 1999; 250: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The contribution of the SR-A to cell adhesion is dependent on the cell type and the cellular activation state. In resident peritoneal macrophages (not elicited) or resting Kupffer cells, cell adhesion does not differ in SR-A +/+ andSR-A −/− cells, whereas in thioglycollate-elicited macrophages or phorbol ester-activated Kupffer cells, the SR-A is responsible for about 85 and 35%, respectively, of cell adhesion in the presence of serum (19van Velzen A.G. Suzuki H. Kodama T. van Berkel T.J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The SR-A also mediates the adhesion of macrophages and SR-A-transfected cells to glycated collagen type IV in the absence of serum and divalent cations (17El Khoury J. Thomas C.A. Loike J.D. Hickman S.E. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10197-10200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to activated β lymphocytes (20Yokota T. Ehlin-Henriksson B. Hansson G.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and to sections of several mouse tissues (16Hughes D.A. Fraser I.P. Gordon S. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Hughes D.A. Fraser I.P. Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The tissue components with which the SR-A interacts were not identified. Our data show that the SR-A contributes to both the cation-dependent and -independent adhesion of thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages to the extracellular matrix from HSMCs, in either the presence or absence of serum. In the presence of serum,SR-A −/− macrophages showed 65 and 95% reduced adhesion (in the presence and absence of divalent cations, respectively) to extracellular matrix, compared with the adhesion of SR-A +/+ macrophages. This difference in adhesion is similar to data reported previously using tissue culture plastic (11Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S. Noda T. Toyoda Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Horiuchi S. Takahashi K.

Kodama T. van Berkel T.J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of serum the difference in adhesion to the extracellular matrix betweenSR-A −/− andSR-A +/+ macrophages was much greater than the effect when adhesion to plastic was studied.SR-A −/− macrophages showed 84 and 90% decreased adhesion to the HSMC extracellular matrix (in the presence and absence of divalent cations, respectively) compared with the decreases in adhesion to tissue culture plastic of 28 and 29% (19van Velzen A.G. Suzuki H. Kodama T. van Berkel T.J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the interaction of the SR-A with components in the extracellular matrix contributes to the adhesion of thioglycollate-elicited macrophages and that this interaction is independent of serum and divalent cations. We found that expression of the SR-A doubled the amount of time necessary to release cells with trypsin from tissue culture plates or tissue culture plates coated with extracellular matrix from HSMC. Our studies complement and extend previous studies using a different paradigm which suggested that the SR-A is partially responsible for the trypsin-resistant adhesion of macrophages to tissue culture plastic (16Hughes D.A. Fraser I.P. Gordon S. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In those studies, RAW 264 macrophages were gently trypsinized and washed in serum-containing medium before adhesion assays. Trypsin release after adhesion was not studied. Under those conditions, the SR-A was determined to account for 15–20% of the trypsin-resistant cell adhesion (16Hughes D.A. Fraser I.P. Gordon S. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The contribution of the SR-A to the adhesion of macrophages in vivo has not been demonstrated. However, our data and those reported previously suggest a role for the SR-A in adhesion under both normal and pathological conditions in both the vasculature and the central nervous system. The SR-A is highly expressed on activated microglia in the vicinity of Aβ-containing senile plaques in brains of patients with AD (30Christie R.H. Freeman M. Hyman B.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 399-403PubMed Google Scholar). The SR-A binds and internalizes microaggregates of the 42-amino acid form of Aβ in vitro(9Paresce D.M. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently reported that the SR-A binds secreted forms of APP (8Santiago-Garcia J. Mas-Oliva J. Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30655-30661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Aβ peptide and secreted APP are major constituents of senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits in patients with AD and Down's syndrome (31Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 32Haass C. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3783-3793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Van Nostrand W.E.

The SR-A may contribute to the clearance of both Aβ and secreted APP, which are produced continuously in normal and AD brains (32Haass C. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3783-3793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Van Nostrand W.E. Farrow J.S. Wagner S.L. Bhasin R. Goldgaber D. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

McKay D.M. Tintner R. Frangione B. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 258: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). However, the SR-A also mediates the adhesion of microglia and human monocytes to β-amyloid fibril-coated surfaces, leading to secretion of reactive oxygen species and cell immobilization (36El Khoury J. Hickman S.E. Thomas C.A. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. Loike J.D. Nature. 1996; 382: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The SR-A may, therefore, contribute to the adhesion of cells to the senile plaques and/or to cells expressing APP on their plasma membrane. In addition to Aβ and sAPP, AD plaques contain a wide variety of molecules, including extracellular matrix proteoglycans. It would be interesting to determine whether these molecules have a role in the interaction with microglia and in the progression of the disease. The SR-A may also contribute to the adhesion of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. Expression of the SR-A contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.SR-A −/− mice had smaller atherosclerotic lesions than control mice (11Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M.

However, this has not been proved. Other aspects of SR-A biology have been suggested to contribute to the reduced atherosclerosis (11Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K.

These data suggest that the adhesion and retention ofSR-A −/− macrophages in the extracellular matrix may be lower than the retention ofSR-A +/+ macrophages, thereby resulting in reduced development of atherosclerosis. Biglycan, versican, and decorin, normally present in arteries, are substantially elevated in atherosclerotic lesions (38Wagner W.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 454: 52-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 39Wight T.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Wight T.N. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1980; 5: 1-39PubMed Google Scholar). In atherosclerotic plaques, decorin colocalizes with the macrophage-rich core (41Evanko S.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Gold L.I. Wight T.N. Am. J.

Our data suggest that the interaction of the SR-A with these proteoglycans or other components of the extracellular matrix may contribute to the adhesion and retention of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions, thereby enhancing lipid accumulation and the progression of the disease.

https://openalex.org/W2093885105,"The controlled export of solutes is crucial for cellular adaptation to hypotonic conditions. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae glycerol export is mediated by Fps1p, a member of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family of channel proteins. Here we describe a short regulatory domain that restricts glycerol transport through Fps1p. This domain is required for retention of cellular glycerol under hypertonic stress and hence acquisition of osmotolerance. It is located in the N-terminal cytoplasmic extension close to the first transmembrane domain. Several residues within that domain and its precise position are critical for channel control while the proximal residues 13–215 of the N-terminal extension are not required. The sequence of the regulatory domain and its position are perfectly conserved in orthologs from other yeast species. The regulatory domain has an amphiphilic character, and structural predictions indicate that it could fold back into the membrane bilayer. Remarkably, this domain has structural similarity to the channel forming loops B and E of Fps1p and other glycerol facilitators. Intragenic second-site suppressor mutations of the sensitivity to high osmolarity conferred by truncation of the regulatory domain caused diminished glycerol transport, confirming that elevated channel activity is the cause of the osmosensitive phenotype.

Accumulation of osmolytes is a ubiquitous strategy of cellular osmoadaptation (1Somero G.N. Yancey P.H. Hoffmann J.F. Jamieson J.D. Handbook of Physiology, Section 14: Cell Physiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York1997: 441-484Google Scholar). Cells produce or actively take up osmolytes in order to increase their solute content and thereby maintain turgor and volume under hypertonic conditions (high extracellular osmolarity). Upon shift to hypotonic conditions, i.e. when the extracellular osmolarity drops, cells export solutes to prevent excessive swelling or bursting in a process termed regulated volume decrease (2Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 465-471Google Scholar). While proteins that mediate solute export from mammalian cells have not been identified yet, such channels have been described in bacteria and yeast (3Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Proliferating yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells employ glycerol as osmolyte, which they produce in two steps from the glycolytic intermediate dihydroxyacetonephosphate (12Brown A.D. Microbial water stress physiology. Principles and perspectives. J. Wiley and Sons Ltd., Chichester1990Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that Fps1p mediates export of glycerol across the yeast plasma membrane (13Van Aelst L. Hohmann S. Zimmermann F.K. Jans A.W. Thevelein J.M.

Rep M. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 159-165Google Scholar). Mutants lacking Fps1p are unable to rapidly export glycerol upon hypo-osmotic shock and only a fraction of such cells survive under these conditions (14Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skibbe W.F.

Glycerol flux is diminished within seconds after a shift to high osmolarity and it increases again at an apparently similar time scale when cells are shifted to low osmolarity (15Tamás M.J.

The N-terminal extension of Fps1p appears to be required for controlling glycerol transport as its deletion renders the channel hyperactive. Yeast cells expressing such a hyperactive channel are sensitive to high osmolarity because they need much longer to build up high intracellular glycerol levels due to a higher level of glycerol leakage (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar).

Members of this ancient family have been identified in organisms ranging from Archea to human (17Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev.

Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Google Scholar). Water channels are highly specific to water (17Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Google Scholar), although transport of ions has also been reported (23Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P.

Glycerol facilitators commonly transport small polyols and a range of other uncharged molecules (25Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Google Scholar), and apparently even metalloid ions (26Wysocki R. Chery C.C. Wawrzycka D. Van Hulle M. Cornelis R. Thevelein J.M. Tamás M.J. Mol.

The three-dimensional structure of human aquaporin AQP1 and of the E. coliglycerol facilitator GlpF have been determined (21de Groot B.L. Engel A. Grubmuller H.

MIP channels consist of six transmembrane domains (TMDs) comprised of an internal repeat of three TMDs. Loops B and E form two half TMDs that interact within the membrane and are part of the selective pore. These two loops contain the canonical NPA (asparagine-proline-alanine) motifs that are part of the MIP channel signature sequence, which is conserved in almost all of the presently known 300 MIP channels (17Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Google Scholar, 29Heymann J.B. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1039-1053Google Scholar, 30Stahlberg H. Heymann B. Mitsuoka K. Fuyijoshi Y. Engel A. Hohmann S. Nielsen S. Agre P. Aquaporins. 51. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 39-119Google Scholar). Fps1p is an unusual MIP channel. The NPA motifs in loops B and E are replaced by NLA and NPS, respectively. This observation together with mutational analyses suggests that the channel architecture of Fps1p differs from that of other glycerol facilitators (31Bill R.M. Hedfalk K. Karlgren S. Mullins J.G. Rydström J. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36543-36549Google Scholar). In addition, Fps1p has unusually long N- and C-terminal extensions of 255 and 139 amino acids, respectively. These extensions have no obvious similarity to other proteins in the databases. In this study we identified a regulatory domain within the N-terminal extension. It is located close to the first TMD and restricts transmembrane glycerol flux both under high osmolarity and under normal growth conditions. The regulatory domain shows structural similarity to the channel forming loops B and E suggesting that it might itself dip into the membrane. We discuss implications for the mechanisms by which this domain could be involved in controlling channel function. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study were wild-type W303-1A (MATa leu2-3/112 ura3-1 trp1-1 his3-11/15 ade2-1 can1-100 GAL SUC2 mal0) (32Thomas B.J. Rothstein R.J. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Google Scholar) and an isogenic fps1Δ::HIS3 (YMT2). Yeast cells were routinely grown on a rotary shaker at 30 °C in YNB (yeast nitrogen base) medium (33Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose as a carbon source. Plate growth assays were performed by pregrowing cells either in medium without salt (for hyperosmotic shock) or in medium supplemented with 1m sorbitol (for hypo-osmotic shock). Cells were suspended in the same medium to an OD600 of 1.0. Five microliters of each dilution of 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted onto agar plates supplemented with 2% glucose and 0.8 m NaCl (hyperosmotic shock) or lacking osmoticum (hypo-osmotic shock). Growth was monitored after 2–3 days at 30 °C. YEpmyc-FPS1 is a 2μ LEU2 plasmid expressing a c-mycepitope-tagged Fps1p (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar). The FPS1 alleles containing larger truncations (constructs fps1-Δ6 tofps1-Δ11), pairwise amino acid replacements (constructsfps1-12 to fps1-24) or insertions/deletions (constructs fps1-25 to fps1-28) were constructed by completely amplifying YEpmyc-FPS1 except for the region to be deleted or altered (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar). The primers used contained either aSacII site (constructs fps1-Δ6 tofps1-Δ11) or a SpeI site (constructsfps1-12 to fps1-28) and three additional nucleotides at their 5′-end. Ligation results in the insertion of a proline and an arginine residue (SacII) or a threonine and a serine residue (SpeI) at the site of the deletion. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. FPS1 alleles containing alanine or phenylalanine point mutations were constructed using the megaprimer polymerase method (34Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407Google Scholar) with YEpmyc-FPS1 as template and the mutagenesis and flanking (M5 and M6) primers listed in TableI. The resultant PCR products were co-transformed into S. cerevisiae with KpnI- andCspI-digested YEpmyc-FPS1. The resulting gap-repaired plasmids (35Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R.

To determine the proportion of produced glycerol that is retained, cells were grown in liquid YNB medium to an OD600 of 0.5–1.0, sedimented, and resuspended in medium containing 0.8 m NaCl, and samples were collected by filtration. To determine glycerol influx following its concentration gradient, cells were grown in liquid YNB medium to an OD600 of ∼2.0. Cells were harvested, washed, and suspended in ice-cold MES buffer (10 mm MES, pH 6.0) to a density of 40–60 mg of cells ml−1. Glycerol influx in the presence or absence of hyperosmotic stress was measured by adding glycerol to a final concentration of 100 mm “cold” glycerol plus 40 μm [14C]glycerol (160mCi/mmol; AmershamBiosciences) in a total volume of 250 μl (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar). Aliquots of 50 μl were collected by filtration and washed twice, and the radioactivity retained on the filters was determined. Filters with cells were dried at 80 °C overnight for dry weight determination. Transport experiments were performed in triplicate. Yeast membranes were prepared as previously described (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar). 10 μg of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-c-myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody. For detection, the membrane filters were incubated with 50 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 75 mg of nitroblue tetrazolium salts per ml. Protein was quantified using the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Sequence alignments were carried out using ClustalW (38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). Mean values for hydrophobicity were obtained as described (39Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar, 40Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Google Scholar). Propensity for α and β conformation was predicted by a sliding window calculation of the cumulative index for three successive residues, using previously reported scales (41Deleage G. Roux B. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 289-294Google Scholar). The models of the putative membrane dipping regions were generated by extraction of the Cα atom coordinates of loop B of E. coliGlpF from the Brookhaven Protein Data bank (PDB) file, 1FX8, using appropriate commands in RASMOL (42Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Google Scholar), followed by replacement with corresponding amino acid residues of the aligned Fps1p regulatory domain and construction of the loop using the MaxSprout algorithm (43Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 183-194Google Scholar). Predicted secondary structure was corroborated by analysis of the modeled structures using TMAlpha (44Sarakinou K.S. Antoniw J.F. Togawa R.C. Mullins J.G.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29 (36): A74Google Scholar). The predicted Fps1 protein consists of a hydrophilic N-terminal extension (amino acids 1–255), the core of six transmembrane domains (TMDs 1–6) with their connecting loops A–E (amino acids 256–530), and a hydrophilic C-terminal extension (amino acids 531–669) (13Van Aelst L. Hohmann S. Zimmermann F.K. Jans A.W. Thevelein J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2095-2104Google Scholar, 31Bill R.M. Hedfalk K. Karlgren S. Mullins J.G. Rydström J. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36543-36549Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that deletion of the N-terminal extension between positions 13 and 230 renders Fps1p hyperactive (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar). Deletion of residues 76–230 and 151–230 also increased transport through Fps1p while truncation upstream of position 145 did not cause any obvious effect. These data indicated that the segment important for control of Fps1p is located between positions 150 and 231 (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar). To define this regulatory domain in more detail we generated a further six deletions (Fig. 1 A). Those deletions were constructed in an FPS1 gene cloned under control of its own promoter into a multicopy plasmid and then expressed in an fps1Δ mutant. All constructs carried a C-terminal c-myc tag. By Western blot analysis of membrane preparations we confirmed that all constructs were expressed and that the gene products were located in fractions containing the plasma membrane (Fig.1 C). The amount of protein located in the plasma membrane seemed to differ between different alleles. Since we did not observe any correlation between the apparent amounts of membrane-localized Fps1p and functionality we assumed that the different protein levels did not affect the interpretation of the experiments. Similar observations were reported previously (31Bill R.M. Hedfalk K. Karlgren S. Mullins J.G. Rydström J. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36543-36549Google Scholar). For unknown reasons in some samples two bands appeared. Neither evidence for phosphorylation (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar) nor glycosylation 2K. Hedfalk, Roslyn M. Bill, J. Rydström, and S. Hohmann, unpublished data. of the protein, which could possibly explain the nature of the two bands, has been obtained so far. We then tested the functionality of the Fps1p constructs. Thefps1Δ mutant is sensitive to hypo-osmotic shock because it is unable to rapidly release accumulated glycerol (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar). In order to test if the constructs could complement the hypo-osmosensitivity of thefps1Δ mutant cells were pregrown in medium containing 1m sorbitol and then plated in serial dilutions on medium lacking sorbitol (Fig. 1 D). It appeared that all constructs could complement the hypo-osmosensitivity of the fps1Δmutant and hence encoded functional glycerol export channels located in the plasma membrane. To test if channel function was controlled normally we tested transformants for hyperosmosensitivity on plates with 0.8 mNaCl. Cells expressing FPS1 alleles 6–9 grew on high osmolarity plates like transformants carrying wild type FPS1(Fig. 1 B; see also left panel in Fig.1 D). This indicated efficient retention of glycerol produced by the cell and successful adaptation to high osmolarity and hence normal restriction of Fps1p-mediated glycerol export. The largest such truncation, FPS1-Δ9, lacks amino acids 13–215, which hence seemed to be dispensable for channel control. However, cells expressing constructs 10 and 11 grew only poorly on high osmolarity plates (Fig. 1, B and D), very much like we observed previously for cells expressing Fps1p lacking amino acids 13–230 (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar). The poor growth on high osmolarity plates was associated with a pronounced delay in building up high intracellular glycerol levels (data not shown). This is in line with previous observations with other N-terminal truncations (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar) and indicated an inability to restrict glycerol transport under hyperosmotic stress. Alleles 10 and 11 lack a segment immediately upstream of position 230 and the smallest truncation, FPS1-Δ11, lacks amino acids 217–230 but retains all 216 amino acids upstream. Hence, amino acids relevant for channel control are contained within the region covered by residues 217–230. All sequences upstream of this position seem to be dispensable for this control, and their function remains unknown for the moment. To further analyze this regulatory domain we scanned the sequence between 217 and 244 (except for residues Ser-237 and Thr-238) by pairwise replacement of amino acids with threonine and serine (Fig. 2). We chose this combination of amino acids because they are fairly neutral in their effect on secondary structure while we expected their insertion to affect the amphiphilic character of the region. All mutated genes were again expressed from the endogenous FPS1 promoter on a multicopy plasmid. The mutated proteins were detected in the plasma membrane fraction, they were all functional glycerol exporters as judged from their ability to complement the hypo-osmosensitivity of thefps1Δ mutant, and they grew like wild type on control plates lacking osmoticum (data not shown). Several of the mutations conferred strong osmosensitivity (Fig. 2); some did not have any effect at all while others resulted in intermediate sensitivity. Again, we interpret hyperosmosensitivity as an inability to restrict channel function under high osmolarity stress. Mutation of amino acids Pro-217, Ile-218, Met-219, Val-220 caused moderate osmosensitivity while mutation of the subsequent two amino acids caused strong osmosensitivity, indicative of a hyperactive channel. While exchange of amino acids 223 and 224 again did not seem to affect channel control, all mutations in the region 225–232 caused strong osmosensitivity, identifying this area as being of crucial importance. Note that 231 and 232 are threonine-proline and hence mutagenesis only changed Pro-232. Exchanges at positions 233–236 resulted in partial osmosensitivity suggesting that these residues also contribute to the function of the regulatory domain. Residues 233 and 234 are threonine-valine and hence mutagenesis only affected Val-234. Based on these observations we decided to focus further mutagenesis on the region between residues 222 and 238. We exchanged individual amino acids to alanine (with the exception of Tyr-226, which was replaced by phenylalanine) and expressed and analyzed the mutant alleles in the same way as described above. All mutated proteins were detected in the plasma membrane fraction, complemented the hypo-osmosensitivity of thefps1Δ mutant and grew like wild type on control plates without osmoticum (data not shown). We noted that the region between 217 and 244 contains a total of six proline residues, which could be of structural importance. Hence we first focused on the prolines in positions 222, 229, 232, and 236. Replacement of Pro-232 caused strong osmosensitivity, confirming the observation from the TS-scanning mutagenesis. However, replacement of Pro-222 had no effect. Since TS replacement of residues Lys-221 and Pro-222 caused strong osmosensitivity it appears that either Lys-221 is critical for channel control and/or that position Pro-222 tolerates alanine but not serine. Replacement of Pro-229 and Pro-236 caused moderate osmosensitivity, suggesting that the exchange with alanine affected channel control only to a certain extent. We further noted that the region under study contained phosphorylatable amino acids. Previous attempts to link different signaling pathways and protein kinases to channel control had not provided any evidence for a role of phosphorylation of Fps1p in channel regulation (15Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C.W. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Google Scholar) but could not exclude such a possibility. We replaced all four threonine residues and the serine residue by alanine and the tyrosine residue by phenylalanine. Only replacement of Thr-231 and Thr-233 caused intermediate or moderate osmosensitivity. These two residues immediately flank the critical Pro-232. Finally, replacement of residues Asn-228, Gln-230, and Leu-225 resulted in different degrees of osmosensitivity. Taken together, it appears that residues Leu-225, Asn-228, Gln-230, Thr-231, and Pro-232 are of particular importance for channel control. We then chose a subset of the mutants representing different types of mutations for a more detailed analysis of the effects on glycerol transport: the shortest truncation (Fig. 1) that caused osmosensitivity (FPS1-Δ11, residues 217–230), the longest truncation that did not cause osmosensitivity (FPS1-Δ9, residues 13–215) and alanine mutations (Fig. 3) that caused different degrees of osmosensitivity: L225A, N228A, T231A, and P232A. We observed that the alleles that conferred osmosensitivity could less well retain the glycerol they produced, suggesting that they had a higher capacity of glycerol transmembrane flux (data not shown). To monitor this effect more directly, we determined the influx of radiolabelled glycerol following its concentration gradient in unstressed cells and during the first minute after shifting cells to 0.8 m NaCl. The different transformants displayed very different profiles of glycerol influx (Fig.4; note that the two graphs have different scales). Truncation of the regulatory domain (FPS1-Δ11) as well as mutations of Thr-231 and Pro-232 caused the highest levels of glycerol influx while mutation of Leu-225 caused intermediately high glycerol influx. These data correlate well with the degree of sensitivity to 0.8 m NaCl of cells expressing the same alleles (Figs."

Searches for epigenetic mechanisms inDrosophila development uncovered an opposition between the trithorax (trxG)1and Polycomb (PcG) groups. TrxG proteins appear to maintain patterns of gene activation, whereas PcG proteins maintain patterns of gene repression. TrxG encompasses several subclasses of gene regulatory factors (1Kennison J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 20: 289-303Google Scholar). Although there are good models for action by some trxG members (e.g. brahma,moira,zeste, and GAGA), the activity of one subclass of the trxG, trxG3, which includes Trx, Ash1, and Ash2 (2Shearn A. Genetics. 1989; 121: 517-525Google Scholar, 3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar), remains unclear. Several trxG and PcG proteins contain a SET domain (Su(var) (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar, 4Tschiersch B. Hofmann A. Krauss V. Dorn R. Korge G. Reuter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3822-3831Google Scholar, 5Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D.

Reuter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3822-3831Google Scholar)), a well conserved 150-amino acid domain found in all eukaryotes, which mediates histone methyltransferase activity (5Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Google Scholar, 6Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Google Scholar). Trx and Ash1 both contain a SET domain. There is little evidence so far that Trx methylates histones; however, binding to histones has been documented (7Katsani K.R. Arredondo J.J. Kal A.J. Verrijzer C.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2197-2202Google Scholar). The third trxG3 member, Ash2, does not contain a SET domain but has a PHD finger (8Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Google Scholar) and a SPRY domain (9Ponting C. Schultz J. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 193-194Google Scholar). Although budding yeast does not have a Trx homologue, it has a protein, Set1, with a very similar type of SET domain (10Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Google Scholar). For this reason, we determined the composition of the Set1 complex, Set1C, and found that it has H3 Lys4 methyltransferase activity in vitro (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar). Concomitantly, two other groups have identified most members of Set1C (11Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Google Scholar, 12Nagy P.L. Griesenbeck J. Kornberg R.D. Cleary M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 90-94Google Scholar). The complete Set1C and the in vitro specificity for H3 Lys4 methylation have since been confirmed (13Krogan N.J. Dover J. Khorrami S. Greenblatt J.F. Schneider J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10753-10755Google Scholar). The requirement for Set1 in H3 Lys4methylation in vivo was identified (14Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Google Scholar) and extended to Set1C members (12Nagy P.L. Griesenbeck J. Kornberg R.D. Cleary M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 90-94Google Scholar, 13Krogan N.J. Dover J. Khorrami S. Greenblatt J.F. Schneider J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10753-10755Google Scholar). Set1C includes Bre2, the protein inSaccharomyces cerevisiae that is most similar to theDrosophila trxG protein, Ash2. Because we were exploring trxG action, we speculated that the protein-protein linkage between Set1 and Ash2/Bre2 in Set1C might consolidate trxG3 action to SET domains and histone methylation. At that time, however, no Set1 homologue was apparent in the Drosophila genome. We mined the Drosophila genome with deep bioinformatic tools to identify the Set1 orthologue, buried in sequence misreads. This discovery encouraged the trxG3-histone methylation proposition and the possibility that the Set1-Ash2 association may be broadly conserved in eukaryotes (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar). The work reported here was begun with the motivation to challenge our proposition by characterizing the protein complex associated with Schizosaccharomyces pombe Set1. The fission yeast S. pombe is widely held to be a more representative model for higher eukaryotes than the budding yeastS. cerevisiae. Indeed many S. pombe proteins appear to be more similar to their mammalian homologues than toS. cerevisiae counterparts (15Sipiczki M. Genome Biol. 2000; (REVIEWS1011): 1Google Scholar). A number of cellular aspects such as the nuclear cycle, structure of centromeres, and aspects of histone methylation are similar between S. pombeand higher eukaryotes but divergent in S. cerevisiae. Although both yeasts have H3 Lys4 methylation, S. cerevisiae lacks the nearby H3 Lys9 methylation (14Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Google Scholar,16Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Google Scholar). Emerging evidence in S. pombe and higher eukaryotes indicates that methylations of H3 Lys4 and H3 Lys9 are mutually exclusive in chromatin domains (16Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Google Scholar, 17Litt M.D. Simpson M. Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Google Scholar). Because this mechanism cannot exist in S. cerevisiae, extrapolations from the budding yeast to higher eukaryotes regarding H3 Lys4 methylation, Set1C, and Ash2 remain unsafe. Hence, we examined H3 Lys4 methylation in S. pombe and compared it with S. cerevisiae. Strains used in this study are isogenic to DB241 (h−; ura 4-D18; ade 6-M210; leu 1–32). Gene disruptions and protein tagging was done as described (18Tasto J.J. Carnahan R.H. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Yeast. 2001; 18: 657-662Google Scholar). TAP purification and identification of proteins by mass spectrometry were performed essentially as described for budding yeast (19Pijnappel W.W. Schaft D. Roguev A. Shevchenko A. Tekotte H. Wilm M. Rigaut G. Seraphin B. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2991-3004Google Scholar, 20Shevchenko A. Schaft D. Roguev A. Pijnappel W.W.M.P. Stewart A.F. Shevchenko A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 204-212Google Scholar). All the detectable bands in all gel lanes were analyzed, and only those specific to the complex are designated in Fig. 1. Persistent background proteins were different from those of budding yeast (20Shevchenko A. Schaft D. Roguev A. Pijnappel W.W.M.P. Stewart A.F. Shevchenko A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 204-212Google Scholar) and will be reported separately. Assays were performed as described previously (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar). The antibodies used were peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP; Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-dimethylated Lys4-H3 (Abcam), and rabbit polyclonal anti-acetyl histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Superose 6 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) was loaded with 500 μl of cleared crude cell extract from a TAP-tagged strain and run in Buffer E (20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.0, 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20). Fractions were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting against the TAP tag. Size standards were run in parallel under the same conditions. Total RNA from exponentially growing yeast cultures was isolated (Qiagen) and subjected to RT-PCR. As a control for DNA contamination, a reaction without reverse transcriptase (RT) was run in parallel. Before reaching reaction plateau, (30 cycles) aliquots were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA was isolated from exponentially growing yeast cultures, digested withEcoRI, and analyzed by standard methods using a 1.3% agarose/TAE (Tris acetate-EDTA) gel. pAMP1 (21Matsuura A. Naito T. Ishikawa F. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1501-1512Google Scholar) was digested with ApaI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs), gel-purified (Qiagen), and labeled by random priming (AmershamBiosciences). We purified the complex associated with S. pombe Set1 (Sp_Set1C) using tandem affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry (19Pijnappel W.W. Schaft D. Roguev A. Shevchenko A. Tekotte H. Wilm M. Rigaut G. Seraphin B. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2991-3004Google Scholar, 20Shevchenko A. Schaft D. Roguev A. Pijnappel W.W.M.P. Stewart A.F. Shevchenko A. Mol. Cell.

Sp_Set1C is composed of the following eight proteins (Fig.1) named in descending molecular weight order as follows (with S. pombe genome database reference in parentheses): Sp_Set1 (spcc306.04c), Sp_Ash2 (spbc13g1.08c), Sp_Spp1 (spcc594.05c), Sp_Swd3 (spbc354.03), Sp_Swd2 (spbc18h10.06c), Sp_Swd1 (spac23h3.05), Sp_Shg1 (spac17g8.09), and Sp_Sdc1 (spcc18.11c). The overall composition differs only slightly from S. cerevisiae Set1C (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar, 13Krogan N.J. Dover J. Khorrami S. Greenblatt J.F. Schneider J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10753-10755Google Scholar). The composition of S. pombe Set1C (Sp_Set1C) was confirmed by tagging each member except Sp_Shg1 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Purification of Sp_Set1C from the Sp_Set1-TAP strain indicated that all cellular Set1 is incorporated in the complex because no uncomplexed, free, cellular protein was apparent (Fig. 1 a). As for Sc_Set1, Sp_Set1 contains an RNA recognition motif and a SET domain flanked by an n-SET domain (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar) and postSET peptide. In all Set1C preparations, Sp_Set1 appeared in two forms, the shorter of which lacked the N terminus (as determined by MALDI peptide mass maps; data not shown). Whether this is a result of specific intracellular processing or nonspecific degradation during the isolation of the complex remains to be determined. Sp_Ash2 is orthologous to Drosophila melanogaster Ash2 protein and is more closely related to it than to its counterpart in Sc-Set1C, Sc_Bre2, which has no PHD finger. Homologies flanking the SPRY domains of Sp_Ash2, Bre2, Dm_Ash2, Mm_Ash2l, Hs_Ash2L, and Hs_Ash2l2 extend beyond the defined limits of the SPRY domain (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar, 9Ponting C. Schultz J. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 193-194Google Scholar). The Sp_Ash2 PHD finger is closely related to the PHD finger of Dm_Ash2 and to the unconventional PHD fingers of Mm_Ash2l, Hs_Ash2L, and Hs_Ash2l2 but not to the PHD finger of Spp1 (data not shown). Purification of Sp_Set1C from the Sp_Spp1-TAP strain indicated that all cellular Spp1 is incorporated in the complex, because no uncomplexed free cellular protein was apparent. Both yeast Spp1s contain nearly identical PHD fingers, which are closely related to the PHD finger of CGBP, a protein that binds preferentially to unmethylated CpGs (23Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to Sc_Set1C, the complex from S. pombe contains two PHD fingers (in Sp_Ash2 and Sp_Spp1). Sp_Swd1, Sp_Swd2, and Sp_Swd3 belong to the WD40 β propeller protein superfamily (24Paoli M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 76: 103-130Google Scholar). Based on the Hidden Markov model and profile-based self-dot-plot analyses, each of these three proteins contains seven statistically significant WD40 repeats (Fig.1 a and data not shown). They also share significant sequence similarity with their homologues from S. cerevisiae and several species including flies, Arabidopsis, and man, indicating that they are individually very conserved (data not shown). Sp_Shg1, like its homologue in the Set1C of S. cerevisiae, appeared in Sp_Set1C as a minor component. Only two other proteins with similarity to Sp_ and Sc_Shg1s are evident in the data bases, one inCandida albicans and the other in Caenorhabditis elegans, with highest similarity at the N termini (data not shown). In Sc_Set1C, Sdc1 appeared as a minor component. We did not identify its S. pombe homologue in the Sp_Set1 TAP preparations, probably because of its small size and poor mass spectrometry signature. However, when the Sp_Sdc1 homologue was tagged, Sp_Set1C was retrieved, thus proving its presence in the complex. Notably, a significant excess of Sp_Sdc1 was retrieved over Set1C members and other proteins, indicating that Sp_Sdc1 may also exist as free protein in the cell (Fig. 1 b; TableI). Sp_Sdc1 and Sc_Sdc1 show similarity to the C. elegans dosage compensation protein, Dpy-30. The similarity includes a short motif related to the dimerization motif in the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar).Table IRelative molar subunit composition of Set1CSet1CSet1-TAPAsh2-TAPSpp1-TAPSwd1-TAPSwd2-TAPSdc1-TAPSet11.01.01.01.01.01.0Ash21.42.82.82.82.87.0Spp11.12.12.12.11.32.1Swd3—1.41.41.2?1.4Swd1—1.51.52.51.51.5Swd20.40.71.31.31.10.7Sdc100—0018.9Shg1——————Estimations were made by densitometry of Coomassie-stained gel images taking Set1 as 1.0.

In other cases no overestimation was observed, thus indicating that the complex did not usually disassemble. —, denotes an inability to determine a relative estimation due to the co-migration of another protein. Interestingly, when either Sp_Ash2 or Sp_Sdc1 was TAP-tagged and purified, Sp_Set1C was retrieved along with three new high molecular weight proteins, now called Sp_Lid2 (Spbp19A11.06), Sp_Ecm5 (Spbc83.07), and Sp_Snt2 (Spac3h1.12c). Sp_Lid2 is the S. pombe homologue of the Drosophila trxG protein, Lid (little imaginal discs (25Gildea J.J. Lopez R. Shearn A. Genetics. 2000; 156: 645-663Google Scholar)). The Lid family of proteins, which includes Sc_Lid2 and mammalian Xe169 and Rbp2, contains three PHD fingers, a BRIGHT domain, and a JmjC domain. The BRIGHT domain is a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain with preference for AT-rich regions (26Kortschak R.D. Tucker P.W. Saint R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 294-299Google Scholar). The JmjC domain is found in a wide variety of organisms from bacteria to humans in at least seven families of proteins. The domain has no known function but may be involved in regulation of chromatin remodeling (27Balciunas D. Ronne H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 274-276Google Scholar, 28Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 26: 7-9Google Scholar). Sp_Snt2 contains three PHD fingers, a SANT domain (29Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Google Scholar), and a BAH domain (30Callebaut I. Courvalin J.C. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 189-193Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the homologues of Ecm5 and Snt2 interact physically; however, they do not appear to interact with Sc_Sdc1 or Sc_Lid2 (data not shown). Sp_Ecm5 contains a JmjC domain together with the N-terminal domain JmjN (27Balciunas D. Ronne H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 274-276Google Scholar), often associated with JmjC. To confirm the composition of the Sp_Lid2 complex (Sp_Lid2C), Sp_Lid2 was TAP-tagged and purified. Although Sp_Sdc1 was not identified, again presumably because of its small size and consequent difficulties with a clear mass spectrometry signature, Sp_Ash2, Sp_Ecm5, and Sp_Snt2 were retrieved (Fig. 1 b). By dissection of protein-protein interactions within Sc_Set1C, we showed previously that Bre2 and Sdc1 directly interact with each other (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar). Here we show that Sp_Ash2 and Sp_Sdc1 both associate with Sp_Set1C and Sp_Lid2C. Thus, we conclude that Sp_Ash2 and Sp_Sdc1 serve as proteomic hyperlinks between two complexes and probably form a module through interaction with each other. Hence Sp_Set1C and Sc_Set1C show almost the same polypeptide and domain compositions, differing only by the absence of a PHD finger in Bre2 and unexpected proteomic hyperlinks through Sp_Ash2 and Sp_Sdc1 to Sp_Lid2C. Except for Shg1, homologues and orthologues are present in diverse eukaryotic databases, indicating that Set1C is highly conserved. We estimated the size of the Sp_Set1C by means of Superose 6 size-exclusion column chromatography (Fig. 2 a). Two bands were observed, corresponding to the full-length and shorter versions of Set1 with the longer Set1 migrating in a complex(es) at ∼1 MDa and the shorter migrating around 800 kDa (assuming an overall globular configuration). We do not know whether the smaller complex(es) represents an authentic second complex(es) or a degradation product. The estimated size of 1 MDa is the same as Sc_Set1C (11Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Google Scholar) 2A. Roguev, D. Schaft, A. Shevchenko, R. Aasland, A. Shevchenko, and A. Francis Stewart, unpublished observations. but differs from the smaller apparent estimation of ∼500 kDa made after cell extraction in higher salt (12Nagy P.L. Griesenbeck J. Kornberg R.D. Cleary M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 90-94Google Scholar). The relative stoichiometry of Sp_Set1C subunits was estimated by densitometric measurement of images from the Coomassie-stained gels and then adjusted for molecular weight (Table I). Given a 1-MDa complex, we propose the complex composition presented in Fig.2 b. This model is concordant with our data; however, it should be regarded as an initial proposition. Mass estimations from Coomassie staining intensities can be only approximations for several reasons, including understaining because of the highly acidic content. This may not be a problem for Sp_Set1C because all subunits have isoelectric points between 5 and 6.5 except for Set1, which is 9.0. We also point out that the question as to whether Set1C is present in cells as a single complex or in several slightly different forms cannot be answered yet. The histone methyltransferase activity of Sp_Set1C was tested using the complex isolated from the Sp_Set1-TAP strain and incubation with core histones in the presence of [3H]SAM. It showed methyltransferase activity directed toward histone H3 (Fig.3 a), which was specific for Lys4 (Fig. 3 b). In this case, unlike Sc_Set1C (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar), fusion of the TAP tag to the C terminus next to the SET domain did not inhibit the enzymatic activity in vitro. The contribution of individual complex members to the enzymatic activityin vivo was examined. Disruption strains were readily obtained for all complex members except for Sp_Sdc1, which was elusive until recently. Hence, no complex member is essential for S. pombe. Individual disruption of all members totally ablated H3 Lys4 methylation except for Sp_Ash2, Sp_Sdc1, and Sp_Shg1, which showed about one-tenth, one-half, or wild type levels of H3 Lys4 methylation, respectively (Fig.4 a). These results are identical to those obtained from the same experiments in S. cerevisiae 2 (Refs. 12Nagy P.L. Griesenbeck J. Kornberg R.D. Cleary M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 90-94Google Scholar and 13Krogan N.J. Dover J. Khorrami S. Greenblatt J.F. Schneider J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10753-10755Google Scholar) except for Spp1. Deletion of Spp1 in S. cerevisiae has no effect on H3 Lys4 methylation, whereas in fission yeast it leads to complete loss of H3 Lys4 methylation. All of the WD40 repeat proteins are required for H3 Lys4 methylation, demonstrating that they are not redundant to each other. WD40 repeat proteins have been shown to serve as platforms for protein complex assembly; however, some of these proteins bind to histones (e.g. TBL1, Groucho, TUP1, and RCC1; e.g. Ref.31Nemergut M.E. Mizzen C.A. Stukenberg T. Allis C.D. Macara I.G. Science. 2001; 292: 1540-1543Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4 a, no dimethylated H3 Lys4was present upon disruption of the complex, indicating that Sp_Set1C is the major, possibly only, H3 Lys4 methyltransferase activity in S. pombe and extending the recently published result of Noma and Grewal (32Noma K.I. Grewal S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16438-16445Google Scholar) who show that deletion of set1 fromS. pombe abolishes H3 Lys4 dimethylation. Disruption of Set1 and other Sc_Set1C components causes complex phenotypes in S. cerevisiae including defects in cell wall formation, growth, and DNA repair, as well as alterations in silencing and telomere length (10Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Google Scholar, 14Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D.

We examined two of these phenotypic markers, growth and telomere length, for Sp_Set1C members (Fig. 4, b and c). Concordance between loss of H3 Lys4 methylation and phenotypic impact was observed in both assays. Loss of Shg1 and Sdc1 had the least impact on H3 Lys4 methylation and phenotype. The next mildest impact in all three assays was loss of Ash2. The only notable deviation from qualitative equivalence in all three assays is the effect of loss of Spp1 on telomere length. This suggests selectivity for Spp1 in the regulation of telomere length. Notably, in S. cerevisiae, loss of Set1C members results in shorter telomeres (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar,10Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Google Scholar, 34Corda Y. Schramke V. Longhese M.P. Smokvina T. Paciotti V. Brevet V. Gilson E. Geli V. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 204-208Google Scholar), whereas we observed lengthening in S. pombe. Either the telomere length changes due to Set1C disruption are not directly due to disturbance of chromatin at the telomeres, or the difference between S. cerevisiae and S. pombe may reflect the possibility that loss of H3 Lys4 methylation in S. pombe alters the boundaries of H3 Lys9 methylation domains. In S. cerevisiae, H3 Lys4methylation is dependent upon both Set1C and ubiquitinylation of H2B by Rad6 (37Sun Z.-W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Google Scholar, 38Dover J. Schneider J. Boateng M.A. Wood A. Dean K. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28368-28371Google Scholar). When the S. pombe Rad6 orthologue Rhp6 (Spac18b11.07c) was disrupted, there was a complete loss of H3 Lys4 methylation (Fig.5 a). The possibility that this effect was indirect via abolished expression of a Set1C member was excluded by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5 b). Hence, the regulation and enzymology of H3 Lys4 methylation is highly conserved between budding and fission yeasts. Set1C in S. cerevisiae includes Bre2, the homologue of the Drosophila trxG member, Ash2. To enquire whether the association between Set1 and Ash2 may also be found in other eukaryotes, we characterized Set1C from S. pombe. We found that both yeast Set1Cs are highly conserved, hence suggesting that Set1C will be highly conserved throughout eukaryotes, including the retention of the Set1-Ash2 linkage in flies. Our observations also strengthen the proposition that H3 Lys4 methylation is a common mechanistic feature of the trxG3 subgroup. Very recently, further evidence for this proposition has emerged with the biochemical identification of H3 Lys4 methyltransferase activity in both of the other trxG3 members, Ash1 (42Beisel C. Imhof A. Greene J. Kremmer E. Sauer F. Nature. 2002; 419: 857-862Google Scholar) and Mll (43Nakamura T. Mori T. Tada S. Krajewski W. Rozovskaia T. Wassell R. Dubois G. Mazo A. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1119-1128Google Scholar, 44Milne T.A. Briggs S.D. Brock H.W. Martin M.E. Gibbs D. Allis C.D. Hess J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1107-1117Google Scholar). We also found that Ash2 associates with Lid2 in S. pombe. Because Lid is a trxG protein in Drosophila (25Gildea J.J. Lopez R. Shearn A. Genetics. 2000; 156: 645-663Google Scholar), the identification of Ash2 as a trxG protein may relate to its interaction with Lid rather than with Set1 or possibly to its involvement in both complexes. In both yeasts, mutations of both Ash2 (Bre2) and Sdc1 decreased but did not abolish H3 Lys4 methylation. Whether these reductions represent a global reduction of methylation or loss of methylation at specific sites and not others remains to be determined. In any event, the protein-protein linkage of Ash2 and Sdc1 suggests that these reductions are based on a similar mechanistic loss. If Set1C selectively targets specific nucleosomes, then it is likely that the nonessential Ash2, Sdc1 or Shg1 subunits play roles in selectivity. Conversely, if Set1C methylates nucleosomes by a general mechanism, for example to methylate every nucleosome in a chromatin domain, then it is likely that the three WD40 proteins, Swd1, Swd2, and Swd3, play roles in substrate binding. Our results reveal the striking conservation surrounding H3 Lys4 methylation. However, prior evidence from the two yeasts highlight differences rather than similarities. Budding yeast lacks H3 Lys9 methylation, but it appears that H3 Lys4 and Lys9 methylations are mutually exclusive in other eukaryotes (16Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Google Scholar, 17Litt M.D. Simpson M. Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Google Scholar). Furthermore, the first evidence from budding yeast indicates that Set1 and H3 Lys4methylation is associated with chromatin repression at telomeres and rDNA (13Krogan N.J. Dover J. Khorrami S. Greenblatt J.F. Schneider J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10753-10755Google Scholar, 14Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D.

Briggs S.D. Strahl B.D. Curcio M.J. Allis C.D. Winston F. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 165-170Google Scholar), whereas it correlates with active chromatin in fission yeast (16Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Google Scholar, 32Noma K.I. Grewal S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16438-16445Google Scholar). Resolution of this discrepancy awaits further work; however, recent evidence from budding yeast also associates H3 Lys4 methylation with active chromatin, in particular with actively transcribed coding regions (39Bernstein B.E. Humphrey E.L. Erlich R.L. Schneider R. Bouman P. Liu J.S. Kouzarides T. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8695-8700Google Scholar, 40Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J.

Although strikingly conserved, the two yeast Set1Cs differ in three ways, each of which relates to PHD fingers. First, Ash2 in Sp_Set1C includes a PHD finger, whereas Bre2 in Sc_Set1C does not. Second, the PHD finger protein Spp1 is required for H3 Lys4 methylation in S. pombe but not in S. cerevisiae. Third, Sp_Ash2 and Sp_Sdc1 form a proteomic hyperlink between Sp_Set1C and Lid2C, which includes several PHD fingers. Although PHD fingers have been found exclusively in chromatin proteins so far, their mode of action remains elusive. Possibly the missing PHD finger relationships of Sc_Set1C relate to the absence of H3 Lys9 methylation in budding yeast. This correlation suggests that the PHD fingers of Ash2 and Spp1 may help in the recognition, perhaps directly, of the post-translational states of the nucleosomes upon which Set1C acts. If so, then some PHD fingers would interpret the histone code like certain chromo and bromo domains (8Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Google Scholar, 40Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C.T. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Google Scholar). Furthermore the intriguing proteomic association of Set1C to another trxG protein, Lid, is either a highly unusual coincidence involving two trxG proteins or a hint that Lid proteins and complexes may also involve reading of the histone code. The close linkage of Sdc1 to Set1C and Lid2C also has implications for dosage compensation in C. elegans through the Sdc1 homologue Dpy30 (45Hsu D.R. Chuang P.T. Meyer B.J. Development. 1995; 121: 3323-3334Google Scholar). As for Set1C, ubiquitinylation of H2B (46Jason L.J.M. Moore S.C. Lewis J.D. Lindsey G. Ausio J. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 166-174Google Scholar) and Rad6 homologues are apparent in all eukaryotes examined. Because the protein machinery for H3 Lys4 methylation and its relationship to Rad6 is highly conserved between budding and fission yeasts, it is likely that the Set1C/Rad6 axis in H3 Lys4 methylation is highly conserved in eukaryotes. If so, it will be interesting to understand why mammals appear to have two orthologues of Set1 (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar). Because Set1C appears to be built on a dimeric platform, both mammalian Set1s may be incorporated into a single Set1C, or there could be two or more Set1Cs with possible differences in function. It will also be interesting to understand how the putative mammalian Set1Cs relate to the other known H3 Lys4 activities mediated by Set7/9 (47Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1207-1217Google Scholar, 48Nishioka K. Chuikov S. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 479-489Google Scholar) and Ash1 (42Beisel C. Imhof A. Greene J. Kremmer E. Sauer F. Nature. 2002; 419: 857-862Google Scholar). Our work also presents new proteomic insights. The remarkable conservation of the nonessential Set1C in the two yeasts bodes well for future extrapolations from lower to higher eukaryotes regarding other protein complexes. However the proteomic environment surrounding the two Set1Cs appears to differ. The only identified proteomic hyperlink in Sc_Set1C was Swd2, which is also a subunit of cleavage polyadenylation factor (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar). This proteomic hyperlink is not conserved in S. pombe.2 Furthermore, we have identified a new hyperlink between Sp_Set1C and Sp_Lid2. The S. cerevisiae orthologues of Ecm5 and Snt2 also interact with each other but do not appear to interact with Sc_Bre2, Sc_Sdc1, or Sc_Lid2.2 This work, in conjunction with our previous paper (3Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Google Scholar), presents, to our knowledge, the first case in which fine mapping of one complex and the surrounding proteomic environment from two organisms has been compared. Although we find that the Set1Cs from S. cerevisiae andS. pombe are highly conserved, their proteomic environments appear to differ, thus pointing to an inherent limitation of the “orthologous proteome” concept (49Rubin G.M. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2204-2215Google Scholar) and the need for comparative proteomic analyses (50Liska A. Shevchenko A. Proteomics. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Whether our observations define a new proteomic principle regarding strong conservation within complexes and weaker conservation of linkages between complexes remains to be determined, but this explanation certainly makes intuitive sense.

Although calcium is an important regulator of neuronal survival during development of the nervous system and is also implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, it is not known if calmodulin mediates these actions of calcium. To determine the role of calmodulin in regulating neuronal survival and death, we overexpressed calmodulin with mutations in all four Ca2+-binding sites (CaM(1–4)) or with disabled C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites (CaM(3,4)) in cultured neocortical neurons by adenoviral gene transfer. Long-term neuronal survival was decreased in neurons overexpressing CaM(1–4) and CaM(3,4), which could not be rescued by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The basal level of Akt kinase activation was decreased, and the ability of BDNF to activate Akt was completely abolished in neurons overexpressing CaM(1–4) or CaM(3,4). In contrast, BDNF-induced activation of p42/44 MAPKs was unaffected by calmodulin mutations. Treatment of neurons with calmodulin antagonists and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor blocked the ability of BDNF to prevent neuronal death, whereas inhibitors of calcium/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II did not. Our findings demonstrate a pivotal role for calmodulin in survival signaling by BDNF in developing neocortical neurons by activating a transduction pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt.

BDNF has several effects on cellular calcium homeostasis, including enhancement of calcium oscillations in cultured hippocampal neurons (29Sakai N. Yamada M. Numakawa T. Ogura A. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1997; 778: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and stimulation of calcium release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive stores in myocytes (30Kleiman R.J. Tian N. Krizaj D. Hwang T.N. Copenhagen D.R. Reichardt L.F. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, studies have suggested roles for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) IV in the effects of BDNF on gene expression (31Finkbeiner S. Tavazoie S.F. Maloratsky A. Jacobs K.M. Harris K.M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1031-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if and how calcium mediates survival signaling by BDNF. Calmodulin is a loop-helix-loop Ca2+-binding protein that is evolutionarily conserved and is expressed in all mammalian cells (32Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Calmodulin transduces Ca2+ signals by interacting with specific target proteins; examples include CaMKII, CaMKIV, calcineurin, spectrin A2, p21, and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (33Bredt D.S. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar,34Soderling T.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Calmodulin has four Ca2+-binding sites, with two in the globular N-terminal domain and two in the globular C-terminal domain; the Ca2+-binding sites are separated by flexible α-helical domains. When bound to Ca2+, calmodulin undergoes a conformational change that allows it to bind to target effector proteins and to stimulate or inhibit their activities. Calmodulin plays important roles in regulating synaptic plasticity (35Gnegy M.E. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 2000; 14: 91-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its possible roles in mediating actions of neurotrophic factors are unknown. Because BDNF has been shown to increase the levels of intracellular Ca2+ in neurons on the one hand and also activates PI3K-Akt and Ras-MEK-MAPK pathways on the other hand, we sought to establish a role for calmodulin in one or both of these BDNF cell survival signaling pathways. Cultures of embryonic neocortex were prepared from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (36Glazner G.W. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 161: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 on 12-mm glass coverslips photoetched with a grid (Eppendorf) to allow relocation of the same microscope field at different time points. The coverslips were coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). The culture medium consisted of Neurobasal medium with B27 supplements (Invitrogen); cultures were maintained in a 95% room air and 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. BAPTA-AM and EGTA were from Molecular Probes, Inc. BDNF was from Invitrogen. W-12, W-13, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, KN-92, KN-93, and AIP were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. LY294002 and PD98059 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Nicardipine was from Sigma. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using the overlap extension method (37Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar). A synthetic gene encoding wild-type bovine calmodulin (38Waltersson Y. Linse S. Brodin P. Grundstrom T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7866-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was used as template for the PCRs. In mutant CaM(1,2), Asp21 and Asp57 were changed to Ala. In mutant CaM(3,4), Asp94 and Asp130were mutated to Ala, whereas in mutant CaM(1–4), Asp21, Asp57, Asp94, and Asp130 were all changed to Ala. A 5′-flanking BamHI restriction site and a 3′-flanking EcoRI restriction site were introduced into the wild-type and mutant calmodulin cDNAs. DNA fragments (BamHI-EcoRI) containing the entire coding region of wild-type or mutant calmodulin were first subcloned into the pGEX-4T plasmid. DNA fragments (HindIII-XbaI) containing the wild-type or mutant calmodulin cDNA were then removed from the pGEX-4T plasmid and subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle plasmid pAdv/RSV (39Huang S.

A portion of each construct (15 μg) and an equal amount of the adenoviral package plasmid pJM17 were cotransfected into the E1 trans-complementing cell line 293 using calcium phosphate. The recombinant adenoviruses, generated by homologous recombination, were isolated by plaque formation in 293 cells. Viral DNA was isolated from at least five separate plaques for each construct, and the insertion of calmodulin or its mutants or β-galactosidase in the viral genome was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion. High-titer stocks of recombinant adenoviruses were grown in 293 cells and purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation. The titers of viral stocks were ∼2.8 × 109 pfu/ml for wild-type calmodulin, 6 × 109 pfu/ml for CaM(1,2), 4.4 × 109 pfu/ml for CaM(3,4), 3 × 109 pfu/ml for CaM(1–4), and 4.8 × 109 pfu/ml for β-galactosidase. The methods for delivery of the adenovirus to the cultures were described previously (40Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cultured neurons were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 pfu/cell. At 8 days in culture, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4) containing primary monoclonal antibody against MAP2, a microtubule-associated protein used as neuronal marker. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 2 h in PBS containing fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; ImmunoResearch Laboratory). After washing with PBS, some cultures were counterstained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml), a DNA-binding dye, to label nuclei. After 3 days of infection with adeno-β-galactosidase, the cells were rinsed briefly in ice-cold PBS and incubated for 1 h in fixative solution (2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1 m NaHPO4, pH 7.3). Cells were washed three times with rinse solution (0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 m NaHPO4, pH 7.3) and then placed in X-gal stain solution containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, and 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6 plus 0.1 mNaHPO4, pH 7.3, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 8 mg/ml X-gal for 12–16 h at 37 °C. Stained cells were rinsed and equilibrated in sucrose solution (20% sucrose, 0.05% NaN3, and 0.1 m NaHPO4, pH 7.3) at 4 °C. At 5 days in vitro, live neurons in each of four 175-μm2 regions of the grid on each coverslip were counted from images captured using a digital camera; at the beginning of each experiment, the average number of neurons in a 175-μm2 region was in the range of 30–50. Four separate coverslips were used for each condition; and thus, ∼800 neurons were quantified for each experiment. Four separate experiments were performed. Neurons that were in the process of degenerating (i.e. that displayed nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, and extensive neurite fragmentation) were excluded. On each subsequent day, the same areas were located and recounted; the number of live neurons remaining at each day was expressed as a percentage of the initial number. To identify and quantify apoptotic neurons, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then stained with the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33258. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and examined under epifluorescence illumination using a ×40 objective lens. Cells were considered “apoptotic” if their nuclear chromatin was condensed or fragmented, whereas cells were considered viable if their chromatin was diffusely and evenly distributed throughout the nucleus. To further confirm and detect apoptotic DNA fragmentation, a TUNEL kit (R&D Systems) was used. Briefly, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and washed with PBS, pH 7.4. After blocking of endogenous peroxidases, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a reaction mixture containing terminal transferase, biotinylated nucleotide (dNTP), or PBS as a control. Cells were then incubated in the presence of streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase for 20 min at room temperature. After rinsing in PBS, DNA strand breakage was visualized in the presence of horseradish peroxidase substrate. The apoptotic cells exhibited dark blue nuclear staining. Approximately 500 cells on each coverslip were scored; three separate coverslips were assessed for each condition in each experiment; and three separate experiments were performed for both Hoechst 33258 staining and TUNEL staining. After infection and experimental treatment, the cells were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the protein concentration in each sample was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Proteins (50 μg of protein/lane) were then resolved on 7.5–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 4% nonfat milk in Tris-HCl-based buffer with 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.5, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of primary antibody. Cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of a 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibody (IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Reaction product was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies included anti-tubulin (mouse, 1:5000; Sigma), anti-phospho-p42/44 MAPK (mouse, 1:1000; New England Biolabs Inc.), anti-p42/44 MAPK (rabbit, 1:1000; New England Biolabs Inc.), anti-phospho-Akt (rabbit, 1:1000;Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Akt (rabbit, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-calmodulin (mouse, 1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). All data are presented as means ± S.E. Comparisons between controls and treatments were performed using Student's unpaired t test or ANOVA when appropriate. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To investigate how calmodulin, a calcium-sensing protein, can influence neuronal survival, we used primary neocortical neurons that were isolated and cultured from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats in serum-free medium. The cultures consisted of two populations of cells (based on morphology and expression of cell type-specific proteins). Cells with round cell bodies and long thin neurites were immunoreactive with an antibody against MAP2, whereas flat cells with no neurites were immunoreactive with an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig. 1, A–C; and data not shown). At 8 days in culture, 91 ± 3.3% (n = 3) of the cells were MAP2-positive and 9 ± 4.5% (n= 3) were MAP2-negative, whereas at 14 days in culture, the percentage of MAP2-negative cells was increased to ∼25%. The distinct morphologies of neurons and astrocytes allowed us to unambiguously identify neurons for the various analyses performed in this study. To study the role of calmodulin in neuronal survival, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to generate forms of calmodulin in which either Ca2+-binding domains 1 and 2 (CaM(1,2)) or 3 and 4 (CaM(3,4)) or all four Ca2+-binding domains (CaM(1–4)) were mutated at Asp residues known to be critical for Ca2+binding (Asp21, Asp57, Asp94, and Asp130); in each case, the mutation changed the Asp residue to an Ala residue. Adenoviral constructs were used to deliver the calmodulin cDNAs into primary neocortical neurons in culture. To control for nonspecific effects of infection and overexpression of any exogenous protein, we used neurons infected with adeno-β-galactosidase as the control in this study. Using a multiplicity of infection of 50, we found that nearly 100% of the neurons were infected as demonstrated by β-galactosidase staining (Fig. 1 C). Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates showed that the CaM(3,4) and CaM(1–4) proteins were overexpressed in infected cells and that, as expected for adenoviral vectors, expression was sustained at a high level (Fig. 1 D). The mutant forms of calmodulin exhibited a slightly lower apparent molecular mass than endogenous calmodulin (Fig. 1 B), consistent with a previous finding that calmodulin displays a Ca2+-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility (41Geiser J.H. Tulnen D.V. Brockerhoff S.E. Neff M.M. Davis T.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 949-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found that when cardiac myocytes were infected with adenoviral vector containing wild-type calmodulin or mutant CaM(1,2), the levels of calmodulin were tightly regulated such that little or no overexpression of calmodulin occurred. 2D. Yang, A. Cheng, and R. Xiao, manuscript in preparation. We obtained a similar result in primary neocortical neurons infected with adenovirus containing wild-type calmodulin or mutant CaM(1,2) (Fig.1 D). The cells were cultured for 5 days in Neurobasal medium with B27 supplements and then infected with adeno-β-galactosidase (control), adeno-CaM(1,2), adeno-CaM(1–4), or adeno-CaM(3,4). At 5 days in culture, cells were infected with viral vectors. Three days after infection, the culture medium was changed to Neurobasal medium lacking B27 trophic supplements (withdrawal of trophic support). Fig.2 A shows representative phase-contrast micrographs of cultured cortical neurons that had been infected with adeno-β-galactosidase and adeno-CaM(1–4) immediately prior to withdrawal of trophic supplements and 4 days later. Many more neurons had degenerated 4 days after withdrawal of trophic support in cultures infected with CaM(1–4) compared with cultures infected with control virus. To quantitatively analyze the time course of neuronal survival, the total number of cells identifiable as live neurons by phase-contrast microscopy in each grid square was counted daily for 6 days. The results show that neuronal survival was significantly decreased in neurons expressing the CaM(3,4) and CaM(1–4) mutants 2, 4, and 6 days after withdrawal of trophic support compared with neurons infected with control virus or virus containing the CaM(1,2) mutant (Fig. 2 B). In an additional experiment, we performed TUNEL staining analysis of adeno-β-galactosidase-, adeno-CaM(1,2)-, adeno-CaM(1–4)-, or adeno-CaM(3,4)-infected neurons 6 days after withdrawal of trophic support. Essentially all of the neurons expressing CaM(3,4) or CaM(1–4) were TUNEL-positive, whereas ∼70% of the neurons expressing β-galactosidase (control) or infected with adeno-CaM(1,2) were TUNEL-positive (Fig. 2, C andD). When trophic support was not removed from the cultures, adeno-CaM(3,4)- and adeno-CaM(1–4)-infected neurons died significantly faster compared with adeno-β-galactosidase- and CaM(1,2)-infected neurons (Fig. 2, C andD). Thus, the CaM(3,4) and adeno-CaM(1–4) mutations promote neuronal death in the absence or presence of trophic support, indicating that the effect of the mutations is not the result of an altered response to one or more components of the B27 supplements. The initial results suggested a role for calmodulin in cell survival signaling in developing neocortical neurons. To link calmodulin to a specific trophic factor signaling pathway, we employed BDNF, a neurotrophin previously shown to promote the survival of cultured embryonic hippocampal and neocortical neurons (42Ip N.Y. Li Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3394-3405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ohsawa F. Widmer H.R. Knusel B. Denton T.L. Hefti F.

When cultures that had been infected with the control adenoviral construct or adeno-CaM(1,2) were treated with BDNF after withdrawal of trophic supplements, long-term neuronal survival was significantly increased (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the ability of BDNF to promote neuronal survival was completely abolished in neurons expressing either the CaM(1–4) or CaM(3,4) mutant (Fig. 3,B and C), demonstrating that Ca2+binding in the C-terminal EF-hands of calmodulin is required for BDNF cell survival signaling. To confirm a role for calmodulin in BDNF cell survival signaling, we employed W-13, a calmodulin antagonist, and W-12, a less active structural analog of W-13 (W-13 IC50 = 68 μm versus W-12 IC50 = 260 μm) (45Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In these experiments, neuronal death was assessed 2 days following withdrawal of trophic supplements by counting Hoechst-stained neurons with condensed nuclei or TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 4 A). In cultures subjected to withdrawal of trophic supplements, ∼20% of the cells died during a 2-day period, whereas ∼10% of the cells died when they were treated with BDNF. When cells were treated with 80 μm W-13, a concentration previously shown to inhibit calmodulin maximally (14Egea J. Espinet C. Soler R.M. Dolcet X. Yuste V.J. Encinas M. Iglesias M. Rocamora N. Comella J.X. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the neuronal survival-promoting effect of BDNF was completely abolished (Fig. 4, A and B). At this concentration, the effect of W-13 was specific because the same concentration of W-12 did not alter the ability of BDNF to prevent apoptotic neuronal death (Fig. 4 B). As was the case when neuronal survival was evaluated in neurons expressing a calmodulin mutant by morphological criteria (Fig. 3), W-13 completely abolished the ability of BDNF to prevent neuronal death as assessed by counting apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 4, A and B).Figure 4Calmodulin and Akt activation is essential for the neuronal survival-promoting effect of BDNF , whereas ERK activation is not required. Primary cultured neurons were incubated in medium lacking B27 trophic supplements in the absence or presence of 25 ng/ml BDNF as indicated. Cultures were treated with the indicated agents, which were added at the time of removal of trophic supplements: 80 μm W-12, 80 μm W-13, 20 μm LY294002, and 10 μm PD98059. After 48 h, cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33258 or processed to TUNEL staining.

Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two pathways for BDNF cell survival signaling in neurons have been identified, one involving PI3K and Akt kinase and the other involving MAPKs p42 and p44 (also known as ERK1 and ERK2) (12Segal R.A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). To determine which of these pathways is involved in BDNF cell survival signaling in our neocortical cultures, we pretreated cultures with either LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K (46Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1 (47Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar). LY294002 completely abolished the neuronal survival-promoting effect of BDNF, whereas PD98059 did not (Fig. 4 B). In other studies, we found that the same batch of PD98059 could block the activation of ERKs by BDNF (data not shown), suggesting that failure of PD98059 to abolish the neuronal survival-promoting effect of BDNF is not due to instability of PD98059. These results suggest that activation of PI3K is required for BDNF cell survival signaling, whereas activation of ERKs is not. To determine whether calmodulin acts upstream of one or both of the kinase cascades activated by BDNF, we exposed neocortical cultures to BDNF in the abs"

To study the effect of NDPK on G protein activity in living cells, the NDPK isoforms A and B were stably expressed in H10 cells, a cell line derived from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of either NDPK isoform had no effect on cellular GTP and ATP levels, basal cAMP levels, basal adenylyl cyclase activity, and the expression of Gsα and Giα proteins. However, co-expression of Gsα led to an increase in cAMP synthesis that was largely enhanced by the expression of NDPK B, but not NDPK A, and that was confirmed by direct measurement of adenylyl cyclase activity. Cells expressing an inactive NDPK B mutant (H118N) exhibited a decreased cAMP formation in response to Gsα. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated a complex formation of the NDPK with Gβγ dimers. The overexpression of NDPK B, but not its inactive mutant or NDPK A, increased the phosphorylation of Gβ subunits. In summary, our data demonstrate a specific NDPK B-mediated activation of a G protein in intact cells, which is apparently caused by formation of NDPK B·Gβγ complexes and which appears to contribute to the receptor-independent activation of heterotrimeric G proteins.

In the cell, the major reaction is the phosphate transfer from ATP to other NDPs to maintain the levels of NTPs, especially the relatively high level of GTP. Only a small fraction of cellular NDPK binds to the plasma membrane, where it may serve the synthesis of GTP, required for the activation of G proteins (1Kimura N. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L.

Science. 1991; 254: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown G protein activation through the enzymatic activity of NDPK (synthesis of GTP from a nucleoside triphosphate and GDP), the specificity of this phenomenon has been questioned (8Randazzo P.A.

Biomembr. 2000; 32: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Particularly in the intact cell, where GTP concentrations are in the upper micromolar range, evidence for a mechanism beyond the sole synthesis of GTP appears mandatory to support this hypothesis. On the other hand, we have shown recently (10Niroomand F. Piacentini L. Jakobs K.H. Mura R. Rauch B. Kübler W. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1479-1486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that NDPK activates G proteins and regulates adenylyl cyclase activity in canine cardiac sarcolemmal membranes. This activation required the catalytic activity of NDPK (synthesis of GTP) but was clearly distinct from the effect of exogenous GTP, suggesting a more direct interaction of NDPK and G proteins.Evaluation of direct G protein activation through phosphotransfer by NDPK is associated with substantial methodological constraints. Mainly, GDP is released spontaneously from G proteins and may then serve as a free substrate for phosphorylation by the NDPK (8Randazzo P.A. Northup J.K. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18182-18189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approaches to immobilize the bound GDP at the G protein (11Zhu J. Tseng Y.H. Kantor J.D. Rhodes C.J. Zetter B.R. Moyers J.S. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14911-14918Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) are associated with protein denaturation, which in turn may lead to unspecific protein phosphorylation by the NDPK (12Engel M. Veron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.-L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, structural considerations make an interaction of the NDPK and the guanine nucleotide-binding Gα subunit unlikely. Access of the NDPK to the Gα subunit would require dramatic conformational changes, including the release of Gβγ dimers prior to the phosphorylation step. On the other hand, GTP formation by a phosphate transfer via intermediately phosphorylated Gβ subunits has been observed in several tissues (13Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J.

Seavey S.E. Rhodes C.J. Metz S.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and a complex formation of NDPK B with Gβγ is reported in the accompanying paper (19.Cuello, F., Schulze, R. A., Heemeyer, F., Meyer, H. E., Lutz, S., Jakobs, K. H., Niroomand F., and Wieland, T. (2003) 278, 7220–7226.Google Scholar). Beyond the molecular mechanisms, the important question of whether NDPK can activate G proteins in intact cells has not been addressed, most likely because of the lack of specific activators and inhibitors of NDPK. To circumvent these problems, we took a pragmatic approach by co-expressing the human NDPK isoforms A (nm23-H1) and B (nm23-H2) and the α subunit of the Gs protein (Gsα) and measured the effect on cAMP synthesis and phosphorylation of Gβ. We report that the Gsα-mediated stimulation of cAMP formation increased with the expression level of NDPK B but not NDPK A. Moreover, evidence is provided that the increase in cAMP formation is dependent on the catalytic activity of the NDPK B isoform and a complex formation with Gβγ.DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible interaction of NDPK and G proteins in living cells. Our experimental setting offers two major advantages when compared with prior approaches performed in membranes or reconstituted in vitro systems. First, we circumvent the technical problems associated with a proof of phosphotransfer to G protein-bound GDP or GTP channeling (9Otero A.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and second, we address the issue of a physiologically relevant mechanism by studying the effects in intact cells. The results of the combined overexpression of NDPK isoforms and Gsα in H10 cells can be summarized as follows. The stimulation of cAMP synthesis by NDPK required Gsα, and much of the effect of Gsα was dependent on NDPK activity. The effects of both NDPK and Gsα were dependent on and linear with the expression of the respective proteins. The activation of Gsα by NDPK required the catalytic activity of the enzyme. It was not seen with its inactive mutant. Furthermore, the effect was specific for the NDPK B isoform. Orlov et al. (25Orlov N.Y. Orlova T.G. Nomura K. Hanai N. Kimura N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) recently found a transducin-mediated isoform-specific binding of NDPK to rod outer segment membranes. In their study, the transducin-mediated binding of NDPK B to the membrane exceeded that for the A isoform 100-fold, indicating a specific interaction of the G protein with NDPK B.Cellular cAMP is influenced by several factors that had to be controlled to confine our results to NDPK activity. To block influences of β-adrenoceptors and phosphodiesterases, cAMP assays were performed in the presence of propranolol and IBMX, respectively. Furthermore, expression of NDPK had no influence on the expression levels of the adenylyl cyclase-regulating G proteins, the basal adenylyl cyclase activity, or cellular ATP and GTP contents. Finally, direct measurements of adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro exhibited an NDPK B- and Gsα-dependent activation in the presence of GDP and ATP.Evidence of G protein activation by NDPK in cells does not resolve the problem of its mechanism. Previous studies had demonstrated an activation of G proteins (13Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20791-20797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by phosphorylated Gβ subunits. In H10 cell membranes, the extent of Gβ phosphorylation was dependent upon the level, activity, and isoform of NDPK. In addition, Gβ subunits co-precipitated with an antibody against NDPK. Furthermore, the accompanying paper (19.Cuello, F., Schulze, R. A., Heemeyer, F., Meyer, H. E., Lutz, S., Jakobs, K. H., Niroomand F., and Wieland, T. (2003) 278, 7220–7226.Google Scholar) shows a highly selective co-purification of NDPK B and Gβγ dimers with different isolation protocols. A reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of NDPK with transducin Gβγ further confirms a complex formation. Most important, the phosphorylation of Gβ subunits could be reconstituted by the addition of NDPK-enriched co-factor fractions to purified Gβγ dimers of different origin. The identification of a phosphorylated histidine residue (His-266 in Gβ1) that is exposed at the surface of the Gβ molecule raises the possibility of a phosphate transfer from His-118 of NDPK B to His-266 in Gβ (19.Cuello, F., Schulze, R.

The enhanced phosphorylation of Gβ in membranes of cells overexpressing NDPK B and the lack of such an effect in membranes of cells overexpressing its catalytic inactive mutant H118N (Fig. 5) substantiates this hypothesis.Assuming that the NDPK B-dependent effects on cAMP formation are mediated by NDPK B·Gβγ complexes, our data suggest that the activation of G proteins by GTP formation via intermediately phosphorylated NDPK B·Gβγ complexes is a mechanism to regulate the basal, receptor-independent activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Fig. 6). In line with this hypothesis, an at least 3-fold increase of the NDPK content and activity in sarcolemmal plasma membranes from failing human myocardium was accompanied by a higher basal activation of Gi proteins (26Lutz S. Mura R. Baltus D. Movsesian M.A. Kübler W. Niroomand F. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As Gi protein expression is also increased in heart failure (27Feldman A.M. Cates A.E. Veazey W.B. Hershberger R.E. Bristow M.R. Baughman K.L. Baumgartner W.A. Van Dop C. J. Clin.

Ginsburg R. Minobe W. Cubicciotti R.S. Sageman W.S. Lurie K. Billingham M.E. Harrison D.C. Stinson E.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 307: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar) and diminished basal cAMP formation (30Böhm M. Reiger B. Schwinger R.H. Erdmann E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1713-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).If NDPK B is a regulator of G protein activity, an important question is whether its contribution is regulated in cells. Recently, we found a 3-fold elevated plasma membrane-associated NDPK in hearts from patients with severe congestive heart failure (26Lutz S. Mura R. Baltus D. Movsesian M.A. Kübler W. Niroomand F. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This elevation was diminished in patients treated with a β-adrenoreceptor antagonist. Furthermore, chronic treatment of rats with the β-adrenoreceptor agonist, isoproterenol, induced an increase in plasma membrane-bound NDPK (31Niroomand F. Mura R. Braun M. Lutz S. Circulation. 2000; 102: II-197Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting chronic β-adrenergic activation as a mechanism for regulation of the NDPK membrane content. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that an NDPK B·Gβγ complex, as a receptor-independent activator of G proteins, may have the potential to regulate a broad spectrum of cellular functions. Studies are in progress to further substantiate this hypothesis. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK)1 catalyzes the transfer of terminal phosphate groups from 5′-triphosphate to 5′-diphosphate nucleotides. In the cell, the major reaction is the phosphate transfer from ATP to other NDPs to maintain the levels of NTPs, especially the relatively high level of GTP. Only a small fraction of cellular NDPK binds to the plasma membrane, where it may serve the synthesis of GTP, required for the activation of G proteins (1Kimura N. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 108/II. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York1993: 485-496Google Scholar, 2Otero A.D. Biochem.

An activation of G proteins by NDPK has been disputed for more than 10 years. Although numerous in vitro studies (4Ohtsuki K. Yokoyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Kimura N. Shimada N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Kikkawa S.

Science. 1991; 254: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown G protein activation through the enzymatic activity of NDPK (synthesis of GTP from a nucleoside triphosphate and GDP), the specificity of this phenomenon has been questioned (8Randazzo P.A. Northup J.K. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18182-18189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Otero A.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Particularly in the intact cell, where GTP concentrations are in the upper micromolar range, evidence for a mechanism beyond the sole synthesis of GTP appears mandatory to support this hypothesis. On the other hand, we have shown recently (10Niroomand F. Piacentini L. Jakobs K.H. Mura R. Rauch B. Kübler W. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1479-1486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that NDPK activates G proteins and regulates adenylyl cyclase activity in canine cardiac sarcolemmal membranes. This activation required the catalytic activity of NDPK (synthesis of GTP) but was clearly distinct from the effect of exogenous GTP, suggesting a more direct interaction of NDPK and G proteins. Evaluation of direct G protein activation through phosphotransfer by NDPK is associated with substantial methodological constraints. Mainly, GDP is released spontaneously from G proteins and may then serve as a free substrate for phosphorylation by the NDPK (8Randazzo P.A. Northup J.K. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18182-18189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approaches to immobilize the bound GDP at the G protein (11Zhu J. Tseng Y.H. Kantor J.D. Rhodes C.J. Zetter B.R. Moyers J.S. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14911-14918Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) are associated with protein denaturation, which in turn may lead to unspecific protein phosphorylation by the NDPK (12Engel M. Veron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.-L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, structural considerations make an interaction of the NDPK and the guanine nucleotide-binding Gα subunit unlikely. Access of the NDPK to the Gα subunit would require dramatic conformational changes, including the release of Gβγ dimers prior to the phosphorylation step. On the other hand, GTP formation by a phosphate transfer via intermediately phosphorylated Gβ subunits has been observed in several tissues (13Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Wieland T. Ronzani M. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol.

Seavey S.E. Rhodes C.J. Metz S.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and a complex formation of NDPK B with Gβγ is reported in the accompanying paper (19.Cuello, F., Schulze, R. A., Heemeyer, F., Meyer, H. E., Lutz, S., Jakobs, K. H., Niroomand F., and Wieland, T. (2003) 278, 7220–7226.Google Scholar). Beyond the molecular mechanisms, the important question of whether NDPK can activate G proteins in intact cells has not been addressed, most likely because of the lack of specific activators and inhibitors of NDPK. To circumvent these problems, we took a pragmatic approach by co-expressing the human NDPK isoforms A (nm23-H1) and B (nm23-H2) and the α subunit of the Gs protein (Gsα) and measured the effect on cAMP synthesis and phosphorylation of Gβ. We report that the Gsα-mediated stimulation of cAMP formation increased with the expression level of NDPK B but not NDPK A. Moreover, evidence is provided that the increase in cAMP formation is dependent on the catalytic activity of the NDPK B isoform and a complex formation with Gβγ. DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible interaction of NDPK and G proteins in living cells. Our experimental setting offers two major advantages when compared with prior approaches performed in membranes or reconstituted in vitro systems. First, we circumvent the technical problems associated with a proof of phosphotransfer to G protein-bound GDP or GTP channeling (9Otero A.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and second, we address the issue of a physiologically relevant mechanism by studying the effects in intact cells. The results of the combined overexpression of NDPK isoforms and Gsα in H10 cells can be summarized as follows. The stimulation of cAMP synthesis by NDPK required Gsα, and much of the effect of Gsα was dependent on NDPK activity. The effects of both NDPK and Gsα were dependent on and linear with the expression of the respective proteins. The activation of Gsα by NDPK required the catalytic activity of the enzyme. It was not seen with its inactive mutant. Furthermore, the effect was specific for the NDPK B isoform. Orlov et al. (25Orlov N.Y. Orlova T.G. Nomura K. Hanai N. Kimura N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) recently found a transducin-mediated isoform-specific binding of NDPK to rod outer segment membranes. In their study, the transducin-mediated binding of NDPK B to the membrane exceeded that for the A isoform 100-fold, indicating a specific interaction of the G protein with NDPK B.Cellular cAMP is influenced by several factors that had to be controlled to confine our results to NDPK activity. To block influences of β-adrenoceptors and phosphodiesterases, cAMP assays were performed in the presence of propranolol and IBMX, respectively. Furthermore, expression of NDPK had no influence on the expression levels of the adenylyl cyclase-regulating G proteins, the basal adenylyl cyclase activity, or cellular ATP and GTP contents. Finally, direct measurements of adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro exhibited an NDPK B- and Gsα-dependent activation in the presence of GDP and ATP.Evidence of G protein activation by NDPK in cells does not resolve the problem of its mechanism. Previous studies had demonstrated an activation of G proteins (13Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20791-20797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by phosphorylated Gβ subunits. In H10 cell membranes, the extent of Gβ phosphorylation was dependent upon the level, activity, and isoform of NDPK. In addition, Gβ subunits co-precipitated with an antibody against NDPK. Furthermore, the accompanying paper (19.Cuello, F., Schulze, R. A., Heemeyer, F., Meyer, H. E., Lutz, S., Jakobs, K. H., Niroomand F., and Wieland, T. (2003) 278, 7220–7226.Google Scholar) shows a highly selective co-purification of NDPK B and Gβγ dimers with different isolation protocols. A reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of NDPK with transducin Gβγ further confirms a complex formation. Most important, the phosphorylation of Gβ subunits could be reconstituted by the addition of NDPK-enriched co-factor fractions to purified Gβγ dimers of different origin. The identification of a phosphorylated histidine residue (His-266 in Gβ1) that is exposed at the surface of the Gβ molecule raises the possibility of a phosphate transfer from His-118 of NDPK B to His-266 in Gβ (19.Cuello, F., Schulze, R.

Although LeTx-induced cytolysis of macrophages plays an important role in the outcome of anthrax infection, the sensitivity of macrophages in vitrodoes not correlate with in vivo susceptibility to infection of Bacillus anthracis. This divergence suggests that additional factors other than LeTx are involved in the cytolysis of LeTx-resistant macrophages in vivo. We found that LeTx-resistant macrophages became sensitive to LeTx-induced cytolysis when these cells were activated by bacterial components. Tumor necrosis factor-α induced by bacterial components was a key factor that cooperated with LeTx in inducing LeTx-resistant macrophage death.

The processed PA heptamerizes and binds 3 molecules of either EF or LF, resulting in either a PA·EF or a PA·LF complex, which is internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis (10Elliott J.L.

Although it is known that EF exerts its effects through a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase activity, the mechanisms of LF intoxication are less clear. LF can be delivered to the cytosol of cells, but cytolysis as a consequence of the intracellular LF is observed only in macrophages from certain mouse strains (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H.

The toxic activity of LF depends on its protease activity (4Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Leppla S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), suggesting that proteolysis of one or more cellular protein(s) unleashes a cascade of events resulting in the death of the intoxicated macrophages. Indeed, cleavage of several mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases (MKKs) has been observed (15Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the physiological importance of MKK proteolysis relative to macrophage cytolysis cannot be established because similar cleavage is observed in macrophages that are resistant to LeTx (16Pellizzari R. Guidi-Rontani C. Vitale G. Mock M. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 17Watters J.W. Dewar K. Lehoczky J. Boyartchuk V. Dietrich W.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Inbred mouse strains exhibit striking differences in the sensitivity of their cultured macrophages to the effects of LeTx (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, C3H mouse macrophages lysed by LeTx at 1 ng/ml are 100,000 times more sensitive than A/J mouse macrophages (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages from CBA/J and BALB/c mice are sensitive, whereas those from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice are resistant. Direct binding studies revealed that the affinity and number of PA receptors/cell are the same in sensitive and resistant cells (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic activation of PA is also the same in both sensitive and resistant macrophages (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resistant macrophages are not cross-resistant to other toxins and viruses that, like lethal toxin, require vesicular acidification for activity. This implies that resistance is not due to defects in vesicular acidification (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, the proteolysis of MKKs is comparable in sensitive and resistant cells (16Pellizzari R. Guidi-Rontani C. Vitale G. Mock M. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 17Watters J.W. Dewar K. Lehoczky J. Boyartchuk V. Dietrich W.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, resistance is due to a defect at a stage occurring after proteolysis. Watters et al. (17Watters J.W. Dewar K. Lehoczky J. Boyartchuk V. Dietrich W.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) identified a mutation on a gene named kif1C that is responsible for the different sensitivities of macrophages to LeTx.kif1C encodes a kinesin-like motor protein of the UNC104 subfamily (18Dorner C. Ciossek T. Muller S. Moller P.H. Ullrich A. Lammers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20267-20275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is clear that proper function of kif1C is required for LeTx resistance, but how this protein is involved in LeTx-elicited changes in macrophages is unknown (17Watters J.W. Dewar K. Lehoczky J. Boyartchuk V. Dietrich W.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The kif1C protein has been excluded as a target of LF-mediated proteolysis (17Watters J.W. Dewar K. Lehoczky J. Boyartchuk V. Dietrich W.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).It was believed that LeTx-induced cytolysis of macrophages played an important role in the overall outcome of anthrax infection. Injection of LeTx into CBA/J mice, whose macrophages are sensitive to LeTx, results in a more rapid death compared with A/J mice, whose macrophages are resistant to LeTx-induced cytolysis (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the sensitivity of macrophages to LeTx in vitro does not correlate within vivo susceptibility to infection of either encapsulated or non-encapsulated strains of B. anthracis (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pellizzari R. Guidi-Rontani C. Vitale G. Mock M. Montecucco C.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because macrophages can be activated by encounters with infected bacteria (19Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 20Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar), we addressed whether macrophage activation has an effect on cell viability in LeTx-treated LeTx-resistant macrophages. We found that treatment of macrophages with bacterial components can make LeTx-resistant macrophages become sensitive to LeTx-induced cytolysis. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) induced by bacterial components is at least one of the factors that cooperate with LeTx in inducing macrophage death. Our data suggest that the autocrine/paracrine effect of TNF plays a key role in LeTx-resistant macrophage death in vivo.DISCUSSIONWe have examined the effect of cellular activation of macrophages on the cell viability of LeTx-treated LeTx-resistant macrophages. We found that treatment of macrophages with different bacterial components made LeTx-resistant murine macrophages susceptible to LeTx-induced cell death. TNF produced by activated macrophages is a key mediator that sensitizes LeTx-resistant macrophages to LeTx-induced death. We have determined that the protease activity of LF and mTor activity in cells are required for TNF/LeTx-induced resistant macrophage death and that this type of cell death is caspase-independent. Sensitizing LeTx-resistant macrophages to LeTx-induced cytolysis suggests that host responses to anthrax infection participate in the macrophage deathin vivo.LeTx-induced cytolysis of macrophages plays an important role in the outcome of anthrax infection. Lethality in mice of different strains resulting from direct injections of LeTx mimics the in vitrosensitivity of macrophages to LeTx-induced cell death (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A contribution of host responses to the lethality of anthrax infection can also be deduced from the study of Welkos et al. (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They showed that C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mouse strains are killed byB. anthracis Vollum 1B strain (wild-type) infection with similar LD50 values (five to six spores). However, the LD50 of the non-encapsulated toxin-producing strain Sterne is significantly different. The LD50 of C3H/HeN mice is 8 × 106 spores, whereas C3H/HeJ mice are completely resistant to the Sterne strain at the highest dose used (2 × 107 spores). These two strains have similar genetic backgrounds, except that C3H/HeJ mice have a point mutation in TLR4 that impairs signaling initiated by some bacterial cell wall components such as LPS. It is possible that capsulated B. anthracis can escape TLR4 recognition and therefore that the TLR4 mutation does not alter the host responses to anthrax infection. However, “naked”B. anthracis can be detected by TLR4, and the TLR4 deficiency impairs macrophage responses, thereby increasing levels of LD50. Although wild-type B. anthracis does escape phagocytosis by macrophages and some other host defense reactions, certain levels of host response should occur. The capsule should interact with macrophages, and we have shown here that the major components of the capsule such as PGA can stimulate macrophages to produce TNF. Although the capsule may prevent PG from interacting with the macrophages, this interaction would occur if the capsule was released or damaged. Because macrophages are producers of TNF, the local concentration of TNF around macrophages can be high. We suggest that macrophage-produced TNF may be responsible for cytolysis of LeTx-resistant macrophages in vivo. This contention is consistent with two published in vivo studies using neutralizing antibodies of TNF. When the anti-TNF antibody is administered to BALB/c mice, there is no protective effect from an injection of LeTx (14Hanna P.C. Acosta D. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10198-10201Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In contrast, administration of the anti-TNF antibody delays the death of C57BL/6J mice infected with B. anthracis (36Kalns J. Scruggs J. Millenbaugh N. Vivekananda J. Shealy D. Eggers J. Kiel J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When the macrophages from BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were analyzed for their sensitivity to LeTx in vitro, BALB/c macrophages were found to be sensitive to LeTx, but C57BL/6J macrophages were not. It is possible that because LeTx can directly trigger cytolysis of macrophages in BALB/c mice, inhibition of TNF does not help the survival of the mice. Although TNF is involved in the cytolysis of macrophages in anthrax-infected C57BL/6J mice, blocking TNF delays death.Life or death of a cell is determined by a balance between death and survival pathways. TNF is a pleiotropic cytokine produced mainly by macrophages. TNF is also recognized by macrophages and regulates the pattern of gene expression (35Riches D.W. Chan E.D. Winston B.W. Immunobiology. 1996; 195: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TNF-induced cellular responses are mediated by either one of the two TNF receptors, TNF-RI (p55) and TNF-RII (p75) (37Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). Macrophages express both receptors (33Mukhopadhyay A. Suttles J. Stout R.D. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31906-31912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because TNF-RI knockout mice have the same sensitivity to anthrax infection as wild-type mice (36Kalns J. Scruggs J. Millenbaugh N. Vivekananda J. Shealy D. Eggers J. Kiel J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the sensitization of LeTx-resistant macrophages to LeTx-induced death by TNF is most likely through TNF-RII. This notion is consistent with the observation that human TNF, which is able to bind only to TNF-RI on murine cells, could not promote the death of LeTx-resistant macrophages (Fig.4 D). TNF can induce caspase-dependent and -independent cell death (38Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 781-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 39Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 40Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). It is clear that TNF/LeTx-induced cell death is independent of caspases because Z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit cell death (Fig. 6 B). Because the mechanism of caspase-independent cell death by TNF is largely unknown, it is unclear whether the same method is used in TNF/LeTx-induced macrophage death.Even though TNF induces cell death in many cells, some cell types such as macrophages proliferate in response to TNF (33Mukhopadhyay A. Suttles J. Stout R.D. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31906-31912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TNF activates various kinases of the MAPK family and induces various transcription factors such as NF-κB in macrophages (32Winston B.W. Chan E.D. Johnson G.L. Riches D.W.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4491-4497PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mukhopadhyay A. Suttles J. Stout R.D. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

Activation of MAPK has been shown to be involved in both apoptosis and cell survival of macrophages depending on the cell death stimuli (41Mohr S. McCormick T.S. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5045-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 42Petrache I. Choi M.E. Otterbein L.E. Chin B.Y. Mantell L.L. Horowitz S. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L589-L595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Park et al. (27Park J.M. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Karin M. Science. 2002; 297: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) showed that LPS stimulation of macrophages treated with sublytic doses of LF and saturated PA63 (cleaved active form of PA) results in apoptosis. The dismantling of the p38 MAPK pathway by sublytic doses of LF was implicated to be partly responsible for the apoptosis of activated macrophages (27Park J.M. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Karin M. Science. 2002; 297: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). We have shown here that inhibition of ERK, p38, JNK, protein kinase C, tyrosine kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways enhanced TNF/LeTx-induced death of LeTx-resistant macrophages (Fig. 6 C), which supports the idea that damage to certain intracellular signaling pathways by LF may impair cell survival mechanisms (27Park J.M. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Karin M. Science. 2002; 297: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Inhibition of any single pathway did not have an effect on the viability of TNF-treated macrophages (Fig.6 D), suggesting that disruption of a single signaling pathway cannot mimic the LF effect on survival mechanisms. This speculation was supported by the observation that a combination of inhibitors of MAPKs and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase significantly induced cell death in TNF-treated macrophages (Fig. 6 D). In contrast to the reported effect of sublytic doses of LF (27Park J.M. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Karin M. Science. 2002; 297: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), apoptotic features could not be found in macrophages treated with cytolytic doses of LeTx in the presence of LPS stimulation (Fig. 3). It appears that the phenotype of cell death is determined by the level of LF damage rather than cellular activation because sublytic doses of LeTx alone already triggers apoptotic features (26Popov S.G. Villasmil R. Bernardi J. Grene E. Cardwell J. Wu A. Alibek D. Bailey C. Alibek K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Rapamycin was the only inhibitor we tested that could prevent TNF/LeTx-induced macrophage death (Fig. 6 C). The rapamycin target mTor is a controller of regulatory metabolic responses (43Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway can regulate mTor in some systems (43Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is responsible for mTor regulation in our system because wortmannin or LY294002 did not have the same effect as rapamycin, but rather had an opposite effect. Because rapamycin did not inhibit LeTx-induced cytolysis of LeTx-sensitive macrophages (data not shown), mTor is most likely involved in TNF signaling in TNF/LeTx-induced death of LeTx-resistant macrophages. How mTor is regulated and how mTor functions in TNF/LeTx-induced LeTx-resistant macrophage death are a subject for further investigation.LeTx causes the proteolysis of certain cellular proteins by triggering the cytolysis of LeTx-sensitive macrophages. Because of a difference of three amino acids in the kinesin-like motor protein kif1C, this proteolysis cannot cause cell death in LeTx-resistant macrophages. kif1C was suggested to be involved in retrograde vesicle transport, and TNF may influence this transport to sensitize LeTx-resistant macrophages. It is also possible that TNF sensitizes LeTx-resistant macrophages through a mechanism independent of kif1C. LeTx leads to proteolysis of certain proteins that may damage some cellular functions. TNF-induced cellular responses under this condition could be imbalanced and result in cell death. It was reported that human macrophages are sensitive to LeTx-induced cytolysis in vitro(13Hanna P.C. Kruskal B.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Bloom B.R. Collier R.J. Mol. Med. 1994; 1: 7-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have tested human macrophages from two donors and found that both were resistant to LeTx-induced cell death and could be sensitized through TNF treatment, as was observed in LeTx-resistant murine macrophages (data not shown). This result fits with a predication that human macrophages should be resistant to the effect of LeTx because the human KIF1C gene has the same amino acid sequence as C57BL/6J and other resistant strains in the region that determines LeTx sensitivity (17Watters J.W. Dewar K. Lehoczky J. Boyartchuk V. Dietrich W.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It appears that different human populations exhibit differences in the sensitivity of their macrophages due to the effect of LeTx. Thus, our study on LeTx-resistant macrophage death is relevant to anthrax infection in humans and provides valuable insight into the anthrax pathogenesis. Anthrax infections are initiated by endospores ofBacillus anthracis (1Dixon T.C. Meselson M. Guillemin J. Hanna P.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). These spores germinate after they are phagocytosed by macrophages and begin to express virulence toxins that lead to a systemic immune response, shock, and death (1Dixon T.C. Meselson M. Guillemin J. Hanna P.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the three toxins produced by anthrax bacilli, edema factor (EF),1lethal factor (LF), and protective antigen (PA), are principally responsible for provoking the host responses (1Dixon T.C. Meselson M. Guillemin J. Hanna P.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 2Sellman B.R. Nassi S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8371-8376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PA functions as a molecular transporter by facilitating the entry of LF and EF into cells through endocytosis and translocation of EF and LF into the cytosol (3Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar,4Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Leppla S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). LF, a zinc metalloprotease (4Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Leppla S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), together with PA is termed lethal toxin (LeTx). LeTx is the major contributor of virulence in infected animals (1Dixon T.C. Meselson M. Guillemin J. Hanna P.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EF, an adenylate cyclase (3Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), functions as an enhancer that enhances the cytotoxicity of LeTx in macrophages (6Pezard C. Berche P. Mock M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Much is known about the mechanisms of action and cellular entry of LF and EF. PA binds to a cell-surface receptor (7Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), where it is proteolytically processed on the cell surface (8Wesche J. Elliott J.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The processed PA heptamerizes and binds 3 molecules of either EF or LF, resulting in either a PA·EF or a PA·LF complex, which is internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis (10Elliott J.L. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PA then forms a hole in the acidified endocytic vesicle through which EF or LF is delivered to the cytosol (11Milne J.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although it is known that EF exerts its effects through a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase activity, the mechanisms of LF intoxication are less clear. LF can be delivered to the cytosol of cells, but cytolysis as a consequence of the intracellular LF is observed only in macrophages from certain mouse strains (5Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conflicting results have been reported regarding whether LeTx induces cytokine production in macrophages (12Erwin J.L. DaSilva L.M.

https://openalex.org/W2101549937,"We studied the molecular basis of the up to 46-fold increased accumulation of folates and methotrexate (MTX) in human leukemia CEM-7A cells established by gradual deprivation of leucovorin (LCV). CEM-7A cells consequently exhibited 10- and 68-fold decreased LCV and folic acid growth requirements and 23–25-fold hypersensitivity to MTX and edatrexate. Although CEM-7A cells displayed a 74–86-fold increase in the reduced folate carrier (RFC)-mediated influx of LCV and MTX, RFC overexpression per se cannot induce a prominently increased folate/MTX accumulation because RFC functions as a nonconcentrative anion exchanger. We therefore explored the possibility that folate efflux activity mediated by members of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family was impaired in CEM-7A cells. Parental CEM cells expressed substantial levels of MRP1, MRP4, poor MRP5 levels, whereas MRP2, MRP3 and breast cancer resistance protein were undetectable. In contrast, CEM-7A cells lost 95% of MRP1 levels while retaining parental expression of MRP4 and MRP5. Consequently, CEM-7A cells displayed a 5-fold decrease in the [3H]folic acid efflux rate constant, which was identical to that obtained with parental CEM cells, when their folic acid efflux was blocked (78%) with probenecid. Furthermore, when compared with parental CEM, CEM-7A cells accumulated 2-fold more calcein fluorescence. Treatment of parental cells with the MRP1 efflux inhibitors MK571 and probenecid resulted in a 60–100% increase in calcein fluorescence. In contrast, these inhibitors failed to alter the calcein fluorescence in CEM-7A cells, which markedly lost MRP1 expression. Replenishment of LCV in the growth medium of CEM-7A cells resulted in resumption of normal MRP1 expression. These results establish for the first time that MRP1 is the primary folate efflux route in CEM leukemia cells and that the loss of folate efflux activity is an efficient means of markedly augmenting cellular folate pools. These findings suggest a functional role for MRP1 in the maintenance of cellular folate homeostasis.

Piccianno M.F. Stockstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). As such, normal and neoplastic dividing cells have an absolute folate requirement for DNA replication (1Stockstad E.L.R. Piccianno M.F. Stockstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Disruption of folate biosynthesis with folic acid antagonists (i.e. antifolates) is the pharmacological basis for the antitumor activity of methotrexate (MTX)1 and various antifolates (2Bertino J.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 1993; 11: 5-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because mammalian cells are devoid of folate biosynthesis, they rely on folate vitamin uptake from exogenous sources. Membrane transport of folates and MTX is mediated by several systems (3Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 4-6PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jansen G. Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy.

Members of the MRP family, currently comprising nine genes (i.e. MRP1–9), function as ATP-driven efflux transporters of various natural product anions and acidic charged drug conjugates (14Borst P.

Drug Resistance Updates. 2000; 3: 287-300Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells transfected with MRP1–4 accumulate decreased levels of MTX and consequently display resistance to this drug, particularly upon short term drug exposure (16Hooijberg J.-H. Broxterman H.J. Kool M. Assaraf Y.G. Peters G.J. Noordhuis P. Scheper R.J. Borst P. Pinedo H.M. Jansen G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2532-2535PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kool M. van der Linden de Haas M.

Kruh G.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1934-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles isolated from MRP1- and MRP2-transfected cells exhibit ATP-dependent transport of MTX (16Hooijberg J.-H. Broxterman H.J. Kool M. Assaraf Y.G. Peters G.J. Noordhuis P. Scheper R.J. Borst P. Pinedo H.M. Jansen G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2532-2535PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic analysis of folic acid, leucovorin (LCV; 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate) and MTX transport into MRP1- and MRP3-rich membrane vesicles reveals K m values in the low millimolar range (22Zeng H. Cheng Z.-S. Belinsky M.G. Rea P.A. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7225-7232PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the free intracellular level of folates and antifolates including MTX is determined by the net activities of these influx (i.e. RFC) and efflux (RFC and MRP) transport pathways. CEM-7A is a human leukemia CCRF-CEM subline previously established by gradual deprivation of LCV from the growth medium (23Jansen G. Westerhof G.R. Jarmuszewski M.J.A. Kathmann I. Rijksen G. Schornagel J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18272-18277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in RFC gene amplification (24Drori S. Sprecher H. Shemer G. Jansen G. Goldman I.D. Assaraf Y.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and carrier overexpression (23Jansen G. Westerhof G.R. Jarmuszewski M.J.A. Kathmann I. Rijksen G.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consequently, CEM-7A cells displayed a marked increase in the influx of MTX and LCV accompanied by a comparable increase in the steady-state transmembrane gradient of MTX (23Jansen G. Westerhof G.R. Jarmuszewski M.J.A. Kathmann I. Rijksen G. Schornagel J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18272-18277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, there was no increase in the efflux rate constant for MTX (23Jansen G. Westerhof G.R. Jarmuszewski M.J.A. Kathmann I. Rijksen G. Schornagel J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18272-18277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast with previous studies (25Zhao R. Seither R. Brigle K.E. Sharina I.G. Wang P.J. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21207-21212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) demonstrating that upon transfection of RFC cDNA into murine leukemia cells, there is a marked increase (5–10-fold) in the bi-directional fluxes (i.e. influx and efflux) of MTX with only a small increase in the transmembrane gradient. This discrepancy raised the possibility that the lack of increase in the MTX efflux rate in CEM-7A cells may be due to a second alteration, such as a decrease in MRP-mediated folate efflux activity. To explore this further, studies were undertaken to characterize the bi-directional fluxes and net transport of folic acid in CEM-7A cells. Folic acid has a very low affinity for the RFC (26Jansen G. Mauritz R. Drori S. Sprecher H. Kathmann I. Bunni M.A. Priest D.G. Noordhuis P. Schornagel J.H. Pinedo H.M. Peters G.J. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30189-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, folic acid efflux should be largely mediated by RFC-independent pathways such as MRPs (14Borst P. Oude Elferink R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 15Renes J. de Vries E.G.E. Jansen P.L.M. Muller M.

Accordingly, alterations in folic acid efflux (27Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) should primarily reflect changes in MRP expression and efflux activity. We report here that CEM-7A cells exhibit a high influx and transmembrane gradient for folic acid, LCV, and MTX and that this is accompanied by a 5-fold decrease in the folic acid efflux rate constant. This markedly defective folate export appears to be due to a 95% loss of MRP1 expression, thereby resulting in high transmembrane folate gradients. These results establish for the first time that MRP1 is the primary folate efflux transporter in CEM leukemia cells and that the loss of this major folate efflux route is an efficient means of markedly augmenting cellular folate pools. These findings suggest a functional role for MRP1 in folate homeostasis in mammalian cells. Folic acid, LCV (calcium salt), MTX, probenecid, and N-hydroxysuccinimide were obtained from Sigma.

Calcein AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and MK571 was from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Parental CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 2.3 μm folic acid and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. CEM-7A cells, originally isolated by gradual deprivation of LCV from the growth medium (23Jansen G. Westerhof G.R. Jarmuszewski M.J.A. Kathmann I. Rijksen G. Schornagel J.H. J. Biol.

These cell lines were cultured in folate-free RPMI medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, antibiotics as well as 2 and 5 nm folic acid, respectively, as the sole folate source. The human ovarian carcinoma cell line, 2008, and its sublines stably transduced with MRP1, 2, 3, and 5 cDNAs were kindly provided by Prof. P. Borst and Dr. M. Kool (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), whereas HEK293 cells were used as a control for MRP4 overexpression. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.3 μm folic acid, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Exponentially growing CEM and CEM-7A cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to folic acid-free RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Following 4–6 days of growth in folic acid-deficient medium, cellular growth was arrested. The cells were then seeded (3 × 104/well) in medium (0.15 ml) containing increasing concentrations of either folic acid or LCV ranging from 1 pm to 3 μm in 96-well tissue culture plates. Following 3 days of incubation at 37 °C, viable cell numbers were determined by hemocytometer count using Trypan blue exclusion. EC50 is defined as the folic acid concentration necessary to produce 50% of maximal cell growth. Parental CEM cells and their CEM-7A subline from the mid-logarithmic phase were seeded in 96-well plates (3 × 104/well) in growth medium (0.15 ml/well) containing various concentrations of the antifolates MTX or edatrexate. After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C, cell numbers were determined by hemocytometer count using Trypan blue exclusion. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) is defined as the drug concentration at which cell growth is inhibited by 50% relative to untreated controls. Cells (2 × 107 CEM and 3 × 106 CEM-7A cells) at the mid-log phase of growth were washed three times in an HBS transport buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 140 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH (27Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 1–30 min in HBS (1-ml suspensions) containing 2 μm [3H]MTX, [3H]LCV, or [3H]folic acid. TMQ was included (5 μm) to block [3H]folic acid and dihydrofolic acid reduction by dihydrofolate reductase (27Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transport controls contained a 500-fold excess of unlabeled MTX (1 mm). Transport was stopped by the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold HBS. Then the cell suspension was centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. The final cell pellet was suspended in 0.2 ml of water, and the radioactivity was determined on an Ultima Gold (Packard) liquid scintillation spectrometer. The cells in exponential growth were harvested by centrifugation (750 ×g for 5 min), washed twice with HBS, and adjusted to a density of 5 × 106/ml (CEM-7A cells) or 2 × 107 cells/ml (CEM, CEM/MTX-LF, and CEM/GW70-LF cells) in 10 ml HBS (pH 7.4 at 37 °C) and then transferred to 50-ml capped tubes and placed in a shaking 37 °C water bath. Ten min before the addition of [3H]folic acid, TMQ was added at 5 μm and was present during the entire period of loading and efflux. Following a 20-min loading period, the cells were centrifuged (750 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 11 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) HBS and placed in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. Then 1-ml samples were drawn and transferred to a centrifuge tube containing 10 ml ice-cold HBS. The cells were centrifuged, and the cell pellet was processed for radioactivity. To distinguish between the RFC-mediated and MRP-mediated folic acid efflux routes, the irreversible RFC inhibitor N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of MTX (NHS-MTX, 7.5 μm) (31Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and probenecid (1 mm), which inhibits MRP1 activity (32Versantvoort C.H. Bagrij T. Wright K.A. Twentymen P.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), were added to the transport buffer. Because the influx capacities among the leukemia cell lines differed to a large extent, CEM/MTX-LF, CEM/GW70-LF, CEM-7A, and parental CEM cells were loaded to comparable levels with the following [3H]folic acid concentrations: 2, 2.5, 2.5, and 10 μm, respectively. Folic acid efflux kinetic data were expressed as the log of the ratio of exchangeable intracellular folate at a given transport time to the initial exchangeable intracellular level (27Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To examine the expression of RFC and the various MRPs in parental CEM cells and its various sublines (2 × 107 cells), total cellular proteins were extracted in a buffer (250 μl) containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (60 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μg/ml), and EGTA (1 mm). Following 1 h of incubation on ice, the extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing the fraction of detergent-soluble proteins was collected. The proteins (10–50 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 7.5% (for MRP) or 10% (for RFC) polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and electroblotted onto a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 1% skim milk. The blots were then reacted with the following anti-human MRP monoclonal antibodies (kindly provided by Prof. R. J. Scheper, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at a 1:500 dilution: rat anti-MRP1 (MRP-r1) and mouse anti-MRP2, anti-MRP3, anti-MRP4 (kindly provided by Dr. G. D. Kruh), anti-MRP5, anti-BCRP, and anti-Pgp. To determine RFC expression, the blots were reacted with a polyclonal antiserum (1:700) prepared in mice against a C-terminal hRFC peptide. 2I. Ifergan, I. Meller, J. Issakov, and Y. G. Assaraf, submitted for publication. The blots were then rinsed in the same buffer for 10 min at room temperature and reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rat IgG (1:40,000 dilution; Jackson Immunoresearch Labs, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three 10-min washes in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature, enhanced chemiluminescence detection was assessed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biological Industries). The protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Exponentially growing CEM and CEM-7A cells were adjusted to a density of 106/ml and incubated in growth medium containing 3 nm calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a chromophore that in its intracellular anionic form (i.e.calcein), is exported also by MRP1 (33Feller N. Broxterman H.J. Wahrer D.C. Pinedo H.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Following 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed for fluorescence intensity per cell by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson). Excitation was at 488 nm, and emission was at 525 nm. The autofluorescence intensities of unstained parental CEM and CEM-7A cells were recorded and subtracted from those of calcein AM-stained cells. Folic acid and LCV growth requirements in parental CCRF-CEM cells were compared with those of CEM-7A cells adapted to grow in a medium containing 0.25 nm LCV as the sole folate source (23Jansen G. Westerhof G.R. Jarmuszewski M.J.A. Kathmann I. Rijksen G. Schornagel J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18272-18277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The growth requirements of CEM-7A cells for folic acid and LCV were markedly decreased when compared with parental CEM cells. The LCV and folic acid concentrations necessary to produce 50% maximal growth (EC50) of CEM-7A cells were 10- and 68-fold lower than those obtained with parental CEM cells (TableI). Furthermore, relative to parental CEM cells, CEM 7-A cells were 23- and 25-fold more sensitive to the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors MTX and edatrexate (Table I). Because these results were consistent with an increased capacity of CEM-7A cells to accumulate folates and antifolates, the transport of [3H]LCV (Fig.1 A), [3H]MTX (Fig. 1 B), and [3H]Folic acid (Fig.1 C) was determined in parental CEM and CEM-7A cells. The accumulation of 2 μm tritiated folates and MTX was markedly increased in CEM-7A cells following 20 min of uptake (Fig. 1); CEM-7A cells accumulated 490 ± 50 pmol LCV, 510 ± 130 pmol of MTX, and 30 pmol of folic acid/107 cells, as compared with 19 ± 4 pmol of LCV, 16 ± 3 pmol of MTX, and 2 pmol of folic acid/107 cells, respectively, in parental CEM cells (Table II). Based on the level of MTX tightly bound to dihydrofolate reductase (determined by efflux studies), the net MTX and folic acid pools in CEM-7A cells were 46- and 15-fold higher than in parental CEM cells, respectively (Table II). Consistently, LCV accumulation in CEM 7A cells was 26-fold higher than that in parental CEM cells (Table II). This marked accumulation of folates and MTX was not associated with increased activities of folate-dependent enzymes including dihydrofolate reductase, thymidylate synthase, and folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase in CEM-7A cells (23Jansen G.

The importin α subunit recognizes classical NLS sequences, and the importin β subunit directs the complex to the nuclear pore. Recent work shows that the N-terminal importin β binding (IBB) domain of importin α regulates NLS-cargo binding in the absence of importin β in vitro. To analyze the in vivo functions of the IBB domain, we created a series of mutants in theSaccharomyces cerevisiae importin α protein. These mutants dissect the two functions of the N-terminal IBB domain, importin β binding and auto-inhibition. One of these importin α mutations, A3, decreases auto-inhibitory function without impacting binding to importin β or the importin α export receptor, Cse1p. We used this mutant to show that the auto-inhibitory function is essentialin vivo and to provide evidence that this auto-inhibitory-defective importin α remains bound to NLS-cargo within the nucleus. We propose a model where the auto-inhibitory activity of importin α is required for NLS-cargo release and the subsequent Cse1p-dependent recycling of importin α to the cytoplasm.

In eukaryotes, the nuclear envelope provides an essential barrier that separates the nuclear genome from the intermediary metabolism, signaling systems, and translation machinery of the cytoplasm. Selective bi-directional transport of macromolecules across this nuclear envelope regulates critical cellular processes such as gene expression (1Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Google Scholar, 2Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Google Scholar). All nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules occurs through large proteinaceous structures, called nuclear pore complexes (NPC), 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; CEN, centromeric; DIC, differential interference contrast; 5-FOA, 5-fluoro-orotic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IBB, importin β binding; NLS, nuclear localization signal; RanGTP-RS, RanGTP regenerating system; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate that perforate the nuclear envelope (3Wente S.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1374-1377Google Scholar, 4Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16593-16596Google Scholar). These macromolecular cargoes are specifically targeted to and transported through NPCs by a family of soluble nuclear transport receptors (5Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Google Scholar, 6Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Google Scholar). The small GTPase, Ran, governs the interactions between the nuclear transport receptors and macromolecular cargoes (5Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Google Scholar, 7Kuersten S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 497-503Google Scholar). Import receptors bind cargo in the absence of RanGTP, whereas export receptors bind cargo in a trimeric complex with RanGTP (5Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Google Scholar, 8Izaurralde E. Kutay U. vonKobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Google Scholar). This mode of regulation requires an asymmetric distribution of RanGTP, with more RanGTP in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. To achieve this asymmetry, the Ran regulatory proteins are compartmentalized with the GTPaseactivating protein (RanGAP), which generates RanGDP, in the cytoplasm (9Hopper A.K. Traglia H.M. Dunst R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 309-321Google Scholar) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RCC1), which generates RanGTP, in the nucleus (10Ohtsubo M. Kai R. Furuno N. Sekiguchi T. Sekiguchi M. Hayashida H. Kuma K. Miyata T. Fukushige S. Murotsu T. et al.Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 585-593Google Scholar). The best-characterized nuclear import process occurs via receptor recognition of a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS). This classical NLS is typified by a cluster of basic amino acids (monopartite) or two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10–12 amino acid linker (bipartite) (11Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Google Scholar, 12Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Google Scholar). A heterodimeric import receptor, composed of importins α and β (also known as karyopherin α and β), mediates the nuclear import of proteins that contain a classical NLS (13Görlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-392Google Scholar, 14Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2008-2011Google Scholar, 15Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Google Scholar). Over the last several years many studies have led to a detailed model for the individual steps in the classic nuclear transport cycle (5Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Google Scholar, 16Conti E. Izaurralde E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 310-319Google Scholar): 1) importin α binds to the NLS-cargo to form a trimeric import complex with importin β; 2) this NLS-cargo/importin α/importin β complex is targeted to the NPC by importin β; 3) the complex then translocates into the nucleus where it encounters RanGTP; 4) upon binding RanGTP, importin β dissociates from NLS-cargo/importin α; 5) NLS-cargo is released from importin α; and 6) once cargo is released, importin α is recycled to the cytoplasm by its export receptor, Cse1p/CAS, in a trimeric complex with RanGTP. Thus, the directionality and efficiency of nuclear import of NLS-cargo is accomplished not only by the Ran GTPase cycle but also by an additional series of protein-protein interactions, occurring in defined locations, that result in changes in affinities of the transport receptor for NLS-cargo. Dissociation of the NLS-cargo/importin α/importin β import complex is critical for delivery of NLS-cargo into the nucleus (7Kuersten S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 497-503Google Scholar). RanGTP-mediated dissociation of importin β from the trimeric import complex (17Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Google Scholar) results in an NLS-cargo/importin α complex. Precisely how NLS-cargo is then released from importin α is unknown; however, a recent study shows that Cse1p and the nucleoporin, Nup2p, can facilitate cargo release in vitro (18Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Google Scholar). The release of cargo is important in the subsequent functions of both the cargo (7Kuersten S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 497-503Google Scholar) and importin α (19Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Google Scholar, 20Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Bischoff F.R. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6805-6815Google Scholar, 21Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Google Scholar). For example, a recent study identified a critical cargo, TPX2, of the importin α/β complex whose release from importin α is essential for mitotic progression (22Gruss O.J. Carazo-Salas R.E. Schatz C.A. Guarguaglini G. Kast J. Wilm M. Le Bot N. Vernos I. Karsenti E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 83-93Google Scholar). Although this study did not determine the mechanism of cargo release, it highlighted the importance of understanding how cargoes are efficiently dissociated from importin α within the nucleus to mediate their cellular function. Furthermore, Cse1p, the export receptor for importin α, can only interact with importin α that is not bound to NLS-cargo (19Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Google Scholar, 20Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Bischoff F.R. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6805-6815Google Scholar, 21Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Google Scholar). Thus, for importin α to be recycled to the cytoplasm, it must be dissociated from NLS-cargo within the nucleus. This ensures that importin α is recycled to the cytoplasm only when it has released NLS-cargo; and thereby provides a mechanism for assuring uni-directional transport of NLS-cargo into the nucleus. The convergence of data from structural analyses and in vitro binding studies provides insight into how importin α binds to and regulates interactions with NLS-cargo (17Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Google Scholar, 23Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 301-304Google Scholar, 24Catimel B. Teh T. Fontes M.R. Jennings I.G. Jans D.A. Howlett G.J. Nice E.C. Kobe B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Google Scholar). Domain analysis has shown that importin α has an N-terminal domain that binds importin β (the importin β binding domain or IBB), a central armadillo domain that constitutes the NLS binding pocket, and a C-terminal region that appears to be important for binding to its export receptor Cse1p/CAS (21Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Google Scholar, 27Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6572-6576Google Scholar). Structural studies have extended the knowledge obtained from this domain analysis. Conti et al. (25Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Google Scholar) solved the structure of truncatedSaccharomyces cerevisiae importin α (amino acid residues 89–530) in the presence of an NLS peptide revealing details of how the central armadillo domain of importin α creates specific binding pockets for NLS-cargo. More recently, the structure of full-length mouse importin α, solved in the absence of NLS-cargo, showed that the N-terminal IBB domain of importin α can form an intramolecular interaction with the NLS-binding pocket of importin α (23Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 301-304Google Scholar). This observation suggested that the IBB, in addition to mediating binding to importin β (28Görlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Google Scholar), could have a second role as an auto-inhibitory domain to regulate cargo binding (23Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 301-304Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis,in vitro binding studies have shown that importin α lacking the proposed auto-inhibitory domain (ΔIBB-α), binds more tightly to NLS-cargo than full-length importin α (26Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Google Scholar), and that this auto-inhibition of full-length importin α binding to NLS-cargo is relieved in the presence of importin β (17Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Google Scholar, 26Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Google Scholar). Further analysis of the N-terminal IBB domain of importin α revealed a proposed internal NLS that could serve as an auto-inhibitory sequence to regulate NLS binding through intramolecular competition for the NLS binding site (23Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 301-304Google Scholar, 24Catimel B. Teh T. Fontes M.R. Jennings I.G. Jans D.A. Howlett G.J. Nice E.C. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34189-34198Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest a dual role for the N-terminal domain of importin α in 1) binding to importin β and 2) auto-inhibition of NLS-cargo binding. To analyze the in vivo requirement for of the auto-inhibitory activity of importin α, we created a series of importin α mutants. These mutants dissect the two functions of the N-terminal domain, importin β binding and auto-inhibition. One of these mutants specifically decreases auto-inhibitory function without impacting RanGTP-regulated binding to importin β. Despite normal binding to both importin β and Cse1p, this importin α mutant is unable to function in vivo. These experiments demonstrate that the auto-inhibitory function of importin α is essential in vivo. Our data support the hypothesis that the auto-inhibitory mutant is deficient in NLS-cargo release from importin α and the subsequent recycling of importin α to the cytoplasm. Thus, we propose that the auto-inhibitory function of importin α is necessary for efficient release of NLS-cargo into the nucleus via intramolecular competition of the N-terminal IBB domain at the NLS-binding site.

Open table in a new tab Amino acid substitutions were introduced in the S. cerevisiae importin α (SRP1) coding region using PCR. For most mutants, mutagenesis was carried out on importin α in the bacterial expression vector pProEX-HTb (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mutations were subcloned from the bacterial expression vector into the yeast expression plasmid for in vivo studies. An 88-amino acid N-terminal deletion of importin α, ΔIBB-α (pAC959), was created using the following PCR-based strategy. An importin α plasmid (pAC876) was used as a template to amplify the importin α promoter and ΔIBB-α open reading frame starting at a PCR-introduced ATG start codon preceding leucine residue 89. These products were further amplified by PCR to form ΔIBB-α (amino acid residues 89–542) expressed from the endogenous importin α promoter. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the yeast centromeric (CEN) plasmid pRS315 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). For all constructs generated, the presence of each desired mutation and the absence of any other mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The in vivo function of each of the importin α mutants was tested using a plasmid shuffle technique (33Boeke J.D. Truehart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding each of the importin α mutant proteins were individually transformed into SRP1 deletion cells (ACY324) containing the URA3 SRP1 maintenance plasmid, pAC876. Single transformants were grown in liquid culture to saturation, serially diluted (1:10), and spotted on minimal media plates lacking leucine as a control or on fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) plates. The drug 5-FOA eliminates the URA3 plasmid-encoded wild-type importin α (pAC876) (33Boeke J.D. Truehart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Google Scholar). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown to log phase in appropriate media at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in water and once in PBSMT (100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 15 mm (NH4)2SO4, 75 mm KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100). Cells were subsequently lysed in PBSMT with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin) by glass bead lysis. Equal amounts of total protein (generally 10 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-myc antibody (1:2000 dilution; Oncogene), polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (35Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Google Scholar), anti-GST (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-His (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-Cse1p (1:5000) (36Hood J.K. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35142-35146Google Scholar), or polyclonal anti-importin β antibody (1:5000 dilution) (37Koepp D.M. Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Google Scholar). Assays were performed with purified recombinant S. cerevisiaeproteins Srp1p (importin α), Kap95p (importin β), Cse1p, and Gsp1p (Ran). Full-length His6-importin α (residues 1–542), His6-ΔIBB-importin α (residues 89–530), His6-IBB-GFP (importin α residues 1–88), His6-SV40 (SPKKKRKVEAS)-NLS-GFP, His6-Cse1p, and His6-Ran were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography essentially as described previously (26Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Google Scholar, 38Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Google Scholar, 39Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Google Scholar). Importin β was expressed and purified as described previously (26Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Google Scholar). GST-importin α and GST-A3-importin α were expressed as described elsewhere (40Kunzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out using an ISS PC1 fluorometer fitted with polarization filters. The dissociation constants for the binding of SV40 NLS-GFP and IBB-GFP to importin α were measured essentially as described previously (26Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Google Scholar, 38Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Google Scholar). Briefly, SV40 NLS-GFP or IBB-GFP was diluted in PBS to the desired concentration (∼20 nm) in a total volume of 1 ml in a 1-cm quartz cuvette. Changes in the anisotropy of the GFP fluorophore were monitored as aliquots of the full-length wild-type or mutant importin α proteins were successively added to the assay volume. Changes in anisotropy were used to calculate the fraction of the GFP fluorophore bound, yielding a binding isotherm for the reaction. The binding isotherm was then fit through nonlinear regression to a simple binding equation to obtain dissociation constants. All K d values were calculated as detailed athttp://www.biochem.emory.edu/Hodel/Research/BindingCurves/fitting_curves.htm. The dissociation constant for importin α binding to importin β was measured using a competition assay (41Wang Z.X. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 111-114Google Scholar) with IBB-GFP. The assay was carried out as described above except changes in the anisotropy of IBB-GFP were monitored in the presence of increasing amounts of importin β. This yielded a dissociation constant for IBB-GFP binding to importin β. To measure the binding of importin α to importin β, the binding of IBB-GFP was examined in the presence of three different concentrations of full-length wild-type or mutant importin α. The K d values for wild-type and mutant importin α proteins binding to importin β were determined by fitting the resulting binding curves to an equation for the fraction of IBB-GFP bound as a function of K d for IBB,K i for the full-length importin α protein, the total IBB-GFP concentration, the total importin β concentration, and the total concentration of the full-length importin α protein. Binding energies were calculated using ΔG =RT ln K d, where RT = −0.59 kcal/mol. As previously described (26Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Google Scholar), importin β was covalently coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Approximately 0.2 mg/ml purified full-length wild-type or full-length mutant importin α or ΔIBB-α was incubated with 0.5 ml of importin β-coupled beads in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer, and beads were either eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 m NaCl) or incubated with a RanGTP-RS as described previously (39Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant Ran was incubated with a RanGTP-RS (20 units of acetate kinase, 10 mm GTP, and 10 mm sodium acetyl phosphate) for 15 min on ice before addition to the beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The supernatants from each reaction were subsequently saved as the eluant fractions. The beads were washed twice with binding buffer before elution with elution buffer. The unbound (2% of total unbound), bound (2% of total bound), and eluant (2% of total eluant) fractions were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). GST-importin α proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and tested for interaction with Cse1p essentially as described previously (40Kunzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The GST-importin α-conjugated beads were washed five times with PBSMT before incubation with purified Cse1p (10 μg) and Gsp1p (20 μg) in the presence or absence of the RanGTP-RS in a total volume of 500 μl. The bound (50% of total bound) fractions were resolved on a 8% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted as described. For quantification, immunoblots were analyzed using a fluorescence imager and Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described elsewhere (37Koepp D.M. Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Google Scholar) with the following conditions. The myc antibody was used at 1:100 dilution, and the GFP antibody was used at 1:2000 for incubation with cells overnight at 4 °C. The Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:1000 dilution) was incubated with cells for 2 h at room temperature. DNA was stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml). Samples were viewed through a Texas Red-optimized filter (Chroma Technology) using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. Direct fluorescence microscopy was used to localize GFP fusion proteins in live cells. For all experiments, cells were stained with DAPI to visualize the DNA and confirm the location of the nucleus. The localization of the fusion proteins was monitored by directly viewing the GFP signal in living cells through a GFP-optimized filter as described for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Agarose-conjugated anti-myc antibody beads (9E-10 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to immunoprecipitate importin α-myc proteins. Wild-type cells (ACY192) expressing importin α-myc (pAC891) or A3-importin α-myc (pAC894) from the endogenous SRP1promoter were transformed with galactose-inducible plasmids encoding GFP (pAC1042) alone or a bipartite NLS (KRTADGSEFESPKKKRKVE)-GFP (pAC1045) (38Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Google Scholar). Cells were grown to early-log phase in synthetic media containing 2% raffinose, induced with 2% galactose, and incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. Lysates were prepared as described for immunoblot analysis. Six milligrams of total protein lysate was incubated with myc antibody-coupled agarose beads (10 μl of volume of packed beads) for 5 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of a RanGTP-RS. Beads were washed twice in PBSMT and once in PBSM before elution with 30 μl of sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 250 mm dithiothreitol, 5% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 25% glycerol). The bound (50% of total bound) fractions were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted as described. For quantification, immunoblots were analyzed using a fluorescence imager and Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). Previous structural and in vitro analyses identified an auto-inhibitory sequence within the N-terminal IBB domain of importin α (23Kobe B. Nat. Struct.

It was originally identified by expression library screening with a monoclonal antibody against a fraction of DNA-binding nuclear proteins of Drosophila melanogaster (1James T.C. Elgin S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3862-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The chromosomal rearrangement of euchromatic genes adjacent to the heterochromatic regions results in gene silencing, designated “position effect variegation.” Mutations in a Drosophilasuppressor of the variegation 2-5 gene encoding HP1 result in dosage-dependent dominant suppression of position effect variegation (2Eissenberg J.C.

Genetics. 1992; 131: 345-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its mutation affects the segregation of chromosomes (4Kellum R. Alberts B.M. J.

These results, in addition to the finding that HP1 physically interacts with suv39h1, a histone methyltransferase responsible for the methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (23Aagaard L. Laible G.

These data collectively implicate an additional molecular mechanism supporting the histone code hypothesis that differential and combinatorial post-translational modifications of the N-terminal tail of histone, including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, epigenetically mark the chromosomal state as open or closed for transcriptional activity (28Jenuwein T.

These data suggest that LANA maintains the KSHV genome, not only by tethering the viral episome to host chromosomes during host cell mitosis but also by actively participating in the DNA replication of the viral genome, possibly through interactions with cellular replication machinery, such as ORCs.

In this report, we speculate on the functional association between LANA and HP1, and the consequent effects on transcriptional activity, subnuclear structure targeting, and latent replication activity. Plasmids pcDNA3 LANA, pFLAG-CMV2 LANA, pEBG LANA, and their derivatives encoding deletion mutants of LANA were described previously (45Lim C. Sohn H. Lee D. Gwack Y. Choe J. J.

Samples of cDNA corresponding to specific regions of LANA were amplified from pcDNA3 LANA by PCR, with appropriate sets of primers, and inserted into CMV G4 (45Lim C. Sohn H. Lee D. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10320-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to express GAL4 DBD-fused proteins in mammalian cells. The pGEX2T hHP1α plasmid (60Seeler J.-S. Marchio A. Sitterlin D. Transy C. Dejean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7316-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. A. Dejean (Institut Pasteur, France). pGEX2T mHP1α, mHP1β, and mHP1γ (61Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You J. Abdelghani M.O. Khechumian R. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6385-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) were generously supplied by Dr. R. Losson (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, France). A BamHI/EcoRI fragment of pGEX2T hHP1α was inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and the BglII/EcoRI sites of pEGFP C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). ABamHI/NotI fragment of pcDNA3 hHP1α was inserted in the corresponding sites of pEBG to express glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused hHP1α in mammalian cells. cDNAs corresponding to hHP1α, mHP1β, and mHP1γ were amplified by PCR with appropriate sets of primers and inserted into theEcoRI/XhoI site of pME18S (62Shiio Y. Yamamoto T. Yamaguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5206-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to express FLAG-tagged proteins in mammalian cells. Deletion mutants of hHP1α were constructed using similar procedures. pFR-luc was purchased from Stratagene (San Diego, CA). A BamHI fragment of pFR-luc containing five tandem GAL4-DBD-binding sites was inserted into theBglII site of the pGL3 promoter (Promega, Madison, WI), and the resulting construct was designated pGx5SV-luc. pG4M2-luc was a gift from Dr. H. G. Stunnenberg (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The p4TR-luc construct was described earlier (45Lim C. Sohn H. Lee D. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10320-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 293T cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (51Lim C. Sohn H. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The human cervical cancer cell line, C33A, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using the calcium phosphate method. The quantity of total DNA used in transfection was kept constant by including an appropriate blank vector. The transient reporter assay was performed as described in a previous report (51Lim C. Sohn H. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 293T cells in 100-mm dishes were cotransfected with specific combinations of expression vectors. After ∼36 h of transfection, cells were harvested and pellets stored at −70 °C before use. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, with brief sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. For coimmunoprecipitation, the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. Following the addition of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), the supernatant was further incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. For the GST pull-down assay, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were washed three times in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS gel loading buffer. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, and detected using ECLTM (AmershamBiosciences). The in vitro binding assay was performed as described previously (45Lim C. Sohn H. Lee D. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10320-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 293T cells grown on coverslips were cotransfected with the specified combinations of expression vectors. At ∼24 h post-transfection, cells were either fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 10 min or 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 25 min. LANA was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-LANA serum (a gift from Dr. J. Jung, Harvard Medical School) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). FLAG-tagged proteins were observed using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield® (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Pascal, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (63Izumi M. Yanagi K.-I. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.-Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 293T cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with expression vectors containing GAL4 DBD fusion proteins and harvested ∼36 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mmNaF) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 3 min, soluble fractions extracted by Triton X-100 were further clarified by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 15 min. Triton-extracted nuclei were washed once in cytoskeleton buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and subjected to chromatin digestion in the above buffer containing 1000 units/ml DNase I (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min. DNase I-extractable and -resistant proteins were separated by low speed centrifugation. A schematic representation of subcellular fractionation is depicted in Fig. 5 A. GAL4 DBD fusion proteins were detected with anti-GAL4 DBD monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The transient replication assay was performed as described previously (45Lim C. Sohn H. Lee D. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10320-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). C33A cells on 100-mm dishes were cotransfected with 2 μg of p4TR-luc, 2 μg of pGL2-basic as an internal control, and 8 μg of FLAG-CMV2 derivatives expressing FLAG-tagged LANA mutants. At ∼36 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and diluted into fresh media. Cells were harvested 96 h after transfection, and low molecular weight DNA was extracted by the Hirt lysis method (64Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Supernatants were successively extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and chloroform. Ethanol-precipitated DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of distilled water containing RNase. DpnI and Alw44I were used to digest unreplicated DNA and linearize pGL2-basic derivatives, respectively. DpnI digestion was confirmed by monitoring the complete digestion of the unreplicated internal control, pGL2-basic. Southern blot hybridization and detection of plasmids containing the luciferase gene were performed as described previously (45Lim C. Sohn H. Lee D. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10320-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Earlier reports (50Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9637-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 59Schwam D.R. Luciano R.L. Mahajan S.S. Wong L. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) suggest that LANA functions as a transcriptional repressor when tethered to constitutively active promoters via a heterologous DNA-binding domain. However, the domain of LANA responsible for transcriptional repression remains to be conclusively identified. Schwam et al. (59Schwam D.R. Luciano R.L. Mahajan S.S. Wong L. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both the N and C termini of LANA contain a transcriptional repression domain, in contrast to reports by Krithivas et al. (50Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9637-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) that only the N terminus of LANA mediates transcriptional repression, possibly via interactions with the mSin3 corepressor complex. Because different cell lines and reporters were employed in the two sets of experiments, it is possible that the cellular or promoter context affected the transcriptional activity of LANA. Accordingly, we examined the transcriptional activity of full-length LANA and derivatives fused to GAL4 DBD in a transient reporter assay, using two cell lines and four different reporters containing tandem repeats of GAL4 DBD-binding sites. The reporters include pFR-luc, pG4M2-luc, pGx5SV-luc, and pGal4TK-luc containing the basic promoter element (TATA box), adenovirus major late promoter, SV40 promoter, and thymidine kinase promoter downstream of the tandem GAL4 DBD-binding sites, respectively. As shown in Fig.1 A, both full-length and N-terminal LANA corresponding to amino acids 1–340 fused to GAL4 DBD displayed comparable transcriptional repressor activity on all reporters tested in transiently transfected 293T cells. However, transcriptional repression by C-terminal LANA corresponding to amino acids 950–1162 fused to GAL4 DBD was promoter-specific; pG4M2-luc was slightly repressed, and pGX5SV-luc was not affected. LANA and deletion mutants not fused to GAL4 DBD included in the same reporter assay did not affect the transcriptional activity of reporters (data not shown). Therefore, it seems unlikely that the observed promoter specificity is because of the effect of C-terminal LANA itself on transcription from each promoter independently of GAL4 DBD sites. Similar transient reporter assays were performed in C33A cells (Fig. 1 B). Unexpectedly, the N terminus of LANA fused to GAL4 DBD did not display transcriptional repression activity on any of the reporters tested. In contrast, the C terminus of LANA fused to GAL4 DBD repressed transcriptional activity with similar promoter specificity as that observed in 293T cells. To determine the transcriptional repression domain within the C terminus of LANA, we constructed a series of deletion mutants fused to GAL4 DBD (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 1 D, the central region of the C terminus is responsible for transcriptional repression in both cell lines. The inability of LANA CΔ161 and LANA C1107 fused to GAL4 DBD to repress transcription was not due to lower expression levels in transfected cells, as verified by Western blotting with anti-GAL4 DBD antibody (data not shown). The results collectively suggest that both the N and C termini of LANA display cell type- and promoter-specific transcriptional repression activity. KSH"

In NG108 neuronal cells, activated EphB2 recruits p120RasGAP, in a fashion that is associated with down-regulation of the Ras-Erk mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway and neurite retraction. To pursue the role of the Ras-MAPK pathway in EphB2-mediated growth cone collapse, and to explore the biochemical and biological functions of Eph receptors, we sought to re-engineer the signaling properties of EphB2 by manipulating its regulatory motifs and SH2 binding sites. An EphB2 mutant that retained juxtamembrane (JM) RasGAP binding sites but incorporated a Grb2 binding motif at an alternate RasGAP binding site within the kinase domain had little effect on basal Erk MAPK activation. In contrast, elimination of all RasGAP binding sites, accompanied by the addition of a Grb2 binding site within the kinase domain, led to an increase in phospho-Erk levels in NG108 cells following ephrin-B1 stimulation. Functional assays indicated a correlation between neurite retraction and the ability of the EphB2 mutants to down-regulate Ras-Erk MAPK signaling. These data suggest that EphB2 can be designed to repress, stabilize, or activate the Ras-Erk MAPK pathway by the manipulation of RasGAP and Grb2 SH2 domain binding sites and support the notion that Erk MAPK regulation plays a significant role in axon guidance. The behavior of EphB2 variants with mutations in the JM region and kinase domains suggests an intricate pattern of regulation and target recognition by Eph receptors.

Ligand-induced autophosphorylation in the activation segment of the kinase domain, as well as phosphorylation of juxtamembrane (JM) tyrosines in RTKs such as Eph receptors, induce conformational changes that stimulate the activity of the kinase domain (4Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Google Scholar, 5Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Google Scholar, 6Wybenga-Groot L.E. Baskin B. Ong S.H. Tong J. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Cell. 2001; 106: 745-757Google Scholar). Furthermore, receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, usually within non-catalytic sequences flanking the kinase domain, creates docking sites for proteins with SH2 or PTB domains, leading to the recruitment of cytoplasmic targets that regulate downstream signaling (3Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047Google Scholar, 7Pawson T. Gish G.D. Nash P. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 504-511Google Scholar). This scheme is evident in the ability of RTKs to recruit negative or positive regulators of the Ras GTPase, such as the p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) or Grb2 (8Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Google Scholar). RasGAP, which stimulates the hydrolysis of Ras-bound GTP, is a modular polypeptide with a C-terminal catalytic domain that down-regulates Ras, linked to two SH2 domains (surrounding an SH3 domain) at the N terminus (9Hu K.Q. Settleman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 473-483Google Scholar, 10Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar). In contrast, Grb2 is an adaptor comprised of a central SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains that bind to targets with proline-rich motifs (11Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Google Scholar, 12Matuoka K. Shibata M. Yamakawa A. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, through recruitment of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos1, Grb2 directs phosphotyrosine-induced exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras, thereby stimulating the Erk MAPK pathway (3Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047Google Scholar). RasGAP and Grb2 are therefore SH2-containing proteins with opposing effects on the state of Ras activation, and data from both invertebrate and mammalian systems suggest that RTKs potentially employ Grb2 and RasGAP in combination to achieve sophisticated regulation of the Ras signaling pathway (14Cleghon V.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2481-2488Google Scholar). SH2 domains generally bind short phosphotyrosine-containing peptide sequences but differ in their ability to recognize residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (7Pawson T. Gish G.D. Nash P.

King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar). For example, the Grb2 SH2 domain binds preferentially to pTyr-X-Asn motifs (17Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar), whereas the RasGAP SH2 domains binds optimally to pTyr-X-X-Pro motifs (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar). We have employed these observations as the basis to explore signaling by EphB2, a member of the predominant family of mammalian RTKs. Eph receptors are activated by their association with cell surface ligands, ephrins, and regulate biological events involving cell-cell interactions, including axon guidance, boundary formation, neural crest migration, angiogenesis, and synaptic function (19Adams R.H. Klein R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 183-188Google Scholar, 20Cheng N. Brantley D.M. Chen J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 75-85Google Scholar, 21Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Google Scholar). In their cytoplasmic regions, Eph receptors have a JM sequence, followed by the kinase domain, a SAM domain, and a C-terminal PDZ domain binding motif. Activated receptors become phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues, including a tyrosine in the activation loop of the kinase domain and two conserved tyrosines in the JM region that regulate kinase activity (24Binns K.L. Taylor P.P. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Holland S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4791-4805Google Scholar, 25Kalo M.S. Pasquale E.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14396-14408Google Scholar, 26Kalo M.S. Yu H.H.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 177-187Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tyrosines in the JM region and elsewhere can then directly engage cytoplasmic targets. In addition, the receptor can potentially phosphorylate docking proteins, such as p62Dok-1, with the ability to engage signaling proteins (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar). Of interest, in contrast to other RTKs, which generally stimulate Ras, activation of EphB2 (28Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Google Scholar) and EphA2 (29Miao H. Wei B.R. Peehl D.M. Li Q. Alexandrou T. Schelling J.R. Rhim J.S. Sedor J.R. Burnett E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 527-530Google Scholar) down-regulates the Ras-MAPK pathway in specific mammalian cell types (i.e. neuronal and endothelial cells). In the context of EphB2, RasGAP recruitment appears to inhibit Ras activation, which then leads to down-regulation of the MAPK pathway (28Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Google Scholar). Interfering with Ras down-regulation, either by expression of a dominant-negative form of RasGAP or a constitutively activated Ras variant, suppresses the ability of ephrin-B1 to induce neurite retraction in NG108 neuronal cells expressing EphB2. In this study, we demonstrate that mutating the previously identified RasGAP binding sites in the EphB2 JM region is not sufficient to switch the EphB2 signal from down-regulation to up-regulation of the MAPK signaling. We identify a novel binding site for RasGAP and show that introduction of a Grb2 binding sequence in place of this second RasGAP binding site within the kinase domain stabilizes phospho-Erk levels in ephrin-B1-stimulated cells. Complete abrogation of RasGAP binding coupled with recruitment of Grb2, leads to an up-regulation of phospho-Erk, and a block in the ability of EphB2 to induce neurite retraction. These results demonstrate that it is possible to rewire RTK signaling to the Ras-MAPK pathway by the rational design of mutant receptors with modified sites for protein-protein interactions. Our results are consistent with an intricate regulation of EphB2 through the combined actions of the JM region and kinase domain. Full-length murine EphB2 cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of EphB2 was performed using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). Green fluorescent protein-tagged EphB2 (EphB2-GFP) was constructed by inserting the whole length of GFP cDNA into ApaI site in the C-terminal of EphB2 between Arg983 and Ala984. For glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion constructs, cDNA sequences corresponding to the mouse Grb2 SH2 domain (residues 79–160) and human RasGAP SH2 domain (residues 169–470) were cloned into pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed as GST fusion proteins. For immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, anti-EphB2 (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar, 30Henkemeyer M. Orioli D. Henderson J.T. Saxton T.M. Roder J. Pawson T. Klein R. Cell. 1996; 86: 35-46Google Scholar) and anti-HA mouse monoclonal (12CA5) (31Tong J. Killeen M. Steven R. Binns K.L. Culotti J. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40917-40925Google Scholar) antibodies have been described previously. Anti-Grb2 and anti-phospho-Erk1/2 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Cell Signaling Technologies, respectively. Other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. NG108-15 (NG108) cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines in NG108 cells were produced as previously described (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar, 28Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Google Scholar). Briefly, parental NG108 cells were transfected with 20 μg of cDNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Google Scholar). Cells were then grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) to select stable transfectants. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. 20 μg of plasmid DNA was used to transfect 2 × 106 HEK-293 cells/100-mm plate by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Google Scholar). Control cells were treated in the same way but with no DNA or with expression vector DNA only. Stimulation of EphB2-expressing cells was carried out as previously described (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar, 28Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Google Scholar) with 2 μg/ml aggregated Ephrin-B1Fc. For Erk activity studies, EphB2 cells were seeded into six-well plates 24 h prior to stimulation at 3 × 105 cells/well. Unless otherwise indicated, NG108 cells were serum-starved overnight in DMEM containing 1× hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine. For Erk and anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-pTyr) Western blots, cells were stimulated with Ephrin-B1Fc as indicated and lysed directly in 2× SDS loading buffer. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and routinely lysed in PLC lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaPPi, 100 mmNaF, 1 mm vanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) as previous described (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar, 30Henkemeyer M. Orioli D. Henderson J.T. Saxton T.M. Roder J. Pawson T. Klein R. Cell. 1996; 86: 35-46Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of cleared lysates were determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins were immunoprecipitated for 1–2 h at 4 °C, and beads were routinely washed three times in HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin for anti-phosphotyrosine blots or 5% skimmed milk for other blots, and immunoblotted as per standard protocols. Primary antibodies were detected with anti-mouse- or protein-A-horseradish peroxidase followed by treatment with Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Pierce). For the GST fusion protein pull-down experiment, pre-bound GST fusion protein beads (around 6 μg of protein/ml) were used to pull down proteins from whole cell lysates in PLC lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h and washed three times in HNTG buffer. Peptide arrays were constructed according to the Spots-synthesis method as previously described (33Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M. Nature. 2001; 414: 514-521Google Scholar). Acid-hardened cellulose membranes pre-derivatized with polyethylene glycol (AbiMed, Langfield, Germany) were spotted with a grid of Fmoc β-alanine (Bachem) prior to peptide synthesis. Standard Fmoc chemistry was used throughout. Fmoc-protected and -activated amino acids were spotted in high density 24- × 18-spot arrays on 130- × 90-mm membranes using an AbiMed ASP422 robot. All washing, Fmoc, and side-chain deprotection steps were done manually in polypropylene containers. The amino acids were used at a concentration of 0.25m and were twice spotted at a volume of 0.2 μl for each coupling reaction. The peptides covering all tyrosine residues in the EphB2 intracellular region were synthesized (see sequence in Fig. 3 below). Following peptide synthesis and side-chain deprotection, membranes were blocked overnight in 5% skim milk. Purified GST or GST fusion proteins were added at 0.1 μm in TBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times in TBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibody for 1 h in TBS. Detection was by SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Wild type and mutant (JXGrb2) forms of EphB2 were immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected NG108 cells, radiolabeled by in vitro kinase assay with [γ-32P]ATP, and digested with trypsin. The digests were resolved in two dimensions on 100-μm × 20-cm × 20-cm thin-layer cellulose plates by electrophoresis followed by ascending chromatography. Electrophoresis was performed at pH 1.9 in 50:156:1794 88% formic acid/glacial acetic acid/water for 40 min at 1000 V on a Hunter HTLE-7000 thin layer electrophoresis system, and ascending chromatography was carried out in 750:500:150:600n-butanol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/water. The plates were exposed to x-ray film for indicated days at −70 °C. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with wild type EphB2, EphB2-EE, KINGrb2, KIN667F, or JXEE-KINGrb2 in the addition of pFA-Elk1 and pFR-Luciferase reporter constructs (Stratagene PathDetect® system), and pSV2-β-galactosidase. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp.). The luciferase activity in lysates was determined by a microplate luminometer LB 96V (EG&G Berthold, Germany) and Luciferin reagent (Promega Corp.). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as per the standard protocol (34Sambrook F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). NG108 cells were transiently transfected by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with wild type or mutant EphB2-GFP. After 20 h, the transfected NG108 cells were differentiated by using 1 mm N 6,O 2-dibutyryladenosine 3′:5′-cycle monophosphate (Sigma) for 5 h. Cells with neurite length of more than two times their cell body length were stimulated with 2 μg/ml clustered ephrin-B1Fc and imaged every 1 min for 20 min on an inverted Leica DM IRB fluorescence microscope equipped with OpenLab software (Improvision Co., UK). We have previously found that activation of ectopically expressed EphB2 in NG108 neuronal cells leads to a down-regulation of the Ras-MAPK pathway, in a fashion that is attenuated by a dominant negative RasGAP polypeptide (33Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M. Nature. 2001; 414: 514-521Google Scholar). To explore whether this is a more general and physiological event, we have investigated the phosphorylation of Erk MAPK in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) or MEFs derived from mouse embryos homozygous for a null mutation in the gene for RasGAP. Stimulation of wild type MEFs with clustered Fc-ephrin-A1 to activate EphA2 endogenously expressed in these fibroblasts led to down-regulation of Erk phosphorylation, whereas no change in Erk phosphorylation was detected in RasGAP −/− cells. These data suggest that the ability of endogenous Eph receptors to down-regulate the Erk MAPK pathway depends on the expression of RasGAP (Fig. 1). To explore the determinants that regulate the coupling of Eph receptors to RasGAP, and the Ras-MAPK pathway, we turned to NG108 neuronal cells induced to express EphB2. Ephrin-B1 stimulation results in phosphorylation of EphB2 tyrosine residues, including two conserved JM tyrosines (Y604IDPFTY610EDP) (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar, 25Kalo M.S. Pasquale E.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14396-14408Google Scholar). In their unphosphorylated form, these JM tyrosines suppress Eph kinase activity (6Wybenga-Groot L.E. Baskin B. Ong S.H. Tong J. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Cell. 2001; 106: 745-757Google Scholar, 24Binns K.L. Taylor P.P. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Holland S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4791-4805Google Scholar, 27Zisch A.H. Pazzagli C. Freeman A.L. Schneller M. Hadman M. Smith J.W. Ruoslahti E. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 177-187Google Scholar); this inhibition is relieved by autophosphorylation of the JM motifs, which can subsequently serve as docking sites for SH2 domain containing proteins, including RasGAP (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar). RasGAP recruitment to EphB2 is associated with the down-regulation of Erk MAPK activity and may play a significant role in the axon guidance function of EphB2 (28Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Google Scholar). We hypothesized that substitution of the RasGAP SH2 domain binding sites in the JM region with known Grb2 binding motifs, the sequence Y604VNVFTY610VNV (see Fig. 5 A), might lead to recruitment of Grb2 to the JM region of the resulting JXGrb2 mutant EphB2 and induce up-regulation of MAPK activity, an effect opposite to that of wild type (WT) EphB2. To study the Erk MAPK response to the EphB2 mutant JXGrb2, we derived an NG108-15 (NG108) cell line stably expressing this mutant. The parental NG108 cells do not express detectable EphB2 and do not respond to ephrin-B1 stimulation. In contrast, ephrin-B1 stimulation of NG-EphB2 cells, which stably express wild type EphB2 receptor, leads to an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of EphB2 and cellular proteins such as p62Dok-1 and induces neurite retraction (18Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Google Scholar) and down-regulation of MAPK activity (28Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Google Scholar). Similarly, ephrin-B1 stimulation of cells expressing JXGrb2 caused an increase in cellular tyrosine phosphorylation, although it was attenuated relative to WT EphB2 (Fig. 2 A). We also observed ligand-dependent association of the mutant receptor with RasGAP in NG108 cells expressing JXGrb2 (Fig.2 C), albeit to a lesser extent than WT EphB2, and Erk1/2 dephosphorylation (Fig. 2 B) in a manner similar to cells expressing WT receptor. Interestingly, we were unable to detect association of either the WT or JXGrb2 EphB2 with Grb2 following ephrin-B1 stimulation (Fig. 2 C). The observation that the JXGrb2 Eph receptor retains the ability to recruit RasGAP raises the possibility that tyrosine residues at the mutated Y604VNVFTY610VNV motif in JXGrb2 may still be able to preferentially recruit RasGAP instead of Grb2, or the mutant receptor could directly or indirectly associate with RasGAP at other sites. In addition, the JM tyrosine residues in the JXGrb2 mutant may not be phosphorylated upon ephrin-B1 stimulation, and therefore binding sites for the Grb2 SH2 domain may never be generated in the JXGrb2 mutant. To test the first hypothesis, arrays of tyrosine-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides encompassing all tyrosine residues in the intracellular EphB2 region were synthesized directly on a membrane and probed with a GST-Grb2 SH2 domain fusion protein (Fig.3 A). As controls, a YVNV-containing phosphopeptide from Shc, which binds the Grb2 SH2 domain, and a YSVP-containing phosphopeptide from p190 RhoGAP, which binds the RasGAP SH2 domains, were included. The GST-Grb2 SH2 fusion protein bound specifically to the phosphorylated Shc peptide and to the JXGrb2 and JX′Grb2 peptides (Fig.3 A) as anticipated but not to their non-phosphorylated counterparts. A GST fusion protein containing both RasGAP SH2 domains associated with the p190 RhoGAP phosphopeptide but was unable to associate with either the JXGrb2 or JX′Grb2peptide (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that the mutated Y604VNVFTY610VNV motif in JXGrb2should bind to Grb2 and not RasGAP, if it were accessible and phosphorylated after ephrin-B1 stimulation. To investigate whether the mutated tyrosine sites in JXGrb2 were indeed phosphorylated, WT EphB2 and mutated JXGrb2 were radiolabeled by using [γ-32P]ATP in an in vitro kinase assay, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. The resulting maps indicated that the most prominent phosphopeptide present in WT EphB2, likely corresponding to the phosphorylated JM site (24Binns K.L. Taylor P.P. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Holland S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4791-4805Google Scholar, 25Kalo M.S. Pasquale E.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14396-14408Google Scholar), is missing from the mutant JXGrb2 (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results indicate that the JXGrb2 mutant retains an ability to down-regulate Erk1/2 activity, and to recruit RasGAP, suggesting the presence of a secondary binding site for RasGAP. In addition, the JXGrb2 mutant was unable to recruit Grb2, apparently due to a lack of phosphorylation at the modified JM region. Because the JXGrb2 mutant receptor was still activated by ephrin-B1 stimulation, these results indicate that mutation of the residues C-terminal to the JM tyrosines interferes with both the inhibitory activity of the JM sequence as well as its ability to become phosphorylated upon receptor activation. To identify other potential RasGAP binding sites in mutant EphB2, we screened a peptide array encompassing all the intracellular phosphopeptides of EphB2 for alternative sites of interaction with a GST fusion protein containing both RasGAP SH2 domains. This revealed another possible RasGAP SH2 binding site, Tyr667, in the EphB2 kinase domain (Fig. 3 A). Tyr667 has been previously identified as a phosphorylation site in vivo (25Kalo M.S. Pasquale E.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14396-14408Google Scholar) and is on the surface of the kinase domain (6Wybenga-Groot L.E. Baskin B. Ong S.H. Tong J. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Cell. 2001; 106: 745-757Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that the Tyr667site might be a suitable candidate site for introducing an ectopic Grb2-binding motif in EphB2. To test whether such a mutant EphB2 (KINGrb2), engineered to contain the Grb2-binding motif at this site (Y667VNV), can be phosphorylated, we expressed a GST fusion protein containing the intracellular domain of the KINGrb2 EphB2 mutant. The GST-KINGrb2 fusion protein became tyrosine-phosphorylated, as detected by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). The GST-KINGrb2 protein was subsequently digested and analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry to map the phosphorylation sites. Ion peaks corresponding to the Tyr667-containing phosphopeptide (SGpY667VNVRQ) were identified by sequencing and, thus, confirmed the specific phosphorylation of Tyr667in mutant KINGrb2 (data not shown). These results suggest that the KINGrb2 binding site can be phosphorylatedin vitro and may thus be able to recruit Grb2 in vivo. To test whether the mutant KINGrb2 receptor can bind to Grb2 and thereby influence Erk MAPK activity in vivo, we made an NG108 cell line stably expressing KINGrb2. Stimulation of cells expressing WT or KINGrb2 EphB2 caused an increase in cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in both cases; the KINGrb2 receptor itself was inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated, although to a lesser extent than WT (Fig.4, A and C). However, although we observed down-regulation of MAPK activity in WT EphB2 cells, cells expressing KINGrb2 retained a constant level of phosphorylated Erk1/2 over time (Fig. 4 B).

It is thought to have a role in neural development for its temporal profile of expression during murine cerebellar development, but its precise role remains unknown. Here we applied the proteomic approach to search for protein targets that interact with V-1. The V-1 cDNA attached with a tandem affinity purification tag was expressed in the cultured 293T cells, and the protein complex formed within the cells were captured and characterized by mass spectrometry. We detected two polypeptides specifically associated with V-1, which were identified as the α and β subunits of the capping protein (CP, alternatively called CapZ or β-actinin). CP regulates actin polymerization by capping the barbed end of the actin filament. The V-1·CP complex was detected not only in cultured cells transfected with the V-1 cDNA but also endogenously in cells as well as in murine cerebellar extracts. An analysis of the V-1/CP interaction by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy showed that V-1 formed a stable complex with the CP heterodimer with a dissociation constant of 1.2 × 10−7m and a molecular stoichiometry of ∼1:1. In addition, V-1 inhibited the CP-regulated actin polymerization in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, our results suggest that V-1 is a novel component that regulates the dynamics of actin polymerization by interacting with CP and thereby participates in a variety of cellular processes such as actin-driven cell movements and motility during neuronal development.

The V-1 protein was originally identified in the murine cerebellum as one of the proteins expressed significantly at the initial stage of postnatal development (1Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T. Isobe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 615-620Google Scholar), particularly in the regions where synaptic formation and neuronal migration occur actively during neurogenesis (2Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M.

For example, Yamakuni et al. (5Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y. Yamamoto H. Kunikata-Sumitomo M. Minegishi A. Kubota M. Ito M. Konishi S. J. Biol.

Thus, both of these studies (5Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y. Yamamoto H. Kunikata-Sumitomo M. Minegishi A. Kubota M. Ito M. Konishi S. J. Biol.

However, no biological function has been attributed to V-1 in the cytoplasm in which this molecule predominantly resides within the cells and tissues (5Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y.

Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar) and mass spectrometry (MS). Following this strategy, we identified capping protein (CP) as a V-1-binding protein. We confirmed the existence of the V-1·CP complex not only in cultured cells transfected with the TAP-tagged V-1 but also endogenously in cells and rat cerebellar extracts. Furthermore, we found that V-1 inhibited the CP-regulated actin polymerization. On the basis of these results, the possible role of V-1 in neuronal development is discussed.DISCUSSIONCP is one of the F-actin-binding proteins that caps the barbed end of actin filaments and nucleates the actin polymerization in a Ca2+-independent (22Maruyama K.

This activity is thought to be functionally significant, because the actin-based movement of Dictyostelium is proportional to the expression level of CP (33Hug C. Jay P.Y. Reddy I. McNally J.G. Bridgman P.C. Elson E.L. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 591-600Google Scholar) and because CP is essential for the in vitro reconstitution of the cell movement (34Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Google Scholar, 35Pantaloni D. Boujemaa R. Didry D. Gounon P. Carlier M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 385-391Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that the V-1 protein forms a stable stoichiometric complex with CP in vitro as well as in vivo (Figs. 2 and 3) and inhibits the CP-mediated nucleation of actin polymerization. Therefore, we assume that V-1 participates in the regulation of actin dynamics in the cells via the interaction with CP.Our strategy to identify the V-1-interacting molecules was based on the tandem affinity purification of the V-1 complex with a TAP tag followed by protein identification by mass spectrometry. The TAP method was originally developed to analyze interactions among yeast proteins (12Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar). We constructed a mammalian expression vector for the TAP method and applied it to the mammalian 293T cell line. Even though the V-1 protein is a rather minor cellular component and a transient expression system was used for the assay, the method enabled us to isolate a sufficient amount of the V-1·CP complex for characterization by nanospray tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). This affinity-tag technique coupled with mass spectrometry is useful to detect novel protein interactions not only in yeast but also in mammalian cells.The V-1 protein consists of three consecutive ANK repeats with an additional short stretch of sequence (1Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T. Isobe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 615-620Google Scholar, 2Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yamakawa Y. Ozawa F. Hishinuma F.

The ANK repeat is a structural motif found in many proteins (36Rubin G.M. Yandell M.D. Wortman J.R. Gabor Miklos G.L. Nelson C.R. Hariharan I.K. Fortini M.E. Li P.W. Apweiler R. Fleischmann W. Cherry J.M. Henikoff S. Skupski M.P. Misra S. Ashburner M. Birney E. Boguski M.S. Brody T. Brokstein P. Celniker S.E. Chervitz S.A. Coates D. Cravchik A. Gabrielian A. Galle R.F. Gelbart W.M.

Pickeral O.K. Shue C. Vosshall L.B. Zhang J. Zhao Q. Zheng X.H. Lewis S. Science. 2000; 287: 2204-2215Google Scholar) and mediates specific interactions with a diverse array of protein targets (4Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Google Scholar). In the tertiary structure of V-1 determined by NMR spectroscopy (37Yang Y. Nanduri S. Sen S. Qin J. Structure. 1998; 6: 619-626Google Scholar), the ANK repeats comprise the hairpin-helix-loop-helix modules where the α helices lie along one side providing a structural framework and the hairpins protrude on the other side of the molecule. The hairpins and the surface of the α helices form a groove-like structure, which is believed to be responsible for the contact with the target molecule. This study identified CP as a potential target of V-1. Interestingly, V-1 bound to the functional CP heterodimer consisting of the α and β subunits but did not bind each of the two subunits. This finding is comparable with previous observations that each of the CP subunits was unstable and did not bind actin in vitro and in vivo (26Hug C. Miller T.M. Torres M.A. Casella J.F. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 923-931Google Scholar, 38Amatruda J.F. Gattermeir D.J. Karpova T.S. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1151-1162Google Scholar, 39Hart M.C. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1287-1298Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that V-1 recognizes the structural interface of the CP heterodimer by its groove-like ANK repeats and covers the F-actin binding surface located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the CPβ subunit (26Hug C. Miller T.M. Torres M.A. Casella J.F. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 923-931Google Scholar). However, whether this is the molecular mechanism by which V-1 inhibits the interaction of CP and F-actin awaits further structural investigation.Two distinct proteins, carmil (40Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Google Scholar) and twinfilin (24Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Google Scholar), are known to bind CP. Carmil is a scaffold protein containing the CP-binding site, the myosin I-binding site, the short sequence commonly found in several actin monomer-binding proteins, and the acidic stretch that can activate Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation (40Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal region of carmil binds CP, but its activity with CP is unknown. Twinfilin is a ubiquitous actin monomer-binding protein composed of two ADF/cofilin-like domains connected by a short linker region and has a role in the regulation of actin turnover (41Palmgren S. Vartiainen M. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 881-886Google Scholar). Twinfilin also forms a stable complex with CP but does not affect its activity. V-1 is neither a scaffold protein nor an actin-binding protein, and it lacks structural homology to either carmil or twinfilin. Thus, V-1 belongs to a novel CP-binding protein category. Recently, Ena/VASP was reported as an anti-capping molecule, which promotes actin filament elongation by associating with the barbed ends of actin and shielding them from CP (42Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Loureiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 509-521Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton in the Ena/VASP-deficient cell contained shorter, more highly branched filaments than those in the control cells. V-1 resembles Ena/VASP in the activity of CP-regulated actin polymerization, but whether a similar phenotype can be attributed to the V-1-deficient cell is currently unknown.Previous studies suggested the potential roles of V-1 in nuclear events such as the transcriptional activation of a set of enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis (5Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y. Yamamoto H. Kunikata-Sumitomo M. Minegishi A. Kubota M. Ito M. Konishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27051-27054Google Scholar, 6Suzuki T. Inagaki H. Yamakuni T.

This study suggests for the first time that V-1 functions in the molecular events taking place in the cytoplasm in which the major portion of V-1 resides within the cells as revealed by previous immunohistochemical studies (5Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y. Yamamoto H. Kunikata-Sumitomo M. Minegishi A. Kubota M. Ito M. Konishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27051-27054Google Scholar, 9Knuefermann P. Chen P. Misra A. Shi S.P. Abdellatif M. Sivasubramanian N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23888-23897Google Scholar). V-1 also appeared to be a typical cytoplasmic protein in terms of amino acid sequence with no apparent nuclear localization signal. Our previous studies revealed the characteristic temporal profile of V-1 expression in the developing murine cerebellum at postnatal days 7–12 (2Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yamakawa Y. Ozawa F. Hishinuma F. Kubota M. Minegishi A. Song S.Y. Yamakuni T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9946-9951Google Scholar). Namely, V-1 expression is particularly significant during the migration of progenitor granule cells from the external to internal granular layer to make synaptic contacts with the target Purkinje cells. Likewise, the dynamics of actin polymerization play a pivotal role in the maturation of granule cells, because the modulation of the barbed ends of actin filaments with cytochalasins changed the behavior of the growth cone (44Zmuda J.F. Rivas R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2797-2809Google Scholar) and the migration of granule cells (45Rivas R.J. Hatten M.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 981-989Google Scholar). These observations coupled with the results reported here suggest that V-1 may have a role in the CP-mediated actin-driven cell movements and motility such as granular cell migration and synapse formation. The V-1 protein was originally identified in the murine cerebellum as one of the proteins expressed significantly at the initial stage of postnatal development (1Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T. Isobe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 615-620Google Scholar), particularly in the regions where synaptic formation and neuronal migration occur actively during neurogenesis (2Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M.

Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Google Scholar). In the tertiary structure of V-1 determined by NMR spectroscopy (37Yang Y. Nanduri S. Sen S. Qin J. Structure. 1998; 6: 619-626Google Scholar), the ANK repeats comprise the hairpin-helix-loop-helix modules where the α helices lie along one side providing a structural framework and the hairpins protrude on the other side of the molecule. The hairpins and the surface of the α helices form a groove-like structure, which is believed to be responsible for the contact with the target molecule. This study identified CP as a potential target of V-1. Interestingly, V-1 bound to the functional CP heterodimer consisting of the α and β subunits but did not bind each of the two subunits. This finding is comparable with previous observations that each of the CP subunits was unstable and did not bind actin in vitro and in vivo (26Hug C. Miller T.M. Torres M.A. Casella J.F. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 923-931Google Scholar, 38Amatruda J.F. Gattermeir D.J. Karpova T.S. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1151-1162Google Scholar, 39Hart M.C. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1287-1298Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that V-1 recognizes the structural interface of the CP heterodimer by its groove-like ANK repeats and covers the F-actin binding surface located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the CPβ subunit (26Hug C. Miller T.M. Torres M.A. Casella J.F. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 923-931Google Scholar). However, whether this is the molecular mechanism by which V-1 inhibits the interaction of CP and F-actin awaits further structural investigation.Two distinct proteins, carmil (40Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Google Scholar) and twinfilin (24Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Google Scholar), are known to bind CP. Carmil is a scaffold protein containing the CP-binding site, the myosin I-binding site, the short sequence commonly found in several actin monomer-binding proteins, and the acidic stretch that can activate Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation (40Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal region of carmil binds CP, but its activity with CP is unknown. Twinfilin is a ubiquitous actin monomer-binding protein composed of two ADF/cofilin-like domains connected by a short linker region and has a role in the regulation of actin turnover (41Palmgren S. Vartiainen M. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 881-886Google Scholar). Twinfilin also forms a stable complex with CP but does not affect its activity. V-1 is neither a scaffold protein nor an actin-binding protein, and it lacks structural homology to either carmil or twinfilin. Thus, V-1 belongs to a novel CP-binding protein category. Recently, Ena/VASP was reported as an anti-capping molecule, which promotes actin filament elongation by associating with the barbed ends of actin and shielding them from CP (42Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Loureiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 509-521Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton in the Ena/VASP-deficient cell contained shorter, more highly branched filaments than those in the control cells. V-1 resembles Ena/VASP in the activity of CP-regulated actin polymerization, but whether a similar phenotype can be attributed to the V-1-deficient cell is currently unknown.Previous studies suggested the potential roles of V-1 in nuclear events such as the transcriptional activation of a set of enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis (5Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y. Yamamoto H. Kunikata-Sumitomo M. Minegishi A. Kubota M. Ito M. Konishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27051-27054Google Scholar, 6Suzuki T. Inagaki H. Yamakuni T.

This study suggests for the first time that V-1 functions in the molecular events taking place in the cytoplasm in which the major portion of V-1 resides within the cells as revealed by previous immunohistochemical studies (5Yamakuni T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino M. Song S.Y. Yamamoto H. Kunikata-Sumitomo M. Minegishi A. Kubota M. Ito M. Konishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27051-27054Google Scholar, 9Knuefermann P. Chen P. Misra A. Shi S.P. Abdellatif M. Sivasubramanian N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23888-23897Google Scholar). V-1 also appeared to be a typical cytoplasmic protein in terms of amino acid sequence with no apparent nuclear localization signal. Our previous studies revealed the characteristic temporal profile of V-1 expression in the developing murine cerebellum at postnatal days 7–12 (2Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yamakawa Y. Ozawa F. Hishinuma F. Kubota M. Minegishi A. Song S.Y. Yamakuni T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9946-9951Google Scholar). Namely, V-1 expression is particularly significant during the migration of progenitor granule cells from the external to internal granular layer to make synaptic contacts with the target Purkinje cells. Likewise, the dynamics of actin polymerization play a pivotal role in the maturation of granule cells, because the modulation of the barbed ends of actin filaments with cytochalasins changed the behavior of the growth cone (44Zmuda J.F. Rivas R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2797-2809Google Scholar) and the migration of granule cells (45Rivas R.J. Hatten M.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 981-989Google Scholar). These observations coupled with the results reported here suggest that V-1 may have a role in the CP-mediated actin-driven cell movements and motility such as granular cell migration and synapse formation. CP is one of the F-actin-binding proteins that caps the barbed end of actin filaments and nucleates the actin polymerization in a Ca2+-independent (22Maruyama K. Kimura S. Ishii T. Kuroda M. Ohashi K. Muramats S. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 215-232Google Scholar, 23Caldwell J.E. Heiss S.G. Mermall V. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8506-8514Google Scholar, 27Maruyama K. Kurokawa H.

Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Google Scholar) and a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent manner (29Heiss S.G. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8753-8758Google Scholar, 30Haus U. Hartmann H. Trommler P. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 833-839Google Scholar, 31Barkalow K. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J.

This activity is thought to be functionally significant, because the actin-based movement of Dictyostelium is proportional to the expression level of CP (33Hug C. Jay P.Y. Reddy I. McNally J.G. Bridgman P.C. Elson E.L. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 591-600Google Scholar) and because CP is essential for the in vitro reconstitution of the cell movement (34Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Google Scholar, 35Pantaloni D. Boujemaa R. Didry D. Gounon P. Carlier M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 385-391Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that the V-1 protein forms a stable stoichiometric complex with CP in vitro as well as in vivo (Figs. 2 and 3) and inhibits the CP-mediated nucleation of actin polymerization. Therefore, we assume that V-1 participates in the regulation of actin dynamics in the cells via the interaction with CP. Our strategy to identify the V-1-interacting molecules was based on the tandem affinity purification of the V-1 complex with a TAP tag followed by protein identification by mass spectrometry. The TAP method was originally developed to analyze interactions among yeast proteins (12Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar). We constructed a mammalian expression vector for the TAP method and applied it to the mammalian 293T cell line. Even though the V-1 protein is a rather minor cellular component and a transient expression system was used for the assay, the method enabled us to isolate a sufficient amount of the V-1·CP complex for characterization by nanospray tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). This affinity-tag technique coupled with mass spectrometry is useful to detect novel protein interactions not only in yeast but also in mammalian cells. The V-1 protein consists of three consecutive ANK repeats with an additional short stretch of sequence (1Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T. Isobe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 615-620Google Scholar, 2Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yamakawa Y. Ozawa F. Hishinuma F. Kubota M. Minegishi A. Song S.Y. Yamakuni T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2132076177,"In the present work, we studied the effects of fenretinide (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR)), a hydroxyphenyl derivative of all-trans-retinoic acid, on sphingolipid metabolism and expression in human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cells. A2780 cells, which are sensitive to a pharmacologically achievable HPR concentration, become 10-fold more resistant after exposure to increasing HPR concentrations. Our results showed that HPR was able to induce a dose- and time-dependent increase in cellular ceramide levels in sensitive but not in resistant cells. This form of resistance in A2780 cells was not accompanied by the overexpression of multidrug resistance-specific proteins MDR1 P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein, whose mRNA levels did not differ in sensitive and resistant A2780 cells. HPR-resistant cells were characterized by an overall altered sphingolipid metabolism. The overall content in glycosphingolipids was similar in both cell types, but the expression of specific glycosphingolipids was different. Specifically, our findings indicated that glucosylceramide levels were similar in sensitive and resistant cells, but resistant cells were characterized by a 6-fold lower expression of lactosylceramide levels and by a 6-fold higher expression of ganglioside levels than sensitive cells. The main gangliosides from resistant A2780 cells were identified as GM3 and GM2. The possible metabolic mechanisms leading to this difference were investigated. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide synthases were similar in sensitive and resistant cells, whereas GM3 synthase mRNA level and GM3 synthase activity were remarkably higher in resistant cells.

Sphingolipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of apoptosis induced in tumor cells. Ceramide, produced under physiological (tumor necrosis factor α, γ-interferon, and interleukins) and pharmacological (anticancer drugs, including daunorubicin, vincristine, 1-α-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, and retinoids) stimuli by sphingomyelin hydrolysis or by de novo biosynthesis, is a mediator of apoptosis and an inhibitor of cell proliferation in a variety of tumor cell lines (reviewed in Refs. 1Obeid L.M.

GlcCer accumulation results in the ability of drug-resistant cells to scavenge ceramide, thus preventing ceramide-induced apoptotic death. Multidrug resistance (MDR), a drug-resistant phenotype characterized by the ability of tumor cells to become insensitive to a variety of chemically unrelated chemotherapeutics after exposition to one single drug, is hallmarked by the overexpression of energy-dependent drug efflux pump proteins, such as MDR1 P-glycoprotein (MDR1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) (3Sietsma H.

In MDR human ovarian carcinoma cells, SM and galactosylceramide levels are also higher respect to parental sensitive cells, whereas LacCer and all of the more complex GSLs are present in lower amounts. These data can be at least in part interpreted in the scenario described above. However, in addition to this it is necessary to recall that sphingolipids and sphingolipid metabolites other than ceramide have biological activities that could be responsible for the acquisition of a drug resistance phenotype (16Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318Google Scholar, 17Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Google Scholar, 18Radin N.S. Eur. J.

Thomazy V.A. Heyman R.A. Davies P.J. Cell. Death Differ. 1998; 5: 11-19Google Scholar). Retinoids exert their effects by regulating gene expression through two classes of nuclear receptors: retinoic acid (RA) receptors α, β, and γ and retinoid X receptors α, β, and γ. RA receptors and retinoid X receptors activate gene transcription by binding as homo- or heterodimers to specific DNA sequences, the retinoic acid-responsive elements, and the retinoid X-responsive elements, usually found in the 5′-flanking regions of responsive genes (20Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar). Retinoids have been shown to have differentiating and antitumor activities in several experimental models, and their effectiveness in the treatment and prevention of human cancer has already been established (21Lotan R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1031-1039Google Scholar).4-[3,7-Dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4, 6,8- nonatetraenamido]-1-hydroxybenzene, known asN-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR), pharmacologically known as fenretinide, is a synthetic amide of all-trans-RA, which has shown reduced toxicity relative to RA while maintaining a significant biological activity (22Formelli F. Barua A.B. Olson J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1014-1024Google Scholar). HPR is under investigation in clinical trials as preventive and therapeutic agent and has already shown a preventive effect for ovarian and breast cancers in premenopausal women (23De Palo G. Veronesi U. Camerini T. Formelli F. Mascotti G. Boni C. Fosser V. Del Vecchio M. Campa T. Costa A. Marubini E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 146-147Google Scholar, 24Veronesi U. De Palo G.

Malone W.F. Sporn M.B. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1847-1856Google Scholar) as well as chemopreventive and therapeutic efficacy against different tumors in animal models (22Formelli F. Barua A.B. Olson J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1014-1024Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that HPR has significant antiproliferative activity associated with induction of apoptosis in several tumor cell types (22Formelli F. Barua A.B. Olson J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1014-1024Google Scholar). To date, the mechanism of action of HPR is poorly understood. Some studies suggest that the effects of this retinoid are mediated through RA receptor and retinoid X receptor signaling (25Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Lee X. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Sager R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 133-141Google Scholar, 26Fanjul A. Delia D. Pierotti M.A. Rideout D. Qiu J. Pfahl M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22441-22446Google Scholar, 27Sabichi A.L. Hendricks D.T.

Cancer. 1999; 81: 829-834Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that apoptosis in response to HPR primarily occurs by a receptor-independent mechanism, which is accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species (29Delia D. Aiello A. Meroni L. Nicolini M. Reed J.C. Pierotti M.A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 943-948Google Scholar, 30Oridate N. Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Mitchell M.F. Hong W.K. Lotan R. J. Natl.

Fontanella E. Prinetti A. Sandhoff K. Grabowski G.A. Delia D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1475-1477Google Scholar).Discontinuation of retinoid treatment leads to recurrence of the lesion. However, as occurs with chemotherapeutic agents, continuous retinoid exposure might cause development of drug resistance. So far, only few in vitro models had been developed to investigate mechanisms and molecular characteristics associated with retinoid resistance (33Ponzanelli I. Giannı̀ M. Giavazzi R. Garofalo A. Nicoletti I. Reichert U. Erba E. Rambaldi A. Terao M. Garattini E. Blood. 2000; 95: 2672-2682Google Scholar, 34Appierto V. Cavadini E. Pergolizzi R. Cleris L. Lotan R. Canevari S. Formelli F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1528-1534Google Scholar). In a recent study, we hypothesized that continuous HPR treatment might lead to resistance to the retinoid. We showed that when A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells, which are very sensitive to HPR (35Supino R. Crosti M. Clerici M. Warlters A. Cleris L. Zunino F. Formelli F. Int J Cancer. 1996; 65: 491-497Google Scholar), were continuously exposed to the drug, they developed a 10-fold resistance to the drug (34Appierto V. Cavadini E. Pergolizzi R. Cleris L. Lotan R. Canevari S. Formelli F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1528-1534Google Scholar). Differences in HPR uptake and metabolism were observed between sensitive and resistant cells (34Appierto V. Cavadini E. Pergolizzi R. Cleris L. Lotan R. Canevari S. Formelli F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1528-1534Google Scholar). HPR intracellular peak levels were 2 times lower, and a polar metabolite, not detected in sensitive cells, was found in cell extracts from resistant cells. Moreover, the development of HPR resistance was associated with changes in marker expression, suggestive of a more differentiated status (34Appierto V. Cavadini E. Pergolizzi R. Cleris L. Lotan R. Canevari S. Formelli F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1528-1534Google Scholar). The expression of RA receptor β, a putative tumor suppressor (36Houle B. Rochette-Egly C. Bradley W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 985-989Google Scholar), was markedly increased, whereas the expression of cell surface molecules associated with tumor progression including HER-2 laminin receptor and β1 integrin was markedly reduced.An increase in the cellular levels of ceramide upon HPR treatment was reported in neuroblastoma (31Wang H. Maurer B.J. Reynolds C.P. Cabot M.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5102-5105Google Scholar, 37Maurer B.J. Metelitsa L.S. Seeger R.C. Cabot M.C. Reynolds C.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1138-1146Google Scholar) and breast cancer cell lines (32Panigone S. Bergomas R. Fontanella E. Prinetti A. Sandhoff K. Grabowski G.A. Delia D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1475-1477Google Scholar). In the present work, we studied the possible involvement of ceramide in HPR-induced apoptosis in A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells. Moreover, we assessed whether resistance to HPR was associated with modifications of sphingolipid patterns and metabolism in these cells. Sphingolipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of apoptosis induced in tumor cells. Ceramide, produced under physiological (tumor necrosis factor α, γ-interferon, and interleukins) and pharmacological (anticancer drugs, including daunorubicin, vincristine, 1-α-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, and retinoids) stimuli by sphingomyelin hydrolysis or by de novo biosynthesis, is a mediator of apoptosis and an inhibitor of cell proliferation in a variety of tumor cell lines (reviewed in Refs. 1Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Google Scholar and 2Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Google Scholar). Interestingly, in tumor cell lines, resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments is often associated with an increased ability of the cell to glycosylate ceramide, as a consequence of a higher activity of glucosylceramide synthase (3Sietsma H.

RA receptors and retinoid X receptors activate gene transcription by binding as homo- or heterodimers to specific DNA sequences, the retinoic acid-responsive elements, and the retinoid X-responsive elements, usually found in the 5′-flanking regions of responsive genes (20Mangelsdorf D.J.

Retinoids have been shown to have differentiating and antitumor activities in several experimental models, and their effectiveness in the treatment and prevention of human cancer has already been established (21Lotan R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1031-1039Google Scholar). 4-[3,7-Dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4, 6,8- nonatetraenamido]-1-hydroxybenzene, known asN-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR), pharmacologically known as fenretinide, is a synthetic amide of all-trans-RA, which has shown reduced toxicity relative to RA while maintaining a significant biological activity (22Formelli F. Barua A.B. Olson J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1014-1024Google Scholar). HPR is under investigation in clinical trials as preventive and therapeutic agent and has already shown a preventive effect for ovarian and breast cancers in premenopausal women (23De Palo G. Veronesi U. Camerini T. Formelli F. Mascotti G. Boni C. Fosser V. Del Vecchio M. Campa T. Costa A. Marubini E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 146-147Google Scholar, 24Veronesi U. De Palo G.

Olson J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1014-1024Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that HPR has significant antiproliferative activity associated with induction of apoptosis in several tumor cell types (22Formelli F. Barua A.B. Olson J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1014-1024Google Scholar). To date, the mechanism of action of HPR is poorly understood. Some studies suggest that the effects of this retinoid are mediated through RA receptor and retinoid X receptor signaling (25Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Lee X. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Sager R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 133-141Google Scholar, 26Fanjul A. Delia D. Pierotti M.A. Rideout D. Qiu J. Pfahl M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22441-22446Google Scholar, 27Sabichi A.L. Hendricks D.T.

Cancer. 1999; 81: 829-834Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that apoptosis in response to HPR primarily occurs by a receptor-independent mechanism, which is accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species (29Delia D. Aiello A.

However, as occurs with chemotherapeutic agents, continuous retinoid exposure might cause development of drug resistance. So far, only few in vitro models had been developed to investigate mechanisms and molecular characteristics associated with retinoid resistance (33Ponzanelli I. Giannı̀ M. Giavazzi R. Garofalo A.

Cancer. 2001; 84: 1528-1534Google Scholar). In a recent study, we hypothesized that continuous HPR treatment might lead to resistance to the retinoid. We showed that when A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells, which are very sensitive to HPR (35Supino R. Crosti M. Clerici M. Warlters A. Cleris L. Zunino F. Formelli F. Int J Cancer. 1996; 65: 491-497Google Scholar), were continuously exposed to the drug, they developed a 10-fold resistance to the drug (34Appierto V. Cavadini E. Pergolizzi R. Cleris L. Lotan R. Canevari S. Formelli F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1528-1534Google Scholar). Differences in HPR uptake and metabolism were observed between sensitive and resistant cells (34Appierto V. Cavadini E. Pergolizzi R. Cleris L. Lotan R. Canevari S. Formelli F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1528-1534Google Scholar). HPR intracellular peak levels were 2 times lower, and a polar metabolite, not detected in sensitive cells, was found in cell extracts from resistant cells. Moreover, the development of HPR resistance was associated with changes in marker expression, suggestive of a more differentiated status (34Appierto V. Cavadini E. Pergolizzi R. Cleris L. Lotan R. Canevari S. Formelli F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1528-1534Google Scholar). The expression of RA receptor β, a putative tumor suppressor (36Houle B. Rochette-Egly C. Bradley W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An increase in the cellular levels of ceramide upon HPR treatment was reported in neuroblastoma (31Wang H. Maurer B.J. Reynolds C.P. Cabot M.C.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1475-1477Google Scholar). In the present work, we studied the possible involvement of ceramide in HPR-induced apoptosis in A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells. Moreover, we assessed whether resistance to HPR was associated with modifications of sphingolipid patterns and metabolism in these cells."

Nef binds to the adaptor protein (AP) complexes of coated vesicles, inducing an expansion of the endosomal compartment and altering the surface expression of cellular proteins including CD4 and class I major histocompatibility complex.

Nef misdirects CD4 from the plasma membrane and the Golgi to lysosomes, and it retains class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 in thetrans-Golgi region (2Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R.

Le Gall S. Lemonnier F. Heard J.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 338-342Google Scholar). When fused to the transmembrane domains of integral membrane proteins such as CD4 or CD8, Nef increases the rate of internalization of these chimeras from the cell surface (3Mangasarian A. Foti M.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1235-1238Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that Nef functions as a connector between the cytoplasmic domains of cellular proteins and the membrane trafficking machinery. This hypothesis was supported by the observations that Nef binds vesicle coat proteins including the adaptor protein (AP) complexes (6Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodeus M. Durand H. Doute M. Letourneur F.

These data indicate a general effect of Nef on the trafficking of membrane proteins within the endosomal system. This general effect is supported by the observation that Nef induces a morphologic expansion of endosomal membranes (14Erdtmann L. Janvier K. Raposo G. Craig H.M. Benaroch P. Berlioz-Torrent C. Guatelli J.C. Bernarous R. Benichou S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 871-883Google Scholar, 15Sanfridson A. Hester S. Doyle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 873-878Google Scholar). Membrane trafficking within the endosomal system is mediated in large part by vesicles coated with AP complexes (16Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Google Scholar, 17Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 499-503Google Scholar). Of the four members of the AP complex family, AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4 coat vesicles that mediate transport between the trans-Golgi, endosomes, and lysosomes, whereas AP-2 coats vesicles that mediate endocytosis. The complexes are involved both in the formation and budding of coated vesicles as well as in their selection of cargo. This selection requires the recognition of specific sequences in the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins (18Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Google Scholar). These sequences are tyrosine- or leucine-based motifs, which mediate direct binding to the AP complexes (19Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Google Scholar, 20Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Google Scholar, 21Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.-P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Google Scholar). HIV-1 Nef contains a canonical leucine-based AP-binding motif (EXXXLL) within a solvent exposed, unstructured loop near the C terminus of the protein (5Bresnahan P.A. Yonemoto W. Ferrell S.S. Williams-Herman D.G.R. Greene W.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1235-1238Google Scholar, 9Greenberg M. DeTulleo L. Rapoport I. Skowronski J. Kirchhausen T. Curr.

However, the role of this motif in the specific interactions of Nef with the various AP complexes is incompletely defined (5Bresnahan P.A. Yonemoto W. Ferrell S.S. Williams-Herman D.G.R. Greene W.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1235-1238Google Scholar, 9Greenberg M. DeTulleo L. Rapoport I. Skowronski J. Kirchhausen T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1239-1242Google Scholar, 22Craig H.M. Pandori M.W. Guatelli J.C.

Greene W.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2977-2981Google Scholar). Leucines of the EXXXLL motif are required for the binding of Nef to AP-1 (5Bresnahan P.A. Yonemoto W. Ferrell S.S. Williams-Herman D.G.R. Greene W.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1235-1238Google Scholar). These residues are also required for the binding of Nef to the medium subunit of AP-3 (23Craig H.M. Reddy T.R. Riggs N.L. Dao P.P. Guatelli J. Virology. 2000; 271: 9-17Google Scholar), but binding of Nef to intact AP-3 has not been demonstrated. The role of the glutamic acid residue in the Nef EXXXLL motif is untested, but analogous residues have been implicated in the binding of several mammalian and yeast proteins to AP-3 (25Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Google Scholar, 26Darsow T. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 142: 913-922Google Scholar). Although peptides containing the EXXXLL sequence of Nef or the DKQTLL sequence of the T cell receptor γ chain are competitive for binding to the β subunit of AP-2, the direct binding of HIV-1 Nef to intact AP-2 is extremely weak (9Greenberg M. DeTulleo L. Rapoport I. Skowronski J. Kirchhausen T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1239-1242Google Scholar, 24Bresnahan P.A. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2977-2981Google Scholar). With the exception of AP-2, the association of the AP complexes with membranes is regulated by ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) (27Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Google Scholar, 28Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Google Scholar, 29Ooi C.E. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S. J.

ARF1 undergoes a cycle of membrane association and dissociation controlled by a myristoyl-switch mechanism, which is in turn regulated by guanine-nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis (27Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Google Scholar, 31Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Google Scholar). ARF1 associates with membranes when bound to GTP. The GTP-bound state of ARF1 is induced by guanine nucleotide exchange proteins (GEPs), which catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP. Certain Golgi-associated ARF1-GEPs are inhibited by the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) (32Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Google Scholar, 33Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Google Scholar, 34Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Google Scholar, 35Morinaga N. Tsai S.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12856-12860Google Scholar). By inhibiting these GEPs, BFA induces the GDP-bound state of ARF1 and causes the dissociation of ARF1 and ARF1-dependent coats from membranes. ARF1 also dissociates from membranes in response to GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which cause the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP on ARF (36Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Google Scholar). The physiologic action of ARF1-GAPs allows the dissociation of ARF1-dependent vesicle coats from membranes during vesicular transport (37Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Google Scholar). When membrane-associated, ARF1 generates a high-affinity binding site for the AP complexes (38Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Google Scholar). The nature of this binding site is not known. ARF1 may activate an unidentified “docking protein” for the AP complexes (38Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Google Scholar, 39Seaman M.N. Sowerby P.J. Robinson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25446-25451Google Scholar, 40Dittie A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J.

A. 1999; 96: 5013-5018Google Scholar), or it may induce a modification of membrane phospholipids that enables AP binding (42Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Google Scholar). Alternatively, ARF1 may itself be the docking protein, an hypothesis supported by its ability to bind directly to subunits of the AP-1 and AP-4 complexes (43Austin C. Hinners I. Tooze S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21862-21869Google Scholar, 44Boehm M. Aguilar R.C. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6265-6276Google Scholar). To understand the basis of the pleiotropic effects of Nef on protein trafficking within the endosomal system, we tested the hypothesis that Nef regulates the association of AP complexes with membranes. We report that Nef causes the persistent attachment of AP-1 and AP-3 to juxtanuclear membranes despite experimental perturbations of the ARF1-based regulatory system. Nef neither displayed ARF-like activity nor did it modulate ARF1 or its regulators in vitro. Instead, the direct binding of Nef to AP complexes appears crucial for this membrane stabilization, because mutations in the leucine-based motif of Nef affected both the binding to AP-1 and AP-3 in vitro and the stabilization of these complexes on membranesin vivo. These findings support the hypothesis that a persistent attachment of AP complexes to membranes underlies a general effect of Nef on the endosomal system. Plasmid vectors for the expression of wild-type or mutated HIV-1Lai Nef fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human CD8 α chain were constructed in the pRcCMV plasmid (Invitrogen) as described (14Erdtmann L.

Robinson; anti-HA epitope: rat mAb 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or rabbit polyclonal antibody HA.11 (BabCO); fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD8: murine mAb CD8-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Coulter Coultronics); anti-poly-His (Covance); anti-transferrin receptor: murine mAb anti-CD71 (Sigma); anti-CD63: murine mAb CLB (Diagnostic Research); anti-CD4: murine mAb Leu3A (BD Biosciences); and anti-class I MHC: murine mAb W6/32 (Sera Lab). Secondary antibodies against the mouse, rabbit, and rat IgGs and conjugated to Cy3, Cy5, rhodamine-X, or Texas Red were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. A secondary antibody against rabbit IgG and conjugated to Alexa 647 was from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and rabbit IgG were from Dako. After transfection with the indicated plasmids, HeLa cells were spread on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (8 × 104 cells/well) and then stained for immunofluorescence 24 h later as described (14Erdtmann L. Janvier K. Raposo G. Craig H.M. Benaroch P. Berlioz-Torrent C. Guatelli J.C. Bernarous R. Benichou S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 871-883Google Scholar). When indicated, the cells were treated with BFA (Sigma or Epicentre) at 37 °C before fixation; the concentration and duration of BFA treatment are indicated in the figure legends. For anti-δ-adaptin staining, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, quenched for 10 min with 0.1 mglycine in PBS and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton in PBS. For anti-γ-adaptin staining, cells were either fixed with methanol for 10 min at −20 °C and then permeabilized as described above or fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeablized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After permeabilization, cells were incubated for 30 min with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, then successively incubated for 30 min at room temperature with primary and secondary antibody mixtures to stain the adaptins and HA or poly-His epitope tags. Cells were then washed, blocked for 10 min with 10% mouse serum in PBS, and stained for 30 min with CD8-fluorescein isothiocyanate mAb. Cells transfected with plasmid expressing Nef-GFP were stained only by indirect immunofluorescence for the indicated adaptin. Coverslips were mounted on slides using immunofluor mounting medium (ICN). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 instrument or a Zeiss microscope with a Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal attachment. Images were collected using single fluorescence excitation and acquisition; the absence of crossover between the signals from the doubly and triply labeled cells was confirmed using appropriate controls. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Wild-type or mutated GST-Nef proteins were produced in E. coli as described (4Schwartz O. Marechal V. Le Gall S. Lemonnier F. Heard J.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 338-342Google Scholar), and eluted from Sepharose-glutathione beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 10 mmreduced GSH. Coatomer was purified from rabbit liver as described previously (47Paris S. Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Google Scholar). The following proteins were expressed in E. coli: [Δ17]ARF1, a truncated form of ARF1 lacking the first 17 N-terminal amino acids, was purified by gel filtration (Sephacryl S200 HR, Amersham Biosciences) (48Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Google Scholar); ARNO Sec7 domain (residues 50–252 of ARNO) was isolated by anion exchange on QAE-Sepharose and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-100 HR (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (49Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Google Scholar); and ARF-GAP1 (50Huber I. Rotman M. Pick E. Makler V. Rothem L. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 307-316Google Scholar). Full-length His-ARNO and His-Cytohesin1 were purified by nickel affinity chromatography on POROS-MC20 (Perceptive Biosystem). HeLa cells (107) were lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The cytoplasmic lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of GST or GST-Nef proteins immobilized on GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed five times in lysis buffer. Bound cellular proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-γ- and anti-δ-adaptin antibodies and chemiluminescent detection; the signals were quantified using NIH Image Software. [Δ17]ARF1 was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP in the presence of purified ARNO-Sec7 as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor. [Δ17]ARF1 (500 nm) was incubated in the presence of 15 μm ARNO-Sec7, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmAMP-PNP, 1 μCi/ml [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol), and 10 μm unlabeled GTP. Loading proceeded for 15 min at 25 °C, and free GTP was removed by gel filtration. The amount of GTP that became ARF-bound was determined following nitrocellulose filtration. Nucleotide exchange on [Δ17]ARF1 was measured as an increase in tryptophan fluorescence as described (51Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Chardin P. Paris S. Chabre M. Cherfils J. Antonny B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3651-3659Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 37 °C in the presence 500 nm [Δ17]ARF1, 50 mmTris (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm MgCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μm GTP. Hydrolysis of GTP on [Δ17]ARF1 was assayed by a modification of the assay described (52Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Google Scholar). GAP assays contained 150 nm [γ-32P]GTP-loaded [Δ17]ARF1, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm AMP-PNP, and GAP1 as indicated in a final volume of 40 μl. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C in the absence of coatomer with the indicated amounts of ARF-GAP1, or in the presence of coatomer (100 nm) and 300 nmARF-GAP1. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of cold charcoal suspension (5% charcoal in 50 mmNaH2PO4). Following centrifugation, the amount of 32Pi in the supernatant was determined. The subcellular distribution of Nef in relation to AP complexes was examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.1). For these studies, we used two fusion proteins: one in which the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was appended to the C terminus of Nef (Nef-GFP (23Craig H.M. Reddy T.R. Riggs N.L. Dao P.P. Guatelli J. Virology. 2000; 271: 9-17Google Scholar, 53Greenberg M.E. Bronson S. Lock M. Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6964-6976Google Scholar)), and the other in which the entire Nef sequence was appended to the lumenal and transmembrane domains of CD8, generating a membrane protein containing Nef as the cytoplasmic domain (CD8-Nef (14Erdtmann L.

Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1994; 1: 373-384Google Scholar)). These chimeras are functional for the down-regulation of CD4 and class I MHC (data not shown and Fig.2) and have been extensively used to analyze the interaction of Nef with the endocytic machinery (3Mangasarian A.

In HeLa cells, Nef-GFP was concentrated in a juxtanuclear region near the cell center, the region in which AP-1 complexes were also concentrated (Fig. 1 A). CD8-Nef was also concentrated in a juxtanuclear region (Fig. 1 B), and its distribution overlapped extensively with AP-1 and AP-3, but not with AP-2. Notably, the distribution of Nef-GFP included a cytoplasmic component, but that of CD8-Nef did not (Figs. 1 and 3), because CD8-Nef is exclusively membrane-associated, whereas Nef-GFP, which associates with membranes via its N-terminal myristoyl group, is in part cytoplasmic. Furthermore, in most cells that expressed CD8-Nef, the intensity of staining for AP-1 and AP-3 in the juxtanuclear region was greater than in cells that did not express the chimera. This supraphysiologic recruitment of AP-1 and AP-3 by CD8-Nef was reminiscent of the recruitment of AP-1 or AP-3 to juxtanuclear membranes caused by the overexpression of transmembrane chimeras containing the cytoplasmic domains of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, Lamp I, or Limp II (55Le Borgne R. Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29451-29461Google Scholar). These data confirm that the CD8-Nef chimera provides an optimal experimental system for studying the relationship between Nef and the AP complexes.Figure 2Nef expands the perinuclear recycling endosomal compartment, where it sequesters CD4 and class I MHC.HeLa cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing CD8-Nef, then stained by indirect immunofluorescence for the indicated cellular proteins (middle column, red) and by direct immunofluorescence for CD8-Nef (left column,green).

HeLa cells were transfected with the plasmid that expresses Nef-GFP (panel A) or CD8-Nef (panel B), then examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to detect Nef-GFP and CD8-Nef (green) and either AP-1 (γ-adaptin, red) or AP-3 (δ–adaptin, red). Where indicated in panel A, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml BFA for 30 min before fixation and staining; where indicated in panel B, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml BFA for 15 min before fixation and staining. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy revealed that Nef expression severely affects the morphology of the endosomal compartment (14Erdtmann L. Janvier K. Raposo G. Craig H.M. Benaroch P. Berlioz-Torrent C. Guatelli J.C. Bernarous R. Benichou S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 871-883Google Scholar, 15Sanfridson A. Hester S. Doyle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 873-878Google Scholar). To identify more precisely the membrane systems affected by Nef, we characterized the compartment in which CD8-Nef resides by co-staining for cellular markers of the endocytic pathway (Fig. 2). CD8-Nef co-localized extensively with transferrin receptor in the juxtanuclear region near the cell center. Strikingly, CD8-Nef induced a marked increase in transferrin receptor staining in this juxtanuclear region. These data indicate that Nef induces an expansion of this compartment, presumably via condensation of peripheral endosomal membranes into this region. Notably, both CD4 and class I MHC co-localized with Nef in the juxtanuclear region (Fig. 2). In contrast, little to no co-localization was observed between Nef and CD63, a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 2), or between Nef and sialyltransferase, a Golgi marker (data not shown). Together, these observations suggest that Nef sequesters CD4 and class I MHC in a perinuclear transferrin receptor-positive endosomal compartment at steady state. We hypothesized that Nef might alter the endosomal system by regulating the membrane association of AP complexes. To test this, we treated Nef-expressing cells with BFA, a fungal metabolite that inhibits Golgi-associated ARF1 guanine nucleotide exchange proteins (GEPs) and causes the release of ARF1 and ARF1-dependent coat components from membranes (Fig. 3). In cells that did not express Nef, AP-1 and AP-3 became diffusely cytoplasmic because of dissociation from membranes. In contrast, AP-1 and AP-3 remained concentrated with Nef in a juxtanuclear region despite BFA treatment in cells expressing either Nef-GFP (panel A) or CD8-Nef (panel B). The juxtanuclear distribution of AP-1 and AP-3 was not preserved in BFA-treated cells that expressed a CD8 construct lacking a cytoplasmic domain, which localized predominantly to the plasma membrane (data not shown). These data indicate that Nef stabilizes the association of AP-1 and AP-3 with membranes. This stabilization was also observed following infection of"

Thus, blood pressure may be lowered, in part, through vasodilation due to membrane hyperpolarization. The Ca2+ signal is evoked via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in sarcoplasmic reticulum proximal to the plasma membrane. We show here that cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (cADPR), by activating RyRs, mediates, in part, hyperpolarization and vasodilation by β-adrenoceptors. Thus, intracellular dialysis of cADPR increased the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration proximal to the plasma membrane in isolated arterial smooth muscle cells and induced a concomitant membrane hyperpolarization. Smooth muscle hyperpolarization mediated by cADPR, by β-adrenoceptors, and by cAMP, respectively, was abolished by chelating intracellular Ca2+ and by blocking RyRs, cADPR, and BKCa channels with ryanodine, 8-amino-cADPR, and iberiotoxin, respectively. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A antagonistN-(2-[p-bromocinnamylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride (H89) blocked hyperpolarization by isoprenaline and cAMP, respectively, but not hyperpolarization by cADPR. Thus, cADPR acts as a downstream element in this signaling cascade. Importantly, antagonists of cADPR and BKCa channels, respectively, inhibited β-adrenoreceptor-induced artery dilation. We conclude, therefore, that relaxation of arterial smooth muscle by adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors results, in part, from a cAMP-dependent and protein kinase A-dependent increase in cADPR synthesis, and subsequent activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+release via RyRs, which leads to activation of BKCachannels and membrane hyperpolarization.

Identifying the precise mechanisms involved is therefore essential to our understanding of how blood pressure may be regulated by PKA-dependent signaling and may provide fundamental insights into the causes of essential hypertension. Previous studies have suggested that activation of PKA may promote BKCa-dependent hyperpolarization by direct phosphorylation of the BKCa channel protein (4Jaggar J.H. Porter V.A. Lederer W.J.

Despite the wealth of information linking RyR activation to vasodilation by adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors, however, little attention has been paid to the role of cADPR in this process. We show here that hyperpolarization and dilation by adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors is mediated, in part, by cADPR-dependent SR Ca2+ release and consequent activation of BKCa channels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle. Single smooth muscle cells were enzymatically isolated from second order branches of the pulmonary artery of male Wistar rats (150–300 g, sacrificed by cervical dislocation). Briefly, arteries were incubated (1 h, 22 °C) in a low Ca2+ solution of the following composition: 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 15 mmNaHCO3, 0.16 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose, 10 mmTaurine, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mg/ml papain (Fluka), and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Then, 0.25 mg/ml 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol (Fluka) was added to the solution followed by a further 30-min incubation. The tissue was placed in enzyme-free low Ca2+ solution, and single smooth muscle cells were isolated by gentle trituration. Cells were placed, as required, onto a glass coverslip in the experimental chamber. Membrane potential in single pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells was measured in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique in current-clamp mode (I = 0) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon instruments, Foster City, CA). Cells were bathed in physiological salt solution of the following composition (physiological salt solution A): 130 mm NaCl, 5.2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.45. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 °C). Seal resistance was ≥3 gigaohms, series resistance was ≤5 megaohms, and pipette resistance was 2–4 megaohms. Fetchex and Fetchan software (Axon instruments, Foster City, CA) were used to perform data acquisition and analysis. Cells were incubated for 30 min in low Ca2+ solution (see above) containing 5 μmFura-2 AM, washed, and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min. 5 μm Fura-2 (free acid) was also added to the pipette solution used for intracellular dialysis (see above). Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were monitored by assessing Fura-2 fluorescence, using excitation wavelengths of 340 nm (F340) and 380 nm (F380), respectively, and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Emitted fluorescence was monitored using a Hamamatsu 4880 image-intensifying CCD camera and recorded and analyzed using Openlab imaging software (Improvision) on an Apple Macintosh G4 personal computer. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 0.25–5 Hz with background subtraction being carried out on-line. Changes in Fura-2 fluorescence are reported as the F340/F380 ratio and as the estimated intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Artery rings (2–3 mm in length) were isolated from second order branches of rat pulmonary arteries and mounted onto an automated myograph (AM10, Cambustion Biological, Cambridge, UK) using 50-μm tungsten wire. Tension was set to be equivalent to a pressure of 30 mm Hg. The methods have been described in detail previously (34Dipp M. Nye P.C.G. Evans A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L318-L325Google Scholar, 35Mulvany M.J. Halpern W. Circ. Res. 1977; 41: 19-26Google Scholar). The myograph contained physiological salt solution B: 118 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 5.56 mm glucose. The solution was maintained at 37 °C and bubbled with 75% N2, 20% O2, and 5% CO2 to maintain a pH of 7.4. The endothelium was removed by rubbing the intima of the arteries with braided silk surgical thread. Endothelium removal was confirmed by the failure of 100 μm acetylcholine to relax constrictions induced by 1 μm (5Z, 9α, 11α, 13E, 15S)-9,11,15-Trihydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoic acid (PGF2α). Isoprenaline, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), cADPR, ADP-ribose, iberiotoxin, 8-amino-cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (8-NH2-cADPR), 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (8-Br-cADPR), heparin,N-(2-[p-bromocinnamylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride (H89), cAMP, ryanodine, PGF2α, myo-inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3), and cyclopiazonic acid were from Sigma. Fura-2 and Fura-2-AM were from Molecular Probes. Xestospongin C was from Calbiochem. Fura-2, Ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid were dissolved in Me2SO, final dilution of 1:1000. At this concentration, Me2SO was without effect on the preparations studied here. Using Fura-2 fluorescence imaging techniques and the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, we measured, in parallel, changes in the intracellular Ca2+concentration and resting membrane potential evoked by intracellular dialysis of cADPR in isolated rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In agreement with previous investigations in arterial smooth muscle, resting membrane potentials were within the range −40 to −60 mV, and estimated resting Ca2+ concentrations were in the range 70–150 nm (4Jaggar J.H. Porter V.A. Lederer W.J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C235-C256Google Scholar, 36Kirber M.T. Etter E.F. Bellve K.A. Lifhitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Fay F.S. Walsh J.V. Fogarty K.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 315-327Google Scholar). Intracellular application of cADPR (20 μm) evoked a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, as indicated by an increase in the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio (F340/F380) from 0.5 ± 0.1 to 0.8 ± 0.1 (mean ± S.E.; Fig.1 A) and a concomitant hyperpolarization. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ was localized at the cell perimeter, i.e. in close apposition to the plasma membrane. However, the capacity of Fura-2 for binding Ca2+ resulted in marked attenuation of cADPR-dependent hyperpolarization. Thus, subsequent investigations of the transduction pathway leading to hyperpolarization utilized electrophysiological techniques alone. In the absence of Fura-2, intracellular dialysis of cADPR (20 μm) evoked hyperpolarization from −40 ± 2 to −75 ± 1 mV (n = 28, Fig. 1 B), which was reversed by the selective BKCa channel antagonist iberiotoxin (100 nm, n = 7, Fig. 1 B). Importantly, no hyperpolarization was observed when intracellular Ca2+ was chelated by intracellular infusion of BAPTA (1 mm, Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, cADPR-induced hyperpolarization was slowly reversed when SR Ca2+ stores were depleted by cyclopiazonic acid (10 μm,n = 4, Fig. 1 D), blocked following preincubation with 20 μm ryanodine (20 min,n = 4, Fig. 1 E), and blocked by the selective cADPR antagonists 8-NH2-cADPR (100 μm, n = 4, Fig. 1 F) and 8-bromo-cADPR (100 μm, n = 4, not shown (37Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Google Scholar)). These findings are summarized in Fig. 1 G. Hyperpolarization induced by 1 mm caffeine, which triggers Ca2+ release via RyRs by a mechanism independent of cADPR (22Galione A. Summerhill R.S. Ryanodine Receptors. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 52-70Google Scholar), was insensitive to the cADPR antagonist 8-NH2-cADPR (100 μm; n = 4, not shown) and 8-bromo-cADPR, respectively, (100–300 μm;n = 4, not shown). This is consistent with the view that the cADPR antagonists tested here selectively inhibit SR Ca2+ release by cADPR in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells but do not block SR Ca2+ release via RyRs or BKCa channel activation per se. Note that we found no measurable contamination of cADPR-containing solutions with ADP or ADP-ribose and, in contrast to the effects of cADPR, intracellular infusion of 20 μm ADP-ribose had no effect on membrane potential (n = 4, not shown). Extracellular application of 20 μm cADPR was without effect on membrane potential in isolated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and neither intracellular nor extracellular application of the cADPR antagonists 8-NH2-cADPR (100 μm, n = 4) and 8-bromo-cADPR (≤300 μm, n = 4), respectively, had any effect on membrane potential. In contrast to hyperpolarization by cADPR, ryanodine had no significant effect on the global Ca2+ wave induced by intracellular dialysis of IP3. Thus, intracellular dialysis of 1 μm IP3 increased the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio from 0.60 ± 0.01 to a peak of 2.5 ± 0.1 in the absence of 20 μm ryanodine (n = 5) and from 0.8 ± 0.1 to a peak of 1.8 ± 0.2 in the presence of 20 μm ryanodine (20-min preincubation,n = 5). Conversely, the IP3R antagonist xestospongin C blocked IP3-induced Ca2+ signals (n = 4, not shown) but had no effect on Ca2+ signals or hyperpolarization by cADPR (n = 4, not shown). These findings suggest that ryanodine blocks hyperpolarization by cADPR without significant effect on the ability of the SR to release Ca2+ over the time course of our experiments. Preincubation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells with 300 μm 8-bromo-cADPR was without effect on the transient increase in Fura-2 fluorescence ratio triggered upon SR store depletion by cyclopiazonic acid. The Fura-2 fluorescence ratio was increased by 20 μm cyclopiazonic acid from 0.37 ± 0.02 to a peak of 0.56 ± 0.03 (n = 10) in the absence of 8-bromo-cADPR and from 0.35 ± 0.03 to a peak of 0.58 ± 0.04 (n = 4) in the presence of 8-bromo-cADPR (300 μm). Thus, it seems unlikely that 8-bromo-cADPR blocks cADPR-dependent hyperpolarization by inhibiting SR Ca2+ ATPase activity. When taken together, the aforementioned findings are consistent with the view that cADPR mediates hyperpolarization by triggering SR Ca2+ release via RyRs by a mechanism independent of the SR Ca2+ ATPase and IP3Rs, respectively, which ultimately leads to BKCa channel activation and hyperpolarization. Given our finding that cADPR mediates hyperpolarization by BKCa channel activation, we investigated the role of cADPR in mediating hyperpolarization induced by the activation of β-adrenoceptors, a family of adenylyl cyclase-coupled vasodilator receptors that are known to mediate smooth muscle relaxation, in part, by activating BKCa channels and membrane hyperpolarization (4Jaggar J.H. Porter V.A. Lederer W.J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C235-C256Google Scholar, 5Porter V.A. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Heppner T.J. Stevenson A.S. Kleppisch T. Ledderer W.J. Nelson N.T. Am. J.

Extracellular application of the selective β-adrenoreceptor agonist isoprenaline (10 μm) induced sustained hyperpolarization from −39 ± 2 to −75 ± 1 mV (n = 20, Fig.2 A), which was reversed by the selective BKCa channel antagonist iberiotoxin (100 nm, n = 5, Fig. 2 A). As would be expected from previous studies (6Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L100-L105Google Scholar, 7Satake N. Shibata M. Shibata S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 505-510Google Scholar, 9Shaul P.W. Muntz K.H. Buja L.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 86-92Google Scholar), hyperpolarization by isoprenaline was also blocked by a selective β-adrenoreceptor antagonist, propanolol (10 μm, n = 4, not shown). In common with cADPR, hyperpolarization by isoprenaline was blocked when intracellular Ca2+ was chelated by BAPTA (1 mm, n = 4, Fig. 2 B), underscoring the role of an increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration. Isoprenaline-evoked hyperpolarization was also blocked when SR Ca2+ release was inhibited with ryanodine (20 μm, n = 6, Fig. 2 C). In contrast, intracellular dialysis of heparin, an IP3R antagonist, failed to inhibit hyperpolarization by isoprenaline (n = 3, not shown), which mitigates against a possible role for IP3Rs in this process. As RyRs mediate isoprenaline-evoked hyperpolarization and cADPR mimicked the effects of isoprenaline, we examined the possible role of cADPR in the β-adrenoreceptor signaling pathway. Hyperpolarization by isoprenaline was abolished by intracellular infusion of 8-NH2-cADPR (100 μm, n = 6, Fig. 2 D) and of 8-Br-cADPR (100 μm, n = 6, not shown), respectively. The powerful effects of these two selective cADPR antagonists strongly suggest a key role for cADPR in mediating isoprenaline-induced membrane hyperpolarization in arterial smooth muscle cells. These findings are summarized in Fig. 2 E. Since β-adrenoceptors activate adenylyl cyclase (6Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L100-L105Google Scholar, 7Satake N. Shibata M. Shibata S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 505-510Google Scholar, 9Shaul P.W. Muntz K.H. Buja L.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 86-92Google Scholar), we investigated the relationship between isoprenaline, cAMP, PKA, and cADPR-mediated hyperpolarization. Intracellular infusion of cAMP (10 μm) induced hyperpolarization in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells from −43 ± 4 mV to −82 ± 5 mV (n = 10), which was reversed by the selective BKCa channel antagonist iberiotoxin (100 nm,n = 6, Fig.3 A). In common with cADPR and isoprenaline, cAMP-dependent hyperpolarization was blocked in cells that had been preincubated with 20 μm ryanodine (n = 5, Fig. 3 B) and was abolished by co-infusion with 8-NH2-cADPR (100 μm,n = 11, Fig. 3 C) and by co-infusion with 8-Br-cADPR (100 μm, not shown). These findings are summarized in Fig. 3 D. Preincubation with H89 (1 μm), a selective PKA inhibitor, abolished hyperpolarization by isoprenaline (n = 5, Fig. 4, A and D). In marked contrast, hyperpolarization by cADPR (20 μm) remained unaffected in the presence of H89 (1 μm), measuring −76 ± 2 mV (n = 28) in the absence of H89 and −78 ± 6 mV in the presence of H89 (1 μm;n = 3; Fig. 4, B and D). In common with isoprenaline, but in contrast to cADPR, cAMP failed to induce membrane hyperpolarization in the presence of 1 μmH89 (n = 6, Fig. 4, C and D). These findings are consistent with cADPR acting downstream of cAMP and PKA activation during β-adrenoreceptor signaling. The role of cADPR in mediating isoprenaline-induced vasodilation was investigated in isolated pulmonary artery rings by tension recording experiments. Isolated pulmonary artery rings, without endothelium, were first constricted with 50 μm PGF2α. Subsequent application of isoprenaline (100 nm; IC50) relaxed the PGF2α (50 μm)-induced constriction by 68 ± 4% (Fig. 5 A,n = 4). Application of 8-Br-cADPR (300 μm), a membrane-permeant cADPR antagonist (37Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Google Scholar), reversed the isoprenaline-induced relaxation to 36 ± 2% (Fig.5 A, n = 4). Clearly, these findings are consistent with a role for cADPR in mediating dilation by β-adrenoreceptor activation. Note that in the presence of 50 μm PGF2α, isolated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were depolarized relative to control, and under these conditions, intracellular dialysis of 20 μm cADPR elicited hyperpolarization consistent with control, from −36 ± 2 mV to −61 ± 12 mV (n = 4, Fig. 5,inset). In contrast to its inhibition of dilation by isoprenaline, 300 μm 8-bromo-cADPR has no effect on constriction by potassium (i.e. by voltage-gated Ca2+ influx) and PGF2α, respectively (29Dipp M. Evans A.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 77-83Google Scholar). After block of RyRs by ryanodine (20 μm) and depletion of SR stores by cylclopiazonic acid (10 μm), isoprenaline (100 nm) relaxed PGF2α (50 μm)-induced constriction by 21 ± 5% (n = 4) and 37 ± 4% (Fig. 5 B andC; n = 4), respectively. In each case, the inhibition of dilation by isoprenaline was equivalent to that obtained in the presence of 8-bromo-cADPR. These findings are therefore consistent with the view that cADPR mediates the component of vasodilation by isoprenaline that is dependent on SR Ca2+release via RyRs. Support for this viewpoint comes from our finding that preincubation of isolated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells with ryanodine (20 μm) did not deplete SR Ca2+ stores and that 8-bromo-cADPR was without effect on the Ca2+ transient evoked following inhibition of SR Ca2+ ATPase activity by cyclopiazonic acid (see above). Furthermore, inhibition of SR Ca2+ ATPase activity by cyclopiazonic acid induced transient constriction of isolated arteries (Fig. 5 C), whereas 8-bromo-cADPR"

When these mutants are shifted to glucose, Rpn6p depletion induces several specific phenotypes. First, multiubiquitinated proteins accumulate, indicating a defect in proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Second, mutant yeasts are arrested as large budded cells with a single nucleus and a 2C DNA content; in addition, the spindle pole body is duplicated, indicating a general cell cycle defect related to the turnover of G2-cyclins after DNA synthesis.

Prior to degradation, most substrates of the proteasome are covalently conjugated to ubiquitin (Ub).1 Ubiquitylation requires three enzymatic activities, the first of which activates ubiquitin, which is then transferred to one of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. A third activity conveyed by ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase is required for substrate specificity. The multiubiquitinated proteins are subsequently recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is very similar to that of mammals. In vitro the RP can be dissociated in two subcomplexes, the lid, containing eight regulatory subunits, Rpn3, Rpns5–9, and Rpns 11 and 12, and the base, which links the RP to the CP and contains six homologous ATPases, Rpt1–6p, as well as Rpn1p and Rpn2p. Recently, additional proteins have been described as components of affinity-purified proteasomes (12Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The proteasome lid subunits exhibit marked similarities to the COP9-signalosome complex (CSN) (13Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), a key regulator that has recently been demonstrated to be involved in numerous signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 14Schwechheimer C. Deng X.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 420-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The CSN has been found in plants, mammals,Drosophila, and Saccharomyces pombe, but it is absent from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The eight subunits of the CSN are each paralogous to one of the eight subunits that form the lid of the 26 S proteasome. The CSN and the proteasome are evolutionary conserved particles, but they have unique structures (15Kapelari B. Bech-Otschir D. Hegerl R. Schade R. Dumdey R. Dubiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, they might share a common function, because the CSN has been reported recently (16Chamovitz D.A. Glickman M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yang X. Menon S. Lykke-Andersen K. Tsuge T. Di X. Wang X. Rodriguez-Suarez R.J. Zhang H. Wei N. Curr.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) to be involved in protein degradation. Possible cooperation between both complexes in plants has also been reported (19Kwok S.F. Staub J.M. Deng X.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, a new protein complex related to the RP, also containing Rpn6p, has been found in Arabidopsisseedlings and cauliflower florets (20Peng Z. Staub J.M. Serino G. Kwok S.F. Kurepa J. Bruce B.D. Vierstra R.D. Wei N. Deng X.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Despite recent advances in the knowledge of the structure and function of the proteasome, the enzymatic activities and specific functions played by most regulatory subunits remain unknown. With the exception of Rpn9p and Rpn10p, all the regulatory subunits are essential. Rpn10p binds polyUb chain both in its free form and when incorporated into proteasomes (21van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M.

Thus, Rpn10p presumably functions as a proteasomal polyUb protein receptor. However, other major polyUb receptors must exist in the proteasome, because in Δrpn10strains only short-lived proteins, degraded by the Ub-fusion degradation pathway, are known to be stabilized (21van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Rpn10p is also important for correct association of lid and base (13Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The base is sufficient to activate CP proteolysis of certain non-Ub proteins, governing their entry into the CP (11Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is responsible for the unfolding function of the RP (9Strickland E. Hakala K. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5565-5572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 10Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and functions as a gating device for the CP channel; this last role played primarily by Rpt2p (23Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 24Köhler A. Cascio P. Leggett D.S. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Recently, a new mediator of ubiquitin chain recognition has been described, Rpt5p, one of the ATPase subunits from the base (8Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Another subunit of the base, Rpn1p, acts as a receptor for Rad23p (22Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), a protein that might deliver proteins to the proteasome for degradation (25Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Less is known about the role played by lid subunits during protein degradation. However, the lid is required for the degradation of polyUb-conjugated substrates, at least in vitro (13Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Among the essential lid proteins, only Rpn3p, Rpn11p, and Rpn12p have been further characterized (26Bailly E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6872-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Rinaldi T. Ricci C. Porro D. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Frontali L. Mol. Biol.

Shimizu Y. et al.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As it is the case for the 20 S and ATPase components, they have been found to be essential for cell cycle progression, demonstrating the important role of Ub-mediated proteolysis in the control of the cell cycle (29Deshaies R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Recently Rpn11p has been described as a metalloisopeptidase involved in the deubiquitination of proteasome substrates (31Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 32Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Assigning individual roles to lid subunits should enhance our understanding of the proteasome. To this end, a functional analysis performed with the S. cerevisiae null rpn6-Δ1conditional mutant is presented in this report. Protein Rpn6p was first described as an open reading frame with unknown function, found during the systematic sequencing of the yeast S. cerevisiae genome (33Boskovic J. Soler-Mira A. Garcia-Cantalejo J.M. Ballesta J.P. Jimenez A. Remacha M. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It was later identified as the human S9 homologue (34Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Saito A. Watanabe T.K. Shimada Y. Fujiwara T. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Gene. 1997; 203: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and as a component of the S. cerevisiae RP (11Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional characterization of this subunit as a proteasome component that interacts with CSN has been carried out in Arabidopsis andDrosophila (19Kwok S.F. Staub J.M. Deng X.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Peng Z. Staub J.M. Serino G. Kwok S.F. Kurepa J. Bruce B.D. Vierstra R.D. Wei N. Deng X.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Lier S. Paululat A. Gene. 2002; 298: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has been reported that Rpn6p is essential for Drosophila development (36Lier S. Paululat A. Gene. 2002; 298: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The data presented in this report suggest that Rpn6p plays a key role in the lid of the yeast RP. It is important for maintaining the correct assembly of 26 S proteasomes and facilitates the proper accommodation of other lid subunits. Moreover, Rpn6p subunit is necessary for the complete activation of 26 S upon binding of the RP to the CP. In addition, Rpn6p function is essentially required during mitosis. S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Cells were grown in synthetic dextrose minimal (SD), synthetic complete (SC), or rich medium with either glucose (YPD) or galactose (YPGal) as a carbon source (37Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Hydroxyurea was added to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml and incubated for 4 h. Transformation of S. cerevisiae was carried out as described elsewhere (38.Agatep, R., Kirkpatrick, R. D., Parchaliuk, D. L., Woods, R. A., and Gietz, R. D. (1998) Technical Tips Online Ed.: www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/medicine/biochem/gietz/method.html.Google Scholar). For selection of geneticin (G418) resistance, cells were first grown for 2 h at 30 °C in liquid YPD and then spread on YPD plates containing 200 μg/ml of G418. Plasmids with URA3 as the selection marker were cured by plating the cells onto SC plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (37Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α was used for cloning steps and was grown in LB medium. Standard DNA cloning and manipulation were performed according to well established techniques (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR amplifications were made using the high fidelityPfu (Stratagene) or Pwo (Roche Diagnostics) DNA polymerases.Table IYeast strains and plasmids used in this workStrainGenotypeaThe strains are transformed with plasmids shown in parentheses.SourceCEN.PK2MATa/α, ura3–52/ura3–52 trp1–289/trp1–289 leu2–3,112/leu2–3,112 his3-Δ1/his3-Δ1 MAL2–8c-SUC2K.D.

Open table in a new tab Disruption of RPN6 was performed using the short flanking homology method (40Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) was used as a source of the geneticin resistance gene. Hemagglutinin (HA) tagging of PDS1 (strains FS6a2 and FSD622) and CLB2 (strains FS6a3 and FSD623) was done by transforming either FS6a (for FS6a2) and FSD620 (for FSD622) with plasmid pOC52 linearized with SacI andClaI or FS6a (for FS6a3) and FSD621 (for FSD623) with pCLB2(HA)3 linearized with BglII. Strains used for proteasome purification were obtained from FS6a and FSD641 by replacing the PRE1 locus with a protein A-taggedPRE1 (12Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), thus yielding the strains FS6a4 and FSD642, respectively. Relevant features of the plasmids used in this work are shown in Table I. These were constructed as follows. For pRC-66 and pFC7–66, the 2.1-kbp fragment containing the Rpn6p encoding region plus 450 and 330 nucleotides from the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was cloned into plasmid pRS416 (42Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pRC-66. The same fragment was cloned into pFL37 (43Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16620-16626Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), thus yielding pFC7–66. For pFC8-G6 and pFC9-G6, for conditional expression of Rpn6p, the DNA encoding fragment was fused to the GAL1promoter in centromeric plasmids pFL38 and pFL39 (44Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). From plasmid pRC-66 a 1.7-kbp fragment was digested and cloned into pFLUraGP0 (45Santos C. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15689-15696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The obtained plasmid was termed pFC8-G6. The GAL1-RPN6fragment was also cloned in pFL39, yielding plasmid pFC9-G6. For pFC8-GHis6, a PCR-amplified fragment of RPN6 was cloned in plasmid pRSETC (Invitrogen), which places in the N terminus the hexahistidine and T7 tags, yielding pRSET6. The tagged RPN6thus generated was subcloned into pFLUraGP0 (45Santos C. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15689-15696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain pFC8-GHis6, which harbors His6-RPN6 under the control of theGAL1 promoter. For pFC6–6S9 and pFC7-P0S9, a 1.3-kbp PCR fragment containing the S9 coding region amplified from a HeLa cells cDNA library was cloned in plasmid BSP0Hs (46Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2130-2136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pBP0S9. The 3-kbp fragment containing the S9 open reading frame flanked by the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of RPP0 was cloned into pFL37 (43Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16620-16626Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), thus yielding pFC7-P0S9. S9 open reading frame was also placed under the control of the RPN6 promoter by overlapping PCRs and cloned in pFL36 plasmid (44Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), yielding pFC6–6S9. The pF6M-SIC1(HA) construct was obtained by cloningSIC1(HA) from YCp-SIC1 together with the MET25promoter, obtained from pUG35 (kindly provided by Dr. Hegemann, Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany) in plasmid pFL46S (44Bonneaud N.

DNA content was quantified with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScalibur; BD Biosciences). Samples containing 10,000 cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, resuspended in 0.5 mm sodium citrate supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml RNase, incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and treated with 5 mg/ml pepsin before staining with propidium iodide and sonication. Standard procedures were used for immunoblotting. Tubulin was detected by using rat monoclonal antibody YOL1/34 (Harlan Sera-Lab), polyUb-conjugated proteins were detected with a commercially available rabbit polyclonal antibody (Affiniti), T7-His6-tagged Rpn6p was detected with a commercially available monoclonal antibody against the T7 tag (Novagen), and HA-tagged proteins were detected using the monoclonal antibody 12CA5. As a loading control in SDS-PAGE, antibodies recognizing the ribosomal protein P0 were used (45Santos C. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15689-15696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence and 4′,6-diamindine-2′-phenylindole (DAPI) staining were performed as described elsewhere (47Pringle J.R. Adams A.E. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG (Biomeda Corp.) was used as a second antibody for tubulin detection. For protein extraction cells were resuspended in Buffer 1 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) plus protease inhibitors. Glass beads were added, and cells were broken with a FastPrep FP120 (Bio 101 Inc.). A total extract of 50 to 100 μg was routinely resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroeluted onto polyvinylidene fluoride filters (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Yeast cells were resuspended in 0.2 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.8, and fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then spotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and finally in acetone. After drying, the membranes were mounted on scanning electron microscopy stubs and then coated with gold. Scanning electron microscopy was performed on a Philips XL30 scanning electron microscope. Proteasome purification was accomplished using protein A-tagged Pre1p. Details of this procedure are provided elsewhere (12Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The separation of proteasomes by density gradient sedimentation was done centrifuging 50 mg of whole cell protein, obtained in Buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm ATP) and applied over a 10–40% continuous glycerol gradient. The gradients were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm in an AH-627-2A Beckman rotor for 22 h at 4 °C. Assays of proteasome activity were done as described in Glickmanet al. (11Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of purified proteasomes were incubated in Buffer A with 0.1 mm Suc-LLVY-AMC (Bachem) for 30 min at 30 °C. 1% SDS was added to quench the reaction, and released (AMC) fluorescence was read at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. Proteasomes were resolved by non-denaturing PAGE (11Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the bands were visualized upon incubation of the gels in 10 ml of 0.1 mm Suc-LLVY-AMC in Buffer A for 30 min at 30 °C. Yeast cultures (1010cells) were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, washed, and resuspended in HB buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 60 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin) and broken with 2 volumes of acid-washed glass beads. 60 μg of extract was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of H1 histone (0.5 mg/ml) and [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm, 100 cpm/pmol). Reaction was stopped by the addition of one volume of 2× sample buffer, and samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. As a part of the yeast genome sequencing project our group described an open reading frame named YDL097c (D2381) (33Boskovic J. Soler-Mira A. Garcia-Cantalejo J.M. Ballesta J.P. Jimenez A. Remacha M. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which was later identified as a component of the proteasome RP named Rpn6p (11Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize this proteasome subunit, a cassette was constructed containing the kanr gene flanked by 40 nucleotides from the 5′ and 3′ ends of RPN6, respectively, to direct the disruption of the gene in diploid strains FY1679 and CEN.PK2. After transformation, geneticin-resistant colonies were selected, and the correct integration of the cassette into the genome was confirmed by PCR (data not shown). Transformants from both genetic backgrounds were chosen for sporulation and tetrad analysis. In all tetrads dissected, the four spores segregated in a 2:2 ratio of viable versus non-viable spores (Fig.1 A). As expected, all the viable spores were sensitive to geneticin, indicating that they did not carry the disruption marker. This result indicates that Rpn6p function is essential for either vegetative growth or spore germination. Heterozygous RPN6-disrupted diploids (FS6D6) were transformed with the centromeric plasmid pFC8-G6, which directs the expression of RPN6 under the control of the GAL1promoter, and allowed to sporulate and then tetrads were dissected. As expected from the previous results, only two colonies per tetrad grew on glucose whereas all four spores formed colonies on galactose plates (data not shown). Geneticin-resistant haploid cellsrpn6-Δ1 from strain FSD61 stopped cell division after prolonged incubation in the restrictive glucose-containing medium (Fig.1 B), allowing further study of the function of Rpn6p. Initially, the depletion of Rpn6p on glucose in these mutants was studied. A His6-tagged version of Rpn6p was cloned in the same centromeric plasmid under the control of the GAL1promoter as explained above, and the same procedure was followed to obtain strain FSD641, which conditionally expresses His6-Rpn6p on galacto"

A Gβγ binding site of GRK2 is localized in the carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. This Gβγ binding site of GRK2 also regulates Gβγ-stimulated signaling by sequestering free Gβγ subunits. We report here that truncation of the carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding site of GRK2 did not abolish the Gβγ regulatory activity of GRK2 as determined by the inhibition of a Gβγ-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates in cells. This finding suggested the presence of a second Gβγ binding site in GRK2. And indeed, the amino terminus of GRK2 (GRK21–185) inhibited a Gβγ-stimulated inositol phosphate signal in cells, purified GRK21–185 suppressed the Gβγ-stimulated phosphorylation of rhodopsin, and GRK21–185 bound directly to purified Gβγ subunits. The amino-terminal Gβγ regulatory site does not overlap with the RGS domain of GRK-2 because GRK21–53 with truncated RGS domain inhibited Gβγ-mediated signaling with similar potency and efficacy as did GRK21–185.

Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Google Scholar). GRKs are modular proteins consisting of at least three structural domains with different functions. The core kinase domain of GRK2 and GRK3, which represents the β-adrenergic receptor kinase isozymes, is flanked by an amino-terminal domain, which contains an RGS domain, and a carboxyl-terminal domain, which contains a pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain) (2Carman C.V. Parent J.-L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar, 3Sallese M. Mariggio S. D'Urbano E.

The activation of GRK2 and GRK3 requires the activation and dissociation of a heterotrimeric G-protein,i.e. the kinases are activated by free Gβγ subunits (5Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B.

Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2180-2185Google Scholar). A Gβγ binding site of GRK2 and GRK3 is localized in the carboxyl terminus of the kinase and overlaps the PH domain (7Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Google Scholar). Truncation of the PH domain of GRK2 generates a kinase with compromised regulation by Gβγ subunits (7Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding site of GRK2 also regulates Gβγ-stimulated signaling by sequestering free Gβγ subunits (8Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Google Scholar). Analyzing the Gβγ regulatory activity of proteins is a means of identifying Gβγ-binding proteins or localizing Gβγ binding sites of proteins (9Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Touhara K. van Biesen T.

Quitterer U. Weber C.K. Gierschik P. Lohse M.J. Rapp U.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 971-974Google Scholar). To find out whether the Gβγ regulatory activity of GRK2 resides entirely in the carboxyl-terminal PH domain, we analyzed the Gβγ-sequestering activity of wild-type GRK2 and of carboxyl-terminal-truncated GRK2 mutants. The capacity of those proteins to inhibit a Gβγ-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates mediated by activation of phospholipase Cβ2was determined (12Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P. Nature. 1992; 360: 684-686Google Scholar). We report here that truncation of the carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding site of GRK2 did not abolish the Gβγ regulatory activity of GRK2. A previously unrecognized Gβγ binding site of GRK2 was identified in the amino terminus of GRK2 that enhances the kinase activity of GRK2 toward the receptor substrate rhodopsin and which inhibits Gβγ-stimulated signaling. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were cultured and transfected as described previously (13AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Google Scholar) with plasmids encoding human GRK2 or the indicated truncation mutants of GRK2 or GRK5. The mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction and were sequenced entirely to confirm the identity of the mutants. Total inositol phosphate levels of HEK-293 cells were determined as described (13AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Google Scholar). For determination of the Gβγ regulatory activity of wild-type GRK2 and of the different truncation mutants, cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated GRK2 mutants and phospholipase Cβ2, Gβ1, and Gγ2 (11Slupsky J.R. Quitterer U. Weber C.K. Gierschik P. Lohse M.J. Rapp U.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 971-974Google Scholar). Human GRK2 was expressed in Sf9 cells using a recombinant baculovirus. GRK2 was purified by SP- Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose according to established protocols (14Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Google Scholar, 15AbdAlla S. Zaki E. Lother H. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26079-26084Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of GRK2 (GRK21–185), GRK21–53, GRK254–185, and GRK51–200 were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The kinase activity of GRK2 was assessed by phosphorylation of the receptor substrate rhodopsin in a total volume of 50 μl of buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4) containing 20 nm GRK2, Gβγ subunits as indicated, 400 nm rhodopsin, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation was initiated by light and proceeded for 20 min at room temperature. After SDS-PAGE, receptor phosphorylation was assessed by autoradiography. Rhodopsin-enriched membranes were prepared from dark-adapted bovine retinae by sucrose gradient centrifugation (14Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Google Scholar). To determine the activation of GRK2 by Gβγ subunits, various concentrations of purified Gβγ subunits from bovine brain were incubated in the phosphorylation mixture (16Müller S. Hekman M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10439-10443Google Scholar). To assess the effect of antibodies specifically cross-reacting with the amino terminus or with the carboxyl terminus of GRK2, polyclonal anti-GRK2 antibodies were immunoselected by affinity chromatography on GRK21–185or on GRK2561–689, respectively, covalently coupled to Affi-Gel-10 (13AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Google Scholar). The purified antibodies were incubated in the phosphorylation mixture as indicated. Specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibodies with GRK21–185 or with GRK2561–689 were analyzed in immunoblot. Proteins were separated on SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and identified in immunoblot similarly as described (17AbdAlla S. Lother H. el Massiery A. Quitterer U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for GRK2 or for Gβ have been characterized previously (14Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Google Scholar, 18Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10626-10631Google Scholar). Purified GST-GRK21–185 (100 nm) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with Gβγ subunits (3 nm) in a total volume of 500 μl of buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After extensive washing with the same buffer, bound Gβγ subunits were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and identified in immunoblot with Gβ-specific antibodies. As a control, GST-GRK51–200was used instead of GST-GRK21–185. The Gβγ-mediated enhancement of the pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαo was performed with 8 nm Gαoand 12 nm Gβγ in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations (10 nm–3 μm) of GST-GRK21–185, GST-GRK21–53, or GST-GRK254–185 similarly as described previously (19Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal PH domain of GRK2 is essential for the Gβγ-dependent phosphorylation of receptor substrates by GRK2 (7Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Google Scholar). Furthermore, PH domains can regulate Gβγ-stimulated signaling by sequestering free Gβγ subunits (9Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Touhara K. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12984-12989Google Scholar). To analyze whether the PH domain of GRK2 is entirely responsible for the Gβγ regulatory activity of GRK2, the PH domain of GRK2 was truncated, and the Gβγ regulatory activity of the truncated GRK2 mutant (GRK21–558CVLL) was analyzed in intact cells by determining the inhibition of a Gβγ-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates mediated by activation of phospholipase Cβ2 (11Slupsky J.R. Quitterer U. Weber C.K. Gierschik P. Lohse M.J. Rapp U.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 971-974Google Scholar, 12Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P. Nature. 1992; 360: 684-686Google Scholar). To exclude that a cytosolic localization of the truncated GRK2 mutant prevented the interaction with membrane-anchored Gβγ subunits in cells, a membrane-anchoring CAAX motif was introduced in GRK21–558CVLL similarly as described (7Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Google Scholar). Wild-type GRK2, the carboxyl-terminal-truncated mutant GRK21–558CVLL, and the carboxyl terminus of GRK2 containing the PH domain, GRK2561–689, were expressed in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1 A,lanes 1–3) and analyzed for their Gβγ regulatory activity (Fig. 1 B). Wild-type GRK2 and GRK21–558CVLL inhibited the Gβγ-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates (Fig. 1 B, columns 1 and2 versus c). GRK2561–689comprising the PH domain of GRK2 also significantly decreased the Gβγ-stimulated signal (Fig. 1 B, column 3). Expression levels of Gβγ and of phospholipase Cβ2were similar in the different experiments (not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that the PH domain of GRK2 inhibits Gβγ-stimulated signaling in cells but that the Gβγ regulatory activity of GRK2 is not entirely mediated by the carboxyl-terminal PH domain. To identify the additional domain involved in the Gβγ regulatory activity of GRK2, GRK21–558CVLL was further truncated. In GRK21–485 the entire carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding site of GRK2 was truncated (7Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Google Scholar). Wild-type GRK2 and GRK21–485 were expressed in HEK-293 cells (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and2). Full-length GRK2 (Fig. 2 B, column 1) and the truncated mutant GRK21–485 significantly inhibited the Gβγ-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates (Fig.2 B, column 2 versus column c). The inhibition of the Gβγ-stimulated signal was not dependent on the introduction of a membrane-anchoring CAAX motif in GRK21–485CVLL (Fig. 2, A and B,lane 3, column 3). The carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding domain of GRK2, GRK2495–689, was also expressed (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). GRK2495–689inhibited the Gβγ-stimulated signal similarly to GRK21–485, confirming the Gβγ regulatory capacity of the carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding site of GRK2 (Fig. 2 B,column 4). Together, these findings demonstrate that truncation of the carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding site of GRK2 does not abolish the Gβγ regulatory activity of this kinase, suggesting that GRK2 contains a previously unrecognized Gβγ binding site in addition to the carboxyl-terminal site. In search for the second Gβγ binding site of GRK2, the Gβγ regulatory effect of the amino-terminal domain of GRK2 was analyzed. GRK21–185 was expressed in HEK-293 cells (Fig.3 A, upper panel,lane 1). GRK21–185 inhibited the Gβγ-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates by ∼40% similarly to GRK21–485 (Fig. 3 A, column 1 versus c and cf. Fig. 2 B). Again the Gβγ regulatory activity was independent of a CAAXmembrane-anchoring motif (Fig. 3 A, lane 2,column 2). As a control, the amino-terminal domain of GRK5 was expressed (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2) because GRK5 has been reported to phosphorylate receptor substrates independently of the addition of Gβγ subunits (20Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Google Scholar). GRK51–200 or GRK51–200CVLL did not significantly affect the Gβγ-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates under the applied experimental conditions (Fig. 3 B, columns 1 and2 versus c). In contrast, the amino terminus of GRK2 lacking the receptor interacting site (21Yu Q. Cheng Zhi Gan Y. Bao G. Li L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1222-1227Google Scholar), GRK215–185, inhibited the Gβγ-stimulated signal similarly as did GRK21–185(Fig. 3 B, column 3, versus Fig.3 A). The expression levels of GRK51–200, of GRK51–200CVLL, and of GRK215–185 were similar when determined in immunoblot with antibodies specific for GRK5 or for GRK2 (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lanes 1–3). Thus, the amino-terminal domain of GRK2 contains a Gβγ regulatory site, which is apparently absent in GRK5. Because GRK21–185 regulated Gβγ-stimulated signaling in intact cells, we asked whether purified GRK21–185 interacted with Gβγ subunits directly. GRK21–185 was purified as a GST fusion protein and tested for the inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated rhodopsin phosphorylation. Purified GST-GRK21–185 inhibited the GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin stimulated by 30 nm Gβγ (IC50: 340 ± 30 nm, Fig.4 A). GST as a control did not affect the phosphorylation of rhodopsin at concentrations <10 μm (not shown). These findings demonstrate that the amino-terminal domain of GRK2 regulates a Gβγ-stimulated signal in cells and in vitro. To further confirm that the amino-terminal domain of GRK2 interacts directly with Gβγ subunits, binding of GST- GRK21–185 to Gβγ subunits was measured. GST-GRK21–185 or GST-GRK51–200 as a control were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with purified Gβγ subunits. Bound Gβγ subunits were eluted and detected in immunoblot with Gβ-specific antibodies (Fig. 4 B). Although under the experimental conditions Gβγ subunits did not bind in significant amounts to GST-GRK51–200, which was used as a control (Fig. 4 B, lane 1, column 1), the amino-terminal domain of GRK2, GST-GRK21–185, interacted specifically with Gβγ subunits (Fig. 4 B,lane 2, column 2), i.e. nearly 100% of the loaded Gβγ subunits were bound by the GST-GRK21–185-Sepharose (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). Together these findings demonstrate that GRK21–185 binds directly to Gβγ subunits. Thus, GRK2 contains a second Gβγ binding site in the amino terminus in addition to the carboxyl-terminal PH domain. The carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding domain of GRK2 is essential for the Gβγ-dependent stimulation of the kinase activity toward receptor substrates (7Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Google Scholar). Does the amino-terminal Gβγ binding domain also affect the kinase activity of GRK2? To determine the effect of the amino terminus on the kinase activity, the amino-terminal Gβγ binding domain of GRK2 was targeted with immunoselected antibodies. The purified polyclonal antibodies used for this experiment specifically cross-reacted with GRK21–185but did not interact with the carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding domain of GRK2 as determined in immunoblot (not shown). The presence of 100 nm antibodies to the amino terminus of GRK2 suppressed the Gβγ-stimulated (10–40 nm) phosphorylation of rhodopsin by 20 nm GRK2 (Fig. 5,B, lanes 1–3, versus A,lanes 1–3), suggesting that the amino terminus of GRK2 is involved in phosphorylating rhodopsin. To analyze whether the antibodies interfered with the binding of Gβγ subunits to the amino terminus of GRK2, the concentration of the purified Gβγ subunits was increased (Fig. 5, A andB, lanes 4–7). Gβγ stimulated the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by GRK2 in the absence of antibodies (EC50 = 38 ± 7 nm, Fig. 5 A). The presence of 100 nm antibodies specifically cross-reacting with the amino terminus of GRK2 increased the EC50 value of Gβγ in stimulating GRK2-mediated rhodopsin phosphorylation more than 20-fold (Fig. 5, B versus A), but the Gβγ subunits were capable of reversing the antibody-mediated inhibition of the GRK2-induced rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). A higher concentration of the antibodies (250 nm) further increased the EC50 value of Gβγ in stimulating GRK2 (not shown). As a control, unrelated antibodies not cross-reactive with GRK2 did not affect the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by GRK2 (not shown). Together these findings provide strong evidence that the antibodies compete with Gβγ subunits for binding to the amino terminus of GRK2, thereby preventing the stimulatory interaction of Gβγ with the amino terminus. The interaction of Gβγ with the amino-terminal Gβγ binding domain of GRK2 may thus contribute to the Gβγ-dependence of GRK2. To differentiate between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding sites of GRK2, the effect of domain-specific antibodies to the carboxyl terminus was assessed in the rhodopsin phosphorylation assay. Antibodies specifically cross-reacting with the carboxyl-terminal domain, GRK2561–689 (anti-C), inhibited the stimulatory effect of Gβγ at concentrations ranging from 20 nm to 1 μm (Fig.6 A). Interestingly, these antibodies did not alter the GRK2-mediated rhodopsin phosphorylation in the presence of less than 20 nm Gβγ as did the antibodies cross-reacting with the amino terminus (Fig. 6 A versus Fig. 5 B). Considering that these low Gβγ concentrations in the rhodopsin phosphorylation assay are achieved without the addition of purified Gβγ because the Gβγ subunits come from the rhodopsin-enriched membranes as determined in immunoblot (not shown), this finding is in good agreement with previous observations; a GRK2 mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding site is capable of phosphorylating rhodopsin but lacks the Gβγ-enhancing effect exerted by the addition of purified Gβγ subunits (7Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal Gβγ binding sites of GRK2 are functionally different. The GRK2 activity that was not blocked by the carboxyl-terminal-specific antibodies was still Gβγ-dependent because increasing concentrations of Gβ-specific antibodies used as Gβγ scavenger inhibited the residual rhodopsin phosphorylation entirely (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained with several other Gβγ-binding proteins such as Gαo or the Raf kinase (not shown). Because the carboxyl-terminal-specific antibodies did not interfere with the Gβγ scavenger (Fig. 6 B), these findings reveal again the second Gβγ binding site in GRK2, which is distinct from the carboxyl-terminal site (Fig. 6 B). For comparison, antibodies to the amino terminus of GRK2 inhibited the GRK2-mediated rhodopsin phosphorylation under similar conditions in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6 C). As controls, the antibodies to the amino terminus of GRK2 did not bind Gβγ (not shown), and carboxyl-terminal antibodies did not interfere with the inhibition exerted by the amino-terminal-specific antibodies (Fig. 6 C). Thus, the second Gβγ binding site in the amino terminus of GRK2 is functionally different from the carboxyl-terminal site and is involved in rhodopsin phosphorylation at low concentrations of Gβγ (<20 nm). The amino terminus of GRK2 contains a previously identified RGS domain (Ref. 2Carman C.V. Parent J.-L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar and 3Sallese M. Mariggio S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar and Fig.7D). Does the RGS domain overlap with the amino-terminal Gβγ binding domain? Two different GST fusion proteins were prepared, GST-GRK21–53 and GST-GRK254–185, encompassing the RGS domain (Fig.7 D). Although GRK21–53 inhibited the Gβγ-stimulated phosphorylation of rhodopsin by GRK2 similarly to GRK21–185 (Fig. 7 A, upper panel versus Fig. 4 A), the RGS domain, GRK254–185, had no significant effect when applied at similar concentrations (Fig. 7 A, lower panel). This finding strongly suggests that the RGS domain and the amino-terminal Gβγ regulatory site of GRK2 do not overlap. In addition to the Gβγ binding site, GRK21–53 contains other regulatory sites such as a receptor interacting site (21Yu Q. Cheng Zhi Gan Y. Bao G. Li L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1222-1227Google Scholar) or a calmodulin binding site (22Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that GRK21–53 interfered with the kinase activity of GRK2 in a Gβγ-independent manner, we analyzed the Gβγ regulatory effects of this protein in another Gβγ-dependent assay, the Gβγ-mediated enhancement of the pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαo (19Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Google Scholar). GRK21–53inhibited the enhancing effect of Gβγ on the ADP-ribosylation of Gαo (Fig. 7 B) with similar potency and efficacy as did GRK21–185 (IC50, 290 ± 20 and 360 ± 30 nm of GRK21–53 and GRK21–185, respectively). In contrast, the RGS domain, GRK254–185, had no significant effect at concentrations <1 μm (Fig. 7 B). Thus, GRK21–53encompasses the functionally important portion of the amino-terminal Gβγ regulatory site of GRK2, whereas the RGS domain of GRK2, GRK254–185, did not interfere significantly with Gβγ binding. The in vitro findings were confirmed in cells. Although GRK21–53 inhibited Gβγ-stimulated signaling similarly to GRK21–185, the RGS domain GRK254–185 did not affect the Gβγ-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates mediated by PLC-β2 (Fig.7 C, first through fourth columns). By contrast, the RGS domain-containing GRK21–185 and GRK254–185 efficiently inhibited a Gαq-stimulated inositol phosphate signal mediated by PLC-β1 that was not affected by GRK21–53(Fig. 7 C, fifth through eighth columns). The kinase activity of GRK2 and GRK3 toward receptor substrates is strongly enhanced by Gβγ subunits. The Gβγ dependence links the kinase activity of these GRKs to the activation of a heterotrimeric G-protein. A carboxyl-terminal PH domain in GRK2 and GRK3 is essentially involved in the Gβγ dependence of GRKs (7Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Google Scholar). Here we present strong evidence that the amino-terminal domain of GRK2 contains a second Gβγ binding site that contributes to the regulation of GRK2 by low concentrations of Gβγ subunits; (i) the amino terminus of GRK2 inhibited Gβγ-stimulated signaling in cells and in vitro, (ii) GRK21–185 interacted directly with purified Gβγ subunits, (iii) targeting of the amino-terminal Gβγ binding domain of GRK2 by site-directed antibodies suppressed the GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin, and (iv) this inhibition was released by an excess of free Gβγ subunits. The amino terminus of GRK2 contains several important structural elements, an RGS-domain affecting Gαq-stimulated signaling (2Carman C.V. Parent J.-L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar, 3Sallese M. Mariggio S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar), a calmodulin binding site (22Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Google Scholar), which is regulated by protein kinase C phosphorylation (23Krasel C. Dammeier S. Winstel R. Brockmann J. Mischak H. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1911-1915Google Scholar), and a receptor interacting site (21Yu Q. Cheng Zhi Gan Y. Bao G. Li L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1222-1227Google Scholar). A receptor interacting site and a calmodulin binding site were also localized in the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 (22Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Google Scholar, 24Gan X. Wang J. Yang Q. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Google Scholar). These functional similarities of the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal domains of GRK2 are complemented by the localization of a previously unrecognized Gβγ binding site in the amino terminus of GRK2. The novel amino-terminal Gβγ binding site is involved in the Gβγ dependence of GRK2 in addition to the carboxyl terminus. A topological model of GRK2 appears to consist of a core kinase domain flanked by two structurally and functionally different Gβγ binding domains. With two Gβγ binding sites, GRK2 activity is tightly controlled by Gβγ subunits over a wide concentration range. Thereby Gβγ subunits translate the intensity of a G-protein-stimulated signal into GRK2 activity to switch off the signal-generating receptor. Apart from the functional importance of the newly identified Gβγ binding site in the amino terminus of GRK2, this domain may constitute a novel target allowing the selective inhibition of GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation by pharmacological tools. Site-directed antibodies to the kinase amino terminus suppressed the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by GRK2. Because such an inhibition was released by the addition of an excess of Gβγ subunits, blockade of GRK2 activity by pharmacological compounds binding to the amino terminus of GRK2 would be reversed upon excessive G-protein activation, i.e.Gβγ release. The proposed mechanism could allow the design of fine-tuning GRK inhibitors, which would amplify low threshold signals and maintain desensitization of excessive stimuli. Additional experiments will have to identify such compounds to validate the proposed principle under physiological conditions. We thank C. Dees for purification of rhodopsin, GRK2, Gβγ, and Gαo and M. Fischer for insect cell culture."
https://openalex.org/W2021399470,"The GTPase dynamin-2 (dyn-2) binds and positively regulates the nitric oxide-generating enzyme, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) (Cao, S., Yao, Y., McCabe, T., Yao, Q., Katusic, Z., Sessa, W., and Shah, V. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 14249–14256). Here we demonstrate, using purified proteins, that this occurs through a selective influence of the dyn-2 proline-rich domain (dyn-2 PRD) on the eNOS reductase domain. In vitro studies demonstrate that dyn-2 PRD fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) binds recombinant eNOS protein specifically and with binding kinetics comparable with that observed between dyn-2 full-length and eNOS. Additionally, GST-dyn-2 PRD binds the in vitro transcribed35S-eNOS reductase domain but not the 35S-eNOS oxygenase domain. Furthermore GST-dyn-2 PRD binds a35S-labeled eNOS reductase domain fragment (amino acids 645–850) that partially overlaps with the FAD binding domain of eNOS. A recombinant form of the SH3-containing protein Fyn competes the binding of recombinant eNOS protein with dyn-2 PRD, thereby implicating the SH3-like region contained within this reductase domain fragment as the dyn-2 binding region. Mammalian two-hybrid screen corroborates these interactions in cells as well. Functional studies demonstrate that dyn-2 PRD selectively potentiates eNOS activity in a concentration-dependent manner in an order of magnitude similar to that observed with dyn-2 full-length and in a manner that requires calmodulin. Although dyn-2 PRD does not influence eNOS oxygenase domain function or ferricyanide reduction, it does potentiate the ability of recombinant eNOS to reduce cytochrome c, supporting an influence of dyn-2 PRD on electron transfer between FAD and FMN. (These data indicate that the binding domains of dyn-2 and eNOS reside within the dyn-2 PRD domain and the FAD binding region of the eNOS reductase domains, respectively, and that dyn-2 PRD is sufficient to mediate dyn-2-dependent potentiation of eNOS activity, at least in part, by potentiating electron transfer.) The GTPase dynamin-2 (dyn-2) binds and positively regulates the nitric oxide-generating enzyme, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) (Cao, S., Yao, Y., McCabe, T., Yao, Q., Katusic, Z., Sessa, W., and Shah, V.

Indeed, specific proteins have been identified which interact with eNOS, thereby regulating enzyme function, including the large GTPase, dynamin-2 (dyn-2) (8Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Google Scholar, 9Gratton J.-P. Fontana J. O'Connor D. Garcia-Cardena G. McCabe T. Sessa W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22268-22272Google Scholar, 10Garcia-Cardena G.

With regard to the latter, it has been demonstrated that dyn-2 specifically binds eNOS in a direct manner and potentiates the ability of eNOS to convertl-arginine to l-citrulline in a concentration-dependent manner (12Cao S. Yao Y. McCabe T. Yao Q. Katusic Z. Sessa W. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14249-14256Google Scholar). However, delineation of binding domains and the mechanism of activation remain unexplored. eNOS is a bi-domain enzyme that requires a number of cofactors and substrates to generate NO optimally via an orchestrated electron transfer mechanism (1Stuehr D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Google Scholar). An oxygenase domain (amino acids 1–491) contains binding sites for tetrahydrobiopterin, heme, andl-arginine, and a reductase domain (amino acids 492–1205) contains binding sites for calmodulin, FMN, FAD, and NADPH (1Stuehr D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Google Scholar). Electron flux is initiated at the reductase domain where NADPH-derived electrons are transferred sequentially through the bound flavins, FAD and FMN. Electron transfer from the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain is facilitated by calmodulin and allows for reduction of heme iron and the ensuing binding and activation of oxygen. Subsequent oxidation of the amino group of l-arginine allows for the formation of l-citrulline, water, and NO (1Stuehr D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Google Scholar). Assessment of the individual reductase and oxygenase components of this biochemical paradigm allows for mechanistic dissection of how eNOS is influenced by putative regulatory events. Specifically, eNOS reductase domain function can be dissected in isolation from the oxygenase domain by exploiting the ability of moieties within this domain to transfer electrons to exogenous heme protein acceptors (13McCabe T. Fulton D. Roman L. Sessa W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Google Scholar, 14Ghosh S. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Wu C. Lisanti M. Stuehr D. J. Biol.

Specifically, the rate of electron transfer from NADPH to FAD can be estimated by utilizing the electron acceptor ferricyanide (FeCN), which accepts electrons directly from the FAD; the rate of electron transfer from FAD to FMN can be estimated by utilizing the exogenous electron acceptor cytochrome c (15Roman L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Google Scholar). Conversely, oxygenase domain function can be analyzed, independent of reductase domain-dependent heme reduction, by measuring NO synthesis from the NOS enzyme reaction intermediate N ω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA) (14Ghosh S. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Wu C. Lisanti M. Stuehr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22267-22271Google Scholar, 18Gachhui R. Ghosh D. Wu C. Parkinson J. Crane B. Stuehr D.

Members of the dynamin family of proteins, including dyn-2, are recognized as modulators of membrane scission events (20Oh P. McIntosh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Google Scholar). However, these proteins also facilitate specific and well characterized signaling functions by virtue of distinct protein interactions (21Urrutia R. Henley J. Cook T. McNiven M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Google Scholar). In this regard, the dyn-2 protein consists of several characterized subdomains: the GTPase domain (amino acids 1–399), pleckstrin homology domain (PHD; amino acids 521–623), GTPase effector domain (GED; amino acids 623–746), and the proline-rich domain (PRD; amino acids 746–870). Each of these domains maintains distinct functions, and they act in concert to facilitate the cellular functions of dyn-2 (22McNiven M. Cell. 1998; 94: 151-154Google Scholar). The GTPase domain is responsible for the binding and hydrolysis of GTP, events that are promoted by GED. PHD and PRD regions are prominently implicated in regulatory binding interactions. More specifically, PHD binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, whereas PRD binds specific proteins, often notable for the presence of an SH3 domain, including phospholipase Cγ, Nck, AP-2, Grb2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (23McClure S.

Biopolymers. 1998; 43: 383-400Google Scholar). Here we seek to elucidate further interaction regulation mechanisms of dyn-2 and eNOS, using recombinant proteins. The present study demonstrates that dyn-2 binds eNOS by virtue of dyn-2 PRD and conversely that the binding domain of dyn-2 on eNOS is contained within its reductase domain, specifically within a sequence overlapping the FAD binding domain. This interaction is competed by the SH3-containing protein Fyn, thereby implicating the SH3-like region within this eNOS reductase domain fragment as the dyn-2 PRD binding site. Furthermore, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-dyn-2 PRD potentiates eNOS activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with potency similar to that of the full-length protein and in a manner that requires bound calmodulin. Analysis of individual NOS subdomain function demonstrates that although GST-dyn-2 PRD does not influence eNOS oxygenase domain function independently, it does influence eNOS reductase domain activity by potentiating electron transfer between the reductase domain flavins, FAD and FMN. Thus these studies provide mechanistic insights as to how dyn-2 enhances eNOS protein function in vitro. Recombinant eNOS protein was purified fromEscherichia coli as we and others have described previously (12Cao S. Yao Y. McCabe T. Yao Q. Katusic Z. Sessa W. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14249-14256Google Scholar, 31Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L. Gross S. Sessa W. Masters B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Google Scholar). In brief, bovine eNOS in the plasmid pCW was coexpressed with pGroELS plasmid into protease-deficient E. coli. eNOS was purified from extracts using a 2′,5′-ADP affinity column with high purity as evidenced by a single major band on SDS-PAGE. Purified eNOS was stabilized with 0.5 mm l-arginine and 5-fold molar excess of tetrahydrobiopterin. Dyn-2 and dyn-2 subdomain constructs (provided courtesy of Mark McNiven) were subcloned into the GST fusion protein vector, pGEX-1. GST constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3) and purified as we described previously (12Cao S. Yao Y. McCabe T. Yao Q. Katusic Z. Sessa W. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14249-14256Google Scholar). Specificity and quality of GST-dyn-2 subdomain constructs were assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels as shown in Fig. 1 A. These constructs have been documented previously to be functional forin vitro assays of binding and activity, including assessment of GTPase activity, molecular interaction, microtubule responsiveness, and polymeric assembly (21Urrutia R. Henley J. Cook T. McNiven M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Google Scholar, 32McNiven M. Kim L. Krueger E. Orth J. Cao H. Wong T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 187-198Google Scholar). eNOS oxygenase and reductase subdomain constructs were generated from the full-length bovine eNOS (bovine eNOS was courtesy of Bill Sessa), using PCR with primers incorporating restriction endonuclease cutting sites forHindIII and EcoRI, whereas the reductase domain fragments encoding amino acids 511–850, 511–645, and 645–850 were generated by PCR with primers flanked by EcoRI andXhoI restriction endonuclease cutting sites. Individual subdomains and fragments were subcloned into the vector pcDNA3. [35S]Methionine-labeled eNOS full-length or subdomains were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using the TnT coupled reticulocye lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) as we described previously (12Cao S. Yao Y. McCabe T. Yao Q. Katusic Z. Sessa W. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14249-14256Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. In brief, the reaction mix, containing vectors encoding bovine full-length, subdomains, or reductase domain fragments of eNOS DNA (or alternatively negative control containing no DNA), T7 RNA polymerase, and [35S]methionine, was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Translation products were examined by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography of dried gels. Purity and specificity of these reagents are shown in the autoradiograph in Fig. 2, B andD. Recombinant Fyn was obtained from PanVera (Madison, WI).Figure 2GST-dyn-2 PRD binds with an SH3-like sequence within the reductase domain of eNOS. Purified recombinant eNOS derived from E. coli or alternatively, 35S-eNOS full-length, oxygenase, and reductase domain fragments were transcribedin vitro and incubated with GST-dyn-2 full-length or one of its subdomains (GTPase, PHD, GED, PRD). In some experiments, increasing amounts of recombinant Fyn were also added to the reaction mix. Binding was assessed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of dried gels, Western blot analysis, and Coomassie staining of gels, as indicated.A, physical maps of the eNOS constructs utilized for mapping of the domain contributing to the interaction between eNOS and dyn-2. The numbers shown on the top of eachbox correspond to amino acid residues. B, autoradiograph of SDS-PAGE demonstrates the purity and specificity of35S-eNOS full-length, reductase, and oxygenase subdomains as assessed by a single dominant band of the correct molecular size for each protein. C, a representative SDS-PAGE autoradiograph shows that GST-dyn-2 PRD binds the 35S-eNOS full-length (top panel) and 35S-eNOS reductase domain (middle panel) but not the 35S-eNOS oxygenase domain (bottom panel). Note that other dyn-2 subdomains do not bind 35S-eNOS full-length or eNOS subdomains. The radiograph is representative of three independent experiments that yielded comparable results. D, a representative SDS-PAGE autoradiograph shows that GST-dyn-2 PRD binds 35S-eNOS 511–850 (lane 2) and 35S-eNOS 645–850 (lane 4) but not eNOS 511–645 (lane 6).Lanes 1, 3, and 5 depict the input of the respective 35S-eNOS fragments in the binding assay.E, the sequence of the putative SH3 domain of eNOS contained within the region that binds with dyn-2 PRD is shown in comparison with SH3 domains from phospholipase Cγ, Nck, and Fyn (white boxes denote identical amino acids residues between eNOS and the SH3 domains of phospholipase Cγ, Nck, and Fyn). Comparison was made using SeqWeb Version 1.2. F, a representative Western blot using eNOS monoclonal antibody and Fyn monoclonal antibody is shown and demonstrates that when added at increasing concentrations, recombinant Fyn competes with purified recombinant eNOS protein for binding with GST dyn-2 PRD (lanes 2–8). Lane 1 indicates the eNOS input in the binding reactions; lane 9 indicates the maximum Fyn input in the binding reactions.

For competition experiments, a fixed amount of recombinant eNOS (3 pmol) was incubated with varying amounts of recombinant Fyn (0–15 pmol) and with GST beads that contained 10 pmol of GST-dyn-2 PRD, or alternatively GST beads alone, overnight at 4 °C in 300 μl of binding buffer. Bound proteins were washed three times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, then eluted with Laemmli buffer and used for gel electrophoresis. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, using an eNOS monoclonal antibody and a Fyn monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) (33Shah V. Haddad F. Garcia-Cardena G. Frangos J. Mennone A. Groszmann R. Sessa W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2923-2930Google Scholar). In vitro binding of GST-fused dyn-2 subdomain proteins with in vitro transcribed35S-eNOS subdomains and reductase domain fragments was examined by incubating 15 pmol of GST-dyn-2 beads or GST beads alone with a fixed concentration of in vitro translated eNOS (3 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate) in 300 μl, using incubation and wash conditions identical to those described above. Bound35S-eNOS was examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of dried gels. Calculation of the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was performed by incubating a fixed concentration of GST-dyn-2 or GST-dyn-2 PRD beads (5 nm) with purified recombinant eNOS (0–640 nm), premixed with proportionate volume of 35S-eNOS (0–32 μl) used as a radiolabel tracer in a 300-μl reaction mix. Previous analyses performed over a logarithmic range of immobilized GST-dyn-2 protein concentrations (5–45 nm) incubated with saturating concentrations of eNOS ligand have demonstrated that varying the concentration of immobilized GST-dynamin in this experimental protocol does not affect the Kd estimation (12Cao S. Yao Y. McCabe T. Yao Q. Katusic Z. Sessa W. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14249-14256Google Scholar). Quantitation of bound and free 35S-eNOS, assessed directly by scintillation counting, allowed for determination of bound and free recombinant eNOS. Radioactive counts detected after incubation of GST beads with 35S-eNOS, which were of low level, were attributed to background and were subtracted from all subsequent values. Kd was calculated by Scatchard plot analysis of bound and free levels of recombinant eNOS. A GAL4-based mammalian two-hybrid screen was used to detect subdomain interactions in HEK cells (34Fagan R. Flint K. Jones N. Cell. 1994; 78: 799-811Google Scholar). All tissue culture reagents for HEK cells were obtained from Invitrogen. pM and pVP16 vectors were used to create fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA binding domain and DNA activation domain, respectively (35Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Google Scholar) (mammalian two-hybrid matchmaker assay, Clontech). cDNA encoding eNOS full-length and subdomains and dyn-2 full-length and subdomains were subcloned into vectors pM and pVP16, respectively, using PCR with primers incorporating restriction endonuclease cutting sites forBamHI and XbaI, and HindIII andXbaI, respectively. cDNA encoding reductase domain fragments with amino acids 511–850, 511–645, and 645–850 were generated by PCR with primers incorporating restriction sites forEcoRI and BamHI and inserted into pM. HEK cells, grown in 12-well plates, were transfected with pM and pVP16 vectors (0.2 μg) containing appropriate inserts, as well as vectors encoding CAT and Renilla luciferase reporter vectors (0.1 μg and 0.01 μg, respectively). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection, and CAT reporter gene expression was quantified from cell lysates from triplicate wells using a spectrophotometric assay (CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Variation in transfection efficiency and protein concentration was corrected by normalizing CAT readings with Renillaluciferase values. Negative controls in each experiment included transfection with empty pM and pVP16 vectors. Positive controls in each experiment included transfection with pM-53, which encodes mouse p53 protein, and pVP16-T, which encodes SV40 large T-antigen, which is known to interact with p53. NOS activity from E. coli-derived recombinant eNOS protein was assessed by measuring the l-nitroarginine methylester (l-NAME)-inhibited conversion of 3H-labeledl-arginine to 3H-labeledl-citrulline, as we described previously (12Cao S. Yao Y. McCabe T. Yao Q. Katusic Z. Sessa W. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14249-14256Google Scholar). GST protein, GST-dyn-2, and subdomains were eluted from glutathione affinity beads with reduced glutathione and dialyzed. 6.25 pmol of GST-fused protein was incubated with 6.25 pmol of purified recombinant eNOS protein for 60 min at 4 °C in 300 μl of binding buffer identical to that described for in vitro binding assays. In some experiments the concentration of dyn-2 PRD protein was varied between 1.5 and 8 pmol to generate a molar range of 0.25:1, to 1.25:1, of dyn-2 PRD:eNOS. To determine NOS activity, duplicate samples of the preincubated recombinant proteins were added to a 50-μl reaction mix containing 1 mm NADPH, 3 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 100 nm calmodulin, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 μml-arginine andl-[3H]arginine (0.2 μCi) at 37 °C for 20 min. In some experiments the calmodulin concentration was varied from 0 to 100 nm. All samples were analyzed in the presence and absence of the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (1.0 mm) for specificity of effect. The reaction mix was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of cold stop buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 5.5) and passed over a Dowex AG 50W-X8 resin column. Radiolabeled counts/min of generatedl-citrulline were measured and used to determinel-NAME-inhibitable NOS activity. Components of reductase domain function were determined by measuring the ability of E. coli-derived recombinant eNOS to reduce cytochrome c and alternatively FeCN, in an NADPH-dependent manner using spectrophotometric assays (13McCabe T.

GST, GST-dyn-2, and GST-dyn-2 subdomains were eluted with reduced glutathione and dialyzed. 4 nm recombinant eNOS protein was incubated for 1 h with 4 nm GST-fused dyn-2 subdomain protein in 300 μl of reaction buffer buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl at 4 °C. In some experiments, assays were performed using varying concentrations of GST-dyn-2 PRD (2–7 nm) or alternatively, preboiled GST-dyn-2 PRD protein. For cytochrome c reduction assay, 100-μl aliquots from the preincubation mix were added to a 1-ml reaction containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 40 μm cytochrome c, 0.1 mm NADPH, 0.12 μm calmodulin, and 0.2 mm CaCl2. Cytochrome c reduction was measured at 550 nm at 25 °C, using a Beckman spectrophotometer with temperature control (model DU 650), with slight modification from the protocol described by McCabe et al. (13McCabe T. Fulton D. Roman L. Sessa W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was monitored for 60 s, immediately upon addition of the preincubated recombinant protein mix to the reaction buffer, a period during which the reduction rate was linear. The change in absorbance was calculated between the 30-s period of 10–40 s. Turnover number was calculated using the absorbance change during this 30-s interval and an extinction coefficient of 0.021 μm−1. For FeCN reduction assay, 100-μl aliquots from the preincubation protein mix were added to a 1-ml reaction buffer containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.12 μm calmodulin, 0.2 mmCaCl2. Reaction was initiated with the addition of 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, after which the reaction was monitored for 10 min at 420 nm at 25 °C. The turnover number was then calculated using an extinction coefficient of 1.02 mm−1. Selective, NADPH-independent function of the oxygenase domain was assessed by determining the ability of E. coli-derived recombinant eNOS to convert NOHA into nitrite (14Ghosh S. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Wu C. Lisanti M. Stuehr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22267-22271Google Scholar, 18Gachhui R. Ghosh D. Wu C. Parkinson J. Crane B. Stuehr D.

GST, GST-dyn-2, or GST-dyn-2 PRD was eluted from beads with reduced glutathione. After dialysis, 62 pmol of purified recombinant eNOS was preincubated with an equimolar concentration of the GST-fused protein in 60 mm EPPS for 90 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the preincubation mix were then added to a 100-μl reaction mix containing 60 mm EPPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm NOHA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4 μm tetrahydrobiopterin. The reaction was initiated by adding 30 mm H2O2 at 37 °C and stopped after 10 min by adding 1,300 units of catalase. To measure nitrite generation, 100 μl of Griess reagent was added to triplicate samples and incubated at room temperature for 15 min to allow for color development. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Nitrite production was quantified based on NaNO2 standards. All data are given as the means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using an unpaired Student's ttest. We have demonstrated previously that eNOS binds with dyn-2 in a direct and specific manner (12Cao S. Yao Y. McCabe T. Yao Q. Katusic Z. Sessa W. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14249-14256Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism of interaction, binding domains of eNOS and dyn-2 were delineated through the use of complementary approaches, including GST binding assays, competition study, estimation of binding affinities, and mammalian two-hybrid screen. To delineate the domain of dyn-2 required for eNOS inte"

Na+ activation is fast, Gβγ-independent, and probably via a direct, low affinity (EC50, 30–40 mm) binding of Na+ to the channel. Here we demonstrate that an increase in intracellular Na+ concentration, [Na+]in, within the physiological range (5–20 mm), activates GIRK within minutes via an additional, slow mechanism. The slow activation is observed in GIRK mutants lacking the direct Na+ effect. It is inhibited by a Gβγ scavenger, hence it is Gβγ-dependent; but it does not require GTP. We hypothesized that Na+ elevates the cellular concentration of free Gβγ by promoting the dissociation of the Gαβγ heterotrimer into free GαGDP and Gβγ. Direct biochemical measurements showed that Na+ causes a moderate decrease (∼2-fold) in the affinity of interaction between GαGDP and Gβγ. Furthermore, in accord with the predictions of our model, slow Na+ activation was enhanced by mild coexpression of Gαi3. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of regulation of G proteins and demonstrate a novel Gβγ-dependent regulation of GIRK by Na+.

They are activated by direct binding of Gβγ released from heterotrimeric G proteins following activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar). GIRK activity also crucially depends on the presence of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (4Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Na+ has been shown to activate GIRK by a direct, G protein-independent mechanism. The direct activation by Na+ is fast and exhibits low affinity for Na+ with an EC50 of 30–40 mmNa+ (4Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GIRK1/GIRK4 is predominant in the heart; GIRK1/GIRK2 is abundant in the brain. An aspartate, which is absent in GIRK1 but present in the proximal C terminus of GIRK2 (Asp-226) and GIRK4 (Asp-223), is crucial for fast direct gating by Na+ (6Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8639-8648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,8Zhang H., He, C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We have noticed an additional, slow activating effect of Na+ on GIRK channels in excised patches ofXenopus oocytes. The slow activation occurred both in wild-type (WT) GIRK channels and, surprisingly, in GIRK mutants that lack the fast direct Na+ regulation. It did not require GTP but was blocked by a Gβγ scavenger, suggesting mediation by Gβγ. We hypothesized that Na+ promotes dissociation of the heterotrimeric GαGDPβγ complex into free GαGDP and Gβγ; the latter activates GIRK. This hypothesis was supported by direct biochemical measurements. Our findings shed new light on mechanisms of regulation of G proteins and GIRK channels by Na+ and suggest that Na+ may act as a second messenger that regulates effectors via Gβγ. RNA was synthesized in vitro from the following DNAs: GIRK1F137S (9Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), GIRK1, GIRK2, myristoylated cβARK, and Gαi3 (10Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Amounts of injected RNA were as follows: GIRK1, GIRK2, and GIRK2D226N, 0.1–0.2 ng/oocyte; GIRK1F137S, 1–5 ng/oocyte; Gαi3, 0.5–2 ng/oocyte; cβARK, 5 ng/oocyte. In GIRK1F137S experiments, an antisense oligonucleotide (50 ng) against the endogenous GIRK5 subunit was injected to prevent the formation of GIRK1/5 channels (11Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes were prepared, injected with RNA, and incubated in NDE-96 solution (96 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 5 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH = 7.6). Patch-clamp measurements of GIRK activity were done at −80 mV as described previously (10Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The electrode solution contained 146 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes/KOH. The bath (500 μl) contained a Na+-free solution (130 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes/KOH, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Mg-ATP). The pH of all solutions was 7.4–7.6. NaCl was added in 50 μl of bath solution and mixed manually. Patches that showed >50% rundown of activity within 6 min after addition of Na+ (about 10% of all patches) were excluded from the study. Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz using the Axotape software (Axon Instruments). The results were analyzed as described previously (10Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In each patch, the Na+-induced changes in activity (-fold activation) were calculated as -fold change in total open probability, NP o, relative to basal NP o measured during the last minute before the addition of Na+. The DNA of GST-Gαi3 was constructed by inserting the coding sequence of human Gαi3 into the EcoRI-NotI sites of pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was amplified and purified from Escherichia coli using glutathione-Sepharose affinity beads. For pull-down assays, GST-Gαi3 was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.0 with 150 mmKCl or 150 mm NaCl) with either 100 μm GDP or GTPγS. [35S]Methionine-labeled Gβγ was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate, diluted 1:4, and incubated with GST-Gαi3 in 300 μl of the above buffer (with 150 mm NaCl or KCl) for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of GDP or GTPγS. The mixture was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed, and bound proteins were eluted with 15 mm glutathione and analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography as described previously (12Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Barzilai R. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39846-39854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of GST-Gαi3-Gβγ interaction was carried out on Biacore 2000 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using anti-GST antibodies (90 ng) covalently attached to the surface of a CM5 sensor chip as described previously (13Doupnik C.A. Dessauer C.W. Slepak V.Z. Gilman A.G. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following the capture of GST-Gαi3, Gβγ was injected across the sensor surface at a flow rate of 15 ml/min in series of concentrations in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% CHAPS buffer, and either 100 mm KCl or 100 mm KCl. Intermediate concentrations of Na+ were obtained by mixing the two buffers. The kinetic data were analyzed using BIAEvaluation 3.1 software (Biacore AB) and Sigmaplot (SPSS Inc.). The level of GIRK1F137S protein in plasma membrane (Fig. 4 C) was measured as described previously (10Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, large oocyte membrane patches were attached to coverslips, fixated, stained by a specific GIRK1 antibody (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), and visualized using a Cy3-conjugated rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.; pairwise comparisons were done using a two-tailed ttest. WT GIRK1/GIRK2 channels were expressed in Xenopusoocytes, and Na+-induced activation was studied in excised patches (Fig. 1 A). GIRK activity was first recorded in cell-attached configuration. Then the patch was excised (“inside-out”) with its intracellular membrane surface facing the bath solution, which was Na+- and GTP-free but contained Mg-ATP to preserve membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (4Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). After excision, the basal activity declined to a new steady level within 0.5–2 min (10Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). 3–4 min after excision, 40 mm NaCl was added to the bath solution, causing a 6.7 ± 2.5-fold increase (n = 8) in channel activity. In agreement with previous studies (7Petit-Jacques J. Sui J.L. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), this fastNa+ activation was not affected by coexpression of the Gβγ scavenger cβARK (myristoylated C terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase; data not shown). In addition, in many WT GIRK1/GIRK2 patches, a slow, late activation was observed. It started after about 1 min and developed over the next 3–6 min (Fig. 1 A). To explore the slow effects of Na+, we utilized the GIRK1 pore mutant GIRK1F137S, which forms functional homotetrameric channels (9Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and lacks the C-terminal aspartate crucial for the direct Na+ effect. Fast activation of homotetrameric GIRK1F137S channels by 40 mmNa+ was very weak, 1.82 ± 0.36-fold (n = 7) (Fig. 1 B). It might reflect a weak direct effect of Na+ on the GIRK1F137S channel. In seven of eight patches, the activity continued to increase over the next several minutes, reaching a maximum after 4–7 min. Thisslow activation, measured during a 3-min period between 4 and 6 min after addition of Na+, was 3.9 ± 1-fold (n = 7) above basal (Fig. 1 D). It was fully blocked by coexpression of cβARK (Fig. 1, C andD), implying a Gβγ-dependent mechanism. We assumed that the additional 2-fold slow increase in GIRK activity (compared with the 1st min after addition of Na+) reflects an increase in cellular concentration of free Gβγ, [Gβγ]. Comparable slow activation (2.62 ± 0.45-fold, n = 6) was observed already at 10 mm Na+, which causes little fast activation in WT GIRK channels (5Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 645-651Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and no fast activation in GIRK1F137S (1.31 ± 0.16-fold, see Fig. 4). How could Na+ activate GIRK in a Gβγ-dependent manner? GPCRs activate G proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP at the Gα subunit followed by dissociation of GαGTP from Gβγ (15Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). Cl−also promotes GTP binding to Gα in vitro (16Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3597-3602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but Cl− concentration in our bath solution was already saturating for this effect before the addition of NaCl. Most importantly the activation of GIRK1F137S by NaCl was achieved in a GTP-free solution, ruling out a mechanism involving GDP-GTP exchange. Another source of free Gβγ, which does not require GTP, is the basal equilibrium between the Gαβγ heterotrimer and free GαGDP and Gβγ (17Sarvazyan N.A. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar):GαGDPβγ⇆GαGDP+GβγREACTION1We hypothesized that Na+ promotes the dissociation of the Gαβγ heterotrimer into free GαGDP and Gβγ by increasing the K D of Reaction 1. This will increase the concentration of free Gβγ, [Gβγ], activating GIRK in the absence of GTP. The observed time course of Na+activation (minutes) is consistent with the slow dissociation rate constant of the Gαβγ heterotrimer (∼0.001 s−1) (17Sarvazyan N.A. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To scrutinize this hypothesis, we examined the effect of Na+ on binding of Gβ1γ2 to a GST-fused Gαi3 protein, GST-Gαi3 (Fig. 2 A), using a pull-down assay. Gβγ was synthesized in vitro in reticulocyte lysate. Only GST-Gαi3-GDP, but not GST or GST-Gαi3-GTPγS, bound Gβγ in this assay (Fig. 2 B), confirming specificity and functional activity of GST-Gαi3. In three individual experiments like that shown in Fig. 2 C (a and b), we examined the dose dependence of binding of Gβγ to GST-GαGDP. The binding was dose-dependent and reached saturation at about 20 μl of Gβγ-containing lysate. The affinity of binding was lower in high Na+ than in high K+ solution, but the differences were too small for a statistically reliable estimation of the affinity shift. Therefore, we compared the binding at a low [Gβγ] (2 μl of Gβγ-containing lysate) and at saturating [Gβγ] (40 μl of lysate) (summarized in Fig. 2 C,c). With 40 μl of lysate, the extent of binding in 150 mm NaCl was the same as in 150 mm KCl (102.6 ± 8.2%, n = 10). However, at 2 μl of lysate, the binding in the high Na+ solution was reproducibly weaker than in high K+ (65.9 ± 4.2%,n = 14, p < 0.001 compared with 40 μl of lysate). At doses of Gβγ lower than 2 μl of lysate (where a greater effect of Na+ was expected), the signal in the autoradiograms was too weak for a reliable measurement. The ∼34% decrease in Gβγ binding caused by Na+ at 2 μl of lysate (which gave ∼37% of maximum binding in high K+) corresponds to a 1.9-fold change in K D. The effect of Na+ was dose-dependent (Fig. 2 D,a and b) with a K i of 13.6 mm Na+ (Fig. 2 D, c). The effect of Na+ on GαGDP-Gβγ interaction was further studied by SPR. Recombinant Gβ1γ2 was injected in buffers with different concentrations of NaCl (substituted for KCl) across the sensor surface with GST or GST-Gαi3 immobilized via anti-GST antibody (13Doupnik C.A. Dessauer C.W. Slepak V.Z. Gilman A.G. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Gβγ reveals a relatively high degree of nonspecific binding to GST in this assay (13Doupnik C.A. Dessauer C.W. Slepak V.Z. Gilman A.G. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Xu J., Wu, D. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the extent of Gβγ binding to GST-Gαi3-GDP was always greater than to GST (Fig. 3, A andB). Also the wash-out of Gβγ from GST was fast as expected for a low affinity process, whereas unbinding of Gβγ from GST-Gαi3-GDP displayed a slower kinetic component, characteristic for a high affinity interaction. The net specific signal of Gβγ-Gαi3 binding, obtained by subtraction of the GST signal (see Ref. 13Doupnik C.A. Dessauer C.W. Slepak V.Z. Gilman A.G. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), displayed rise and decay phases that were reasonably well fitted by single exponential functions (Fig. 3 C). As expected, GST-Gαi3-GTPγS bound Gβγ much weaker than GST-Gαi3-GDP (Fig. 3 D). When the Na+ concentration was increased, the net binding of Gβγ to GST-Gαi3-GDP was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with a K i of 8 mm Na+ (Fig. 3, E and F). Although these data clearly show specific binding of Gβγ to Gαi3, the contribution of nonspecific binding, particularly in the first few seconds postinjection and sample wash-out, impaired the precise determination of the kinetic constants in Na+ and K+. A limited kinetic analysis on the subtracted traces showed that the dissociation constant of Reaction 1, K D, was increased by 10 mmNa+ by ∼2-fold (two separate sets of experiments). The calculated 2-fold change is in very good agreement with the pull-down results. The SPR experiments support the conclusion that Na+ reduces the affinity of interaction between Gα-GDP and Gβγ. The findings so far support the hypothesis that the slow activation of GIRK by Na+ is due to elevated [Gβγ] that dissociated from GαGDP. This hypothesis not only explains the block of the slow effect of Na+ by βARK but also allows testable predictions. Thus, mass law dictates that coexpression of Gα should shift the equilibrium in Reaction 1 to the left, increasing [Gαβγ] and reducing free [Gβγ]. This should reduce the basal activity of GIRK, but now addition of Na+ should cause a larger relative increase in [Gβγ] than in control conditions. This prediction is independent of initial conditions chosen to describe channel activation by Gβγ. 2D. Yakubovich, I. Rishal, and N. Dascal, unpublished results. However, it is important not to overexpress Gα to very high levels at which free GαGDP can scavenge Gβγ and blunt any Gβγ-induced effects. We produced mild overexpression of Gαi3, 3–4-fold over the resting cellular level (by injecting 5 ng of Gαi3 RNA or less), that does not hinder the activation of GIRK by Gβγ (10Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In agreement with the prediction, in Gαi3-expressing oocytes, slow activation of GIRK1F137S by 10 mmNa+ was 10.3 ± 2.3-fold (n = 10), significantly greater than without Gαi3 (Fig. 4 A and summarized in Fig. 4 B). Slow activation by Na+ was still fully blocked by coexpression of cβARK (Fig. 4, A andB). Another GIRK channel mutant known to lack the direct Na+ activation, GIRK1/GIRK2D226N (14Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 645-651Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was also slowly activated by 10 mm Na+ in Gαi3-expressing cells (11.6 ± 2.8-fold,n = 9), and this effect was inhibited by cβARK (“activation” by 1.04 ± 0.13-fold, n = 4). The dramatic effect of Gαi3 on slow Na+-induced activation strongly supports the G protein-dependent character of this phenomenon. The extent of slow activation by 10 mm Na+, in the presence of Gα, is comparable to the direct effect of 40 mm Na+, although it is still severalfold smaller than the 20–800-fold activation by saturating doses of Gβγ (10Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A simple kinetic model based on our hypothesis and on known or estimated parameters of GαGDP-Gβγ and Gβγ-GIRK interactions correctly described the slow GIRK activation by Na+. The calculations showed that a ∼1.8-fold increase inK D of Reaction 1 by 10 mmNa+ fully accounted for the 2-fold slow activation of GIRK1F137S under control conditions and for an ∼8-fold activation after coexpression of Gαi3.2 It appeared (although a systematic study has not been conducted) that coexpression of Gαi3 did not cause the expected reduction in basal activity of GIRK1F137S (e.g. compare the cell-attached levels of channel activity in Fig. 4 A,a and b). The unexpectedly high basal activity could reflect an increase in membrane levels of GIRK1F137Scaused by Gαi3 as described for WT GIRK1/GIRK2 (10Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed immunostaining of the expressed channels in large plasma membrane patches (Fig. 4 C) showed a net 6.4-fold increase of GIRK1F137S protein by Gαi3 (after subtraction of background observed in uninjected oocytes) compared with channels expressed alone. The dose dependence of the slow Na+ effect was studied in oocytes coexpressing GIRK1F137S and Gαi3. Maximal activation was observed at 10 mm Na+(Fig. 4 D). At higher [Na+] the effect was smaller, consistent with the previously reported inhibition, at high [Na+], of GIRK channel constructs lacking the fast Na+ activation (6Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8639-8648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. The half-maximal activation dose (EC50) appeared to be slightly above 5 mm Na+, but considering the interference of the inhibitory effect at high [Na+], the actual EC50 of slow Na+ activation is probably higher. Our results strongly suggest that Na+ reduces the affinity of interaction between GαGDP and Gβγ. This hypothesis initially arose following the observation of slow, Gβγ-dependent activation by Na+ of mutant GIRK channels lacking the direct Na+ modulation. We then demonstrated weakening of GαGDP-Gβγ binding using direct in vitrobinding assays. Although the detected change in affinity was small, the results obtained by two independent methods (a pull-down assay and surface plasmon resonance) were in good agreement. Both methods, as well as estimates obtained from patch-clamp data, indicate that Na+ causes a ∼2-fold decrease in the affinity of interaction between Gαi3-GDP and Gβγ. The EC50 or K i of the Na+ effect estimated by electrophysiological and the two biochemical methods are also in good agreement (∼6–14 mm), falling within the physiological range of [Na+]in. The proposed hypothesis made it possible to explain the observed inhibition of the slow Na+-induced activation by the Gβγ scavenger, cβARK, and to predict a novel physiological effect: a dramatic enhancement of slow Na+ activation of GIRK by coexpressed Gα. Interestingly Xenopus oocytes possess an unusually high basal level of free Gβγ (19Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A., Ma, C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Lutz L.B. Kim B.E. Jahani D. Hammes S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41512-41520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and coexpression of Gα may actually mimic the “usual” cellular condition of low [Gβγ]. Na+ has long been known to modulate the binding of agonists to many GPCRs, uncoupling these receptors from G proteins. Initially Na+ had been suspected to regulate G proteins directly, but later studies demonstrated a pivotal role of Na+ interaction with a conserved aspartate residue located in the transmembrane region of many GPCRs (for review, see Ref. 21Gierschik P. McLeish K. Jakobs K.H. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1988; 5 Suppl. 12: S20-S24Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, although NaCl has been shown to promote GDP-GTP exchange at the G protein, the active agent was Cl− rather than Na+ (16Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3597-3602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, no direct effects of Na+ on G proteins are known, and this report is the first demonstration of such regulation. Na+ regulation of GIRK channels is considered of high physiological importance since it is believed to determine part of their basal activity in intact cells and to underlie the negative chronotropic effect of cardiac glycosides in the heart (2Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar,5Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our data imply that, in GIRK channels, Na+ acts both directly and indirectly (via Gβγ) to modulate basal activity. The EC50 of the well characterized, direct, Gβγ-independent activation by Na+ is 30–40 mm. The slow, Gβγ-dependent activation of GIRK by Na+ has a definitely lower EC50: maximal effect is attained at 10 mm Na+. Despite the small magnitude of GαGDP-Gβγ affinity change by Na+, 10 mm Na+ caused an impressive 4–10-fold activation of GIRK. Therefore, the slow mechanism may contribute substantially to the basal activity of the channel in intact cells where the resting [Na+]in is 5–10 mm. The observed features of slow Na+ modulation of GIRK conform to the model in which [Gβγ], elevated because of the direct effect of Na+ on Gαβγ dissociation, activates the channel. Yet at present we cannot exclude contribution of additional mechanisms, for instance activation of a nucleotide diphosphate kinase (NDPK), which catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from ATP to GTP. This might, in principle, promote Gαβγ dissociation and activate GIRK (see the discussion in Ref. 2Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, Na+ has been reported to inhibit NDPK (22Marshall L.J. Muimo R. Riemen C.E. Mehta A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C109-C119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and should have inhibited GIRK if NDPK were involved. Sodium ions are crucial for neuronal activity as carriers of depolarization and also regulate many physiological processes (fluid balance and secretion, cardiac contraction, glutamate-induced neuronal excitation, etc.) by a variety of molecular mechanisms from a direct binding of Na+ (GIRK and Na+-dependent transporters and exchangers (23Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 431-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar)) to activation of Src by Na+ via an unknown intermediate (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (24Yu X.M. Salter M.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)). Basal [Na+]in is tightly regulated by pumps and exchangers, being maintained in resting cells below 10 mm. Yet [Na+]in often widely fluctuates. In neurons, even relatively short periods of synaptic activity produce very large increases in [Na+]in, reaching ∼30 mm in apical dendrites and >100 mm in dendritic spines (25Rose C.R. Konnerth A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These considerations raise the possibility that Na+ may, in some cases, act as a second messenger that regulates intracellular targets when a substantial change in concentration occurs. Our findings suggest a new mechanism of Na+-dependent regulation of cellular processes: via Gβγ. The effective range of Na+ concentrations that regulate the Gαβγ ⇆ GGαGDP + Gβγ equilibrium is close to the resting physiological range of [Na+]in. Therefore, regulation of G proteins by Na+ may be a servo-type mechanism that sensitively responds to bidirectional changes in [Na+]inrather than to increases alone. We propose that Na+regulation of the dynamic equilibrium between bound and free GαGDP and Gβγ can have a substantial biological effect by regulating a host of effectors of Gβγ (1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), some of which are second messenger-generating enzymes that may further amplify Na+ effects. This establishes a possible novel way of communication between electrical activity and other cellular processes. We are grateful to A. G.

It is thought that InlB acts by binding directly to the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, present on the surface of host cells.

Here we have compared signaling by HGF and InlB. Whereas stimulation with equivalent concentrations of HGF and InlB elicits similar activation of the HGF receptor, we observed striking differences in downstream activation of MAP kinase. InlB leads to a greater activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway than does HGF. The leucine-rich repeat region, which was previously shown to be sufficient for binding and activation of the HGF receptor, lacks the ability to super-activate the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. Analysis of a series of deletion mutants suggests that it is the B repeat region between the leucine-rich repeat and GW domains that endows InlB with an increased ability to turn on the Ras-MAP kinase pathway.

In vivo, HGF and the HGF receptor play key roles in the development of the liver, kidneys, muscle, and neuronal precursors (2Birchmeier C. Gherardi E.

In vitro activation of the HGF receptor stimulates cell division, cell scattering, and the formation of tubular structures in a three-dimensional matrix (3Trusolino L. Pugliese L. Comoglio P.M.

The Listeria monocytogenes surface-protein internalin B (InlB) binds to and activates the HGF receptor. Initiation of host cell invasion by this intracellular pathogen occurs through the interaction of InlB with the HGF receptor, leading to host cell protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. It has been established that the activation of both the Ras-MAP kinase pathway and PI 3-kinase are essential for uptake of L. monocytogenesinto host cells (25Tang P. Sutherland C.L. Gold M.R.

InlB is composed of an amino-terminal receptor-binding domain followed by a B repeat region (B) and three GW domains. The receptor-binding domain contains three motifs: an amino-terminal cap, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) segment, and an immunoglobin-like region (IR) (27Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Mol.

The amino-terminal cap and the LRR domain have been shown to be sufficient to bind and activate the HGF receptor (29Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Google Scholar). The GW domains attach InlB non-covalently to the bacterial cell wall and have been shown recently to bind to host cell components upon release of InlB from the bacterium (30Jonquieres R. Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 955-965Google Scholar, 31Marino M. Banerjee M. Jonquieres R. Cossart P. Ghosh P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5623-5634Google Scholar). Both HGF and InlB bind and activate the HGF receptor. Interestingly, whereas HGF stimulates mitogenesis, cell migration, and tubulogenesis, InlB induces phagocytosis. This prompted us to compare signaling downstream of these two HGF receptor ligands. Our results show that HGF and InlB are very similar in their ability to activate the HGF receptor, whereas InlB is a stronger activator of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. We found that InlB induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a 90-kDa PI 3-kinase-associated protein, whereas HGF did not. Analysis of InlB deletion mutants showed that, whereas both the IR and B repeat are necessary for maximal signaling downstream of the HGF receptor, it is the B repeat region of InlB that is important for the observed super-activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5623-5634Google Scholar). InlBΔGW1 (residues 36–392 and 464–630), InlBΔB-GW1 (residues 36–321 and 464–630), and InlBΔIR-B-GW1 (residues 36–248 and 464–630) were cloned into pet28b (Novagen) by PCR from the intact InlB expression plasmid using standard protocols. InlBΔGW1, InlBΔB-GW1 and InlBΔIR-B-GW1 were purified using a protocol identical to that used for intact InlB. Protein concentrations were determined using the absorption at 280 nm and the calculated extinction coefficients. The GST-Shc SH2, GST-Shc PTB, GST-Grb2 SH2, and GST-p85 N-SH2 domain fusion proteins have been described previously (33Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19119-19125Google Scholar). Cells were starved overnight in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4. Cells were then stimulated for 1 min at 37 °C with HGF, wild-type, or mutant InlB at a final concentration of 1.5 nm unless otherwise noted. Cells were then rinsed 2 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (PLC-lysis buffer) per 10-cm tissue culture dish. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, incubated with 5 μl of polyclonal antiserum or 1 μl of monoclonal antibody for 1 h on ice and subsequently for 1 h with 100 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose or anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C on an agitator. Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with PLC-lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were boiled 3 min in 62.5 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.3% SDS, and 0.025% bromphenol blue (SDS-sample buffer) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For in vitro binding studies, cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker with 10 μl of glutathione-agarose beads containing 1–2 μg of fusion protein. Beads were washed 4 times with PLC-lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Bio-Rad semi-dry blotting apparatus at 50 mA per gel for 60 min at room temperature. For each individual antibody, immunoblotting was performed per the manufacturer's protocol. Reactive proteins were visualized by ECL (AmershamBiosciences). GST-RBD was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified on glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were washed several times in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 (TBST) and stored at 4 °C in TBST containing 0.02% azide. For affinity precipitation, lysates were incubated with GST-RBD pre-bound to glutathione-agarose (∼10 μl of beads containing ∼10–20 μg of protein) for 1 h at 4 °C on an agitator. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel and subjected to Western blotting with an anti-Ras monoclonal antibody. It has been reported that InlB binds to and activates the HGF receptor (29Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Google Scholar). This suggests that InlB and HGF activate the same signal transduction pathways. To confirm this, we compared protein tyrosine phosphorylation following stimulation with either InlB or HGF. Vero cells, which naturally express the HGF receptor, were grown to confluence, starved overnight in serum-free medium, and stimulated for 1 min at 37 °C with 1.5 nm HGF or 1.5 nm InlB. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) blotting (Fig.1 A). As controls, HGF receptor immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-HGF receptor and anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. The results show that there are several proteins that become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation with either HGF or InlB (Fig. 1 A). Most proteins, including the HGF receptor, were phosphorylated to similar levels in response to either HGF or InlB (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, one protein, with an apparent molecular mass of ∼40 kDa (Fig.1 A, p40), was more highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to InlB than in response to HGF. These results suggest that HGF and InlB differ in their ability to turn on cellular signaling cascades. To identify p40, we focused on members of the MAP kinase family because several of its members, including p38MAPK, Erk-1 (p44MAPK), and Erk-2 (p42MAPK), have been implicated in signal transduction downstream of the HGF receptor (38Awasthi V. King R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L942-L949Google Scholar). To investigate whether p40 is either Erk-1 or Erk-2, cells were stimulated with HGF or InlB, and whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated, active forms of Erk-1 and Erk-2 (Fig.2 A). An anti-Erk-2 blot was included as a control (Fig. 2 B). Both Erk-1 and Erk2 are activated in response to either HGF or InlB. InlB appears to be a stronger activator of Erk-1 and Erk-2 than HGF (Fig. 2, Aand C). Stimulation in the presence of PD98059, a potent inhibitor of MEK, blocks activation of Erk-1 and Erk-2 (Fig.2 A). Anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting of whole cell lysates from cells stimulated with InlB or HGF shows that p40 is no longer phosphorylated when cells are stimulated in the presence of PD98059 (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that p40 represents Erk-2. It is possible that differences between HGF and InlB in their ability to activate Erk-1 and Erk-2 are restricted to a specific ligand concentration. To investigate this, Vero cells were stimulated with a range of HGF or InlB concentrations (Fig.3). Anti-HGF receptor immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) and anti-HGF receptor immunoblotting, whereas whole cell lysates were analyzed for the presence of activated Erk-1 and Erk-2. The results show that receptor phosphorylation levels off between 0.75 and 1.5 nm HGF or InlB (Fig.3 A) and confirm that InlB is a better activator of Erk-1 and Erk-2 than HGF at all concentrations tested. Erk-1 and Erk-2 are activated following a cascade of events known as the Ras-MAP kinase pathway (39Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Google Scholar). Finding differences in the extent of MAP kinase activation following stimulation with HGF or InlB prompted us to investigate other elements of this pathway. MEK activation was evaluated by blotting whole cell lysates of control and stimulated cells with an antibody that recognizes the active form of MEK. The results show that MEK activation paralleled MAP kinase activation (Fig.4 A). To measure levels of active Raf, Raf immunoprecipitates were probed with an antibody that recognizes active Raf (Fig. 4 B). As a control the immunoprecipitates were probed with an anti-Raf antiserum (Fig.4 C). The results show that InlB is a slightly better activator of Raf than HGF (Fig. 4 B). To measure the levels of active Ras, we used a GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf. This fusion protein binds only to active, GTP-bound Ras (40de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Google Scholar, 41Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Google Scholar). Lysates from control, HGF-, or InlB-stimulated Vero cells were incubated with the GST-RBD fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Bound proteins were analyzed by anti-Ras immunoblotting (Fig. 4 D). Anti-Ras immunoblots of whole cell lysates were included as a control (Fig. 4 E). The data show slightly higher levels of Ras activation in response to InlB than in response to HGF (Fig. 4 D). Together, these observations show that InlB is a better activator of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway than HGF. To find out whether there are differences in signal transduction events between the HGF receptor and active Ras, we focused on proteins known to be involved in Ras activation, including Shc, Grb2, and PI 3-kinase. Analysis of Shc and Grb2 immunoprecipitates by anti-Tyr(P) blotting showed that all three isoforms of Shc (p46, p52, and p66) are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to either HGF or InlB (results not shown). GST fusion proteins containing either the Shc PTB domain, the Shc SH2 domain, or the Grb2 SH2 associated with several unidentified proteins that became tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to either HGF or InlB. No qualitative differences in either Shc or Grb2 associated proteins were observed (results not shown). Interestingly, a tyrosine-phosphorylated 90-kDa protein that is present in the PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitates from InlB-stimulated cells is absent from immunoprecipitates from cells that were stimulated with HGF (Fig. 5 A). To investigate this further, lysates of HGF- or InlB-stimulated cells were analyzed for the presence of proteins that bind to the PI 3-kinase amino-terminal SH2 domain in vitro. The results confirmed the presence of a 90-kDa protein present in lysates of InlB-stimulated cells that can bind to the PI 3-kinase amino-terminal SH2 domain (Fig. 5 B). This protein is absent in lysates of HGF-stimulated cells. Our data show that stimulation of Vero cells with InlB results in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 90-kDa protein that is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to HGF. InlB is composed of an amino-terminal LRR domain, an immunoglobin-like region (IR), a B repeat region, and three carboxyl-terminal glycine and tryptophan-containing (GW) domains (Fig.6 A). It is known that the LRR domain by itself can bind to the HGF receptor. LRR can be isolated as a non-physiological disulfide-linked dimer (LRRd) or as a monomer (LRRm). 2M. Banerjee, J. Copp, M. Marino, T. Chapman, P. van der Geer, and P. Ghosh, manuscript in preparation.Dimeric LRR activates the HGF receptor, whereas the monomer is unable to do so.2 To find out whether the LRR domain is sufficient for InlB-mediated signaling, we compared the signaling capabilities of full-length InlB with those of LRRd. Vero cells were stimulated with InlB, LRRd, and HGF and analyzed for HGF receptor phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation (Fig. 6). Our data show that stimulation with 1.5 nm HGF, InlB, or LRRd results in very similar levels of HGF receptor activation, as measured by receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6,B and C). Interestingly, we found that there is a dramatic difference between InlB and either LRRd or HGF in their abilities to activate Erk-2 (Fig. 6, D andE). LRRd resembled HGF in its ability to activate Erk-2, whereas InlB was found to be a more potent activator. This suggests that portions of InlB besides the LRR domain are required for ability of InlB to super-activate the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. To find out which regions of InlB are involved in MAP kinase super-activation, we generated a series of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants. Progressive deletion from the carboxyl terminus affected receptor activation.2 This made it difficult to separate receptor activation from MAP kinase activation. To test the importance of the IR, B, and GW domains to the ability of the InlB to activate cell signaling, mutant proteins with internal deletions were generated (Fig. 7 A). Vero cells were stimulated with the various mutants and analyzed for HGF receptor and MAP kinase activation (Fig. 7, B and D). Control blots showing receptor levels and MAP kinase levels were included (Fig.7, C and E). Our data show that the InlB mutant lacking the first GW repeat (InlBΔGW1) is unaffected in its ability to turn on either the HGF receptor or MAP kinase (Fig. 7). A second mutant that lacks both the B repeat and the first GW repeat (InlBΔB-GW1) is unaffected in its ability to turn on the receptor but has lost the ability to super-activate MAP kinase (Fig. 7). Finally, a mutant that lacks the IR, the B repeat, and the first GW repeat (InlBΔIR-B-GW1) loses the ability to turn on the HGF receptor (Fig.7 A). These data clearly show that the IR and B repeat are important for signaling by InlB. InlB is a protein that is expressed on the surface ofL. monocytogenes and that initiates host cell entry by binding to the HGF receptor (29Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Google Scholar, 42Dramsi S. Biswas I. Maguin E. Braun L. Mastroeni P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 251-261Google Scholar). Binding of InlB to the HGF receptor stimulates phagocytosis (3Trusolino L. Pugliese L. Comoglio P.M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1267-1280Google Scholar, 43Cossart P. Lecuit M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3797-3806Google Scholar). In contrast, stimulation with HGF results in mitogenesis, cell scattering, and tubulogenesis (44Furge K.A. Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5582-5589Google Scholar, 45Vande Woude G.F. Jeffers M. Cortner J. Alvord G. Tsarfaty I. Resau J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 119-130Google Scholar). This prompted us to compare signaling in response InlB and HGF. Several members of the MAP kinase family, including Erk-1, Erk-2, and stress-activated p38 MAPK, are activated in response to HGF (46Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Google Scholar). We found that InlB is a better activator of Erk-1 and Erk-2 than HGF. This is of interest for two reasons. First, because InlB and HGF are both thought to signal exclusively through the HGF receptor, we expected MAP kinase activation to correlate with receptor activation. Our data show that this is not the case (Figs. 3, 6, and 7). Second, MAP kinase activation has been shown to be essential for InlB-mediated host cell invasion (25Tang P. Sutherland C.L. Gold M.R. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1106-1112Google Scholar). Our data raise the possibility that InlB uses a distinct signaling mechanism, one that differs from that used by HGF, to turn on MAP kinase. To explain the differences in activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, we examined proteins that are thought to act proximal in the HGF receptor signal transduction process. Phosphorylation of Shc- and Grb2-associated proteins in response to HGF has been reported previously (7Pelicci G. Giordano S. Zhen Z. Salcini A.E. Lanfrancone L. Bardelli A. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Ponzetto C. Pelicci P.G. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1631-1638Google Scholar, 47Fixman E.D. Fournier T.M. Kamikura D.M. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13116-13122Google Scholar). We did not observe qualitative differences between InlB and HGF in their abilities to stimulate the phosphorylation of Shc- and Grb2-associated proteins (results not shown). It is worth noting that the identity of some of these associated proteins remains to be determined. It has been shown previously (26Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Google Scholar, 48Rahimi N. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24850-24855Google Scholar) that activation of the HGF receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. There are several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase in response to either InlB or HGF. These include a 120-kDa protein that most likely represents Gab1, a 110-kDa protein, p85, and a 55-kDa protein. In addition, there is a 90-kDa protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to InlB but not in response to HGF. In vitro binding experiments showed that this protein binds to the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85. It is tempting to speculate that the difference in the ability to activate the Ras-MAP kinase pathway between InlB and HGF is a result of the difference in ability to stimulate phosphorylation of this 90-kDa protein. A variety of downstream targets for PI 3-kinase has been identified (49Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 233-239Google Scholar). However, we are unaware of the identification of a 90-kDa protein known to bind to the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85. Identification and further characterization of this protein will be necessary to find out whether this protein performs an essential function during InlB-dependent signal transduction. We are currently using an affinity purification approach to identify this protein. InlB is composed of an amino-terminal domain that contains an amino-terminal cap, several LRR, and an immunoglobin-like region (IR). These three motifs comprise a single structural domain that is followed by a B repeat region (B) and a carboxyl-terminal domain that contains three tandem GW repeats (31Marino M. Banerjee M. Jonquieres R. Cossart P. Ghosh P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5623-5634Google Scholar, 50Braun L. Dramsi S. Dehoux P. Bierne H. Lindahl G. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 285-294Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 A). The LRR domain was found previously (29Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Google Scholar) to mediate binding and activation of the HGF receptor. The GW domain has been shown to mediate the association of InlB with the bacterial surface (50Braun L. Dramsi S. Dehoux P. Bierne H. Lindahl G. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 285-294Google Scholar, 51Jonquieres R. Bierne H. Fiedler F. Gounon P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 902-914Google Scholar). When we compared InlB and LRRd, we found that both proteins are similar in their ability to turn on the HGF receptor but different in their ability to turn on MAP kinase. InlB is a stronger activator of MAP kinase. To find out why InlB is a better activator of MAP kinase than either LRRd or HGF, we analyzed a series of carboxyl-terminal InlB deletion mutants for their ability to stimulate cell signaling to the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. Because progressive deletion of the carboxyl terminus affected the abilities of these mutant proteins to activate the HGF receptor, it was impossible to look at downstream signaling.2 Therefore, mutant proteins with internal deletions were generated and tested for their abilities to activate cell signaling. Deletion of the first GW repeat (GW1) resulted in a protein that is unaffected in its ability to activate the HGF receptor or the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. This demonstrates that internal deletions can be made in InlB without completely destroying its biological activity. Neither GW1 nor the B repeat region of InlB seems necessary for maximal activation of the HGF receptor. Comparing the abilities of these proteins to mediate signaling downstream of the HGF receptor, however, shows that the mutant that is missing both GW1 and the B repeats region is severely compromised in its ability to activate the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. The IR appears to be essential for HGF receptor activation because the protein that is missing this region, as well as GW1 and the B repeats, has lost the ability to turn on the HGF receptor. An alternative explanation is that the IR is essential for normal folding of InlB. However, we do know that folding of LRR is independent of IR, as LRRd itself is active (Fig. 6). Our results show that it is possible to separate activation of the HGF receptor from the super-activation of MAP kinase. Furthermore, it appears that it is the B repeat that is essential for the increased ability of the InlB to turn on MAP kinase. One possible explanation for the observed differences in the ability to activate MAP kinase is that the kinetics for the ligand-receptor interaction differs between HGF and InlB. This has been observed for the T cell receptor, where downstream signaling is affected by the kinetics of the interaction between receptor and ligand (52Williams C.B. Engle D.L. Kersh G.J. Michael White J. Allen P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1531-1544Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the activation of the T cell receptor requires the interaction of two different cell types and is the result of several interactions among various proteins present on the surface of the interacting cells (53Brown M.J. Shaw S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R26-R28Google Scholar, 54Germain R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35223-35226Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that the B repeat region of InlB could act by recruiting an unrelated receptor into the signaling complex. InlB thus may signal in a manner analogous to the nerve growth factor (NGF). Two unrelated receptors for NGF have been identified (55Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 131-142Google Scholar). One is a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase and is called the NGF receptor or Trk (56Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin Z.D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Science. 1991; 252: 554-558Google Scholar). The second one is called p75 and is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (57Chao M.V. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1373-1385Google Scholar). The NGF receptor can act as a receptor for NGF by itself. Co-expression of p75 increases NGF binding, and it influences the ability of NGF to stimulate NGF receptor autophosphorylation (58Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Google Scholar, 59Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Google Scholar, 60Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Ibanez C.F. Persson H. Kaplan D.R. Benedetti M. Chao M.V. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 733-745Google Scholar). This second receptor could activate distinct signaling pathways that are different from those activated by the HGF receptor but act in synergy with the signaling downstream of the HGF receptor to lead to the super-activation of MAP kinase that is seen in response to InlB. What is the identity of the second receptor? It has been reported that both gC1qR and glycosaminoglycans are membrane-bound host-cell components that interact with InlB and are important for InlB-mediated invasion of L. monocytogenes (30Jonquieres R. Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 955-965Google Scholar, 61Braun L. Ghebrehiwet B. Cossart P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1458-1466Google Scholar). However, it has been established that InlB interacts with both of these molecules via its GW domains and not the B repeat region (30Jonquieres R. Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 955-965Google Scholar, 31Marino M. Banerjee M. Jonquieres R. Cossart P. Ghosh P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5623-5634Google Scholar). The identification of a second receptor that can interact with the B repeat of InlB would be of importance to understanding how InlB mediates host-cell signaling. In summary, we have found that there are differences in the abilities of InlB and HGF to turn on the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. Analysis of deletion mutants shows that the LRR, the IR, and the B repeat region are all necessary for signaling mediated by InlB, yet it is the B repeat region that is responsible for the signaling differences between InlB and HGF in their abilities to activate MAP kinase. We believe that the LRR is involved in binding to the HGF receptor, whereas one or more of the other domains could interact with a second receptor."

Luciferase reporter assays with deletion and site-directed mutation of the promoter region (−1250 to +77) showed that an AP-2 element at −109 was required for activation and an E-box at +57, for repression. Binding of nuclear factors to each of these cis-elements was demonstrated by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Several components of the Notch-Hes signaling pathway, Jagged,Notch1, Notch3, and Hes-1, were expressed in the leptomeningeal cells. Human Hes-1 co-expressed in the leptomeningeal cells bound to the E-box of the rat L-PGDS gene, and repressed the promoter activity of the rat L-PGDS gene in a dose-dependent manner. The L-PGDS gene expression was up-regulated slowly by interleukin-1β to the maximum level at 24 h. The reporter assay with deletion and mutation revealed that two NF-κB elements at −1106 and −291 were essential for this up-regulation. Binding of two NF-κB subunits, p65 and c-Rel, to these two NF-κB elements occurred after the interleukin-1β treatment. Therefore, the L-PGDS gene is the first gene identified as the target for the Notch-Hes signal through the E-box among a variety of genes involved in the prostanoid biosynthesis, classified to the lipocalin family, and expressed in the leptomeninges.

Fujimoto N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Google Scholar). Later, L-PGDS was found to be identical to β-trace (2Hoffman A. Conradt H.S. Gross G. Nimtz M. Lottspeich F. Wurster U. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 451-456Google Scholar, 3Watanabe K. Urade Y. Mäder M. Murphy C. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1110-1116Google Scholar), which had been identified earlier (4Clausen J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1961; 107: 170-172Google Scholar) as the major protein in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). PGD2 is a major prostanoid in the brain, known as the most potent endogenous somnogenic substance thus far identified (5Hayaishi O. Urade Y. Neuroscientists. 2002; 8: 12-15Google Scholar), and is involved in various physiological events such as regulation of sleep and pain responses (5Hayaishi O. Urade Y. Neuroscientists. 2002; 8: 12-15Google Scholar, 6Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 259-271Google Scholar, 7Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 89-120Google Scholar, 8Urade Y. Eguchi N. Prostaglandins Lipid Mediators. 2002; 68–69: 375-382Google Scholar). Because human L-PGDS-overexpressing transgenic mice (9Pinzar E. Kanaoka Y. Inui T. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4903-4907Google Scholar) and L-PGDS-gene knock-out mice (10Eguchi N. Minami T. Shirafuji N. Kanaoka Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15789-15795Google Scholar) showed abnormality in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and pain responses, PGD2 produced by L-PGDS is thought to play important roles in the regulation of NREM sleep and pain sensation in the central nervous system. Alternatively L-PGDS binds small lipophilic molecules such as retinal and retinoic acid (K d = 70–80 nm) (12) and biliverdin and bilirubin (K d = 33–37 nm) (13Beuckmann C.T. Aoyagi M. Okazaki I. Hiroike T. Toh H. Hayaishi O. Urade Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8006-8013Google Scholar) with affinities higher than those of other members of the lipocalin family. Therefore, L-PGDS is a unique bifunctional protein acting as a PGD2-producing enzyme and as a lipophilic molecule-binding protein (6Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 259-271Google Scholar, 7Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 89-120Google Scholar, 8Urade Y. Eguchi N. Prostaglandins Lipid Mediators. 2002; 68–69: 375-382Google Scholar). L-PGDS is expressed abundantly in the human heart (14Eguchi Y. Eguchi N. Oda H. Seiki K. Kijima Y. Matsu-ura Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14689-14694Google Scholar), the male genital organs (15Ujihara M. Urade Y. Eguchi N. Hayashi H. Ikai K. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4885-4896Google Scholar) of various mammals. In the brain, this enzyme is expressed dominantly in the leptomeninges, chroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes but poorly in neurons, astrocytes, and microglial cells (18Urade Y. Kitahama K. Ohishi H. Kaneko T. Mizuno N. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9070-9074Google Scholar, 19Beuckmann C.T. Lazarus M. Gerashchenko D. Mizoguchi A. Nomura S. Mohri I. Uesugi A. Kaneko T.

These distribution profiles suggest that L-PGDS gene expression is differentially regulated in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner. Garcı́a-Fernández et al. (21Garcı́a-Fernández L.F. Iniguez M.A. Rodriguez-Pena A. Muñoz A. Bernal J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 396-401Google Scholar, 22Garcı́a-Fernández L.F. Rausell E. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Bernal J. Muñoz A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1566-1573Google Scholar) found that L-PGDS gene expression was regulated by the thyroid hormone during brain development in rats and demonstrated that the thyroid hormone responsive element was functional in COS-7 cells (23Garcı́a-Fernández L.F. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Bernal J. Muñoz A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 321-330Google Scholar). White et al. (24White D.M. Takeda T. DeGroot L.J. Stefansson K. Arnason B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14387-14393Google Scholar) also demonstrated that L-PGDS gene expression was induced by the thyroid hormone through its responsive element in human TE671 cells derived from a medulloblastoma in the cerebellum. Moreover, L-PGDS gene expression was induced by dexamethasone in mouse neuronal GT1–7 cells (25Garcı́a-Fernández L.F. Iniguez M.A. Eguchi N. Fresno M. Urade Y. Muñoz A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 460-470Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanisms of L-PGDS gene expression have never been analyzed in the leptomeningeal cells, which show the highest expression of this gene (18Urade Y. Kitahama K. Ohishi H. Kaneko T. Mizuno N. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9070-9074Google Scholar, 19Beuckmann C.T. Lazarus M. Gerashchenko D. Mizoguchi A. Nomura S. Mohri I. Uesugi A. Kaneko T. Mizuno N. Hayaishi O. Urade Y. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 42: 62-78Google Scholar, 20Taniike M. Mohri I. Eguchi N. Beuckmann C.T. Suzuki K. Urade Y. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4885-4896Google Scholar). On the other hand, the L-PGDS level in the rat CSF was increased by the administration of a proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1β (26Ishizaka M. Ohe Y. Senbongi T. Wakabayashi K. Ishikawa K. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1161-1165Google Scholar). IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α activate the NF-κB system (27Kubota T. Kushikata T. Fang J. Krueger J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2000; 279: R404-R413Google Scholar) to elicit somnogenic activities (28Krueger J.M. Fang J. Taishi P. Chen Z. Kushikata T. Gardi J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 148-159Google Scholar, 29Terao A. Matsumura H. Saito M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6599-6607Google Scholar). The sleep-inducing effects of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α were proposed to be mediated by L-PGDS, because these effects were inhibited by administration of inhibitors of PG synthesis to animals (29Terao A. Matsumura H. Saito M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6599-6607Google Scholar). However, the transcriptional regulation of the L-PGDS gene by the NF-κB system has never been clarified. In this study, we characterized the rat L-PGDS gene promoter in the primary cultures of leptomeningeal (LM) cells prepared from neonatal rat brains and identified an AP-2 element for the transcriptional activation, an E-box element for the repression, and two NF-κB elements for slow induction by IL-1β. Among various genes involved in prostanoid biosynthesis, classified as members of the lipocalin family and expressed in the leptomeninges, the L-PGDS gene is the first one identified to be a target of Hes-1, a mammalian homolog ofDrosophila Hairy and Enhancer ofsplit of the Notch-Hes signal pathway. The L-PGDS gene is thus the second identified gene encoding an enzyme suppressed by the Notch-Hes signal, as the human acid α-glucosidase gene was the first one (30Yan B. Heus J. Lu N. Nichols R.C. Raben N. Plotz P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1789-1793Google Scholar, 31Yan B. Raben N. Plotz P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29760-29764Google Scholar). Moreover, the L-PGDS gene is a novel example of a small number of genes slowly up-regulated through activation of NF-κB subunits by IL-1β, similar to the Mn-superoxide dismutase gene (32Antras-Ferry J. Maheo K. Morel F. Guillouzo A. Cillard P. Cillard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 100-104Google Scholar) but different from many of the IL-1β-activated genes identified up to the present. The LM cells were prepared from the external leptomeninges surrounding the cerebral cortex of neonatal rats as described previously (33Ishikawa K. Ohe Y. Tatemoto K. Brain Res. 1995; 697: 122-129Google Scholar). Rat cell lines, i.e. F2408 (embryo), RNB (astrocyte), and C6 (glia), were obtained from the Institute for Fermentation (Osaka, Japan). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) or Ham's F-10 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS), 50 units/ml penicillin G (Meiji Seika, Tokyo, Japan), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Meiji Seika) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Total RNA was prepared by the acid guanidinium-thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). For reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA (1 μg) by RNase H−SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)-adapter primer (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) at 42 °C for 60 min after denaturation of the RNA at 72 °C for 3 min. PCR was conducted with RT products used as the template, LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo), and gene-specific primer sets under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 96 °C for 5 min, followed by 96 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30–40 cycles. The gene-specific primer sets used were chemically synthesized with the reference to the deposited sequence information.

Roberts V.J. Lemke G. Development. 1991; 113: 199-205Google Scholar), Notch2-F1 (5′-GTCCTCAGGCTTCCCTGGAGGAC-3′) and Notch2-F2 (5′-GGCAATCCTTTGCTTGCATCCC-3′) as the forward primers and Notch2-R (5′-GGGGTGAGAGGTCGAGTATTGGC-3′) as the reverse primer forNotch2 (43Weinmaster G. Roberts V.J. Lemke G. Development. 1992; 116: 931-941Google Scholar), and Notch3-F1 (5′-CCCCCTTGTCTGGATGGAAGCCC-3′) and Notch3-F2 (5′-CCCGGGAGGCTGCTTGCCTGTGC-3′) as the forward primers and Notch3-R (5′-GCCAGGAAGACAAGCACAGTC-3′) as the reverse primer for Notch3 (GenBankTM accession number AF164486). Notch mRNAs were detected by nested PCR. In the first-step PCR, the following primer sets were used: Notch1-F1 forNotch1, Notch2-F1 for Notch2, or Notch3-F1 forNotch3 as the forward primer and M13 M4 primer (Takara Shuzo) as the reverse primer. In the nested PCR, Notch1-F2 and Notch1-R for Notch1, Notch2-F2 and Notch2-R for Notch2, or Notch3-F2 and Notch3-R for Notch3 were used as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The resultant PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to verify the nucleotide sequences. To ensure the transcription level of L-PGDS mRNA, we performed the competitive RT-PCR. Briefly, 200 ng of total RNA was converted to the first-strand cDNAs using RNase H− SuperScript II reverse transcriptase in the presence of serial diluted RNA standard (competitor) with random 9-mer primer (Takara Shuzo). PCR amplification was performed using sets of specific primers of L-PGDS-T and L-PGDS-C for L-PGDS or G3PDH-5′ and G3PDH-3′ for G3PDH, ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo), and the RT products. After the initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, PCR was carried out for 15 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, and 20 s at 74 °C for 28 cycles. The amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel followed by staining with ethidium bromide. The stained products were scanned and analyzed by ChemiImager system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The expression level of L-PGDS gene was expressed relative to that of the G3PDH gene. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (2 μg) was separated electrophoretically in a 2.2 m formaldehyde-1.2% (w/v) agarose gel in MOPS buffer (44Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and then transferred to a Hybond XL nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in 20× SSC. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random priming method (45Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C overnight in a solution consisting of 50% (v/v) formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 6× SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml shared salmon sperm DNA (44Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The blots were washed twice in 2× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 10 min and twice in 0.2× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS at 55 °C for 15 min. Blots were analyzed with a fluorescent imaging analyzer (FLA2000; Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). The transcription initiation site of the rat L-PGDS gene was determined by the Cap Site Hunting method (46Maruyama K. Sugano S. Gene. 1994; 138: 171-174Google Scholar) with rat brain CapSite cDNA (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). Briefly, first-step PCR was performed by using LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo) with L-PGDS-E (5′-CGGAATTCTCTCACCTGTGTTTACTC-3′) and 1RDT (5′-GATGCTAGCTGCGAGTCAAGTC-3′; Nippon Gene) as the primers under the following amplification conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles. Nested PCR was carried out by using L-PGDS-C and 2RDT (5′-CGAGTCAAGTCGACGAAGTGC-3′; Nippon Gene) as the primers and first-step PCR products as the template under the same condition as used for the first-step PCR. Resultant PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy termination method with a Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and a Long Tower Read DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). An ∼1.3-kb fragment (−1250 to +77) consisting of the rat L-PGDS gene promoter was amplified by PCR with the gene-specific primer set withXhoI (sense) or HindIII (antisense) sites at their respective 5′-end. PCR fragments doubly digested withXhoI and Hind III were cloned into the upstream region of the luciferase reporter gene of the pGL3-Enhancer vector (Promega). The luciferase-reporter construct carrying the promoter region from −1250 to +77 was designated as −1250/+77. A deletion series was constructed in the same manner. Site-directed mutations were introduced into the putative cis-elements by PCR using mutated primers. All constructs were subjected to nucleotide sequencing to verify their correct sequence and orientation. For transfection, LM cells or those of the three cell lines were seeded at a density of ∼2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and co-transfected with each construct (0.4 μg) and pRL-CMV (0.1 μg; Promega), the latter carrying the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter as the transfection control, by use of Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the method prescribed by the manufacturer. The cells were cultured for 48 h. In the case of IL-1β stimulation, the cells were transfected in the same way as described above. After 48 h of transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without IL-1β (1 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and the cells were then incubated further for 24 h. The luciferase activities were measured by using a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). The reporter activity was calculated relative to that of pGL3-Enhancer vector and was defined as 1. All data were obtained from at least three independent experiments, and each experiment was performed in duplicate. The relative promoter activities were depicted as the mean ± S.D. Nuclear extracts were prepared as follows: cells were suspended in 500 μl of ice-cold buffer comprising 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a mixture of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin at 2 μg/ml each, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and vortexed vigorously. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 400 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and a mixture of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin at 2 μg/ml each, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous agitation. Nuclear extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as described previously (48Fujimori K. Kanaoka Y. Sakaguchi Y. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40511-40516Google Scholar). The expression vector for human Hes-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Caudy (Cornell University) and contained the human Hes-1 coding region fused to a FLAG-tagged sequence (49Castella P. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 229-240Google Scholar). Rat LM cells were co-transfected with the human Hes-1 expression vector and the −1250/+77 construct as described above. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activities were then measured. LM cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and subsequently washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm PMSF and a protease inhibitor mixture of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin at 2 μg/ml each. The cells were then lysed in 200 μl of buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm PMSF and a mixture of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin at 2 μg/ml each and then sonicated. After centrifugation to remove the cell debris, the supernatant was diluted with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.01% (w/v) SDS, and 0.5 mm PMSF and a mixture of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin at 2 μg/ml each and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 60 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), 20 μg of shared salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), and 60 μg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After the protein G-Sepharose had been removed by centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was incubated with the specific antibody and then 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose was added, and the incubation was continued at 4 °C for 1 h. The Sepharose beads were washed five times with washing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 and twice with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. The immunoprecipitated DNA-protein complexes were eluted with 500 μl of 1% (w/v) SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. DNA-protein cross-links were reversed at 65 °C for 5 h, after which the DNA was purified with a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and then used for PCR amplification with the following gene-specific primer sets: S1-F (5′-CTGTATAAAGCAGGAGAGTGC-3′) and S1-R (5′-GGCTGATTTGGGAGTTTTCTCC-3′), S2-F (5′-TGTGAGAAGCAGGTCTTAGCC-3′) and S2-R (5′-CATACCTCAGTGAAGAACGGG-3′), and H1-F (5′-CTCCAGTGGGCAGTCCTTGGG-3′) and H1-R (5′-GGGCTGCACGGAGACCTGGGC-3′) as the sense and antisense primers for NF-κB site 1, site 2, and E-box, respectively, of the rat L-PGDS promoter. PCR amplification was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 94 °C for 25 s, 55 °C for 25 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 34–40 cycles. The resultant PCR products were analyzed on 2% (w/v) agarose gels. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above and separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), washed, and then incubated with second antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by using the ECL Western blotting detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (AmershamBiosciences). The expression of the L-PGDS gene in the rat LM cells and rat cell lines was examined by RT-PCR. The rat L-PGDS mRNA was expressed abundantly in the LM cells (Fig.1 A, lane 1) and negligibly in F2408 (lane 2), RNB (lane 3), and C6 (lane 4) cell lines, whereas the expression of the mRNA for G3PDH as the internal control was almost identical in each cell (Fig. 1 A). Transient transfection experiments with the −1250/+77 construct in the rat LM cells and each of the three rat cell lines demonstrated that efficient reporter activity was detected only in the LM cells (Fig. 1 B). This result is in agreement with the expression of the L-PGDS mRNA demonstrated by the RT-PCR analysis and shows that the promoter region from −1250 to +77 contains the critical element(s) responsible for the cell type-specific expression of the rat L-PGDS gene. Therefore, we used this promoter region to study the transcriptional regulation mechanism involving the activation and/or suppression of L-PGDS gene expression in the LM cells. Transcription initiation sites were determined by the CapSite Hunting method. The sequence analysis of 18 clones demonstrated that nine of them had a nucleotide C of 77 base pairs upstream (defined as +1) of the A of the translation initiation codon, ATG, and that the remaining nine had a C of 75 base pairs upstream (Fig.2), indicating that rat L-PGDS gene expression was initiated predominantly from both of these transcription initiation sites in the brain. Surrounding both transcription initiation sites, a TATA-like box (ATAAATA) was found at a position from −28 to −22, but no typical CCAAT box was observed. Through a TRANSFAC search of the promoter region, several putativecis-elements such as NF-κB elements at −1106 and −291, an Sp-1 element at −926, an AP-2 element at −109, and an E-box at +57 were found. To elucidate the evolutional conservation of the promoter sequences between the human and rat L-PGDS genes, we aligned the 5′-flanking regions of both sequences (Fig. 2). The overall homology (61.9%) between them was observed in a region of ∼400 bp around the transcriptional initiation site. One of the transcription initiation sites of the rat L-PGDS gene showed a one-nucleotide difference from that of the human L-PGDS gene (24White D.M. Takeda T. DeGroot L.J. Stefansson K. Arnason B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14387-14393Google Scholar). Furthermore, severalcis-elements were conserved between them, including the TATA-like box (−28 to −22 for rat and human), the AP-2 element (−109 to −101 and −98 to −90 for rat and human, respectively), and the E- or N-box (+57 to +62 and −334 to −329 for rat and human, respectively). These results suggest that the human and rat L-PGDS genes are regulated in a similar manner. To determine the promoter activity and the important cis-elements involved in the regulation of L-PGDS gene expression, we introduced deletion and site-directed mutation into the promoter region and then conducted reporter analyses using rat LM cells. When the region from −1250 to +77 was used for the luciferase-reporter assay, efficient reporter activity was detected, indicating that this region containedcis-element(s) responsible for the regulation of gene expression (Fig. 1 B). By deletion of the region from −1250 to −281, which contained two NF-κB elements at −1106 and −291, and the Sp-1 element at −926, the promoter activity was decreased by ∼30% compared with that of the −1250/+77 construct (Fig.3), indicating that this region contained weak activation activity for the expression. A deletion from −280 to −100 resulted in a drastic decrease in the promoter activity by nearly 80% as compare"

To better understand distal enhancer-mediated transcription, we examined the regulation of the<i>FGF-4</i> gene. The <i>FGF-4</i> gene is regulated during early development by a powerful distal enhancer located downstream of the promoter in exon 3. Sox-2 and Oct-3 bind to the enhancer and are required for the activation of the <i>FGF-4</i> gene. Previously, we implicated the co-activator p300 as a mediator of Sox-2/Oct-3 synergistic activation of a heterologous promoter, suggesting that p300 may play a role in mediating enhancer activation of the<i>FGF-4</i> gene. In this study, we provide both functional and physical evidence that p300 plays an important role in the action of the <i>FGF-4</i> enhancer. Specifically, we show that E1a, but not a mutant form of E1a that is unable to bind p300, inhibits enhancer activation of the <i>FGF-4</i> promoter. We also demonstrate that Gal4/p300 fusion proteins can stimulate the <i>FGF-4</i>promoter when bound to the <i>FGF-4</i> enhancer. Additionally, we present evidence that p300 mediation of the<i>FGF-4</i> enhancer requires acetyltransferase activity. Importantly, we also show that Sox-2 and p300 are physically associated with the endogenous <i>FGF-4</i> enhancer but weakly associated with the endogenous <i>FGF-4</i> promoter. These results are consistent with a model of transitory interaction between the distal enhancer and the <i>FGF-4</i> promoter. Our results also suggest that intragenic distal enhancers may use mechanisms that differ from extragenic distal enhancers."

In adult animals, insulin and oxysterols induce SREBP-1c gene transcription, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress the nuclear content of SREBP-1c through pre-translational regulatory mechanisms. A decline in nuclear SREBP-1 is associated with suppression of hepatic lipogenesis. In contrast to adult rats, hepatic lipogenesis in preweaned neonatal rats is low. Ingestion of milk fat by the neonate may contribute to low hepatic lipogenesis. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that low lipogenic gene expression prior to weaning correlates with low mRNASREBP-1c, as well as low precursor and nuclear forms of SREBP-1. In contrast to expectations, levels of mRNASREBP-1c and the 125-kDa SREBP-1 precursor in livers of preweaned rats was comparable with adult levels. Despite high levels of SREBP-1 precursor, mature (65 kDa) SREBP-1 was not detected in rat liver nuclei prior to 18 days postpartum. Weaning rats at 21 days postpartum was accompanied by a rise in nuclear SREBP-1 levels as well as increased lipogenic gene expression. In contrast, SREBP-2 was present in rat liver nuclei, and its target gene,HMG-CoA reductase, was expressed above adult levels prior to weaning. These studies indicate that, prior to weaning, SREBP-2 but not SREBP-1 is proteolytically processed to the mature form. As such, SREBP-2-regulated genes are active.

Contrary to expectations, our studies indicated that both mRNASREBP-1 and pSREBP-1c are well expressed in rat liver prior to weaning. Only nSREBP-1c levels are low in neonatal liver, reflecting abrogated maturation of pSREBP-1 to nSREBP-1. We thank Drs. Karl Olson and Julia Busik for critical reading of the manuscript.

Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Google Scholar). In the second FN2 module from each MMP-2 and MMP-9, residues that are important for the interaction with gelatin have been identified via site-directed mutagenesis (6Collier I.E. Krasnov P.A.

Additionally, the ligand binding surfaces of all three modules of MMP-2 have been mapped from1H and 15N NMR perturbations induced by (PPG)6 and the longer chain analog, (PPG)12, synthetic peptide mimics of gelatin (2Briknarová K. Grishaev A. Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Llinás M Structure. 1999; 7: 1235-1245Google Scholar, 3Briknarová K. Gehrmann M. Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Llinás M J. Biol.

In line with the crystallographic evidence, which shows that the FN2 modules in MMP-2 point away from each other (5Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Google Scholar), our NMR studies of the interaction between Col domains and (PPG)6 and (PPG)12 have shown that consecutive Col modules contain distinct ligand-binding sites in which affinities for these ligands are virtually identical to those of the individual domains (3Briknarová K.

Although the affinity of the MMP-2 Col domains for collagenous ligands appears by now to be well established, less is known regarding the specificity of the interaction. In our previous studies we found that the peptide PIIKFPGDVA, which corresponds to segment 33–42 of the pro-MMP-2, interacts with the three Col domains of MMP-2 in a manner that mimics the interaction with the collagen-like (PPG)6and (PPG)12 peptides (3Briknarová K. Gehrmann M. Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Llinás M J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27613-27621Google Scholar, 4Gehrmann M. Briknarová K. Bányai L., H. Patthy L. Llinás M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 137-148Google Scholar). Preference for binding to Col-3 was indicated, consistent with the x-ray crystallographic structure of the pro-MMP-2 (5Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Google Scholar). In the proenzyme, the prodomain interacts intramolecularly with the putative gelatin-binding site of Col-3 via contacts that involve propeptide amino acid residues Ile-35, Phe-37, and Asp-40. As these studies indicate, the ligand specificity of the Col domains is not restricted to collagen-like peptides. It would be useful to gain more information as to the range of structural diversity acceptable for peptides to interact with the Col-binding sites. In the context of MMP-2 involvement in tumor invasion, metastasis and other physiopathological processes (reviewed in Ref. 9Yu A.E. Murphy A.N. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 85-113Google Scholar), it is highly desirable to identify agents that could block its activity. The suitability of MMP-2 as an anticancer target is supported by the finding that MMP-2-deficient mice display reduced angiogenesis and tumor progression (10Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1048-1051Google Scholar). However, very few inhibitors specific for MMP-2 have been described to date (11Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Penate-Medina O. Heikkilä P. Kantor C. Gahmber C.G. Salo T. Konttinen Y.T. Sorsa T. Rouslahti E. Pasqualine R. Nat. Biotechnology. 1999; 17: 768-774Google Scholar). The most potent inhibitors also inhibit several other MMP family members (12Talbot D.C. Brown P.D. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 2528-2533Google Scholar, 13Beckett R.P. Davidson A.H. Drummond A.H.

Bone E.A. Thomas W. Brown P.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2815-2822Google Scholar), they tend to elicit too broad a spectrum of response and often exhibit side effects. It can be speculated that active site inhibitors that also bind to the unique FN2 domains of MMP-2 may be more MMP-2-specific. As a platform for such studies, we have screened random 6-mer and random 15-mer phage display libraries for peptides that interact with the FN2 domains of MMP-2 and characterized the interaction of two selected peptides with the homologous gelatin-binding repeats via 1H/15N NMR studies on the Col-12 and Col-23 constructs. Microtiter plates (Greiner Labortechnik) were coated with the first (ॆgalCol-1), second (ॆgalCol-2), or third (ॆgalCol-3) FN2 modules from human MMP-2 (20Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 403-407Google Scholar) or with the three domains in tandem (ॆgalCol-123) (21Bányai L. Patthy L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 23-25Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins, consisting of the appropriate FN2 module(s) and an amino-terminal peptide derived from the ॆ-galactosidase moiety of the expression vector, were prepared as described previously (20Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 403-407Google Scholar, 21Bányai L. Patthy L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 23-25Google Scholar). The plates were incubated with the proteins (20 ॖg/ml) in 100 mmNaHCO3 buffer for 2 h at 37 °C, after which they were blocked with 30 mg/ml serum albumin in 100 mmNaHCO3 buffer for 2 h at 37 °C and washed six times with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl) and 0.57 Tween 20. ॆgalCol-123-Sepharose was prepared using cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and ॆgalCol-123 according to instructions from the manufacturer. Two phage fUSE5 libraries, which express a foreign 15- or 6-mer random peptide library at the amino-terminal end of all five copies of its pIII coat protein (22Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Google Scholar) and the Escherichia coli strain K91Kan (thi/HfrC), carrying a 舠mini-kan hopper舡 element inserted in the lacZ gene, were obtained from Prof. G. Smith (University of Missouri-Columbia). The number of primary clones in the 15-mer library is 2.5 × 108 (23Nishi T. Budde R.J.A. McMurray J.S. Oberyesekere N.U. Safdar N. Levin V.A. Saya H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 237-240Google Scholar), and in the case of the 6-mer library it is 2 × 108 (22Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Google Scholar). Approximately 1010 phage/well in 100 ॖl of TBS buffer were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Nonspecifically adsorbed phage were washed away with 12 times with 200 ॖl of TBS buffer containing 5 mg/ml serum albumin and 0.57 Tween 20. Unless otherwise indicated, bound phage were eluted with 2 times with 200 ॖl of TBS buffer containing 1 mg/ml gelatin type A from porcine skin type I collagen (Sigma). In some experiments with immobilized ॆgalCol-123, elution was performed with buffer containing 2 mg/ml ॆgalCol-123. Alternatively, ∼1010 phage in 200 ॖl of TBS buffer were incubated with 50 ॖl of ॆgalCol-123-Sepharose for 60 min. The resin was then washed with 10 ml of TBS buffer containing 5 mg/ml serum albumin and 0.57 Tween 20, and the bound phage were eluted with 3 × 200 ॖl of TBS buffer containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. The eluted phages were amplified, and a portion was used in the next biopanning cycle (24Parmley S.F. Smith G.P. Gene. 1988; 73: 305-318Google Scholar). After three rounds, individual phage were isolated, and the DNA sequence of the 5′ end of the gene III was determined using a primer complementary to the positions 1663–1680 of the wild type gene. The peptides ACGYTYHPPCARLTV (ACG), WFPGPITFIPRPWSS (WFP), WHWRHRIPLQLAAGR (WHW), THSHQWRHHQFPAPT (THS), and HASHFRFRHSHVYGV (HAS) were synthesized on an AB-PE 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems-PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. 15N-labeled Col-12 and Col-23 modules from human MMP-2 (residues 223–337 and 278–394 respectively) (Fig. 1) were expressed in E. coliand purified as described previously (3Briknarová K.

Chem. 2002; 383: 137-148Google Scholar). To monitor ligand-induced resonance shifts, small aliquots of WHW or THS stock solutions in 907 H2O, 107 D2O, pH 7.0, were added to samples of 0.35 mm15N-labeled Col-12 and Col-23 in 907 H2O, 107 D2O, pH 7.0, and 1H-15N HSQC experiments (25Müller L.

Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Google Scholar) were recorded at each step. All of the data were acquired at 25 °C on Bruker Avance DMX-500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance three-axis gradient probe. The spectra were processed and analyzed with the programs Felix 95 and Felix 98 (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics Indy R-5000 work station. Protein and peptide ligand concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (28Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Google Scholar). Values of the equilibrium association constant (Ka) were determined by a combination of linear and nonlinear least squares fitting of the chemical shift changes, as described previously (29Marti D.N. Hu C.-K. An S.S.A. von Haller P. Schaller J. Llinás M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11591-11604Google Scholar, 30An S.S.A. Marti D.N. Carreño C. Albericio F. Schaller J. Llinás M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1947-1959Google Scholar). To identify peptides that bind to the FN2 modules from MMP-2, phage display 6-mer or 15-mer random peptide libraries were screened with ॆgalCol-1, ॆgalCol-2, ॆgalCol-3 and ॆgalCol-123. Nonspecifically adsorbed phage were washed away with buffer containing 5 mg/ml serum albumin, then-in most experiments-specifically bound phage was eluted with buffer containing gelatin. In the case of the 6-mer library-unlike in the case of the 15-mer library-there was no enrichment of bound phage after three rounds of biopanning. This observation suggested that a six-residue-long peptide may be too short for unique recognition of FN2 domains, therefore we concentrated on the 15-mer library. From the latter library, after three rounds of biopanning, individual clones were sequenced and the following peptides were identified: ACGYTYHPPCARLTV (ACG), WFPGPITFIPRPWSS (WFP), WHWRHRIPLQLAAGR (WHW), THSHQWRHHQFPAPT (THS), WHVSPRHQRLFHGLF (WHV) and HASHFRFRHSHVYGV (HAS). The frequencies of the peptides selected under various conditions are summarized in Table I. Interestingly, the peptides are not collagen-like and do not share a common, obvious sequence motif. However, their sequences exhibit biased amino acid composition. For example, although His accounts for only 27 of residues in protein databases, the selected peptides contain 167 His. This trend is even more pronounced for peptides selected on single FN2 domains, which contain 227 His. There also is bias in the aromatic amino acid content: whereas Tyr, Trp and Phe account for 87 of residues in protein databases, in the selected peptides, their proportion is 167. Interestingly, peptide inhibitors of the whole gelatinases that have been selected previously from phage display library (11Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Penate-Medina O. Heikkilä P. Kantor C. Gahmber C.G. Salo T. Konttinen Y.T. Sorsa T. Rouslahti E. Pasqualine R. Nat. Biotechnology. 1999; 17: 768-774Google Scholar) are similarly enriched in aromatic residues whereas those from combinatorial (31Ferry G. Boutin J.A. Atassi G. Fauchère J.L. Tucker G.C. Mol. Div. 1996; 2: 135-146Google Scholar) library contain multiple histidines. Our results suggest that not only interaction with the active site but also binding to FN2 modules may contribute to activity of these inhibitors. It is also noteworthy that peptide WFP contains sequence FPG which is found in the pro-domain (residues 37–39); F37 from this motif inserts into the hydrophobic gelatin-binding pocket of Col-3 in the x-ray structure of pro-MMP-2 (5Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K.

In turn, this indicates that despite the sequence differences between the modules, the ligand-binding sites of the three domains are likely to possess common features. The ACG peptide, which was recovered with the greatest frequency on immobilized ॆgalCol-123, has two cysteines that may form a cystine bridge, thus constraining the structure. It is a common observation with phage display peptides that those with the highest affinity tend to be cyclic (11Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Penate-Medina O. Heikkilä P. Kantor C. Gahmber C.G. Salo T. Konttinen Y.T. Sorsa T. Rouslahti E. Pasqualine R. Nat. Biotechnology. 1999; 17: 768-774Google Scholar, 32O'Neil K.T. Hoess R.H. Jackson S.A. Ramachandran N.S. Mousa S.A.

Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 265-270Google Scholar). Interestingly, ACG was rarely selected on single Col domains, which suggests that the complementary binding surface on ॆgalCol-123 comprises multiple modules. There is a striking difference between clones eluted from ॆgalCol-123 with gelatin and those eluted with ॆgalCol-123. Although gelatin will primarily elute phage that interacts with the gelatin-binding site of Col-123, ॆgalCol-123 is likely to release phage bound to any part of the protein. Therefore, peptides that become enriched upon elution with ॆgalCol-123 relative to elution with gelatin (WHV and, to a lesser extent, WHW) are likely to interact with a region situated at least partially outside of the gelatin-binding surface. The interaction of the peptides with Col-12 and Col-23 was investigated using NMR (Fig.1). Because of solubility problems, only WHW and THS were found suitable for this study. Col-12 and Col-23 chemical shift changes induced by WHW and THS binding were monitored in1H-15N HSQC spectra (Fig.2), and affinity constants (Ka) were calculated from the ligand titration curves (Fig. 3, Table II). The first and second modules of the Col-12 construct bind to WHW withKa ∼ 1.9 ± 0.2 mm−1(Col-12/1) and Ka ∼ 2.6 ± 0.3 mm−1 (Col-12/2). Within experimental errors, the latter agrees with the value derived for Col-23/2, Ka ∼ 2.8 ± 0.4 mm−1. For Col-23/3, Ka ∼ 3.0 ± 0.5 mm−1 was determined. The affinity of THS for the Col modules is somewhat weaker, withKa ∼ 0.9 ± 0.2 mm−1for Col-12/1, Ka ∼ 0.9 ± 0.3 mm−1 for Col-12/2 and Col-23/2, andKa ∼ 0.3 ± 0.1 mm−1for Col-23/3.Figure 3Profile of WHW (A) and THS(B) binding to Col-12 and Col-23 monitored by NMR.

Chem. 2002; 383: 137-148Google Scholar), we mapped the gelatin binding surface of the Col modules by localizing spectral perturbations induced by the synthetic gelatin-like peptides (PPG)6 and (PPG)12 on the three-dimensional structures of the modules (Fig.4). This approach proved to be less straightforward in the current study. Backbone amide resonances stemming from the termini and the linking segment of the two-domain constructs are affected by WHW (Figs. 2and 5) and THS (Fig. 6); similar effects were observed during titration of Col-23 with the synthetic gelatin mimics (compare against Fig. 4, C and D). However, in the latter study, the shifts arising from the linking peptide were negligible relative to those marking the gelatin-binding pocket. In the current experiments, on the other hand, most spectral perturbations were of similar magnitude or smaller than those localized in the termini and linker. Hence, it is difficult to distinguish the effects caused by direct contact with the ligand from shifts related to altered conformation or dynamics due to peptide binding elsewhere. Chemical shift perturbations at locations distant from ligand contact sites have been observed previously in other systems (35Foster M.P. Wuttke D.S. Clemens K.R. Jahnke W. Radhakrishnan I.

Front (left) and back (right) views are shown. The description of the figure is the same as for Figs. 4 and 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The gelatin-binding surfaces of Col modules comprise an aromatic cluster and its surrounding region, in particular the loop comprising residues 33–38, at the front face of the domains. The distribution of WHW- and THS-induced shifts on the three-dimensional structures of Col modules can be summarized as follows (Figs. 5 and 6). In the first FN2 module within the Col-12 construct (Col-12/1), WHW predominantly affects residues neighboring the gelatin-binding pocket, most notably residues Gly-33, Arg-34 and Trp-40. In the second FN2 module within both the Col-12 and Col-23 constructs (Col-12/2 and Col-23/2), WHW perturbs mainly the termini, whereas the loop on the front face, which is involved in gelatin binding, is affected to a lesser extent. In the third FN2 module in Col-23 (Col-23/3), WHW-induced resonance shifts are limited to the back of the domain and include the termini and exposed hydrophobic patch, which encompasses, among others, residues Cys-15 to Phe-17; the front side is affected only minimally. Thus, it may be concluded that WHW interacts with the gelatin-binding pocket of Col-1 (4Gehrmann M. Briknarová K. Bányai L., H. Patthy L. Llinás M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 137-148Google Scholar) and possibly Col-2. In agreement with such an interpretation, WHW has been selected most frequently by gelatin elution from plates coated with ॆgalCol-1 and less so from those coated with ॆgalCol-2 (Table I). THS perturbs amide resonances stemming from residues on the right-hand rim of the gelatin-binding pocket in all Col modules (Fig. 6), suggesting that THS contacts Col modules via this site. Signals from the termini are also affected. Design of inhibitors that act on MMP-2 but not on other metalloproteases is a challenging task. Because MMP-2 (together with MMP-9) is unique in having FN2 domains positioned next to its catalytic cleft, active site inhibitors that also interact with FN2 domains should be much more specific. Hence, we have screened random 6- and 15-mer phage display libraries and identified several peptides from the latter library that interact with the FN2 modules of MMP-2."

In the brain, these neurons are especially vulnerable to effects of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Choline acetyltransferase is a substrate for several protein kinases. In the present study, we demonstrate that short term exposure of IMR32 neuroblastoma cells expressing human choline acetyltransferase to Aβ-(1–42) changes phosphorylation of the enzyme, resulting in increased activity and alterations in its interaction with other cellular proteins. Using mass spectrometry, we identified threonine 456 as a new phosphorylation site in choline acetyltransferase from Aβ-(1–42)-treated cells and in purified recombinant ChAT phosphorylated in vitro by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). Whereas phosphorylation of choline acetyltransferase by protein kinase C alone caused a 2-fold increase in enzyme activity, phosphorylation by CaM kinase II alone did not alter enzyme activity. A 3-fold increase in choline acetyltransferase activity was found with coordinate phosphorylation of threonine 456 by CaM kinase II and phosphorylation of serine 440 by protein kinase C. This phosphorylation combination was observed in choline acetyltransferase from Aβ-(1–42)-treated cells. Treatment of cells with Aβ-(1–42) resulted in two phases of activation of choline acetyltransferase, the first within 30 min and associated with phosphorylation by protein kinase C and the second by 10 h and associated with phosphorylation by both CaM kinase II and protein kinase C. We also show that choline acetyltransferase from Aβ-(1–42)-treated cells co-immunoprecipitates with valosin-containing protein, and mutation of threonine 456 to alanine abolished the Aβ-(1–42)-induced effects. These studies demonstrate that Aβ-(1–42) can acutely regulate the function of choline acetyltransferase, thus potentially altering cholinergic neurotransmission.

Shifts in production of soluble APPα by α-secretase to production of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) with activation of β- and γ-secretase in Alzheimer's disease and following traumatic head injury are associated with decreased function and communication by cholinergic neurons (1Selkoe D.J.

These acute effects of Aβ peptides on neurotransmission and synaptic efficacy probably differ from the neurotoxicity produced by long term exposure and high (micromolar) concentrations of the peptides that cause death of cholinergic neurons. Mechanisms underlying acute and long term effects of Aβ peptides on cholinergic function have not been resolved. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; EC 2.3.1.6) produces the neurotransmitter ACh in cholinergic neurons. ChAT undergoes covalent modification post-translationally by protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation (14Bruce G. Hersh L.B. Neurochem. Res. 1989; 14: 613-620Google Scholar, 15Schmidt B.M. Rylett R.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22244-22250Google Scholar), and we showed previously that it is a substrate for a number of protein kinases (17Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Google Scholar). Catalytic activity of this enzyme, its subcellular distribution, and potentially its interaction with other cellular proteins can be regulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. For example, phosphorylation of ChAT by protein kinase C (PKC) on Serine 440 led to a significant increase in its activity and ionic binding to plasma membrane in cells (18Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22244-22250Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ChAT could be altered by changes in activity or subcellular redistribution of protein kinases brought about by neuronal perturbations or pathology such as Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury. This could alter ACh biosynthesis and cholinergic neurotransmission and cause dysfunction of cholinergic neurons. Aβ peptides modulate a range of cellular signal transduction pathways and protein kinases (19Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Google Scholar, 20Wyss-Coray T. McConlogue L. Kindy M. Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Stern D.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 967-973Google Scholar, 21Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Google Scholar). Whereas a number of potential cell surface receptors for Aβ peptides have been identified (20Wyss-Coray T. McConlogue L. Kindy M. Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Stern D.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 967-973Google Scholar, 21Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J.

Yakel J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC120Google Scholar), it is unclear how these peptides mediate their cellular actions either acutely or in the longer term. It is known, however, that Aβ peptides can alter cell calcium homeostasis, leading to increased cytosolic free calcium levels (24Mattson M.P. Chan S.L. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 205-224Google Scholar, 25MacManus A. Ramsden M. Murray M. Henderson Z. Pearson H.A. Campbell V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4713-4718Google Scholar). Within a certain concentration range, this could activate a number of calcium-dependent processes, including calcium-dependent protein kinases such as PKC and α-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). Since ChAT is known to be a substrate for both of these protein kinases (17Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Google Scholar), it is likely that Aβ peptides could affect cholinergic neurotransmission through regulation of function of this enzyme. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that short term exposure of IMR32 neuroblastoma cells stably expressing human 69-kDa ChAT to Aβ peptides would lead to altered function of the enzyme. Interestingly, we observed that treatment of cells with Aβ-(1–42), but not Aβ-(1–40), changed the state of phosphorylation of ChAT, revealing a new putative CaM kinase II phosphorylation site. Furthermore, phosphorylation at this site, when coordinated with phosphorylation of Ser440 by PKC, leads to a hierarchical activation of ChAT and phosphorylation-dependent association of the enzyme with other cellular proteins, including valosin-containing protein (VCP; p97, Cdc48). The cDNA for human 69-kDa ChAT (N1-ChAT) in pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. H. Misawa (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience). The mutant ChAT-T456A was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of Thr456 → Ala in wild-type 69-kDa ChAT using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), with the forward primer 5′-CAGATCGGCCGCTCCAGAGGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCCTCTGGAGCGGCCGATCTG-3′. The presence of the mutation was verified at the nucleotide level by automated DNA sequencing and at the protein level by ESI-MS/MS sequencing. Mutant ChAT-S440A was prepared previously (18Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22244-22250Google Scholar). Human neuroblastoma IMR32 cells were transfected with plasmids containing wild-type 69-kDa human ChAT or mutants ChAT-T456A or ChAT-S440A in pcDNA3.1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). G418-resistant stable transformants were selected and tested for ChAT enzyme activity by radioenzymatic assay and ChAT protein by immunoblot. Cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 0.5% G418 in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For experiments, monolayers of cells were treated at ∼70% confluence. At 4 h before treatment, fresh medium was added to cells, and then Aβ peptides (1–40 or 1–42) or reverse peptides (40–1 or 42–1) used as negative controls were diluted in culture medium to final concentrations of 100 nmfrom 100 μm stocks and added to cells for varying times up to 18 h. For protein kinase inhibition studies, cell-permeable inhibitors (Calbiochem) of PKC (H7; 50 μm), CaM kinase II (KN-93; 5 μm), p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (SB202190; 10 μm), or MEK-1/MEK-2 (U0126; 50 μm) were added to the media 2 h before the addition of Aβ peptides. Aβ peptides (Bachem) were dissolved in double-distilled H2O (1–40 and 40–1) or 0.1% ammonium hydroxide (1–42 and 42–1) at 100 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 4 days (26Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Google Scholar); aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use. For protein phosphorylation studies in cells, culture medium was changed to phosphate-free modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi/ml) at 3 h before the end of the treatment with Aβ peptides; in the case of treatment times shorter than 3 h, phosphate-free modified Eagle's medium and [32P]orthophosphate were added with Aβ peptides at the beginning of the incubation interval. Following treatment, lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin/aprotinin/pepstatin at 10/25/10 μg/ml, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 700 units/ml DNase I) was added to cells and incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged (15,000 ×g for 10 min), and supernatants were used for analysis of activity or phosphorylation of ChAT or for analysis of proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with ChAT. ChAT activity was measured radioenzymatically using a modification of the method of Fonnum (27Fonnum F. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 465-479Google Scholar), as published previously (28Rylett R.J. Goddard S. Lambros A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1388-1397Google Scholar). CD spectra of Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–42), and the corresponding reverse peptides were recorded on a Jasco spectopolarimeter, model J-810, at 25 °C in a 0.1-cm path length cell at 0.2-nm intervals over the wavelength range 190–260 nm. Peptides were analyzed at a concentration of 50 μm in double-distilled H2O (1–40 and 40–1) or 0.1% ammonium hydroxide (1–42 and 42–1). To assess structural composition of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) peptide solutions by electron microscopy, carbon-formvar-coated grids were floated on a drop of each sample to allow peptides to adhere. After 3 min, grids were blotted lightly and then floated on either 1% phosphotungstic acid or 2% uranyl acetate. Following staining, grids were blotted and air-dried, and then representative images were acquired by examining grids in a Philips EM300 electron microscope operated at 60 kV. Cleared cell lysates were mixed with CTab anti-ChAT antibody (17Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Google Scholar) (5 μl of 2 mg/ml stock) or anti-VCP antibody (2 μl of crude rabbit antiserum) for 1 h on ice; VCP antibody was obtained from Dr. L. Samelson (NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD) (29Egerton M. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11435-11441Google Scholar). Immune complexes were captured onto Protein-G Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Electrophoresis sample buffer (3.3% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the beads, and immune complexes were dissociated by heating samples at 60 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 2 min), supernatant proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose membranes in a semidry electroblotting apparatus using transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine) containing 20% methanol. For detection of ChAT or VCP, blotting membranes were saturated with 8% nonfat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline and probed with anti-ChAT CTab antibody (1:2,000) or anti-VCP antibody (1:2,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and bound antibodies were detected by incubation for 1 h with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:5,000; Amersham Biosciences) and the ECL kit (AmershamBiosciences). Bacterially expressed recombinant 69-kDa human ChAT was immunoaffinity-purified as described previously (18Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22244-22250Google Scholar). To identify amino acid residues phosphorylated by CaM kinase II, 5 μg (0.5 μl) of purified ChAT protein was mixed with 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, 100 μm ATP) and 2 milliunits of purified CaM kinase II (a gift from Dr. H. Schulman, Stanford University) for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation reactions were stopped by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer. To determine effects of hierarchical phosphorylation of ChAT by PKC and CaM kinase II on ChAT enzymatic activity, a PKC phosphorylation reaction was carried out for 15 min at 30 °C as described previously (17Dobransky T. Davis W.L. Xiao G.H. Rylett R.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 141-151Google Scholar), followed by phosphorylation by CaM kinase II for an additional 15 min. ChAT activity was measured immediately at 37 °C. IMR32 cells expressing 69-kDa human ChAT were used to assess whether CaM kinase II is activated by treatment with Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–42), and reverse control peptides Aβ-(40–1) and Aβ-(42–1) using the method of Heasley and Johnson (31Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8646-8652Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic CaM kinase II-specific peptide KKALRRQETVDAL was used as a substrate to monitor CaM kinase II activity in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Cells grown in 24-well plates were treated in the presence or absence of Aβ peptides and then rinsed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffered with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Permeabilization solution (100 μl composed of 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 μg/ml digitonin, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 μm cold ATP, 0.4 nm[γ-32P]ATP) (10 μCi/well) supplemented with 1 mm CaM kinase substrate peptide was added to cells for 10 min at 30 °C. A parallel set of control cells were treated in the same manner but without substrate peptide added to obtain a measure of background [32P]phosphate incorporation. KN-93, a cell-permeable inhibitor of CaM kinase II, or its inactive analog KN-92 (5 μm) was added as an additional control. Incubation was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of ice-cold 25% trichloroacetic acid, and then 40 μl of acidified cellular lysate was spotted onto 25-mm phosphocellulose discs (Whatman P-81) (32Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Google Scholar). Filter discs were washed three times with 75 mm phosphoric acid and once with 75 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and then dried and placed in scintillation mixture for determination of radioactivity. Proteins were digested in 0.2 m NaOH and assayed as described by Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) to determine specific activity of peptide phosphorylation expressed as pmol/min/mg protein. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were stained briefly with Coomassie Blue, and then gels were destained and washed for 3 h with at least five solvent changes (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid) to ensure adequate removal of SDS. Gels were subsequently washed with three changes of H2O, and then bands corresponding to ChAT or co-immunoprecipitated proteins were excised from gels and washed with two changes of acetonitrile. Gel slices were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 50 °C for 30 min and alkylated by 55 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 20 min, followed by washing three times with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. After two changes of acetonitrile, gel pieces were dried by vacuum centrifuge and rehydrated in trypsin digestion buffer (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 5 mmCaCl2) containing 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (34Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). After a 45-min incubation on ice, excess trypsin solution was removed, 15 μl of digestion buffer without trypsin was added, and samples were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with two changes of 100 μl of ammonium carbonate buffer by shaking in an orbital shaker for 45 min. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants with eluted peptides were pooled and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation to a final volume of 15 μl. Pooled extracts were acidified with glacial acetic acid at a final concentration of 1%. Two-dimensional thin layer phosphopeptide maps of ChAT were prepared as described previously (35Hemmings H.C.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14491-14497Google Scholar). Following in-gel tryptic digestion of proteins, samples were applied to cellulose TLC plates by sequential spotting of 0.5-μl droplets and electrophoresed in the first dimension in water/acetic acid/formic acid (89.7:7.8:2.5, v/v/v, pH 1.9) at 1000 V for 45 min. Plates were air-dried and developed in the second dimension in water/n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/acetic acid (30:37.5:25:7.5, v/v/v/v). Phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography using Eastman Kodak Co. XAR-5 film at −70 °C. Phosphopeptides required for further analysis were eluted from TLC plates with water/acetonitrile (4:1, v/v) (36Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Google Scholar) and then reduced to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile and 1% acetic acid. This solution of peptides was used directly for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis. For ESI-MS/MS sequencing, peptides were purified on ZipTipC18TM according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore Corp.) and eluted from the tip resin with 65% acetonitrile and 1% acetic acid. Phosphoamino acid analysis was also performed on phosphopeptides eluted from cellulose plates or directly on mixtures of phosphopeptides recovered after in-gel tryptic digestion. Tryptic peptides were lyophilized, resuspended in 70 μl of 6 m HCl, and boiled at 110 °C for 1 h. One- or two-dimensional phosphoamino acid mapping were performed as described by Boyle et al.(37Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on a Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer (Micromass), equipped with a nanoflow source. The instrument was calibrated with [Glu 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, β-amyloid; ACh, acetylcholine; APP, amyloid precursor protein; ChAT, choline acetyltransferase; CTab, anti-ChAT carboxyl-terminal peptide antibody; CaM kinase II, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; PKC, protein kinase C; VCP, valosin-containing protein]Fibrinopeptide B (Sigma), and following desalting on a ZipTipC18TM (4 μl), the concentrated protein digest sample was loaded into a borosilicate capillary (type F; Micromass). A voltage between 600 and 1000 V was applied to the capillary in order to produce nanomolar flow. Parent ion scanning was performed over the m/z range of 300–1500 monitoring neutral loss of 97.9769 and 49.9885 with a collision energy of 32 V. Masses that resulted in such neutral losses were subsequently further fragmented to obtain sequence information. Resultant spectra were background-subtracted and deconvoluted using MaxEnt3 software provided in the Micromass MassLynx version 3.5 software package. The sequence of the peptides was determined using PepSeq version 3.3 software also provided in the MassLynx 3.5 software. Amino acid sequences of tryptic phosphopeptides of ChAT isolated from control and Aβ-treated cells or for identification of unknown proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with ChAT were obtained by mass spectrometry performed on a Micromass Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray source and an online Waters CapLC (Waters). In all cases, 1 μl of sample was injected from the autosampler. The instrument was calibrated with [Glu 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, β-amyloid; ACh, acetylcholine; APP, amyloid precursor protein; ChAT, choline acetyltransferase; CTab, anti-ChAT carboxyl-terminal peptide antibody; CaM kinase II, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; PKC, protein kinase C; VCP, valosin-containing protein]Fibrinopeptide B (Sigma). A gradient consisting of 5–65% B in 15.5 min (A = 0.1% formic acid, B = acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) flowing at 1 μl/min was used to elute peptides from a 300-μm inner diameter reversed-phase precolumn (LC-packings, San Francisco, CA) to the mass spectrometer. Survey spectra were acquired in them/z range of 400–2000. Doubly or triply charged precursor ions were automatically selected for fragmentation by the quadrupole mass filter. In some cases, specific masses were identified for fragmentation. Fragmentation was achieved by collision with argon gas in the collision cell. The collision energy was automatically varied depending on the charge state of the parent peptide. Resultant spectra were background-subtracted and deconvoluted using MaxEnt3 software provided in the Micromass MassLynx 3.5 software package. The sequence of the peptides was determined using PepSeq version 3.3 software also provided in the MassLynx 3.5 software. Proteins co-immunoprecipitating with ChAT were identified initially by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Samples were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with matrix solution containing 1:1 ethanol/acetonitrile saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Each sample (1 μl) was spotted onto the MALDI target plate in triplicate. MALDI-TOF MS was performed on a MALDI-R mass spectrometer (Micromass). Calibration was performed externally using angiotensin I (Sigma), renin substrate (Sigma), adenocorticotrophic hormone clip 18–39 (Sigma) for a three-point calibration. In addition, for each sample, the lockmass method was used as additional calibration with the standard adenocorticotrophic hormone clip 18–39. The peptide mass fingerprint spectra were matched to the NCBI nonredundant data base entries by using the following programs, available on the World Wide Web: Profound (www.proteometrics.com) and Mascot (www.matrixscience.com). The mass tolerance was set to 60 ppm, and two missed cleavage sites were tolerated with the search restricted to human proteins. Stock solutions of Aβ peptide used to treat cells in the present studies were analyzed by CD and electron microscopy to obtain information that would allow relative comparisons to be made about peptide conformations. As shown in Fig.1 A, CD analysis revealed that the secondary structure of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) were qualitatively identical in that they were both composed predominantly of β-sheet conformation indicated by minimum molar ellipticity at 215 nm. Based on the shape of the CD spectra, negligible random coil or α-helical content was present in these two peptides. To obtain quantitatively similar signal strength on CD spectra, the concentration of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) used were 50 and 30 μm, respectively. By comparison, the reverse peptides Aβ-(40–1) and Aβ-(42–1) had a predominantly random coil conformation. In support of the CD data, as illustrated in Fig. 1 B, electron microscopic analysis confirmed that solutions of both Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) contained characteristic Aβ-fibrils. IMR32 cells expressing 69-kDa human ChAT were incubated with Aβ-(1–42) for varying times, and then incorporation of [32P]phosphate and enzyme activity were monitored. As illustrated in Fig.2 A, catalytic activity of ChAT was increased within 30 min of the addition of Aβ-(1–42) to cultures, with this effect being maximal at 10 h (2-fold increase in ChAT-specific activity). The effect of Aβ-(1–42) on ChAT activity followed a biphasic time course, with the response diminishing beyond 10 h. Immunoblots shown in Fig. 2 C (upper panel) demonstrate that cellular ChAT concentration was unchanged over the treatment interval. Phosphorylation of ChAT was also increased up to 3-fold by treatment of cells with Aβ-(1–42) in a manner that paralleled the time course for change in activity of the enzyme, as shown in Fig. 2 B; the corresponding autoradiography data are provided in Fig. 2 C(lower panel). Control cells were treated with inactive peptide Aβ-(42–1); ChAT activity measured in cells with the addition of Aβ-(42–1) did not differ from cells with no Aβ peptide added. ChAT activity was not altered in cells treated for up to 18 h with Aβ-(1–40) or its reverse peptide Aβ-(40–1) (data not shown). However, a 2-fold increase in [32P]phosphate incorporation into Ch"
https://openalex.org/W2047508221,"Sphingomonas sp. A1 possesses a high molecular weight (HMW) alginate uptake system composed of a novel pit formed on the cell surface and a pit-dependent ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in the inner membrane. The transportation of HMW alginate from the pit to the ABC transporter is mediated by the periplasmic HMW alginate-binding proteins AlgQ1 and AlgQ2. We determined the crystal structure of AlgQ2 complexed with an alginate tetrasaccharide using an alginate-free (apo) form as a search model and refined it at 1.6-Å resolution. One tetrasaccharide was found between the N and C-terminal domains, which are connected by three extended hinge loops. The tetrasaccharide complex took on a closed domain form, in contrast to the open domain form of the apo form. The tetrasaccharide was bound in the cleft between the domains through van der Waals interactions and the formation of hydrogen bonds. Among the four sugar residues, the nonreducing end residue was located at the bottom of the cleft and exhibited the largest number of interactions with the surrounding amino acid residues, suggesting that AlgQ2 mainly recognizes and binds to the nonreducing part of a HMW alginate and delivers the polymer to the ABC transporter through conformational changes (open and closed forms) of the two domains.

ABC 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; HMW, high molecular weight; ABP, l-arabinose-binding protein; G, α-l-glucuronate; GBP, galactose-binding protein; GG block, homopolymeric poly-α-l-glucuronate; GM block, heteropolymeric saccharide; M, β-d-mannuronate; ΔM, unsaturated β-d-mannuronate; MBP, maltodextrin/maltose-binding protein; MG block, heteropolymeric saccharide; MM block, homopolymeric poly-β-d-mannuronate; RBP, ribose-binding protein; WAT, water molecule transporters are widely found in bacteria to humans. All of them consist of two membrane proteins spanning the cytoplasmic membrane and forming a translation pore with two ATPase molecules providing the energy for accumulation of a substrate inside the cell membrane. Furthermore, ABC importers of Gram-negative bacteria depend on a periplasmic substrate-specific binding protein. A Gram-negative soil bacterium, Sphingomonas sp. A1, was isolated as a potent producer of an alginate lyase, which catalyzes the depolymerization of a high molecular weight (HMW) alginate (average molecular size, 25,700 Da) (1Hisano T. Yonemoto Y. Yamashita T. Fukuda Y. Kimura A. Murata K. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1995; 79: 538-544Google Scholar). Sphingomonas sp. A1 cells are covered with many large plaits (2Hisano T. Kimura N. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 979-982Google Scholar). When they are assimilating an alginate, pits (0.02–0.1 μm in diameter) are formed on their surface through reconstitution and/or rearrangement of these plaits, and the biopolymer is concentrated in the pits (3Momma K. Hashimoto W. Miyake O. Yoon H.-J. Kawai S. Mishima Y. Mikami B. Murata K. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 23: 425-435Google Scholar). The alginate thus accumulated is then delivered through the action of periplasmic alginate-binding proteins (AlgQ1 and AlgQ2) to a pit-dependent ABC transporter. An alginate-specific ABC transporter consists of AlgM1 and AlgM2 as membrane-spanning permeases and AlgS as an ATP-binding protein (4Momma K. Okamoto M. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3998-4004Google Scholar). An alginate is a polymer comprising β-d-mannuronate (M) and its C5 epimer, α-l-glucuronate (G) (5Periss J. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 309-316Google Scholar). There are block structures that have been shown to cause the gelation and viscosity of the alginate produced by brown seaweed or certain kinds of bacteria (6Rees D.A. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 257-273Google Scholar). The block structures are usually arranged as homopolymeric poly-β-d-mannuronates (MM blocks), homopolymeric poly-α-l-glucuronates (GG blocks), or heteropolymeric saccharides (MG or GM blocks) within the alginate molecule (7Pernas A. Smidsrod O. Larsen B. Haug A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1967; 21: 98-110Google Scholar). The HMW alginate-binding proteins of Sphingomonas sp. A1, AlgQ1 and AlgQ2, are members of a large group of periplasmic binding proteins of Gram-negative bacteria (4Momma K. Okamoto M. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3998-4004Google Scholar). AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 exhibit high amino acid sequence similarity to each other (74% homology), although their sequence identity with other binding proteins is less than 30%. Both AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 function in a monomeric form of 57 kDa. Although binding proteins have a diverse set of ligands (e.g.monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, oxyanions, amino acids, oligopeptides, and vitamins), an extraordinary feature of AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 is that they bind to a macromolecule with similar high affinities, the Kd values being around 10−6–10−7m (8Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Google Scholar). Periplasmic binding proteins of ABC transporters are found in various kinds of prokaryotic microbes (8Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Google Scholar), and the crystal structures of some of these proteins have been determined. Although they exhibit little sequence similarity and are different sizes, ranging from 20 to 60 kDa (8Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Google Scholar), they have similar overall structures composed of two globular domains with a deep cleft between the domains. The binding of substrates periplasmic proteins favors their closure via large scale hinge bending motions (8Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Google Scholar). These movements are required for productive interaction with the membrane permeases. The structures of periplasmic binding proteins of Gram-negative bacteria have many common features as described above, and almost all of them so far analyzed were found to be responsible for the binding of small solutes such as maltose, ribose, amino acids, peptides, and metals (8Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Google Scholar). However, AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 can bind a macromolecule, and this HMW alginate-specific ABC transporter has two binding proteins (AlgQ1 and AlgQ2), although bacterial ABC transporters generally have one periplasmic binding protein. Because alginate is composed of two sugar monomers (M and G), AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 may have specificity for either sugar or a certain polysaccharide arrangement. Therefore, the structural analysis of a periplasmic binding protein having affinity with macromolecules might provide a new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying macromolecule transport through the action of periplasmic binding protein-dependent ABC transporters. To elucidate the structural and functional relationship of periplasmic binding proteins in HMW alginate transport, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of AlgQ2 complexed with an alginate tetrasaccharide and revealed the structure of the alginate binding site as well as the mode of alginate binding accompanying a large conformational change. The methods used for the purification of AlgQ2 have been described previously (9Momma K. Mikami B. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Google Scholar). Briefly, AlgQ2 was purified from Escherichia coli cells transformed with the algQ2 gene by cation exchange column chromatography, dialyzed against 20 mmsodium HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, and then concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml. An alginate tetrasaccharide was prepared through depolymerization of HMW alginate with alginate lyase A1-III (10Yoon H.-J. Hashimoto W. Miyake O. Okamoto M. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 84-90Google Scholar). Cocrystals of AlgQ2 bound with the alginate tetrasaccharide were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The solution for a cocrystallization drop was prepared at 20 °C on a siliconized coverslip by mixing 3 μl of the protein solution (15 mg/ml) with an equal volume of mother liquor comprising 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm alginate tetrasaccharide, and 0.1m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.6. Diffraction data for a crystal of AlgQ2 complexed with the tetrasaccharide were collected up to 1.6 Å with λ = 0.9 Å, using an Oxford PX210 CCD detector system at beam line BL44XU (Beamline for Macromolecule Assembles, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University) at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The data collection was carried out at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. A complete data set was recorded for a single crystal with an exposure time of 6 s for 1° oscillations. The collected images were processed with program D*Trek (11Messerschmidt A. Pflugrath J.W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 306-315Google Scholar) and the CCP4 truncate program (12Collaborative Computation Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The crystal structure of AlgQ2 complexed with the tetrasaccharide (holo-AlgQ2) was solved by the molecular replacement method using program CNS (13Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L.

The coordinates of the ligand-free form of AlgQ2 (9Momma K. Mikami B. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Google Scholar) (apo-AlgQ2; RCSB Protein Data Bank (14Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar), under accession number 1KWH) were used as a search model. Model building was performed with program TURBO-FRODO (AFMB-CNRS, France) on a Silicon Graphics Octane computer. Simulated annealing refinement was carried out with this model using 61.6–2.5-Å resolution data with program CNS (13Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Fo − Fc and 2 Fo − Fc maps were used to locate the correct model. Several rounds of conjugate gradient minimization refinement andB factor refinement, followed by manual model building, were carried out to improve the model by increasing the data to 1.6-Å resolution. Water molecules were incorporated when the difference in density was more than 3.0 ς above the mean and the 2 Fo − Fc map showed a density of more than 1.0 ς. The stereo quality of the model was assessed using program PROCHECK (15Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). Ribbon plots were prepared using programs MOLSCRIPT (16Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar), RASTER3D (17Merrit E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Google Scholar), and GRASP (18Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Google Scholar). These molecular models were superimposed using the fitting program implemented in TURBO- FRODO. A crystal of holo-AlgQ2 (0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.05 mm) was obtained in 2 weeks by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The space group of the crystal was determined to be P21, with unit cell dimensions ofa = 95.63 Å, b = 53.88 Å,c = 114.92 Å, and β = 107.53°, and the solvent content was 45.0% assuming two molecules (molecules A and B)/asymmetric unit. The results of x-ray data collection and the refinement statistics are summarized in TableI. The structure of holo-AlgQ2 was determined by the molecular replacement method, using apo-AlgQ2 (9Momma K. Mikami B. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Google Scholar) as a search model, and refined at 1.6-Å resolution. All of the polypeptide chain sequence could be well traced, and the electron densities of the main and side chains were generally very well defined on the 2 Fo − Fc map. The final R factor was 19.0% for 145,984 data points in the 61.6–1.6-Å resolution range (99.0% completeness). TheR free value calculated for the randomly separated 10% data was 21.1%. Based on the theoretical curves in the plot calculated according to Luzzati (19Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Google Scholar), the absolute positional error was estimated to be close to 0.18 Å between 5.0- and 1.6-Å resolution. Judging from the results of Ramachandran plot analysis (20Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Google Scholar), in which the stereochemical correctness of the backbone structure is indicated by the (φ, ψ) torsion angles, we found that most of the non-glycine residues lie within the most favored regions, the exception being Lys251 (molecule A: φ = 65.0°, ψ = −137.4°; and molecule B: φ = 62.5°, ψ = −139.9°), which is present in a generously allowed region. Lys251 is located next to the terminus of a helix (H12) (9Momma K. Mikami B. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol.

The final model comprises 984 amino acid residues, 2 tetrasaccharides, 2 calcium ions, and 821 water molecules/asymmetric unit. The overall structure of holo-AlgQ2 was similar to that of apo-AlgQ2, except for the disposition of the N and C domains (N domain, residues 1–133 and residues 310–400; C domain, residues 134–309 and residues 401–492). The designation of secondary structure elements of holo-AlgQ2 is the same as that for apo-AlgQ2 (for a description, see Ref. 9Momma K. Mikami B. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Google Scholar). Briefly, holo-AlgQ2 is composed of two globular domains (N and C domains) that form an α/β-structure. The tetrasaccharide is bound in the deep cleft between the domains. Both domains exhibit a similar arrangement of the elements of the secondary structure and can be divided further into two parts (N1 and N2 domains, and C1 and C2 domains) (9Momma K. Mikami B. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Google Scholar). Although almost all binding proteins of ABC transporters consist of two domains, and a deep cleft corresponding to a substrate binding site is formed between the two domains, differences in the transitions or crossovers from one domain to the other are observed in the folding topology of the binding protein structures. Based on these differences, the binding proteins are divided into two types (groups I and II) (21Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar). In group I, the transitions from domain to domain are strand to helix for the first two crossovers and strand to strand for the third crossover e.g. galactose-binding protein (GBP) andl-arabinose-binding protein (ABP), and in group II, the first two are strand to strand and the third is helix to helix,e.g. maltose-binding protein (MBP) and sulfate-binding protein (21Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar). Therefore, AlgQ2, having a sheet topology and crossover connections, is classified into group II. In contrast to apo-AlgQ2, whose N and C domains are wide open, the complex form with the tetrasaccharide was found to be a closed one as reported for other substrate-binding proteins of ABC transporters. For example, in MBP, hinge bending between the two domains involves rotation of ∼35° (22Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Google Scholar). Between the apo and holo forms, the root mean square deviation of equivalent Cα atoms that are within a distance of 2.0 Å of one another is 0.67 Å (295 Cα atoms). These values are 0.42 Å for the N domain (224 Cα atoms) and 0.47 Å for the C domain (264 Cα atoms). To characterize the conformational changes that occur upon domain opening and closing, the domain motion was considered separately as rotation and translation (23Gerstein M. Anderson B.F. Norris G.E. Baker E.N. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 357-372Google Scholar). The N domains of apo and holo forms were superimposed, and the rotation and translation required to superimpose the C domains were determined to be 30° and 0.5 Å, respectively (Fig. 1 b). The binding site for alginate in AlgQ2 is located in the cleft between the two globular domains (N and C domains) (Fig. 1 a). AlgQ2 has an especially deep cleft compared with other periplasmic binding proteins. In the open form of AlgQ2, basic residues, mostly Arg, are on the surface around the cleft in each domain, and aromatic residues are located deep in the cleft (Fig. 2). When AlgQ2 is in the closed form, basic residues face the center of the cleft. The positively charged residues in the cleft might facilitate the attachment of the negatively charged alginate molecule in the cleft and hold the substrate in a proper position for binding. These changes show that basic residues, especially Arg, play a role as sensors for alginate and facilitate the efficient binding of alginate. The bound alginate residues (tetrasaccharide) were identified as ΔM1-M2-G3-M4, from the nonreducing end, where ΔM, M, and G denote unsaturated and saturated β-d-mannuronate and saturated α-l-glucuronate, respectively (Fig.3), and the sugar binding sites, corresponding to the alginate residues, are designated as S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively (Fig. 3 b). Each alginate residue of the bound tetrasaccharide (ΔM1-M2-G3-M4) was in the4C1 (M2, M4) or 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; HMW, high molecular weight; ABP, l-arabinose-binding protein; G, α-l-glucuronate; GBP, galactose-binding protein; GG block, homopolymeric poly-α-l-glucuronate; GM block, heteropolymeric saccharide; M, β-d-mannuronate; ΔM, unsaturated β-d-mannuronate; MBP, maltodextrin/maltose-binding protein; MG block, heteropolymeric saccharide; MM block, homopolymeric poly-β-d-mannuronate; RBP, ribose-binding protein; WAT, water moleculeC4-pyranosid form (G3). The sugar difference density of S1 only fits unsaturated mannuronate. The tetrasaccharide used for cocrystallization with AlgQ2 was prepared through depolymerization of HMW alginate with alginate lyase A1-III (10Yoon H.-J. Hashimoto W. Miyake O. Okamoto M. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 84-90Google Scholar). Depolymerization produces a C4-C5 double bond at the nonreducing terminal mannuronate residues of the products, which are mixtures of MM, MG, and GM blocks (24Hashimoto W. Okamoto M. Hisano T. Momma K. Murata K. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1998; 86: 236-238Google Scholar). However, we found ΔM1-M2-G3-M4 in both molecules A and B, which may indicate that ΔM1-M2-G3-M4 was the predominant species of tetrasaccharide obtained in the present experiment. The bound tetrasaccharide adopts a linear shape (Fig. 3 a). The torsion angles of the glycosidic bonds, defined as O5′-C1′-O4-C4 (ϕ) and C1′-O4-C4-C5 (ψ), between ΔM1 and M2, M2 and G3, and G3 and M4 of each molecule, are shown in TableII. The torsion angles between ΔM1 and M2 in both molecules are in the lowest energy region of the isoenergy map. According to the report by Braccini et al. (25Braccini I. Grasso R.P. Perez S. Carbohydr. Res. 1999; 317: 119-130Google Scholar), the adiabatic maps of glucuronic and mannuronic acid dimers are almost identical, and the energy minima are similar, with identical (ϕ, ψ) values and comparable relative energies. The torsion angles between M2 and G3, and G3 and M4 are also in the lowest energy region of the isoenergy maps of both mannuronic and glucuronic acid dimers. These results suggest that bound tetrasaccharides are in a stabilized conformation.Table IIDihedral angles around the glycosidic linkage of the tetrasaccharideMolecule AMolecule Bφ (°)aThe endocyclic φ and ψ torsion angles of the glycosidic bond for linear alginate tetrasaccharides are defined as O5′-C1′-O4-C4 and C-1′-O-4-C-4-C-5, respectively.ψ (°)aThe endocyclic φ and ψ torsion angles of the glycosidic bond for linear alginate tetrasaccharides are defined as O5′-C1′-O4-C4 and C-1′-O-4-C-4-C-5, respectively.φ (°)aThe endocyclic φ and ψ torsion angles of the glycosidic bond for linear alginate tetrasaccharides are defined as O5′-C1′-O4-C4 and C-1′-O-4-C-4-C-5, respectively.ψ (°)aThe endocyclic φ and ψ torsion angles of the glycosidic bond for linear alginate tetrasaccharides are defined as O5′-C1′-O4-C4 and C-1′-O-4-C-4-C-5, respectively.Δ M1-M2−89.3−136.2−88.3−135.6M2-G3−78.5−128.8−79.1−128.6G3-M4−79.3−97.7−81.9−94.6a The endocyclic φ and ψ torsion angles of the glycosidic bond for linear alginate tetrasaccharides are defined as O5′-C1′-O4-C4 and C-1′-O-4-C-4-C-5, respectively. Open table in a new tab In both molecules A and B, M4 is an α-anomeric, and M4-O1 is wholly axial (Fig. 3 a). No other electron density is present in the binding site. Hydrogen bonds are formed between M4-O1 and two water molecules (molecule A, WAT36 and WAT325; molecule B, WAT559 and WAT697). WAT36 is hydrogen-bonded to Asp74-OD1, -OD2, and Gln55-NE2. This preferential binding of the α-anomer to AlgQ2 is because of the water-bridged hydrogen bonds between axial M4-O1 and the amino acid residues. The bound tetrasaccharide molecule undergoes interactions with the surrounding amino acid residues (Fig. 4). The hydrogen bond interactions between the bound tetrasaccharide and AlgQ2 are listed in Table III. Consistent with the involvement of many charged residues in sugar binding sites, basic and acidic side chains provide many of the nitrogen and oxygen atoms capable of hydrogen bond formation, respectively. Side chains with polar planar groups (Asn, Asp, Glu, Arg, and His) are the ones most often used for hydrogen bonding to carbohydrates (26Quiocho F.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 922-933Google Scholar). The number of hydrogen bonds associated with the tetrasaccharide is 31 (ΔM1, 10; M2, 8; G3, 6; and M4, 7). The number of direct hydrogen bonds between AlgQ2 and the tetrasaccharide is 14 (ΔM1, 8; M2, 3; G3, 2; and M4, 1), and the number of associated water molecules is 17 (ΔM1, 2; M2, 5; G3, 4; and M4, 6). ΔM1 participates in the greatest number of hydrogen bonds, followed by M2, G3, and M4. This suggests that the nonreducing end of a sugar is more heavily involved than the reducing end of the sugar.Table IIIHydrogen bond interactions between the tetrasaccharide and AlgQ2Sugar atomsBond atoms (molecule A/molecule B)DistanceaDistance ≤ 3.2 Å.Element/domainMolecule AMolecule BÅΔ M1 O2Asn375ND23.23.2H18/NΔ M1 O2Tyr395 OH3.13.1H19/NΔ M1 O2WAT71/WAT5132.82.8Δ M1 O3Tyr395OH2.92.8H19/NΔ M1 O3Glu396OE12.52.6H19/NΔ M1 O5Asn375ND23.13.1H18/NΔ M1 O61Asn375ND23.23.0H18/NΔ M1 O61Ser273OG2.52.5H14/CΔ M1 O62WAT73/WAT5092.82.7Δ M1 O62Ser273 N3.03.0H14/CM2 O2Trp270 NE13.03.0SC2/CM2 O2WAT9733.03.0M2 O3Arg186 NH22.92.9L-SC1:H9/CM2 O4WAT71/WAT5132.92.9M2 O61WAT62/WAT5282.72.7M2 O61WAT163/WAT5672.72.6M2 O62Tyr129 OH2.62.5SA1/NM2 O62WAT71/WAT5132.82.7G3 O2Arg313 NH23.13.1L-SC4:SA3/C→NG3 O2WAT276/WAT5243.03.1G3 O2WAT86/WAT5133.13.2G3 O3WAT164/WAT4832.92.8G3 O61WAT380/WAT8142.72.7G3 O62His187 NE23.03.0L-SC1:H9/CG3 O62/WA8162.82.6M4 O1WAT36/WAT5592.72.7M4 O1WAT325/WAT6972.82.9M4 O2Asp21OD12.72.7L-SA5:SA6/NM4 O2/WAT6843.1M4 O3WAT407/WAT6813.12.7M4 O61WAT408/WAT6462.72.6M4 O61WAT127/WAT6712.82.7M4 O61/WAT5132.6M4 O62WAT213/WAT5802.62.7a Distance ≤ 3.2 Å. Open table in a new tab Comparison of the structures showed that two water molecules in the apo-protein are replaced on carbohydrate binding. These two water molecules, WAT584 and WAT617, occupy positions O61 and O62 of ΔM1 in the apo form (9Momma K. Mikami B. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Google Scholar) and form the same hydrogen bond with the protein. Water molecules occupying the positions of hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates to preserve the hydrogen bonding interactions in the sugar binding region have also been observed in the structure of glucoside-related enzymes. Furthermore, a typical characteristic of uronic acids is that C6 is oxidized to carboxyl acid. Thus, these residues (O61 and O62) may confer the specificity to AlgQ2. All residues binding with ΔM1 (Ser273, Asn375, Tyr395, and Glu396) are located in helices, all residues binding with M2 (Tyr129, Arg186, and Trp270) in β-sheets, and all residues binding with G3 and M4 (His187, Arg313, and Asp21) in loops. In MBP, most residues binding with maltose are located in loops of the N domain, and its localization may participate in the hinge bending motion (27Quiocho F.A. Spurlino J.C. Rodseth L.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 997-1015Google Scholar). But in AlgQ2, most of these residues are in the helices of both domains and β-sheets, with a few in loops. The C-C contacts between AlgQ2 and the tetrasaccharide are listed in Table IV. The number of C-C contacts is 39 (ΔM1, 23; M2, 7; G3, 6; and M4, 3). In holo-AlgQ2, almost all the nonpolar-nonpolar contacts between AlgQ2 and the tetrasaccharide are mainly through aromatic side chains (Trp270, Trp399, and Tyr129). Indeed, the close proximity of aromatic side chains to bind a tetrasaccharide is a recurring feature of proteins/enzymes that bind tetrasaccharides. The structure of AlgQ2 is notable among those of proteins/enzymes in that AlgQ2 binds saccharides because of the great abundance of aromatic residues, 16 of which are located in or near the binding site groove. In contrast to most hydrogen-bonding residues located in the N domain, more stacking aromatic residues are found in the C domain. In particular, the aromatic Trp270 residue in the C domain exhibits the most favorable stacking interactions with ΔM1. Such stacking interactions between a sugar and aromatic side chains are quite common in protein-carbohydrate complexes (28Duan X. Hall J.A. Nikaido H. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1115-1126Google Scholar). Of special significance regarding AlgQ2 is the finding that some of the van der Waals contacts are confined to a cluster of nonpolar atoms within the sugar. In the alginate molecule, the disposition of both the axial OH2 and equatorial OH3 of ΔM1 on the hydrophilic side of the ring creates a cluster of nonpolar atoms (C3, C4, and C5) on the opposite side. This nonpolar cluster is stacked with Trp270 (Fig. 4). Because MM blocks may form a cluster of nonpolar atoms within a sugar most easily, ΔMM and MM blocks seem to be bound at the S1 and S2 subsites. In other periplasmic binding proteins, the aromatic residues are partially stacked or face to face with the pyranose ring. As in MBP, aromatic residues in the C domain of AlgQ2 play an important role in the interaction with HMW alginate.Table IVC-C contacts between the tetrasaccharide and AlgQ2Sugar atomsProtein atomsDistanceaDistance ≤ 4.4 Å.Element/domainMolecule AMolecule BÅΔ M1 C1Trp270CD24.04.0SC2/CΔ M1 C1Trp270 CE24.14.1SC2/CΔ M1 C1Trp270 CE34.04.0SC2/CΔ M1 C1Trp270 CH24.14.1SC2/CΔ M1 C1Trp270 CZ24.24.2SC2/CΔ M1 C1Trp270 CZ34.04.0SC2/CΔ M1 C3Trp270 CE34.34.3SC2/CΔ M1 C3Trp270 CZ34.34.3SC2/CΔ M1 C3Glu396 CD4.04.0H19/NΔ M1 C4Trp270 CE34.03.9SC2/CΔ M1 C4Glu396 CD3.83.8H19/NΔ M1 C4Trp399 CH24.44.4L-H19:H20/N→CΔ M1 C4Trp270 CZ34.44.4SC2/CΔ M1 C5Trp270 CB3.83.9SC2/CΔ M1 C5Trp270 CD23.63.6SC2/CΔ M1 C5Trp270 CE33.53.5SC2/CΔ M1 C5Trp270 CG3.83.8SC2/CΔ M1 C5Trp270 CZ34.24.2SC2/CΔ M1 C6Trp270 CB3.33.3SC2/CΔ M1 C6Trp270CD24.04.0SC2/CΔ M1 C6Trp270 CE34.24.1SC2/CΔ M1 C6Trp270 CG3.73.7SC2/CΔ M1 C6Ser273 CB3.73.7H14/CΔ M1 C6Trp399 CH24.24.3L-H19:H20/N→CM2 C2His187CE13.83.8L-SC1:H9/CM2 C3Trp270CE24.34.3SC2/CM2 C4Trp270CE24.04.0SC2/CM2 C4Trp270CZ23.93.9SC2/CM2 C6Tyr129CE24.04.0SA1/CM2 C6Tyr129CZ4.24.2SA1/CM2 C6Arg313CD4.24.1L-SC4:SA3/C→NG3 C2Arg313 CZ4.34.3L-SC4:SA3/C→NG3 C3Arg313CZ3.93.9L-SC4:SA3/C→NG3 C4Arg20CG4.34.3L-SA5:SA6/NG3 C5Arg20CG4.14.1L-SA5:SA6/NG3 C6Arg20CD4.44.4L-SA5:SA6/NG3 C6Arg20CG4.24.2L-SA5:SA6/NM4 C2Asp21 CG3.73.7L-SA5:SA6/NM4 C3Arg20 CA4.24.2L-SA5:SA6/NM4 C5Asn75 CG4.44.4L-SA4:H3/Na Distance ≤ 4.4 Å. Open table in a new tab To analyze the specificity at the S1 subsite, saturated or unsaturated glucuronate or saturated mannuronate was placed at the ΔM1 position by computational simulation. If saturated mannuronate is positioned at the ΔM1 position, O4 interacts with OE1 and OE2 of Glu396at a distance of about 2.8–2.9 Å. When glucuronate is present instead of ΔM1, glucuronate cannot form a C-C contact with Trp270or other aromatic residues because both the axial OH2 and equatorial OH3 of ΔM1 are displaced to the hydrophilic side. This suggests that the S1 subsite may bind saturated and unsaturated mannuronate acids selectively. The rotations around main chain dihedrals in the three interdomain connections are related to the opening and closing of AlgQ2. Movements in the three hinge segments are greatest at residues 133–136 (L-SA1:SC3), 294–314 (L-SC4:SA3), and 399–401 (L-H19:H20) (L, loop; SA, β-sheet in N1 domain; SC, β-sheet in C1 domain; H, α-helix; these notations have been defined previously (9Momma K. Mikami B. Mishima Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Google Scholar)). The hinge region of AlgQ2 is shown in Fig.5. The hydrogen bond between Glu396 (which is an element of H19 in the N domain) and Arg309 (which is an element of L-SC4:SA3) is maintained in both the opened and closed forms and thus stabilizes the interaction between H19 and L-SC4:SA3 (Fig. 5 and TableV). In the closed form, H19 and L-SC4:SA3 are close to the tetrasaccharide in the cleft, and the hydrogen bond formed between Glu396-OE2 and ΔM1-O3. As a consequence of this change, the torsion angles of Arg309 greatly increased (Δφ = 45°, Δψ = 33°), and hinge bending motion occurred in L-SC4:SA3. As a result of this movement, the indirect water-mediated hydrogen bond between Gly133 (L-SA1:SC3) and Gln310 (L-SC4:SA3) via a water molecule (WAT715) is lost, and both the φ and ψ angles of Gly133 and Gln310 change greatly (Gly133, Δφ = −49° and Δψ = −27°; Gln310, Δφ = 37° and Δψ = 41°). In the closed form, Gln310forms hydrogen bonds with residues of the C domain (Fig. 5 and TableV). In particular, Asp206 and Asn207 (L-H9:SD1) are in the loop connecting the C1 and C2 domains. These interactions may stabilize AlgQ2 in the closed form.Table VHydrogen bonds between the N and C domains of apo- and holo-AlgQ2Apo-AlgQ2Protein atoms/NaN, N domain; C, C domain.ElementsProtein atoms/CaN, N domain; C, C domain.ElementsDistancebDistance ≤ 3.2 Å.ÅLys77NZH3Asn425OD1L-H20:H212.9Arg115OH6Gln489 NE2H233.0Ala116OH6Asn425 ND2L-H20:H213.1Thr118OL-H6:SA1Asn425 ND2L-H20:H212.8Glu396 OE1H19Arg309 NH1L-SC4:SA33.0Glu396 OE2H19Arg309NH2L-SC4:SA32.6Holo-AlgQ2Protein atoms/NElementsProtein atoms/CElementsDistanceÅAsp78OD1H3Tyr434OHH212.7Asp78OD2H3Arg431 NH2H212.8Gln310OE1L-SC4:SA3Asp206 OD1L-H9:SD13.0Gln310 OE1L-SC4:SA3Asn207ND2L-H9:SD13.0Gln310NE2L-SC4:SA3Asn207 OD1L-H9:SD13.0Lys311 NZL-SC4:SA3Glu422OE1L-H20:H212.7Glu396 OE1H19Arg309NH1L-SC4:SA32.9Glu396 OE2H19Arg309NH2L-SC4:SA33.0a N, N domain; C, C domain.b Distance ≤ 3.2 Å. Open table in a new tab Therefore, the hinge motion of AlgQ2 can be predicted to be as follows. When Glu396 forms a hydrogen bond with ΔM1, a conformational change occurs in L-SC4:SA3, which interacts with Glu396 through hydrogen bonds. As a result of this conformational change, the association via a water molecule (WAT715) between L-SA1:SC3 and L-SC4:SA3 is lost, and both loops undergo a dynamic hinge bending motion. A water molecule (WAT715) and the interaction between Glu396 and L-H9:SD1 via L-SC4:SA3 are important for the hinge motion of AlgQ2. In periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport systems, a soluble binding protein is the first component to interact with the substrate to be transported, acting as a high affinity receptor for the substrate in the periplasm. A little understanding of how binding proteins function in transport has been obtained through studies on the MBP system (22Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Google Scholar, 26Quiocho F.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 922-933Google Scholar, 27Quiocho F.A. Spurlino J.C. Rodseth L.E.

In this system, MBP undergoes a ligand-induced conformational change that has been observed in both the presence and absence of a ligand, and MBP becomes tightly bound to the membrane transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2052444839,"In the rat, a growth hormone-binding protein (GHBP) exists that is derived from the growth hormone (GH) receptor gene by an alternative mRNA splicing mechanism such that the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the GH receptor are replaced by a hydrophilic carboxyl terminus. In isolation, the GHBP is inactive, although it does compete with the receptor for ligand binding in the extracellular space and therefore inhibits the cellular response to GH. The GHBP is also located intracellularly and is translocated to the nucleus upon ligand stimulation. We show here that endogenously produced GHBP, in contrast to exogenous GHBP, was able to enhance the STAT5-mediated transcriptional response to GH. Interestingly, when the GHBP was targeted constitutively to the nucleus by the addition of the nuclear localization sequence of the SV40 large T antigen, greater enhancement of STAT5-mediated transcription was obtained. The transcriptional enhancement did not require GH per se and was not specific to the GH receptor, since similar enhancement of STAT5-mediated transcription by nuclear localized GHBP was obtained with specific ligand stimulation of both prolactin and erythropoietin receptors. Thus, the GHBP exerts divergent effects on STAT5-mediated transcription depending on its cellular location. The use of a soluble cytokine receptor as a location-dependent transcriptional enhancer and the ligand-independent involvement of the extracellular domain of a polypeptide ligand receptor in intracellular signal transduction provide additional novel mechanisms of transcriptional control.

The GH receptor was the first cloned member of the now extensive cytokine receptor superfamily, which includes the receptors for prolactin (PRL), erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, ciliary neutrophic factor, thrombopoietin, leptin, cardiotrophin I, and the β-chain of interleukin (IL)-2 through IL-7, IL-9, and IL-11 to IL-13 (3Cosman D. Lyman S.D. Idzerda R.L. Beckmann M.P. Park L.S. Goodwin R.G. March C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 265-270Google Scholar). Most receptors of the cytokine receptor superfamily exist in a soluble and transmembrane form (4Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Google Scholar, 5Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. J.

The function of the transmembrane forms is well documented and includes signal transduction predominantly but not exclusively through the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in gene transcription (8Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar, 9Zhu T. Goh E.L. Graichen R. Ling L. Lobie P.E. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Google Scholar). The role of the soluble cytokine receptors, with the notable exception of the soluble forms of the IL-6 and ciliary neurotropitir factor (CNTF) receptors (10Mullberg J. Vollmer P. Althoff K. Marz P. Rose-John S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 211-219Google Scholar, 11Shapiro L. Panayotatos N. Meydani S.N. Wu D. Dinarello C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 51-56Google Scholar), appears confined to ligand sequestration in the extracellular space with a consequent impairment of the cellular response to exogenous ligand (4Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Google Scholar). A soluble rat growth hormone-binding protein (GHBP) exists that is derived from the GH receptor gene by an alternative mRNA splicing mechanism such that the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the GH receptor are replaced by a hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal sequence (12Baumbach W.R. Horner D.L. Logan J.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1199-1205Google Scholar). An analogous GHBP exists in other species (13Baumann G. Stolar M.W. Amburn K. Barsano C.P. DeVries B.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 62: 134-141Google Scholar), such as humans, but is derived by proteolytic cleavage of the full-length membrane-bound receptor (14Smith W.C. Kuniyoshi J. Talamantes F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 984-990Google Scholar), presumably by the action of specific metalloproteases (15Alele J. Jiang J. Goldsmith J.F. Yang X. Maheshwari H.G. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1927-1935Google Scholar). The GHBP has been demonstrated to compete with the receptor for ligand binding in the extracellular space and has been shown to inhibit the cellular response to GH in vitro (16Lim L. Spencer S.A. McKay P. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1287-1291Google Scholar,17Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Google Scholar). In vivo, the GHBP has been demonstrated to increase the biological activity of GH by prolongation of the half-life of plasma GH (18Baumann G. Amburn K. Shaw M.A. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 976-984Google Scholar). The GHBP is also located intracellularly (19Frick G.P. Tai L.R. Goodman H.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 307-314Google Scholar, 20Lobie P.E. Garcia-Aragon J. Wang B.S. Baumbach W.R. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3057-3065Google Scholar, 21Lobie P.E. Wood T.J. Chen C.M. Waters M.J. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31735-31746Google Scholar) and has also been prominently localized to the nucleus (20Lobie P.E. Garcia-Aragon J. Wang B.S. Baumbach W.R. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3057-3065Google Scholar). Other components of the GH signal transduction pathway are also located in the nucleus or translocate to the nucleus upon GH stimulation (21Lobie P.E. Wood T.J. Chen C.M. Waters M.J. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31735-31746Google Scholar, 22Lobie P.E. Barnard R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22645-22652Google Scholar, 23Lobie P.E. Mertani H. Morel G. Morales-Bustos O.

Thus, the GH receptor is subject to ligand-dependent nuclear translocation (21Lobie P.E. Wood T.J. Chen C.M. Waters M.J. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31735-31746Google Scholar), and constitutively nuclear JAK2 is phosphorylated by exogenous GH stimulation (24Lobie P.E. Ronsin B. Silvennoinen O. Haldosen L.A. Norstedt G. Morel G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4037-4045Google Scholar). Internalization of the GH receptor has been reported not to be necessary to achieve transcriptional activation by GH (26Allevato G. Billestrup N. Goujon L. Galsgaard E.D. Norstedt G. Postel-Vinay M.C. Kelly P.A. Nielsen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17210-17214Google Scholar), and therefore the function of the nuclear localization of components of the GH signal transduction pathway is unknown. We demonstrate here that nuclear localized GHBP functions as a potent enhancer of STAT5-mediated transcription, not only for GH but also for other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Thus, the GHBP exerts opposing effects on STAT5-mediated transcription depending on its extra-/intracellular location. The use of a soluble cytokine receptor as a location-dependent transcriptional enhancer and the ligand-independent involvement of the extracellular domain of a polypeptide ligand receptor in intracellular signal transduction provides additional novel mechanisms of transcriptional control. Human growth hormone (hGH) was a generous gift of Novo Nordisk (Singapore). oPRL and rGH were obtained from NIDDK (National Institutes of Health), and mEPO was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. All cell culture medium and supplements (for culture medium) were obtained from Sigma. The luciferase assay system was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The ECL kit was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. The GH, PRL, and EPO receptor cDNAs used here were as described previously (27Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Goullieux F. Mui A.L. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 130: 69-81Google Scholar). Transfection reagent DOTAP, poly(dI/dC) and the DNA 3′-end labeling kit were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Monoclonal antibody against hemagglutinin was obtained from Clontech, monoclonal antiserum against phospho-STAT5A/B were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), monoclonal antisera against green fluorescent protein (GFP) were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), and polyclonal antibody against STAT5B were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). mAb 4.3 and recombinant rat GHBP were generous gifts of Dr. W. R. Baumbach (Monsanto Corp.). The production and characterization of the recombinant rat GHBP has been previously described by us (20Lobie P.E. Garcia-Aragon J. Wang B.S. Baumbach W.R. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3057-3065Google Scholar). BRL cells were stably transfected with the complete rat GH receptor cDNA inserted into an expression vector containing the human cytomegalovirus enhancer and promoter (pcDNA1). The characterization and use of these cells has previously been described in detail (28Silva C.M. Day R.N. Weber M.J. Thorner M.O. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2307-2312Google Scholar). These cells will be referred to as BRL-GHR1–638 cells. BRL cells were grown in DMEM (supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. hGH, rGH, oPRL, and recombinant rat GHBP were prepared as a stock solution of 1 mg/ml in distilled water. For treatment of cells, hGH, rGH, oPRL, mEPO, and recombinant rat GHBP were diluted in fresh DMEM serum-free medium and added to the cells after transient transfection. Cells were treated with 100 nm hGH unless otherwise specified. oPRL was used at 100 nm. mEPO was used at 10 units/ml. The cDNA expression plasmid encoding the wild type GHBP under the control of the metallothionein Ia promotor was as previously described (17Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Google Scholar). In the XS-GHBP construct, the rat GHBP was PCR-amplified without its NH-terminal signal sequence, and an ATG was introduced in the primer just upstream of where the mature GHBP protein is coded. The nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-GHBP was constructed in a similar way, but a nuclear localization signal from the SV40 large T antigen (PKKKRKV) (29Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar) was added upstream of where the mature GHBP is coded. For GHBP-GFP, wild type GHBP was subcloned into a N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein vector from Clontech (pEGFP-N3) under the control of a cytomegalovirus IE promoter. For the construction of epitope-tagged GHBP mutants, wild type GHBP and NLS-GHBP with or without a stop codon at the position of amino acid 115 were subcloned into a pCI-neo vector with a double hemagglutinin tag at the N terminus. The integrity of the reading frame for the GHBP modifications was confirmed by sequence analysis. The construction of GH receptor cDNA expression plasmids containing a deletion, a deletion of box 1 (Δ297–311), or the individual substitution of proline residues 300, 301, 303, and 305 in box 1 for alanine has been described previously (30VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L. Campbell G.S. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21709-21717Google Scholar). BRL and BRL-GHR1–638 cells were cultured to confluence in six-well plates. Transient transfection was performed in serum-free DMEM with DOTAP according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of reporter plasmid (SPI-GLE1-CAT) and 1 μg of pSV2-LUC were transfected per well. The control or empty vectors served to normalize the amount of DNA transfected. For receptor cDNA transfection into BRL cells, 1 μg of each receptor cDNA was used. Cells were incubated with DOTAP/DNA for 12 h before the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM containing either the respective hormones or GHBP at the indicated concentrations. After a further 24 h, cells were washed in PBS and scraped into lysis buffer. The protein content of the samples was normalized, and CAT and luciferase assays were performed as previously described (31Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Pircher T.J. Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Gustafsson J.A. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9448-9453Google Scholar). Results were normalized to the level of luciferase to control for transfection efficiency and calculated as the -fold stimulation of unstimulated (non-hormone-treated) cells. BRL cells were grown on glass coverslips in six-well plates and transiently transfected as described above. Fixation was performed with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min and processed for immunofluorescence as described (32Lobie P.E. Wood T.J. Sliva D. Billestrup N. Waters M.J. Enberg B. Norstedt G. Acta Paediatr. Suppl. 1994; 406: 39-46Google Scholar). The location of the expressed GHBP was determined using the mAb 4.3 directed against the hydrophilic carboxyl terminus of the GHBP (20Lobie P.E. Garcia-Aragon J. Wang B.S. Baumbach W.R. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3057-3065Google Scholar). Noncross-reactive mAbs 50.8 and 7 at the same concentration were used as control (20Lobie P.E. Garcia-Aragon J. Wang B.S. Baumbach W.R. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3057-3065Google Scholar). Labeled cells were visualized with a Carl Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal laser system. For the GFP-GHBP translocation, BRL-GHR1–638 cells were cultured to confluence in six-well plates on 50-μm-thick sapphire glass coverslips. Transient transfection was performed in serum-free DMEM with DOTAP according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were kept for 12 h in serum-free medium and then stimulated with 50 nm hGH or transferred into DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum as indicated. The cells were fixed by using an ethane-freezing/methanol fixation (33Neuhaus E.M. Horstmann H. Almers W. Maniak M. Soldati T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 326-342Google Scholar). To enhance the GFP signal, the fixed cells were exposed to an anti GFP-antibody. Medium from BRL cells transiently transfected with the different GHBP constructs was collected and concentrated. Fractions were normalized for protein content and loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel as described (32Lobie P.E. Wood T.J. Sliva D. Billestrup N. Waters M.J. Enberg B. Norstedt G. Acta Paediatr. Suppl. 1994; 406: 39-46Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry apparatus in Laemmli electrophoresis buffer containing 15% methanol. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk powder in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). mAb 4.3 at 0.25 μg/ml in TTBS (TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) with 1% skim milk powder was used for GHBP detection. Membranes were further processed and developed using the ECL system as previously described (32Lobie P.E. Wood T.J. Sliva D. Billestrup N. Waters M.J. Enberg B. Norstedt G. Acta Paediatr. Suppl. 1994; 406: 39-46Google Scholar). The gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed according to standard protocols. The binding reactions were performed by preincubating 10 μg of nuclear extracts or cytosolic extracts of both hGH-treated and -untreated control vector and NLS-GHBP-transfected cells with 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) acid in 15 ml of buffer containing 20% Ficoll, 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min on ice. For supershift analysis, the extracts were incubated with the antibodies against STAT5B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control antibodies for another 10 min on ice.32P-3′-end-labeled double-stranded SPI-GLE1 probe was added (5′-TGTTCTGAGAAATA-3′), and the mixture was incubated for 5 min on ice followed by another 10 min at room temperature. The samples were electrophoresed on 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE (22.5 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 250 V at 4 °C for 2 h. The gel was dried, and the radioactive pattern was then visualized by autoradiography. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Figures presented for Western blot analyses are representative of multiple experiments. All numerical data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and the data were analyzed using Instat 3.0 from GraphPad Software Inc. We have used a BRL (Buffalo rat liver) cell co-transfection assay (28Silva C.M. Day R.N. Weber M.J. Thorner M.O. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2307-2312Google Scholar) to study the role of the GHBP in the signal transduction pathway of GH. The characterization and use of BRL cells stably transfected with GH receptor cDNA has previously been described in detail (28Silva C.M. Day R.N. Weber M.J. Thorner M.O. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2307-2312Google Scholar), and these cells will be referred to as BRL-GHR1–638 cells. We first used the BRL-GHR1–638 cells to demonstrate the effect of exogenously added recombinant rat GHBP on GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription utilizing a reporter plasmid containing the STAT5 binding element of the serine protease inhibitor 2.1 gene promoter (SPI-GLE1-CAT) (31Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Pircher T.J. Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Gustafsson J.A. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9448-9453Google Scholar). Exogenously added recombinant rat GHBP decreased in a dose-dependent manner the GH stimulation of STAT5-mediated transcription (Fig. 1). With the GH concentration fixed at 1 nm, a dose-dependent inhibition of GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription was observed over the range of 1–100 nm GHBP with an ED50 of 10 nm. The inhibition of GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription is in accord with previous demonstrations that exogenous GHBP inhibits GH-stimulated function (16Lim L. Spencer S.A. McKay P. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1287-1291Google Scholar). The GHBP has also previously been localized intracellularly both attached to intracellular membranes (19Frick G.P. Tai L.R. Goodman H.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 307-314Google Scholar, 20Lobie P.E. Garcia-Aragon J. Wang B.S. Baumbach W.R. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3057-3065Google Scholar) and soluble in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (20Lobie P.E. Garcia-Aragon J. Wang B.S. Baumbach W.R. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3057-3065Google Scholar). To determine the effect of endogenously produced GHBP on the GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcriptional response, we transiently transfected BRL cells with both GH receptor cDNA and WT-GHBP cDNA and examined the STAT5-mediated transcriptional response to GH. The transfected WT-GHBP cDNA resulted in GHBP protein expression in a predominantly perinuclear location and also secretion of the GHBP to the extracellular space (see Fig. 2). In contrast to exogenously added GHBP, 1 μg of transiently transfected WT-GHBP cDNA resulted in a significant increase in the STAT5-mediated transcriptional response to GH (Fig.3 A). This effect was observed at concentrations up to 100 nm GH, and the subsequent decrease in GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription at GH concentrations higher than 100 nm is consistent with antagonism of the GH effect at high ligand concentrations (34Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Google Scholar). Transfection of increasing amounts of WT-GHBP cDNA resulted in less enhancement of the GH-stimulated STAT5 transcriptional response presumably due to increased secretion of GHBP to the medium with the consequent inhibition of GH function. Transient transfection of WT-GHBP cDNA exerted no significant effect on STAT5-mediated transcription in the absence of concomitant transfection of GH receptor cDNA (Fig. 3 B). Transient transfection of WT-GHBP cDNA into BRL-GHR1–638 cells produced similar results as transient transfection of both WT-GHBP and GH receptor cDNA (data not shown). These results indicated that extracellular and intracellular GHBP exerted opposing effects on GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription.Figure 3A, effect of transient transfection of WT-GHBP cDNA on the STAT5-mediated transcriptional response to GH in BRL cells transiently transfected with GHR cDNA. BRL cells were cultured to confluence and transiently transfected with GHR cDNA, SPI-GLE1-CAT, and the indicated amounts of GHBP cDNA. Cells were treated for 24 h with 50 nm GH. C, control. Raw data for the cells transfected with 1 μg of either vector or WT-GHBP cDNA are as follows: nonstimulated, 585 ± 42 and 554 ± 57, respectively; stimulated, 1778 ± 351 and 2836 ± 193, respectively. B, effect of increasing concentrations of GH on the STAT5-mediated transcriptional response to GH in the presence of transiently transfected vector and WT-GHBP cDNA. BRL cells were cultured to confluence and transiently transfected with GHR cDNA, SPI-GLE1-CAT, and 1 μg of WT-GHBP cDNA. Cells were treated for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of GH. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations of the -fold stimulation above non-hormone-stimulated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether nonsecreted cytoplasmically localized GHBP would enhance GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription, we removed the secretion sequence from the GHBP cDNA (XS-GHBP) (12Baumbach W.R. Horner D.L. Logan J.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1199-1205Google Scholar). In the XS-GHBP construct, the rat GHBP was PCR-amplified without its signaling peptide, and an ATG was introduced in the primer just upstream of where the mature GHBP protein is coded. XS-GHBP is expressed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell as observed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy and is not secreted to the extracellular space (Fig. 2). Transient transfection of XS-GHBP cDNA also increased the STAT5-mediated transcriptional response to GH. Transfection of increasing amounts of XS-GHBP cDNA further enhanced GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription. As observed with WT-GHBP, transient transfection of XS-GHBP cDNA exerted no significant effect on STAT5-mediated transcription in the absence of concomitant transfection of GH receptor cDNA (Fig.4). Thus, the intracellular GHBP enhances GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription independent of its secretion to the extracellular space. It has been previously reported that the GHBP is located intracellularly in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in both an insoluble form attached to membranes and a soluble form in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. To determine whether the GHBP was subject to ligand-dependent nuclear translocation, we subcloned the WT-GHBP into a N-terminal enhanced fluorescent protein vector. The WT-GHBP was therefore expressed as a fusion protein to the N terminus of the enhanced GFP. The integrity of the reading frame was confirmed by sequence analysis, and protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis and confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Fig.5 A). The WT-GHBP-GFP was expressed as a protein with a molecular mass of 67 kDa in contrast to the native GFP, which was expressed as a protein of 27 kDa. Examination of the cellular distribution of the WT-GHBP-GFP demonstrated distinct perinuclear localization in contrast to the native GFP, which exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. We transfected GHBP-GFP in BRL-GHR1–638 cells to demonstrate the effect of exogenous GH stimulation on the cellular distribution of GHBP. Stimulation of cells with 50 nm hGH first resulted in a contraction of the perinuclear distribution of the WT-GHBP-GFP and subsequent nuclear translocation, which intensified to 30 min after stimulation with GH. In contrast, the native GFP was not translocated to the nucleus upon cellular stimulation with GH. Cellular stimulation with fetal bovine serum also resulted in nuclear translocation of the WT-GHBP-GFP (Fig.5) but not the native GFP. Thus, the GHBP is subject to ligand-dependent nuclear translocation indicative of an intracellular/intranuclear function. We therefore focused our attention on the nuclear GHBP. To examine the function of the nuclear localized GHBP, we introduced the NLS of the SV40 large T antigen at the N terminus of the GHBP (NLS-GHBP). The NLS-GHBP was constructed by replacement of the secretion sequence of the WT-GHBP with the nuclear localization signal from the SV40 large T antigen (PKKKRKV) (29Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar). The integrity of the reading frame for the GHBP modification was confirmed by sequence analysis, and translation and location of the protein product was determined by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Fig. 2). The NLS-GHBP was predominantly localized to the nucleus and was not secreted from the cell and therefore could be utilized to study the functional effect of nuclear localized GHBP on GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription. Transient transfection of BRL cells with both GH receptor cDNA and NLS-GHBP cDNA resulted in a dramatic enhancement of GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription (Fig.6 A). Transient transfection of BRL-GHR1–638 cells with NLS-GHBP cDNA also resulted in dramatic enhancement of GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription (data not shown). The transcriptional enhancing effect of NLS-GHBP on GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription was increased with the transfection of increasing amounts of NLS-GHBP cDNA (Fig.6 A). No STAT5-mediated transcriptional response to GH was obtained upon transfection of NLS-GHBP cDNA without concomitant transfection of GH receptor cDNA (Fig. 6 A). The ability of NLS-GHBP to enhance GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription was observed over a wide concentration range of both the homologous rat GH (Fig. 6 B) and human GH (Fig. 6 C). The ability of the nuclear localized GHBP to enhance GH-stimulated transcription was not observed when a STAT1/3-responsive reporter plasmid (c-fos-SIE-CAT) (35Liu N. Mertani H.C. Norstedt G. Tornell J. Lobie P.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 196-206Google Scholar) was utilized instead of the STAT5 reporter (SPI-GLE1-CAT) (data not shown). Thus, the transcriptional enhancing effect of the nuclear localized GHBP has some specificity for GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription. Similarly transient transfection of NLS-GHBP cDNA does not alter the activity of reporter plasmids that constitutively express either CAT (pCMV-CAT) or luciferase (pSV2-LUC). As described above, no STAT5-mediated transcriptional response to GH was obtained upon transfection of NLS-GHBP cDNA without concomitant transfection of GH receptor cDNA. We therefore next examined the regions in the intracellular domain of the GH receptor required for NLS-GHBP to enhance GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription. NLS-GHBP cDNA was co-transfected into BRL cells with the cDNA encoding various receptor mutations or deletions as indicated in Fig.7. No GH stimulation of STAT5-medi"
https://openalex.org/W2057501036,"Aspartate aminotransferase has been known to undergo a significant conformational change, in which the small domain approaches the large domain, and the residues at the entrance of the active site pack together, on binding of substrates. Accompanying this conformational change is a two-unit increase in the p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> of the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-Lys<sup>258</sup> aldimine, which has been proposed to enhance catalysis. To elucidate how the conformational change is coupled to the shift in the aldimine p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub>and how these changes are involved in catalysis, we analyzed structurally and kinetically an enzyme in which Val<sup>39</sup>located at both the domain interface and the entrance of the active site was replaced with a bulkier residue, Phe. The V39F mutant enzyme showed a more open conformation, and the aldimine p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> was lowered by 0.7 unit compared with the wild-type enzyme. When Asn<sup>194</sup> had been replaced by Ala in advance, the V39F mutation did not decrease the aldimine p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub>, showing that the domain rotation controls the aldimine p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> via the Arg<sup>386</sup>-Asn<sup>194</sup>-pyridoxal 5′-phosphate linkage system. The maleate-bound V39F enzyme showed the aldimine p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> 0.9 unit lower than that of the maleate-bound wild-type enzyme. However, the positions of maleate, Asn<sup>194</sup>, and Arg<sup>386</sup> were superimposable between the mutant and the wild-type enzymes; therefore, the domain rotation was not the cause of the lowered aldimine p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub>value. The maleate-bound V39F enzyme showed an altered side-chain packing pattern in the 37–39 region, and the lack of repulsion between Gly<sup>38</sup> carbonyl O and Tyr<sup>225</sup>O<i>η</i> seemed to be the cause of the reduced p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> value. Kinetic analysis suggested that the repulsion increases the free energy level of the Michaelis complex and promotes the catalytic reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2036050532,"The RAG1 and RAG2 proteins together constitute the nuclease that initiates the assembly of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes in a reaction known as V(D)J recombination. RAG1 plays a central role in recognition of the recombination signal sequence (RSS) by the RAG1/2 complex. To investigate the parameters governing the RAG1-RSS interaction, the murine core RAG1 protein (amino acids 377–1008) fused to a short Strep tag has been purified to homogeneity from bacteria. The Strep-RAG1 (StrRAG1) protein exists as a dimer at a wide range of protein concentrations (25–500 nm) in the absence of DNA and binds with reasonably high affinity and specificity (apparent K D = 41 nm) to the RSS. Both electrophoretic mobility shift assays and polarization anisotropy experiments indicate that only a single StrRAG1-DNA species exists in solution. Anisotropy decay measured by frequency domain spectroscopy suggests that the complex contains a dimer of StrRAG1 bound to a single DNA molecule. Using measurements of protein intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism, we demonstrate that StrRAG1 undergoes a major conformational change upon binding the RSS. Steady-state fluorescence and acrylamide quenching studies reveal that this conformational change is associated with a repositioning of intrinsic protein fluorophores from a hydrophobic to a solvent-exposed environment. RSS-induced conformational changes of StrRAG1 may influence the interaction of RAG1 with RAG2 and synaptic complex formation.

The genes encoding the variable domains of immunoglobulins or T cell receptors are generated during lymphocyte differentiation by a somatic recombination reaction known as V(D)J recombination (1Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Google Scholar). The reaction is initiated by DNA double strand breaks created at the junction between two coding segments (termed V, D, or J) and their flanking recombination signal sequences (RSSs). 1The abbreviations used are: RSS, recombination signal sequence; aa, amino acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MBP, maltose-binding protein; SC, signal complex; BB, binding buffer; StrRAG1, Strep-RAG1; HMG, high mobility group; FD, frequency domain 1The abbreviations used are: RSS, recombination signal sequence; aa, amino acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MBP, maltose-binding protein; SC, signal complex; BB, binding buffer; StrRAG1, Strep-RAG1; HMG, high mobility group; FD, frequency domain Cleavage is followed by a complex repair process that results in imprecise joining of the two coding segments and typically precise joining of the two RSSs. The RSSs consist of two conserved sequence elements, the heptamer (consensus 5′-CACAGTG-3′) and the nonamer (consensus 5′-ACAAAAACC-3′), separated by a poorly conserved spacer sequence of either 12 or 23 base pairs. Efficient recombination occurs only between a 12-RSS and a 23-RSS, a phenomenon known as the 12/23 rule (for review, see Ref. 2Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Google Scholar). Recognition of 12/23-RSSs and concerted cleavage at the RSS-coding sequence border is performed by a complex of the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins (for reviews, see Ref. 3Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Google Scholar and 4Sadofsky M.J.

Binding and cleavage of DNA by the RAG1·RAG2 complex is facilitated by the ubiquitously expressed architectural DNA-binding proteins HMG1 and -2 (7Sawchuk D.J. Weis-Garcia F. Malik S. Besmer E. Bustin M. Nussenzweig M.C. Cortes P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2025-2032Google Scholar, 8van Gent D.C. Hiom K. Paull T.T. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2665-2670Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis has established the minimal “core” domains of murine RAG1 (residues 384–1008 of the 1040 aa RAG1 protein; Fig.1 A) and RAG2 (residues 1–383 of the 527 aa RAG2 protein) required for recombination activity in transfected nonlymphoid cell lines (9Cuomo C.A. Oettinger M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1810-1814Google Scholar, 10Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1805-1809Google Scholar, 11Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E.

A. 1993; 90: 6100-6104Google Scholar). Most biochemical studies of V(D)J recombination have been performed with the core RAG proteins because of their enhanced solubility compared with the full-length proteins. Surface plasmon resonance (13Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Google Scholar) and in vivo one-hybrid (14Difilippantonio M.J. McMahan C.J. Eastman Q.M. Spanopoulou E. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 253-262Google Scholar) experiments demonstrated specific recognition of the nonamer by the RAG1 nonamer binding domain and a less significant contribution of the heptamer to binding. In the one-hybrid experiments, RAG2 only modestly enhanced RAG1 DNA binding (14Difilippantonio M.J. McMahan C.J. Eastman Q.M. Spanopoulou E. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 253-262Google Scholar), implying that RAG1 by itself was capable of significant, sequence-specific DNA binding. Subsequently, numerous studies making use of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and, in most cases RAG proteins fused to large N-terminal tags (glutathione S-transferase (GST) or maltose-binding protein (MBP)), led to the identification of a stable RAG1·RAG2·RSS complex termed the SC (for signal complex) (15Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4670-4678Google Scholar, 16Hiom K. Gellert M. Cell. 1997; 88: 65-72Google Scholar, 17Mo X. Bailin T. Sadofsky M.J. J. Biol.

These studies also indicated that RAG1 alone binds the RSS with low specificity and that RAG2 substantially enhances the affinity and specificity of the interaction. Such findings have led to the suggestion that the RAG1-RSS interaction is unlikely to be biologically significant in the absence of RAG2 (15Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4670-4678Google Scholar). Only weak, nonspecific DNA binding by RAG2 alone has been reported (17Mo X. Bailin T. Sadofsky M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7025-7031Google Scholar), but recent evidence supports a direct interaction between RAG2 and DNA in the RAG1·RAG2·RSS complex (19Fugmann S.D. Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 899-910Google Scholar). Footprinting experiments (15Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4670-4678Google Scholar, 20Nagawa F. Ishiguro K. Tsuboi A. Yoshida T.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 115-125Google Scholar) reveal that RAG1 generates protection over the nonamer and the flanking portion of the spacer, whereas with both RAG proteins, protein-DNA interactions extend throughout the spacer and heptamer (21Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 115-125Google Scholar). All footprinting experiments utilized MBP-RAG1 core fusion proteins. The stoichiometry of the RAG proteins in the SC is controversial. Some experiments indicated the presence of a dimer of RAG1 (18Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3674-3683Google Scholar, 22Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Google Scholar), whereas others argue for the presence of three or four RAG1 subunits (25Landree M.A. Kale S.B. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4256-4264Google Scholar, 26Mundy C.L. Patenge N. Matthews A.G.W. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 69-77Google Scholar). RAG2 is present in the SC either as a monomer (18Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3674-3683Google Scholar) or as a dimer (23Bailin T. Mo X. Sadofsky M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4664-4671Google Scholar, 26Mundy C.L. Patenge N. Matthews A.G.W. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 69-77Google Scholar). The nonamer binding domain of RAG1 is thought to contact the nonamer, whereas a central domain of RAG1 (aa 528–760) has been shown to display some specificity for the heptamer (27Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Google Scholar). In addition, a C-terminal domain of RAG1 has been shown to cross-link to the coding flank (28Mo X.M. Bailin T. Sadofsky M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2038-2047Google Scholar). Recent experiments indicate a division of labor between RAG1 monomers in the SC; one contacts the nonamer, whereas another engages the heptamer at the site of cleavage (25Landree M.A. Kale S.B. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4256-4264Google Scholar, 29Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 449-458Google Scholar). We currently do not know the equilibrium constant that governs the association of RAG1 monomers into dimers. Furthermore, since most DNA binding studies have been performed by EMSA, we do not know the equilibrium constants governing reactions involving RAG1 alone or RAG1 in conjunction with RAG2 and HMG proteins in forming complexes with the RSS in solution. The equilibrium dissociation binding constant for the interaction of a MBP-RAG1 core (aa 384–1008) fusion protein with 12- or 23-RSS oligonucleotides was determined by EMSA to be close to 100 nm (22Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2938-2946Google Scholar). In this study, however, the MBP-RAG1 fusion protein was capable of forming several protein-DNA complexes with various protein stoichiometries and various DNA binding affinities, and the determined dissociation constant reflected the overall binding without specification of the individual components of reaction. We have now used fluorescence spectroscopy and a RAG1 protein lacking a bulky tag to study the RAG1-RSS interaction in solution, thereby overcoming some of the limitations inherent in the EMSA methodology and any complications caused by a large fusion partner. We find that the RAG1-RSS interaction is of higher affinity and specificity than previously reported. In addition, we document a substantial conformational change in RAG1 induced by interaction with the RSS. Based on these findings, we propose that the RAG1-RSS interaction may play an important role in vivo, especially in light of the observation that for a portion of the cell cycle, developing lymphocytes express RAG1 in the virtual absence of RAG2 protein (30Lin W.C. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2733-2737Google Scholar). Unlabeled and fluorescently labeled deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized and high performance liquid chromatography-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). The 12-RSS substrate was made by annealing (top strand) 5′-GTCGACCACAGTGCTACAGACTGGAACAAAAACCCTGCAG-3′ with its complement. The nonspecific DNA substrate was made by annealing (top strand) 5′-GTCGACTGGCCATCTACAGACTGGAGCGGCCGCACTGCAG-3′ with its complement. The fluorescein fluorophore was attached at the 5′ ends of the top strands using a 5′-fluorescein phosphoramidite that attaches 6-carboxyfluorescein to the oligonucleotide via a C6 chain linker. Annealing of oligonucleotides to generate double-stranded DNA was performed in binding buffer (BB; 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) by heating the complementary oligonucleotides mixed in equimolar amounts for 5 min at 95 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Murine core RAG1 was expressed as a Strep-tag II fusion in the context of the pASK-IBA5 vector (Sigma Genosys). The catalytic core of murine RAG1 from aa 377–1008 was amplified using primers that created anNdeI site at the 5′ end of the gene and a XhoI site at the 3′ end. These PCR products were subcloned into the corresponding sites in pASK-IBA5, placing the Strep tag at the N terminus of the protein. The fusion protein was expressed in the BL21 strain ofEscherichia coli. Expression cultures were started by adding 20 ml of overnight culture per 1 liter final culture volume and grown at 25 °C with rapid shaking (>200 rpm) until theA 600 was ∼1. Expression was induced by the addition of anhydrotetracycline to a final concentration of ∼1 μm and ZnCl2 to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Cultures were grown for an additional 12–16 h, at which point the A 600 was usually ∼5 absorbance units. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 μm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, aprotinin, leupeptin). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice, and debris and insoluble material were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 26,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C in a SW-41 rotor (Beckman). Cleared lysate was added to Fast-Flow Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) 50–75-ml bed volume column preequilibrated in the lysis buffer before the addition of lysate. After loading, the column was washed with two bed volumes of lysis buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, and RAG1 was eluted with 3 bed volumes of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Q-Sepharose elution fractions were applied to a 7–10-ml bed volume Streptactin-Sepharose column (Sigma Genosys) pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and after washing with lysis buffer containing 500 mm salt, Strep-RAG1 was eluted in lysis buffer (500 mm salt) containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. The eluted Strep-RAG1 protein was typically >90–95% pure. Aggregated Strep-RAG1 was separated from dimers and other oligomers using a Superdex 200HR column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing the dimeric protein were dialyzed against BB. MBP-RAG1 core (aa 384–1008) and glutathione S-transferase-RAG2 (aa 1–383) protein expression and purification were performed as described in (22Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2938-2946Google Scholar,31Fugmann S.D. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L.M. Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 97-107Google Scholar). Coupled cleavage reactions (50-μl final volume) contained 10 ng of body-labeled substrate containing both a 12-RSS and a 23-RSS, 100 ng of each RAG protein, 30 ng of HMG2, and 5 mm MgCl2 and were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C using buffer conditions described previously (32Agrawal A. Eastman Q.M. Schatz D.G. Nature. 1998; 394: 744-751Google Scholar). Reaction products were resolved on a 4% native Tris borate EDTA polyacrylamide gel. To create the EMSA probe, 2 μm 12-RSS double-stranded oligonucleotide DNA was 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P] ATP (3000Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and purified on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. StrRAG1 or MBP-RAG1 was incubated with radioactively labeled 12-RSS oligonucleotide in the presence or absence of unlabeled 12-RSS or nonspecific DNA in BB supplemented with 10 ng/ml heparin and 0.5% glycerol at 25 °C for 20 min, and samples were resolved on 4% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate (45 mm Tris (pH 8.9), 45 mm borate) at room temperature. For better separation of the multimeric species formed by MBP-RAG1, a discontinuous 3.5–8% polyacrylamide gel was used. Gels were dried and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The fraction bound at saturation, maximal fraction bound,F MAX = 1, is set constant, whereas we expressed the normalized fraction bound as the ratio between the fraction bound at each data set and the actual constant value of the fraction bound at saturation. The data were fit to a Hill binding isotherm withn = 2. normalized fraction bound=FMAXStrRAG12KD+StrRAG12(Eq. 1) [StrRAG1] represents the concentration of free protein expressed as monomeric protein. The StrRAG1 intrinsic emission fluorescence spectra were recorded using a SLM-8000 L format spectrofluorometer equipped with a 750-watt Xenon arc lamp. All fluorescence measurements were performed in 100-μl quartz cuvettes (Starna, Atascadero, CA) at 25 °C constant temperature maintained by a circulating water bath. The StrRAG1 intrinsic emission fluorescence spectra were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm using an 8-nm band pass for both the monochromator and the emission long pass. All fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 420 nm using 1-nm steps and 2-s integration times. Dilution of StrRAG1 samples was done in ice-cold BB buffer filtered twice through 0.2-μm sterile filters (Gelman Laboratory) followed by a 10-min incubation at 25 °C. For static experiments, mixing of StrRAG1 with DNA or acrylamide was done inside the quartz cuvette followed by a 10-min incubation at 25 °C constant temperature before recording. Each spectrum was corrected (33Ciubotaru M. Bright F.V. Ingersoll C.M. Koudelka G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 859-873Google Scholar) for background, photobleaching (5–15%), and dilution relative to a control sample for which the same amount of protein was incubated in parallel with a corresponding volume of buffer. Photobleaching was always reversible, indicating that no photo products are generated in the reaction. The fluorescence emission intensity of all spectra were expressed as a ratio relative to a standard rhodamine reference excited with the same source and whose emission output was a constant ≈46,500. If sample absorption at excitation wavelength exceeded 0.001, inner filter corrections were also applied according to Lakowicz (34Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Google Scholar). For the time course experiment shown in Fig. 7 b, DNA was mixed with protein rapidly with a long capillary tip with the cuvette in the holder and an automatic shutter opened immediately for recording. The emission at 327 nm was recorded at 1-s intervals. Polarization anisotropy measurements were performed on a PTI C-61 T-format fluorometer equipped with UV-transmitting Glan-Thompson plane polarizers and a circulating water bath to control the cell temperature. All measurements were performed using the same quartz cuvette used for emission scans and temperature set at 25 °C. For tryptophan fluorescence, the samples were excited at 295 nm, and emission was collected at 327 nm, whereas for fluorescein the excitation wavelength was set at 492 nm, and emission was recorded at 520 nm. The recorded intensities were corrected for variations in lamp intensity, detector, and monochromator wavelength-dependent sensitivity. G-factor corrections were included in all calculated anisotropy values. For the time course experiment shown in Fig.7 a, fluorescence intensities were recorded at 1-s intervals. A 1-ml quartz cuvette with a round bottom was used to allow magnetic stirring. To the solution containing 50 nm 12-RSS fluorescein-labeled DNA, either a concentrated StrRAG1 solution or BB buffer supplemented with 50% glycerol (control reaction) was added in a volume less than 1/20 of the total sample, without mixing. The unmixed components were incubated together for 100 s, and then mixing was initiated by rapid stirring. Circular dichroism spectra either of DNA or DNA incubated with StrRAG1 was recorded using a JASCO J715 spectropolarimeter. The buffer used for incubation was 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. The spectra were recorded at 25 °C between 200 and 300 nm. For analysis of the spectra of DNA and StrRAG1 mixtures, the separately recorded DNA spectra were subtracted, and then the spectra were converted to molar ellipticity based upon the molar concentration of StrRAG1 present in each sample. Time-resolved fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decay kinetics were measured in the frequency domain using an SLM-AMINCO 48000 multiharmonic Fourier (MHF) spectrofluorometer (Spectronic Instruments). An argon-ion laser (Coherent, Innova 90-6) operating at 488.0 nm was used as the excitation source. An interference filter (Oriel) was placed in the excitation beam path to minimize extraneous plasma tube super radiance from reaching the detection system. The sample fluorescence was monitored in the typical L-format after passing through a 515-nm longpass filter. The Pockels cell modulator was operated at a 5 MHz base repetition rate. Typically, data were acquired for 60 s between 5 and 150 MHz (30 total frequencies), and at least 10 discrete multifrequency data sets were acquired for a given sample. For the excited-state intensity decay measurements, we used a dilute solution of rhodamine 6G dissolved in water as the reference lifetime standard (3.85 ns). Magic angle polarization conditions were used for all excited-state intensity decay measurements to eliminate bias arising from fluorophore rotational reorientation. The excited-state fluorescence lifetimes and rotational reorientation times were recovered from the frequency-domain data using a commercially available non-linear least squares software package (Globals Unlimited) wherein the true uncertainty in each datum was used as the frequency-dependent weighting factor. The data were fitted for single double and triple exponential decay with limiting anisotropy set nonvariable to 0.4 (35Beecham J.M. Gratton E. Ameloot M. Knutson J.R.L.B. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991Google Scholar), but only the double exponential fitting gave more than 98% correlation with our recorded data points and confident χ2 values between 0.05–0.2. For every set of anisotropy data, a minimum of three experiments was performed under identical conditions, and the data points shown are average values. Each averaged data point was considered only if the sample S.D. was less than 5–7% with respect to the calculated mean. The fitting of averaged data points was performed using a typical Hill binding isotherm (36Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 360-362Google Scholar), robs=rb+Lnrsat−rbKD+Ln(Eq. 2) where r obs is the observed anisotropy of the reporter species, r b is the basal anisotropy of the reporter species in the absence of ligand,r sat is the maximal anisotropy reached at saturation, [L] is the free ligand concentration varied in the reaction, expressed as monomeric species, n is the Hill coefficient expressing the degree of cooperative ligand binding to the reporter species, and KD is the apparent dissociation constant comprising cooperative interaction factors, which reflects the ligand concentration at half-maximal anisotropy. To fit our data values, Equation 2 was written as a function of [L]tot, total concentration of the ligand species, and [R]tot, total concentration of the reporter species in solution. fc1−fc=Ltot−nfcRtotnKD(Eq. 3) The real solutions f c =[R(L)n]/[R]tot of Equation 3 were substituted into the fluorescence anisotropy expression to be fitted to, robs=rb+fcrsat−rb(Eq. 4) The best fit for StrRAG1 binding curve to fluorescein-labeled 12-RSS DNA was obtained with the Hill coefficient n = 1.8. The solution calculations and fitting were performed using Maple 7.0 and Origin 6.0 software. For experiments in which tryptophan anisotropy was monitored while adding unlabeled 12-RSS, because StrRAG1 quantum yield changes with DNA binding we calculated the correction factor R =F/F 0, where F 0is the relative quantum yield (derived from the integral value of fluorescence corrected spectra) of free StrRAG1, and F is the relative quantum yield of DNA bound StrRAG1 at saturation. fc=robs−rbrobs−rbRrsat−robs(Eq. 5) Using Equation 5, which relates the fraction bound protein to anisotropy (34Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Google Scholar, 37Wojtuszewski K. Hawkins M.E. Cole J.L. Mukerji I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2588-2598Google Scholar), combined with Equation 2 for DNA binding, we obtained the equation used for fitting our tryptophan anisotropy data in Fig. 5 where L is the unbound DNA ([DNA] = [L]) (Equation 6). robs=rbKD+LRrsatKD+LR(Eq. 6) The calculations of the apparent molecular weight of protein-DNA complexes using the rotation reorientation time were performed using the original Perrin equation, θ=ηMrv̄+hRT(Eq. 7) where η = 0.94 centipoise P, the viscosity of the aqueous medium at 25 °C, M r is molecular weight, v̄ = 0.73 ml/g, the specific volume for the anhydrous protein, h is the degree of hydration (h = 0 for an anhydrous sphere, h = 0.2–0.4 ml/g for the typical hydration of most protein molecules),T = 298 K, and R = 8.31 × 107 erg K−1mol−1; one can predict based on the rotation reorientation time θGlobal = 48.03 ± 10.05 ns the size of the StrRAG1·12-RSS complex to be between ≈175 kDa (using h = 0) and 120 kDa (usingh = 0.4). Acrylamide quenching data represented as Stern-Volmer plots show an upward curvature concave towards the y axis. This is a characteristic feature for fluorophores quenched both by collisional and static quenching mechanisms. The fractional remaining fluorescence (F 0/F) versus acrylamide concentration [Q] was fit to a second-order function (38Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Google Scholar, 39Laws W.R. Contino P.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 448-463Google Scholar), F0F=1+KD+KSQ+KDKSQ2(Eq. 8) where K D and K S are the apparent dynamic and static quenching constants that characterize the ensemble of fluorophores (Trp and Tyr) present in StrRAG1. In our study, we used a bacterially expressed and purified murine RAG1 protein (aa 377–1008) fused at its N terminus to a short (8 aa) Strep-II tag (Sigma Genosys, Inc.) that allows affinity purification with Streptactin-coupled Sepharose (Fig.1 a). Three purification steps result in a StrRAG1 protein of greater than 98% purity (Fig.1 b). The elution profile from the final gel filtration column reveals a prominent peak at the position expected for a StrRAG1 dimer (compare Fig. 2, a andc; the predicted molecular mass of the monomer is 72 kDa). When the purified dimeric protein was reanalyzed on the gel filtration column, only the dimer peak was observed, indicating that the protein remains stably associated in dimeric form (Fig. 2 b). The intrinsic polarization anisotropy of the purified StrRAG1 at concentrations from 25 to 500 nm is constant, consistent with the existence of protein as a dimer at all concentrations within this range (data not shown). In a standard coupled cleavage assay, the StrRAG1 protein was approximately as active as highly purified, dimeric MBP-core RAG1 (aa 384–1008) (Fig. 1 c). We first tested the DNA binding ability of StrRAG1 by EMSA. Increasing amounts of StrRAG1 (or for comparison, MBP-RAG1) were incubated with a constant amount of labeled DNA bearing a consensus 12-RSS sequence. The binding buffer used throughout this study contains a moderate salt concentration (50 mm NaCl and 5 mm Mg2Cl) and was chosen to minimize nonspecific RAG1-DNA interactions (13Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Google Scholar, 15Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4670-4678Google Scholar). Under these binding conditions, StrRAG1 (Fig. 3 a) gives rise to one predominant shifted species, whereas MBP-RAG1 (Fig.3 b) yields at least three complexes of distinct mobility, consistent with a previous study (22Rodgers K.K. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L. Corbett E. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2938-2946Google Scholar). Binding by StrRAG1 was quantified, and the data points were fit to a single Hill binding isotherm equation (Equation 1; “Experimental Procedures”)"

In the case of PCPE, it has recently been shown that fragments corresponding to the free NTR domain are present in the conditioned medium of human brain tumor cells, where they appear to have moderate TIMP-like activity (45Mott J.D.

Nevertheless, the possibility that PCPE contains domains that can either enhance (CUB) or inhibit (NTR) different metalloproteinases is intriguing. A further possibility is that the NTR and/or CUB domains in PCPE are involved in the observed effects of this protein on the control of cell growth (46Masuda M. Igarashi H. Kano M. Yoshikura H.

Here we use a variety of biophysical techniques, together with molecular modeling, to determine the low-resolution structure of PCPE.

The ∼1.3-kb PCR product was ligated into pGEM-T, sequenced fully on both strands to ensure an error-free clone, excised by digestion with NheI and NotI and ligated in-frame between the NheI and NotI sites of the vector pCEP-Pu/BM40s (53Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Excision of fused BM40-PCPE sequences from the latter construct with KpnI and NotI and insertion between the KpnI and NotI sites of expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) yielded a construct designed to produce a translation product differing from native PCPE only in the replacement of the native signal peptide by the BM40 signal sequence (for enhancement of secretion). Proper insertion of sequences was verified by DNA sequencing of insert-vector junctions. Human 293 embryonic kidney cells, purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/10% fetal bovine serum (14Unsold C.

Two days post-transfection, cells were placed in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), selected for approximately 2 weeks, then G418-resistant clonal lines were picked with cloning cylinders and maintained in growth medium containing 250 μg/ml G418. Confluent monolayers of the clonal line determined by Western blotting to produce the highest levels of recombinant PCPE (rPCPE) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 250 μg/ml G418 and 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) for 24 h. Medium was harvested and centrifuged to remove cell debris, and protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm4-aminobenzamidine dihydrochloride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Conditioned medium, which was typically found to contain ∼15 μg/ml PCPE, was stored at −70 °C until further use. Recombinant PCPE from conditioned 293 cell media was purified as described (54Moschcovich L. Bernocco S. Font B. Rivkin H. Eichenberger D. Chejanovsky N. Hulmes D.J.S. Kessler E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for rPCPE produced in a baculovirus system. The purified protein, in 20 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl pH 7.4, was then concentrated and buffer exchanged, to up to 30 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl pH 7.4, using UltraFree 15 microconcentrators (Millipore, 10 kDa cut-off), and stored at −80 °C. Human 3H-labeled type I procollagen and recombinant BMP-1 with a C-terminal FLAG epitope were prepared and purified as previously described (23Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G.

Procollagen substrate (400 ng) was incubated at 37 °C either alone or in combination with 100 ng purified rPCPE and/or 30 ng BMP-1 in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. Following incubation for the indicated period, reactions were stopped by the addition of 10× concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 min. Following electrophoresis, processing intermediates were visualized as previously described (23Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A.

Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems MALDI-TOF Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer operating in delayed extraction and linear mode. The rPCPE sample was analyzed after dialysis against 0.1 m ammonium acetate and purification using a ZipTipTM C4 (Millipore). The matrix was a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (5 mg) in 0.5 ml of 30% (v/v) CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and an AN-60 TI rotor. Experiments were carried out at 20 °C in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Two samples of 400 μl at protein concentrations of 0.4 and 1.2 mg/ml were loaded into 12-mm path cells and centrifuged at 42,000 rpm. Scans were recorded at 277 nm every 5 min using a 0.03-mm radial spacing. Sedimentation profiles were analyzed using SEDFIT (55Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1503-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) (www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com), which takes advantage of a radial and time-independent noise subtraction procedure (56Schuck P. Demeler B. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2288-2296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), to directly model boundary profiles in terms of a continuous distribution of discrete species and of non-interacting components. This allows the evaluation of both sedimentation (s) and diffusion (D) coefficients, from which the molar mass is derived using the Svedberg equation: M = s RT/D(1 − ρν̄). We estimated the partial specific volume (ν̄) of rPCPE, from its amino acid composition (assuming an additional molecular mass of ∼3 kDa due to glycosylation equivalent to 17 hexose units per PCPE molecule) to be 0.721 ml/g, the solvent density ρ to be 1.005 g/ml, and the solvent viscosity η to be 1.002 mPa·s, at 20 °C using SEDNTERP software (V1.01; developed by D. B. Haynes, T. Laue, and J. Philo, www.bbri.org/RASMB/rasmb.html), which was also used for the calculation of the corrected s 20,w andD 20,w values, and calculated minimum values of the hydrodynamic diameter Dh. Purified rPCPE was dialyzed against 0.1m ammonium acetate. Samples were then diluted in the same buffer and mixed with glycerol (1:1) to obtain final concentrations of rPCPE ranging from 5 to 15 μg/ml. A drop of the solution was then placed onto freshly cleaved mica sheets, using the “mica sandwich” technique (57Mould A.P. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. Chapman J.A. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1985; 91: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and immediately transferred to the holder of a MED 010 evaporator (Balzers). Rotary shadowing was carried out by evaporating platinum at an angle of 8°, followed by evaporation of carbon at 90°. Replicas were floated onto distilled water, picked up on copper grids and examined with a Philips CM120 microscope at the “Centre Technologique des Microstructures” (Université Claude Bernard, Lyon I). Synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected using standard procedures on the X33 camera (58Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instrum.

Dauvergne F. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1982; 201: 223-224Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Samples were measured at protein concentrations of 3.1, 4.6, and 30.8 mg/ml, determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an absorbance of 0.8 at 1 mg/ml calculated from the amino acid sequence. Scattering curves were recorded at a wavelength (λ) of 1.5 Å at a sample-detector distance of 1.8 m covering the momentum transfer range 0.015 < s < 0.43 Å−1 (s = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). Data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam and corrected for detector response, the scattering of buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves were scaled for concentration using the program PRIMUS. 2P. V. Konarev, V. V. Volkov, M. H. J. Koch, and D. I. Svergun, submitted manuscript. To check for radiation damage and aggregation during the small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiment, the data were collected in 10 successive 1-min frames. Reduced data sets at low angles were then extrapolated to zero concentration following standard procedures (62Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small Angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar) and then merged with the higher angle data to yield the final composite scattering curves. To eliminate scattering from a minor population of high molecular mass aggregates (which appeared possibly as a result of freezing and/or concentrating the sample) rPCPE in the low concentration range (3–5 mg/ml) was analyzed directly after further purification by gel permeation chromatography on Superdex 200, using 20 mmHepes, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 as elution buffer. Data from these samples were used for the very low angle region while higher angle data were obtained with rPCPE purified using the standard protocol (see above) then adjusted to 500 mm NaCl and centrifuged for 15 min at 17,500 × g. The molar mass of rPCPE in solution was calculated by SAXS by comparing the forward scattering with that from freshly made reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (molar mass = 66 kDa). The radius of gyration Rg was evaluated using the Guinier approximation, I exp(s) =I(0)exp(−s 2 Rg 2/3), which is valid for (sRg) < 1.3 (62Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small Angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar), and also from the entire scattering curve using with the indirect transform package GNOM (63Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2921) Google Scholar). GNOM was also used to evaluate the forward scattering I (0) and distance distribution functionp(r). The maximum dimension Dmax was also estimated using the orthogonal expansion program ORTOGNOM (64Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Low resolution models of the protein were generated ab initio using the programs DAMMIN (slow mode) (65Svergun D.I. Biophys.

Proteolytic pathways accessory to the proteasome contribute to protein turnover, and their up-regulation may complement the proteasome when proteasomal proteolysis is impaired. Here we show that reduced reliance on proteasomal proteolysis allowed a reduced efficiency of MHC class I ligand production, whereas protein turnover and cellular proliferation were maintained. Using the proteasomal inhibitor adamantane-acetyl-(6-aminohexanoyl)3-(leucinyl)3-vinyl-(methyl)-sulphone, we show that covalent inhibition of all three types of proteasomal β-subunits (β1, β2, and β5) was compatible with continued growth in cells that up-regulate accessory proteolytic pathways, which include cytosolic proteases as well as deubiquitinating enzymes. However, under these conditions, we observed poor assembly of H-2Db molecules and inhibited presentation of endogenous tumor antigens. Thus, the tight link between protein turnover and production of MHC class I ligands can be broken by enforcing the substitution of the proteasome with alternative proteolytic pathways.

However, the 26 S proteasome, a large multicatalytic proteinase complex, carries out the bulk of both cytosolic protein degradation and MHC class I ligand production (1Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu.

This protease has a multisubunit 20 S core structure containing two sets of three distinct catalytic sites, X (β5), Y (β1), and Z (β2), associated with one or two 19 S regulatory accessory complexes (1Rock K.L.

The proteasome generates a wide range of peptide cleavage products (3–24 amino acids in length) that are ultimately degraded into free amino acids (4Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L.

In mammalian cells, a minor subset of peptides is rescued from further degradation and is translocated from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum for assembly with MHC class I molecules. The MHC class I pathway is thereby assured constitutive production of ligands through cytosolic proteolysis. In the case of an immunological challenge, mammalian cells express IFN-γ-inducible proteasomal β-subunits (LMP7/β5i, LMP2/β1i, and MECL-1/β2i) that replace the constitutively expressed subunits in newly synthesized proteasomes (1Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Such replacement leads to increased proteasomal production of peptides with hydrophobic C termini, usually preferred for both TAP transport and MHC class I binding (7Fruh K. Yang Y. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, the majority of potential MHC class I ligands, as deduced from their primary structure, are not efficiently processed, although the correct motifs for TAP transport and MHC class I binding are contained in the protein sequence (8Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 51-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 9Chen W. Norbury C.C. Cho Y. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Such failure may depend on proteolysis by cytosolic proteases inefficient at generating the requisite cleavage products. Thus, it is possible that MHC class I processing may be regulated by differential participation of non-proteasomal peptidases in cytosolic protein degradation. Impaired proteasomal activity can be functionally compensated, at least in part, by another large cytosolic peptidase, tripeptidyl-peptidase II (10Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M.

However, it is unknown whether the adapted state has functional consequences at the level of MHC class I ligand generation and antigen presentation to CTLs. We show that lymphoma cells with reduced reliance on proteasomal activity no longer efficiently produced MHC class I ligands, although cytosolic proteolysis continued, and proliferation was not altered compared with control cells. Assembly of H-2Db molecules was dramatically reduced, and endogenous tumor antigens were not presented efficiently under these conditions. This phenotype contributed to escape from tumor rejection in tumor graft experiments in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice. Using a GFP reporter to measure proteolysis, we show in live cells that non-proteasomal serine peptidase activity participated in protein degradation, but inhibition of these enzymes failed to have a significant effect on the assembly of H-2Kb molecules. Continued proteolysis in proteasome-impaired cells afforded the cell the requisite housekeeping functions while preventing the full display of the usual set of MHC class I-restricted epitopes. EL-4 is a benzopyrene-induced thymoma cell line of the H-2b haplotype, derived from C57Bl/6 mice. RMA is a Rauscher's virus-induced T cell lymphoma cell line and is also derived from C57Bl/6. Adaptation to the proteasomal inhibitor NLVS was obtained by incubation of these cells in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine, and 10 μm NLVS. Gradually outgrowing cells were selected and cultured in 50 μm NLVS over a period of several weeks as described previously (10Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). EL-4.Ub-R-GFP and EL-4.Ub-M-GFP cells were obtained by electroporation of EL-4 cells with constructs Ub-R-GFP and Ub-M-GFP (16Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), respectively, and stable clones were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418. Electroporation was preformed in a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser at 250 V and 960 microfarads. NLVS (14Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 6629-6634Crossref Scopus (406) Google Scholar) covalently modifies all catalytically active subunits of the proteasome, but with preference for the β-subunits with chymotryptic specificity. Several derivatives of NLVS were obtained by variations in the peptide scaffold: 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Ala-Ala-Phe-vinyl sulfone (AAF-VS) and 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Leu-Leu-Gly(cis)-vinyl sulfone (LLG(cis)-VS). LLG-VS was obtained in thecis- and trans-isomers due to the absence of a side chain on the P1 glycine. Whereas the trans-form of LLG-VS modifies proteasomal β-subunits, the cis-form modifies yet uncharacterized targets in the cytosol distinct from the proteasome. Adamantane-acetyl-(6-aminohexanoyl)3-(leucinyl)3-vinyl-(methyl)-sulphone (Ada-Ahx3-Leu3-VS) is an N-terminally extended vinyl sulfone inhibitor that blocks all proteasomal β-subunits in a covalent manner (17Kessler B.M. Tortorella D. Altun M. Kisselev A.F. Fiebiger E. Hekking B.G. Ploegh H.L. Overkleeft H.S. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 913-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To assay the activity of the proteasome, we used the fluorogenic substrates succinyl-LLVY-AMC, benzyloxycarbonyl-GGL-AMC,t-butyloxycarbonyl-LRR-AMC, and benzyloxycarbonyl-YVAD-AMC (Sigma). To assay tripeptidyl-peptidase II activity, we used AAF-AMC (Sigma). Cell extracts or proteasome-enriched fractions and substrate (100 μm) were mixed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP in a final volume of 100 μl. Peptide hydrolysis was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, CT) with excitation at 380 nm and fluorescence reading at 460 nm. Preparation of proteasome-enriched fractions was performed using 0.5–1 × 109 control or adapted EL-4 cells and C57Bl/6 livers. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by vortexing with glass beads in 50 mm Tris base (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP. Glass beads and cell debris were removed by sequential centrifugations at 3000 and 14,000 rpm, respectively. Microsomes were removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and large cytosolic proteins or protein complexes containing proteasomes and tripeptidyl-peptidase II were then sedimented at 100,000 × g for 5 h. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 50 mm Tris base (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 30% glycerol. Cells were starved in methionine/cysteine-deficient medium for 45–60 min, pulsed with [35S]methionine for 15 min, and chased for the indicated times. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and MHC class I molecules were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-p8 serum (H-2Kbcytoplasmic tail), monoclonal antibody Y3 (H-2Kbα1α2), or antibody B22.249.1 (H-2Db α1α2) as described previously (18Machold R.P. Andree S. Van Kaer L. Ljunggren H.-G. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Viral peptide epitopes are known to stabilize the MHC class I complex at 4 °C. We added Db-binding peptide ASNENMDAM (influenza NT60, amino acids 366–374) at 10 μm to detect the presence of unfolded heavy chains. Immune complexes were removed by adsorption to staphylococcus A and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously described (10Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For the generation of CTLs specific for tumor antigens expressed by EL-4 cells, we primed B6 mice two to three times with control or adapted EL-4 cells transfected with B7.1. Priming of responses with EL-4 cells not expressing B7.1 led to very low CTL responses or no response at all. To generate RMA cell-specific CTLs, we primed C57BL/6 mice with irradiated RMA cells two to three times; and for the subsequent generation of in vitro effector cells, 25 × 106 splenocytes were restimulated in vitro with 1–2 × 106 irradiated tumor cells for 5 days. The H-2Db restricted CTL clone ln17 was acquired from Elisabeth Wolpert and Vanoohi Fredriksson (MTC, Karolinska Institutet). The conditions for generation and analysis of this CTL have been described previously (23van Hall T. van Bergen J. van Veelen P.A. Kraakman M. Heukamp L.C. Koning F. Melief C.J. Ossendorp F. Offringa R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Control EL-4 and EL-4ad cells (cultured in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 200 μl/inoculate. The cells were inoculated into the right flanks of syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice at 104 or 106cells/animal. Some of the mice were irradiated with 400 rads prior to tumor inoculation to inhibit antitumor immune responses. Outgrowth of the tumors was monitored by palpations weekly. EL-4 cells can adapt to proliferate in the presence of high concentrations of NLVS, a covalent proteasomal inhibitor (denoted EL-4ad cells) (10Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MHC class I molecules show allelic variation in their ability to undergo assembly and transport during proteasomal inhibition, and H-2Db is one allele that fails to assemble in cells that are treated with proteasomal inhibitors for short-term periods (19Benham A.M. Gromme M. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar, 20Luckey C.J. Marto J.A. Partridge M. Hall E. White F.M. Lippolis J.D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1212-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated H-2Db ligand production in EL-4ad cells, which proliferate with low proteasomal activity. In control EL-4 cells, almost all folded H-2Db molecules were transported from the endoplasmic reticulum within 120 min after onset of the chase, as judged from their acquisition of Golgi-specific glycan modifications (Fig. 1 a, left panel). In EL-4 cells treated with NLVS (50 μm, 3 h), only a minimal fraction of H-2Db heavy chains were transported even after long chase times (Fig. 1 a,middle panel), as reported previously (21Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). Stabilization of H-2Db molecules in cell lysates of NLVS-treated EL-4 cells by addition of the influenza nucleoprotein-(366–374) peptide confirmed that most of these H-2Db heavy chains were devoid of peptide ligand (+ lanes) (22Ljunggren H.-G. Stam N.J. Ohlen C. Neefjes J.J. Hoglund P. Heemels M.T. Bastin J. Schumacher T.N. Townsend A. Karre K. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). In EL-4ad cells, a fraction of H-2Db resumed folding, although at much lower levels compared with control EL-4 cells. The majority of H-2Db heavy chains in EL-4ad cells remained unassembled in the endoplasmic reticulum devoid of peptide, as indicated by the stabilizing effect of nucleoprotein-(366–374) added to lysates of these cells (Fig. 1 a, right panel). In RMAad cells, which were similarly adapted to NLVS, maturation of H-2Db molecules was comparable to that observed in EL-4ad cell (Fig. 1 b). Despite normal proliferation, tumor cells can therefore avoid production of most H-2Db ligands by reduced reliance on proteasomal activity. Tumor cells often acquire deficiencies in MHC class I antigen presentation to escape from host immune detection. To test whether reduced reliance on proteasomal activity has functional consequences, we tested presentation of endogenous tumor antigens to CTLs by EL-4ad and RMAad cells. Both EL-4 and RMA cells express H-2Kb-restricted (gagL75–83) as well as H-2Db-restricted (env189–196) murine leukemia virus-derived peptides and, in addition, an endogenous H-2Db-restricted tumor epitope (23van Hall T. van Bergen J. van Veelen P.A. Kraakman M. Heukamp L.C. Koning F. Melief C.J. Ossendorp F. Offringa R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We generated antitumor CTLs by priming C57Bl/6 mice and subsequent in vitrorestimulation of splenocytes with B7.1-transfected EL-4 cells. We found that tumor antigen-specific CTLs performed efficient killing of control EL-4 cells, whereas EL-4ad cells were not efficiently recognized, although the latter were killed significantly better than C4.4-25−, a β2-microglobulin-deficient variant of EL-4 (Fig. 2 a and data not shown). We also found that RMAad cells likewise had a reduced ability to present endogenous tumor antigens compared with control RMA cells. Although RMAad target cells were killed at higher levels than TAP-deficient RMA-S cells, 5–10 times more CTLs were required to obtain the same degree of killing as seen on RMA target cells (Fig.2 b). Even more pronounced differences were obtained using CTL clone ln17, specific for tumor antigen-specific peptide NKGENAQAI restricted by H-2Db (20Luckey C.J. Marto J.A. Partridge M. Hall E. White F.M. Lippolis J.D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1212-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In line with previous data, we found that ln17 detected the presence of the tumor-specific epitope on RMA cells, but failed to recognize RMA-S cells (Fig. 2 c). Furthermore, no recognition of RMAad cells was observed. MHC class I-restricted presentation of a tumor antigen-specific peptide can thereby be inhibited when proteasomal proteolysis is inhibited in a suitable manner. Because we used IFN-γ secretion as readout for antigen detection by ln17, these data also exclude that the differences in CTL killing were due merely to differences in target cell apoptosis when comparing control and NLVS-adapted target cells. These data support the conclusion that EL-4ad cells fail to display the full repertoire of MHC class I-associated antigens at the cell surface. The chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome is required for the production of most MHC class I ligands and is normally rate-limiting for intracellular proteolysis (1Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 4Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 7Fruh K. Yang Y. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To visualize protein turnover in EL-4ad cells, we performed pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine and displayed labeled protein by SDS-PAGE. As expected from the proliferation rates of these cell lines (10Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we observed a similar rate of decay of labeled proteins when comparing control EL-4 and EL-4ad cells (Fig. 2 d). We conclude that NLVS-adapted cells have a severely inhibited chymotryptic proteasomal activity, as deduced from experiments employing active site-directed covalent probes. When complemented by the induction of other cytosolic proteases (10Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari-Hartz M. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. Niedermann G. Science. 1999; 283: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 12Wang E.W. Kessler B.M. Borodovsky A. Cravatt B.F. Bogyo M. Ploegh H.L. Glas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9990-9995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the remaining proteasomal activity is adequate for normal protein turnover, but not for production of all class I ligands. The activity of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP14 is associated with the 19 S cap proteasome and is up-regulated when the proteasome is inhibited (24Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). More generally, inhibition of proteasomal proteolysis should lead to accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated substrates. Adaptation to proteasomal inhibitors might well include increased activity of deubiquitinating enzymes to deal with such accumulation. We therefore examined whether this was the case also in EL-4ad cells using 125I-labeled ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone (24Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Cellular fractions of control EL-4 and EL-4ad cells (cytosolic as well as proteasome-enriched fractions) were incubated with ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone, and covalently modified polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE. We found increased labeling of IsoT1, USP14, and UCH-L1 in EL-4ad cells compared with control EL-4 cells (Fig. 3 a), in line with what was observed in acutely treated EL-4 cells (24Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). More active ubiquitin removal could prepare these substrates for degradation by other proteases. Two additional active-site probes with different peptide scaffolds were used (25Bogyo M. Shin S. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), [125I]AAF-VS and [125I]LLG-VS, to examine whether residual proteasomal activity is mediated by the β5/β5i-subunits (X/LMP7). None of these probes labeled β5/β5i-subunits (X/LMP7) in lysates of EL-4ad cells, whereas strong labeling was detected in lysates of control EL-4 cells (Fig. 3 b). This confirms that virtually no catalytic activity remains for the β5/β5i-subunits (X/LMP7) in EL-4ad cells, which is important in view of the fact that small amounts of peptide ligand suffice to load MHC class I molecules with peptide (26Yewdell J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 294-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, using [125I]LLG(cis)-VS, we detected a series of modified polypeptides distinct from proteasomal β-subunits. Because vinyl sulfones are mechanism-based probes (14Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 6629-6634Crossref Scopus (406) Google Scholar,27Palmer J.T. Rasnick D. Klaus J.L. Bromme D. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), we conclude that these polypeptides correspond to additional, yet to be identified, proteases. This activity is not inhibited by NLVS, further supporting the alteration in proteolytic specificity in EL-4ad cells (Fig. 3 b, middle panel). Labeling of the β5/β5i- subunits (X/LMP7) with [125I]NLVS was likewise inhibited in RMAad cells when tested with these peptide vinyl sulfones (Fig. 3 c). We next made stable EL-4 transfectants expressing Ub-R-GFP to monitor proteasomal degradation of a protein substrate in live cells (16Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). GFP was converted into an N-end rule substrate and was degraded in EL-4 cells due to its N-terminal arginine, whereas Ub-M-GFP was comparatively stable (Fig.4, a–c) because of the presence of a methionine residue. NLVS treatment of EL-4.Ub-R-GFP cells led to accumulation of fluorescence, as detected by FACS. In line with data from yeast mutants (28Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowsky J. Escher C. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 29Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), efficient inhibition of primarily the chymotryptic proteasomal activity was sufficient for accumulation of fluorescence (Fig. 4, c and d). In addition, the accumulation of R-GFP fluorescence observed in cells exposed to 10 μm NLVS also correlated with the induction of cellular toxicity and subsequent cell death (data not shown). These data further confirm that NLVS is indeed an efficient inhibitor of proteasomal protein degradation in live cells. We next tested whether inhibition of accessory pathways has any effect on cytosolic proteolysis. To do this, we accumulated high levels of the R-GFP substrate in live EL-4.Ub-R-GFP cells and then blocked protein synthesis to study changes in the steady state of the substrate (Fig.5, a–d). This revealed residual substrate degradation in the continued presence of 10 μm NLVS because a substantial fraction of the substrate was removed after 8 h. However, this was inhibited by treatment with AAF-CMK, an efficient inhibitor of tripeptidyl-peptidase II and other serine oligopeptidases (Fig. 5, c and d). Although inhibition of oligopeptidases by AAF-CMK had minor effects on untreated EL-4.Ub-R-GFP cells, we observed a significant effect on R-GFP accumulation upon treating EL-4.Ub-R-GFP cells with both NLVS and AAF-CMK in combination (Fig. 5 e). These data show that non-proteasomal oligopeptidase activity indeed contributes to cytosolic proteolysis, especially during situations of limiting or insufficient proteasomal activity. To further study whether oligopeptidases inhibitable by AAF-CMK are important in generating MHC class I ligands, we performed a pulse-chase experiment with [35S]methionine metabolic labeling and precipitation of H-2Kb molecules. A substantial fraction of H-2Kb molecules continue to assemble in EL-4ad cells (10Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We examined whether this may be due to ligands produced by oligopeptidases inhibitable by AAF-CMK. We found that this treatment had minor effects on the assembly and transport of H-2Kbmolecules in EL-4ad cells and also in control EL-4 cells with active proteasomes (Fig. 5 f). We conclude that pathways accessory to proteasomal proteolysis that are inhibited by AAF-CMK support protein degradation, but reveal poor yields of MHC class I ligands. EL-4ad cells continue to depend on proteasomal β-subunit activity, at least to some extent (30Princiotta M.F. Schubert U. Chen W. Bennink J.R. Myung J. Crews C.M. Yewdell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NLVS fails to block β2- and β2i-subunits (Z/MECL-1) in vivo, a pattern of inhibition that is shared between NLVS and other covalent proteasomal inhibitors such as lactacystin (15Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and epoxomicin (31Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). To examine if residual proteasomal activity influences the viability of EL-4ad cells, we used Ada-Ahx3-Leu3-VS, a cell-permeable tripeptide vinyl sulfone that covalently modifies all proteasomal β-subunits with comparable efficiency (17Kessler B.M. Tortorella D. Altun M. Kisselev A.F. Fiebiger E. Hekking B.G. Ploegh H.L. Overkleeft H.S. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 913-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We found that proteasome-enriched fractions from control EL-4 or EL-4ad cells treated with either NLVS or Ada-Ahx3-Leu3-VS had almost completely blocked chymotryptic and trypsin-like proteasomal activities, whereas the caspase-like activity was 70% inhibited (Fig.6 a). Initially, at early time points, we observed an induction of the trypsin- and caspase-like specificities during inhibitor treatment, possibly due to allosteric effects on the proteasome upon binding of the inhibitor to the X/LMP7 site (32Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Castillo V. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Consistent with the enzyme assays using fluorogenic peptide substrates, labeling of β-subunits with Ada-[125I-Tyr]Ahx3-Leu3-VS in cell lysates followed by separation of the β-subunits by SDS-PAGE confirmed that all proteasomal active sites were covalently modified during treatment of live cells with the Ada-Ahx3-Leu3-VS inhibitor (Fig. 6 a,lower panel). Furthermore, EL-4ad cells proliferated regardless of the presence of Ada-Ahx3-Leu3-VS, whereas control EL-4 cells died within 48 h (Fig. 6 b). To confirm that proteasomes of proliferating EL-4ad cells were indeed modified, we prepared proteasome-enriched fractions from cells treated for several days with Ada-Ahx3-Leu3-VS. This analysis revealed results similar to those observed in acutely treated cells. Essentially no residual tryptic and chymotryptic activities and inhibited caspase-like activity were detected (data not shown). Thus, tumor cells may adapt and proliferate normally even when proteasomal β-subunit activity is almost absent. In vivo tumors frequently acquire mutations in genes encoding proteins of the MHC class I-processing pathway, and these are believed to be the result of immune selection (33Pawelec G. Heinzel S. Kiessling R. Muller L. Ouyang Q. Zeuthen J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 2000; 11: 97-133PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored whether an adapted phenotype similar to that of EL-4ad cells was selected during growthin vivo. We inoculated control EL-4 and EL-4ad cells into syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice and observed tumors in most mice inoculated with EL-4ad cells at both 106 and 104 cells/animal, whereas control EL-4 cells failed to grow and produce tumors (Fig.7 a). The tumor-forming ability of EL-4ad cells was dependent, at least in part, on escape from immune recognition because both EL-4ad and control EL-4 cells formed tumors in mice with a deficiency of perforin and RAG-1 (PKOB/RAG−/−) (Fig. 7 a). Furthermore, after low dose irradiation (400 rads) of the C57Bl/6 mice, commonly used to reduce in vivo transplantation barriers (34Peng L. Krauss J.C. Plautz G.E. Mukai S. Shu S. Cohen P.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7116-7124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), both control EL-4 and EL-4ad cells were able to grow after inoculation of 106 cells/animal, whereas only EL-4ad cells grew at 104 cells/animal (Fig. 7 b). In conclusion, we have shown that the ability of NLVS-adapted cells to proliferate independently of proteasomal β-subunit activities leads to reduced immune recognition in vivo. This study shows that tumor cells may avoid efficient production of MHC class I ligands and hence immune recognition by modulation of proteasomal activity. Pathways accessory to proteasomal proteolysis can reduce the extent to which cells depend on proteasomal activity. In our case, cells adapted to growth in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors were unable to maintain normal levels of MHC class I ligand production. In addition, using the vinyl sulfone inhibitor Ada-Ahx3-Leu3-VS, we showed that inhibition of all catalytic β-subunit activities of the proteasome (more efficiently than achieved with NLVS) was compatible with continued cell growth of EL-4ad cells. These results indicate that it is possible for mammalian cells to partly escape from production of MHC class I ligands by aversion to pathways of protein degradation involving proteases other than the proteasome. Although MHC class I processing is a rather inefficient process overall, in which most (>99%) of the cleaved peptides are never displayed at the cell surface, it is an adequate method for screening of the bulk of cellular protein content for the presence of foreign antigens (26Yewdell J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 294-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of MHC class I at the surface of cells depends on both its transport and removal from the cell surface (35Su R.C. Miller R.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4869-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and transport of H-2Db is substantially inhibited in EL-4ad cells. Despite this, the cell-surface H-2Db (and also H-2Kb) levels detected by FACS are almost normal, suggesting that the rate of decay at the cell surface may be reduced when transport is slow (data not shown). Earlier data on MHC class II transport in cathepsin S−/− mice have revealed a similar feature; and also in this case, an absence of T cell detection is observed for certain antigens (36Driessen C. Bryant R.A. Lennon-Dumenil A.M. Villadangos J.A. Bryant P.W. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 775-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 37Riese R.J. Mitchell R.N.

In the course of an immune response, the proteolytic specificity in antigen processing has profound influence on the generation of MHC class I ligands, as illustrated by the IFN-γ-dependent substitution of proteasomal β-subunits (7Fruh K. Yang Y. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The fact that pathways accessory to proteasomal proteolysis, such as tripeptidyl-peptidase II, can contribute to maintaining proteolysis when the proteasome is inhibited allows for mammalian cells to alter the spectrum of cleavage fragments in the cytosol more dramatically (10Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari-Hartz M. Baumeister W. Eichmann K.

This notion is supported by the up-regulation of several deubiquitinating enzymes in EL-4ad cells, observed otherwise in cells suffering from acute proteasomal inhibition (24Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). USP14 is associated with the 19 S regulatory complex, and its precise role in proteasomal proteolysis remains to be established. Other deubiquitinating enzymes are also up-regulated in EL-4ad cells, such as IsoT1 and UCH-L1, which participate in the disassembly of free polyubiquitin chains (38Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). When the proteasome is blocked, the removal of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugated substrates may be a crucial step to engage alternative proteolytic pathways. Reduced expression of several components of the MHC class I antigen-processing pathway is often observed in human tumors. This includes down-regulation of the IFN-γ-inducible proteasomal β-subunits (β1i, β2i, and β5i) (40Frisan T. Levitsky V. Polack A. Masucci M.G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3281-3289PubMed Google Scholar), important for production of MHC class I ligands, as well as down-regulation of other gene products involved in antigen processing (41Delp K. Momburg F. Hilmes C. Huber C. Seliger B. Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000; 25 Suppl. 2: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 42Algarra I. Cabrera T. Garrido F. Hum.

Tumors may fail to produce certain immunodominant ligands due to altered proteasomal specificity (40Frisan T. Levitsky V. Polack A. Masucci M.G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3281-3289PubMed Google Scholar, 44Morel S. et al.Immunity. 2000; 12: 107-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Our data show that reduced reliance on proteasomal proteolysis biases cytosolic proteolysis to produce peptides that are less fit for MHC class I assembly, thereby down-regulating the pool of potential MHC class I-restricted epitopes. Such down-regulation is stably retained in rapidly proliferating cells and can be induced at fairly high frequency (10Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EL-4ad cells appear to use this phenotype to avoid immunological rejection during the formation of tumors in vivo. An EL-4ad-like phenotype may be preferentially selected in tumors that are poorly antigenic, a trait observed in many types of tumors. Interestingly, in Burkitt's lymphomas, the oncogene c-myc is known to induce down-regulation of a number of components of the MHC class I-processing pathway, including down-regulation of proteasomal chymotryptic activity and up-regulation of tripeptidyl-peptidase II, thus linking the deficiency in antigen processing directly to oncogene expression (45Gavioli R.

https://openalex.org/W1975081617,"The heme active site structure of chloroperoxidase (CPO), a glycoprotein that displays versatile catalytic activities isolated from the marine mold Caldariomyces fumago, has been characterized by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic studies. All hyperfine shifted resonances from the heme pocket as well as resonances from catalytically relevant amino acid residues including the heme iron ligand (Cys29) attributable to the unique catalytic properties of CPO have been firmly assigned through (a) measurement of nuclear Overhauser effect connectivities, (b) prediction of the Curie intercepts from both one- and two-dimensional variable temperature studies, (c) comparison with assignments made for cyanide derivatives of several well characterized heme proteins such as cytochrome c peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase, and (d) examination of the crystal structural parameters of CPO. The location of protein modification that differentiates the signatures of the two isozymes of CPO has been postulated. The function of the distal histidine (His105) in modulating the catalytic activities of CPO is proposed based on the unique arrangement of this residue within the heme cavity. Contrary to the crystal state, the high affinity Mn(II) binding site in CPO (in solution) is not accessible to externally added Mn(II). The results presented here provide a reasonable explanation for the discrepancies in the literature between spectroscopists and crystallographers concerning the manganese binding site in this unique protein.

Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar). Like most members of the peroxidase superfamily, CPO1contains an iron protoporphyrin IX moiety (heme b; Fig.1) as its prosthetic group and shares major common reaction intermediates with other heme peroxidases (1Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar). However, extensive biochemical and biophysical studies carried out on this enzyme have revealed dramatic structural and catalytic differences between CPO and traditional heme peroxidases. For example, the axial ligand to the heme iron in CPO is a cysteine (Cys29) sulfur atom rather than a histidine nitrogen atom commonly found in most heme peroxidases (2Hollenberg P.F. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2630-2633Google Scholar, 3Sono M. Dawson J.H. Hager L.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 347-356Google Scholar, 4Dawson J.H. Kau L.S. Penner-Hahn J.E. Sono M. Eble K.S. Bruce G.S.

Crystallogr. 1995; 51: 842-844Google Scholar). Furthermore, CPO employs a glutamic acid (Glu183) as the distal acid-base catalyst, whereas most other heme peroxidases use a histidine to fulfill the same function (6Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1367-1377Google Scholar). The unique active site structure of CPO dictates a broad spectrum of catalytic activities such as oxidation of organic substrates (peroxidase activity) (7Thomas J.A. Morris D.R. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3129-3134Google Scholar), dismutation of hydrogen peroxide (catalase activity) (8Hewson W.D. Hager L.P. Porphyrins. 1979; 7: 295-332Google Scholar, 9Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Choe Y.S. DePillis G. Catalano C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11641-11646Google Scholar), and monooxygenation of many organic molecules (monooxygenase activity) (10Allain E.J. Hager L.P. Deng L.

Furthermore, CPO has a unique ability to utilize halide (except fluoride) ions to halogenate a wide variety of organic acceptor molecules in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or other organic hydroperoxides (14Libby R.D. Beachy T.M. Phipps A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21820-21827Google Scholar, 15Libby R.D. Rotberg N.S. Emerson J.T. White T.C. Yen G.M. Friedman S.H. Sun N.S. Goldowski R. J. Biol.

Most importantly, CPO is adept in catalyzing the stereoselective epoxidation of alkenes (10Allain E.J. Hager L.P. Deng L. Jacobsen E.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4415-4416Google Scholar, 17Hu S.

Casella L. Gullotti M. Carrea G. Pasta P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10465-10468Google Scholar, 22Colonna S. Gaggero N. Pasta P. NATO ASI Ser. Ser. C Math. Phys.

The versatile catalytic activities of CPO have attracted much interest in understanding the structural properties of the enzyme. Especially, the increasing current interest in chiral synthesis has made CPO an attractive candidate for making important chiral synthons that are of both industrial and medicinal significance. Therefore, detailed structural insight into this structurally unique and catalytically diverse heme enzyme would help to further understand the structure-activity relationship of heme proteins in general and the structural basis for the broad range of activities displayed by CPO in particular. Many chemical and spectroscopic techniques are now available for structural investigations of heme proteins. Among them, NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography represent the most powerful methods for high resolution structural characterization of paramagnetic metalloenzymes. The two methods are complementary in most cases, and it is difficult to determine which one is better. Despite the great success with cytochrome c peroxidase in the early 1980s (24Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13027-13036Google Scholar,25Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Google Scholar), x-ray crystallography of heme peroxidases has suffered from difficulties in obtaining suitable diffracting protein crystals. Nonetheless, the solid-state structure of CcP has served as a convenient and independent structural basis for evaluating results derived from NMR studies of the protein in solution. Consequently, CcP has served as a prototype model for NMR spectroscopists interested in hyperfine resonance assignment and structural refinement of the protein in solution, a state that is more closely related to the physiological conditions under which the enzyme functions (26Satterlee J.D.

Ferrer J.C. Mauk A.G. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 4510-4516Google Scholar, 37–53), relatively few NMR studies of CPO have been reported (54Dugad L.B. Wang X. Wang C.C. Lukat G.S. Goff H.M.

Chem. 1986; 261: 16528-16534Google Scholar). Furthermore, the most powerful NMR approach, the two-dimensional NMR technique that has led to the unambiguous assignment of major hyperfine-shifted signals in a number of heme peroxidases (59Bertini I. Turano P. Vila A.J. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2833-2932Google Scholar), has not been applied to the investigation of CPO. As a result, no extensive and definitive resonance assignments are available for this structurally unique yet functionally diverse enzyme. Here we report the first application of the two-dimensional NMR method to the elucidation of the active site structure of CPO in solution. The observation of both COSY and NOESY connectivities among paramagnetically shifted signals as well as NOESY connectivities between hyperfine shifted resonances and signals within the crowded diamagnetic envelope, in combination with the Curie intercepts obtained from variable temperature experiments coupled with previous one-dimensional NOE studies performed on this enzyme (54Dugad L.B. Wang X. Wang C.C. Lukat G.S. Goff H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1651-1655Google Scholar) have allowed us to assign most of the signals from the heme group, which in turn allows the assessment of the conformations of the heme side chains. Of particular importance, the two-dimensional studies have allowed firm assignment of the heme iron ligand, Cys29 spin system that is critical to the unique catalytic properties of CPO. Surprisingly, the addition of excess Mn(II) to CPO resulted in no detectable effects on the NMR spectral properties of the protein. This is in sharp contrast with the results observed for CPO isolated from cultures grown in the presence of manganese (60Hollenberg P.F. Hager L.P. Blumberg W.E. Peisach J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4801-4807Google Scholar) and from manganese (II) binding variants of CcP (36Wang X. Lu Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9146-9157Google Scholar, 61Yeung B.K.S. Wang X. Sigman J.A. Petillo P.A. Lu Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 215-221Google Scholar, 62Wilcox S.K. Putnam C.D. Sastry M. Blankenship J. Chazin W.J. McRee D.E. Goodin D.B.

The difference between solution and solid-state structural features of the same protein demonstrates the need for structural characterization using NMR to complement x-ray structural analysis. Chloroperoxidase was isolated from the growth medium of C. fumago according to the method established by Morris and Hager (64Morris D.R. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1763-1768Google Scholar) with minor modifications using acetone rather than ethanol in the solvent fractionation step. Protein preparations with Rz values of 1.4 or higher were used in all experiments. Protein samples for NMR experiments were prepared in either D2O buffer or 90% H2O, 10% D2O buffer solutions containing 100 mm potassium phosphate at pH 5.5 (direct meter readings from an Orion 720A pH meter using a standardized calomel combination microelectrode uncorrected for any isotope effects). Samples in D2O were prepared by at least five isotope exchanges of the protein solution in H2O with D2O buffered at pH 5.5. The isotope exchanges were carried out in either Centricon or Centriprep tubes (both from Amicon, Inc.) at 4 °C. All NMR samples contain ∼1.5 mm protein as determined by electronic absorption spectroscopy for the Soret absorbance at 398 nm and the reported absorption coefficient of 91,200m−1 cm−1 (65Gonzalez-Vergara E. Ales D.C. Goff H.M. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 335-348Google Scholar). The cyanide adducts of the protein were prepared by the addition of a 10–20% molar excess of cyanide from a freshly made 500 mm stock solution of KCN in 99.9% D2O. Manganese titration experiments were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. CPO was dialyzed against 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 5.5, and 10 mm EDTA twice overnight, followed by three dialyzes against 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 5.5, to remove EDTA from the sample. CPO (16 μm) is placed in both the sample and reference cuvettes. Under gentle stirring, aliquots of 50 mm MnSO4 solution were added to the sample with 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 30, 40, 50, and 60 equivalents of Mn2+ per enzyme equivalent. At the same time, an equal amount of buffer was added to the reference cuvette to compensate for any dilution effects. UV-visible spectra were obtained in the range of 250–750 nm. EPR experiments were carried out on a 95-GHz (W-band) spectrometer at room temperature. Spectra were obtained on ∼2 mm protein samples in 100 mmKH2PO4, pH 5.5. For Mn(II) binding studies, CPO was first dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm EDTA twice overnight. After removal of excess EDTA, Mn(II) was titrated into CPO under gentle stirring at 4 °C. The samples were then subjected to repeated dilution and concentration in a Centriprep concentrator to remove any free and adventitiously bound Mn(II). Instrument settings used for the experiments were as follows: microwave frequency = 95 GHz, modulation amplitude = 32.4 G, and microwave power = 1.00 milliwatts. Proton NMR spectra of both native and cyanide-bound forms of CPO were recorded at 25 °C on a Varian Unity 600 FT NMR spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 599.97 MHz. The residual solvent signal was suppressed with either the super WEFT method (66Inubushi T. Becker E.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 51: 128Google Scholar) or presaturation during relaxation delay. Chemical shift values were referenced to the residual HDO signal at 4.76 ppm. Variable temperature experiments were carried out on a Varian Unity-Inova 500 FT NMR spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 499.77 MHz. The reference chemical shift of the residual HDO signal was calculated according to the relationship of δT = δ25 − 0.012 (T − 25), where δT is the chemical shift of HDO at temperature Tin °C, and δ25 is the chemical shift of HDO at 25 °C (67Pierattelli R. Banci L. Turner D.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 320-329Google Scholar). A value of 4.76 ppm rather than 4.81 ppm (67Pierattelli R. Banci L. Turner D.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 320-329Google Scholar) was used for δ25 to match the previous NMR studies of CPO (54Dugad L.B. Wang X. Wang C.C. Lukat G.S. Goff H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1651-1655Google Scholar). Phase-sensitive NOESY spectra for the cyanide-bound derivative of CPO were acquired at 25 °C with mixing times ranging from 1.5 to 35 ms. Typical NOESY spectra were collected with 256 experiments in the F1 dimension using the hypercomplex method of States et al.(68States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). In general, 400 scans were accumulated for each F1 experiment, which was acquired with 4096 complex points in the F2 dimension over a spectral width of 27 or 60 kHz. The residual solvent signal in all NOESY experiments was suppressed using a 200-ms presaturation with a weak decoupler power. NOESY spectra with mixing times of 3 ms or less were collected with the incorporation of the super WEFT sequence (66Inubushi T. Becker E.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 51: 128Google Scholar) to suppress the intense diamagnetic signals from the protein matrix and the residual signal from the solvent. Clean TOCSY (69Griesinger C. Otting G. Wuethrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Scopus (1197) Google Scholar) spectra of CPOCN were recorded at both 500 and 600 MHz over different spectral windows using 4096 F2 points and 256 complex F1 points of 320–400 scans. Solvent suppression was achieved by a 200-ms direct saturation during the relaxation delay period. Various mixing times (2, 10, 30, and 40 ms) were used to allow effective spin lock for protons with different relaxation properties. All two-dimensional data were processed on a Dell Dimension 8200 PC with a Pentium 4 processor using Felix 2001 (Accelrys, Inc.). Various apodization functions were employed to emphasize protons with different relaxation properties. For example, apodization over 256, 512, and 1024 points was used to emphasize fast relaxing broad cross-peaks at the expense of resolution, whereas apodization over 2048 points is necessary to emphasize slowly relaxing cross-peaks. All two-dimensional data were zero-filled to obtain 2048 × 2048 matrices as required by the large hyperfine shift dispersion exhibited by the paramagnetic nature of this protein. The structure of CPO was examined on either a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 Extreme workstation using Quanta (Accelrys) or a Dell Dimension 8200 computer using ViewerLite (Accelrys) to visualize the crystal coordinates supplied by the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (6Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1367-1377Google Scholar). Generally, atom separations are reported as distances between protons of interest with the exception of methyl protons, where methyl carbons are used for distance measurements. The proton NMR spectrum of the native ferric high spin CPO (data not shown) is essentially identical to the results reported previously (55Wang X. Goff H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 88-96Google Scholar, 57Goff H.M. Gonzalez-Vergara E. Bird M.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1007-1013Google Scholar). Because of the high spin nature of the native CPO, considerably broad resonances are observed in the NMR spectra that provide only limited information about the structural properties of the enzyme. Therefore, no further efforts were made to analyze the spectra of native CPO in this study. We have focused on the NMR spectral properties of the cyanide-bound, ferric low spin derivative of CPO. This protein form, although not physiologically active, has been the most favorable system on which paramagnetic NMR investigations are carried out (35Savenkova M.I. Satterlee J.D. Erman J.E. Siems W.F. Helms G.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12123-12131Google Scholar, 37de Ropp J.S. Sham S. Asokan A. Newmyer S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem.

Goff H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 63-69Google Scholar). The short electronic relaxation times and large magnetic anisotropy of the low spin peroxidase cyanide complexes give much sharper and better resolved signals in their proton NMR spectra, providing much more information about the electronic, magnetic, and molecular structural properties of the heme pocket as compared with the native, high spin resting forms (27Satterlee J.D.

In addition, the cyanide adduct of heme peroxidases has been implicated as an important analogue for the active, oxidized low spin enzyme intermediates for which proton NMR spectroscopy is currently inapplicable due to the large resonance line widths (73Satterlee J.D. Erman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1091-1093Google Scholar). Although the CPO preparations used in this study were spectrophotometrically homogeneous, the 1H NMR spectra of the cyanide-bound CPO complex are NMR spectroscopically inhomogeneous due to the presence of two isozymes. This is reflected by the pairwise pattern for most of the hyperfine-shifted signals as shown in Fig.2. The approximately equal intensities of the two sets of signals suggest that the ratio of A and B isozymes is close to 1 in the current enzyme preparation. The spectral features are equivalent to that reported previously (54Dugad L.B. Wang X. Wang C.C. Lukat G.S. Goff H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1651-1655Google Scholar, 57Goff H.M. Gonzalez-Vergara E. Bird M.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1007-1013Google Scholar). No noticeable solvent isotope effect on the chemical shifts of heme protons was observed when spectra were recorded in H2O (Fig. 2, lower trace). This is anticipated, since the distal acid-base catalyst in CPO is a glutamic acid (6Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1367-1377Google Scholar) rather than a histidine as in other heme peroxidases (24Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13027-13036Google Scholar, 74Edwards S.L. Raag R. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 750-754Google Scholar, 75Gajhede M. Schuller D.J.

The proton/deuteron exchange on the Nε atom of the distal histidine has been shown to be responsible for the observed solvent effect on heme resonances in several heme peroxidases (36Wang X. Lu Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9146-9157Google Scholar, 53Thanabal V. De Ropp J.S. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 3027-3035Google Scholar, 72Banci L. Bertini I. Pease E.A. Tien M. Turano P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10009-10017Google Scholar). The spectral features of CPOCN display a high degree of similarity to that of other heme peroxidase cyanide derivatives (59Bertini I. Turano P. Vila A.J. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2833-2932Google Scholar). The four intense signals with integrated intensities of three protons each in the downfield region are typical of heme methyl groups. They have been tentatively assigned to the two heme methyls (5- and 1- or 8- and 3-CH3) for the two isozymes (54Dugad L.B. Wang X. Wang C.C. Lukat G.S. Goff H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1651-1655Google Scholar). Other resonances with intensities of one proton each in the downfield region represent protons from other heme substituents and those from amino acid residues in the proximal and distal heme pocket. The resolved upfield spectral region displays several single-proton resonances and a few multiproton signals. Previous work on both heme model compounds and a number of heme peroxidases have firmly concluded that this spectral region encompasses the resonances from β-protons of the heme vinyl and propionate groups as well as those from some of the amino acid residues near the heme center (53Thanabal V.

Here we use antisense-oligonucleotide inhibition of Barx2 expression in limb bud cell culture to show that Barx2 is required for myotube formation. Moreover, overexpression of Barx2 accelerates the fusion of MyoD-positive limb bud cells and C2C12 myoblasts. However, overexpression of Barx2 does not induce ectopic MyoD expression in either limb bud cultures or in multipotent C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells, and does not induce fusion of C3H10T1/2 cells. These results suggest that Barx2 acts downstream of MyoD. To test this hypothesis, we isolated the Barx2 gene promoter and identified DNA regulatory elements that might control Barx2expression during myogenesis. The proximal promoter of theBarx2 gene contained binding sites for several factors involved in myoblast differentiation including MyoD, myogenin, serum response factor, and myocyte enhancer factor 2. Co-transfection experiments showed that binding sites for both MyoD and serum response factor are necessary for activation of the promoter by MyoD and myogenin.

Ordahl C.P. Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1995; 191: 381-396Google Scholar). Several types of transcription factors control the specification and differentiation of skeletal myoblasts within these condensations. Critical among these are four basic helix-loop-helix myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs)1: MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4, each of which binds to E-box sequences in the promoters of skeletal muscle genes (see Ref. 2Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Google Scholar for review). Each of the four MRFs can induce skeletal muscle differentiation when expressed in nonmuscle cells (3Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Google Scholar, 4Braun T. Buschhausen-Denker G. Bober E. Tannich E. Arnold H.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 701-709Google Scholar, 5Rhodes S.J. Konieczny S.F.

A. 1990; 87: 1089-1093Google Scholar). However, during normal skeletal muscle development, the MRFs function in a hierarchical fashion: MyoD and Myf5 are involved in myoblast specification, whereas myogenin and MRF4 control the terminal differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes (8Dedieu S. Mazeres G. Cottin P. Brustis J.J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 235-241Google Scholar, 9Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Google Scholar). MyoD also promotes myoblast differentiation by inducing the expression of myogenin and MEF (myocyte enhancer factor) 2 family proteins. In addition, several homeobox genes, including Msx1, Pax3, and Pax7 influence the specification of myoblasts by regulating the expression of particular MRFs (10Epstein J.A. Lam P. Jepeal L. Maas R.L. Shapiro D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11719-11722Google Scholar, 11Schafer K. Braun T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 213-216Google Scholar, 12Houzelstein D. Auda-Boucher G. Cheraud Y. Rouaud T. Blanc I. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M.E. Fontaine-Perus J. Robert B. Development. 1999; 126: 2689-2701Google Scholar). However, few homeobox genes have been described that act downstream of MRFs or that influence myotube fusion directly without influencing the expression of MRFs. One component of the morphogenetic program specified by homeobox genes is the control of cell adhesion, a process that is essential to condensation, migration, and fusion of cells in several developmental contexts (13Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 337-352Google Scholar, 14Andrew D.J. Scott M.P. New Biol. 1992; (15-May): 4Google Scholar). Barx1 and Barx2 are two closely related homeobox proteins that were found in separate efforts to identify factors that control the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (15Tissier-Seta J.-P. Mucchielli M.-L. Mark M. Mattei M.-G. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 3-15Google Scholar, 16Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.H. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we discovered Barx2 and showed that it is expressed in precise patterns during mouse embryonic development in the nervous system, neural crest-derived craniofacial structures, lung buds, and limb mesenchyme (16Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.H. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Google Scholar). More recently, other researchers have shown that chicken and murine Barx2 variants are expressed in both skeletal and smooth muscle (17Smith D.M. Tabin C.J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 203-206Google Scholar, 18Herring B.P. Kriegel A.M. Hoggatt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14482-14489Google Scholar). For example, the chicken Barx2 homologue (Barx2b) is expressed in the early myotome and persists after differentiation of muscle groups in the limb, neck, and cloaca (17Smith D.M. Tabin C.J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 203-206Google Scholar). In addition, Herring et al. (18Herring B.P. Kriegel A.M. Hoggatt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14482-14489Google Scholar) showed that murine Barx2 is expressed in adult skeletal muscle and smooth muscle-containing tissues. Barx2 is also expressed in C2C12 myoblasts, and its expression increases dramatically when myoblasts fuse to form myotubes (18Herring B.P. Kriegel A.M. Hoggatt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14482-14489Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest roles for Barx2 in both skeletal and smooth muscle development. In this study we examined the role of Barx2 in muscle development. Inhibition of Barx2 expression in limb bud cell cultures inhibits myotube formation, whereas overexpression of Barx2 accelerates the appearance of myotubes. However, overexpression of Barx2 does not induce ectopic MyoD expression in limb bud cultures, nor is it sufficient to specify a myoblast fate in multipotent C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells that do not express MyoD. These results suggest that Barx2 acts downstream of MyoD to promote myogenic differentiation but cannot substitute for MyoD function. In support of this conclusion, we found that both MyoD and myogenin can bind to and activate theBarx2 promoter in C2C12 myoblasts. In C3H10T1/2 cells overexpression of Barx2 induces a smooth muscle-like appearance with increased smooth muscle-α-actin expression and formation of stress fibers. Overall our data suggest two roles for Barx2 in muscle development: in MyoD-positive skeletal myoblasts Barx2 controls myotube fusion, whereas in MyoD-negative mesenchymal cells Barx2 may promote differentiation of other contractile phenotypes such as smooth muscle cells or myofibroblasts. Morpholino oligonucleotides (ODNs) that are antisense to a region of the Barx2 mRNA near the initiation codon were designed and synthesized by Gene Tools LLC. Control sense ODNs were also prepared. Dissociated mesenchymal cells were prepared from E10.5 mouse limb buds and 2 × 106cells were plated in 10-μl aliquots at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in CMRL-1066 (Invitrogen) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in four-well culture dishes. After 1 h incubation to allow the micromass cultures to adhere, sense and antisense ODNs were introduced using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured for an additional 24 h before fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde and staining with either anti-MyoD or anti-Barx2 antibodies as described below. Retroviral vectors were constructed that contain either full-length mouse Barx2 cDNA or a cDNA fragment that encodes the homeodomain, Barx basic region, and COOH-terminal activation domain (HD-BBR-C) (19Edelman D.B. Meech R. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21737-21745Google Scholar). A control retroviral vector was constructed that contains the green fluorescent protein gene. The retroviral vector was based on the murine embryonic stem cell virus with modifications as described previously (20Owens G.C. Mistry S.K. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 1044-1048Google Scholar). The vector contains a truncated version of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter flanked by the chicken lysozyme insulator sequence, driving expression of the green fluorescent protein or Barx2 cDNAs. Retroviral particles were packaged in COS1 cells as described previously (21Edelman G.M. Meech R. Owens G.C. Jones F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3038-3043Google Scholar). Supernatant containing retroviral particles was collected after 48 h, filtered, and used to infect primary limb bud cells. Aliquots of 2 × 106 dissociated E10.5 mouse limb bud cells were incubated with 2 ml of filtered retroviral supernatant for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were plated in micromass conditions as described above, incubated for 1 h, and then supplemented with 200 μl of CMRL-1066 containing 10% FBS and 200 μl of retroviral supernatant. After 24 h the medium was changed to CMRL-1066 containing 2% FBS and the cells were cultured for a further 24 h. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and either photographed at ×10 magnification using phase-contrast optics, or stained with anti-MyoD antibodies as described below. Primary limb bud cultures and C3H10T1/2 cell cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized for 1 min with ice-cold acetone. Cultures were then stained with polyclonal antibodies to either Barx2 or MyoD (Santa Cruz), or with monoclonal antibodies to smooth muscle (SM)-α-actin (Sigma) at 1:200 dilutions. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with either fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine (Molecular Probes). 1 × 107 C2C12 cells were electroporated with either 10 μg of linearized Barx2/pcDNA3 expression vector or pcDNA3 control plasmid. The Barx2 expression plasmid contains an in-frame NH2-terminal Myc tag and was described previously (16Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.H. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Google Scholar). Cells were selected for 14 days with 1 mg/ml G418 to establish a population of cells that carried the plasmid at varying integration sites. Cells were tested for expression of Barx2 after 3–4 passages by Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-PCR. Experiments were performed with low passage stocks, as Barx2 levels declined significantly after six passages. To examine differentiation of the transfected C2C12 cells, cultures were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum and examined for myotubes at 24, 48, and 96 h. At 48 h, the cultures were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and photographed at ×5 magnification using phase-contrast optics. To examine protein expression in pcBarx2- and pcDNA3-transfected C2C12 cultures, proliferating cells were harvested at 80% confluence and lysed in a hypotonic buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (22Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6423Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and 20-μg aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen), and blotted using either polyclonal antibodies to Barx2 (Santa Cruz) or monoclonal antibodies to SM-α-actin, β-actin, or desmin (Sigma). Blots were developed using chemiluminescent substrate (Novex) and autoradiographed. The intensity of the protein bands was determined by densitometry using NIH Image software and a ratio of either SM-α-actin or desmin protein to β-actin protein was determined for each sample. The average increase in SM-α-actin expression was determined from three replicate experiments. The murineBarx2 gene was isolated from a 129/SvJ murine genomic BACmid library in the pveloBAC vector after screening with a PCR probe derived from the 5′ end of the Barx2 cDNA sequence (Genome Systems Inc). Several overlapping restriction fragments containing theBarx2 gene were mapped using Southern blot analysis and sequenced. Barx2promoter/luciferase reporter constructs were generated in the promoterless pGL3basic vector (Promega). The longest promoter construct contained a 1812-base pair KpnI-SacI fragment from the 5′ end of the murine Barx2 gene. Additional reporter plasmids containing truncated versions of the Barx2promoter, or internal deletions of promoter regions, were generated by cleavage at restriction sites or by PCR amplification. Mutation of the E-box element (E2) and the CArG box/SRE within the 0.44-kbBarx2 promoter construct was performed using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Synthetic promoter constructs were prepared by cloning oligonucleotides corresponding to a 58-bp segment of theBarx2 promoter (referred to here as the myogenic regulatory region (MRR)) into a modified version of the pGL3basic vector containing a minimal TATA box promoter and initiator sequence (21Edelman G.M. Meech R. Owens G.C. Jones F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3038-3043Google Scholar). In addition, two mutant versions of the MRR were generated in which either the E2 element or the CArG box/SRE were mutated. The sequences of these oligonucleotides with the E-box and CArG box motifs shown in bold, are as follows: MRR 5′-gctccgcacctggccctgcaggaagtgcgcgctgattgacagctgcggtgtcccaaaaaggct-3′; ΔE2 5′-gctccgcacctggccctgcaggaagtgcgcgctgattgagtcctgcggtgtcccaaaaaggct-3′; ΔCArG box 5′-gctccgcacctggccctgcaggaagtgcgcgctgattgacagctgcggtgttttcaaaaattct-3′. To construct the MyoD and myogenin expression plasmids, we first isolated full-length cDNAs from E14 embryonic mouse limb RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The cDNAs were cloned into a modified version of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) that contained an NH2-terminal Myc epitope tag. Proteins of the appropriate molecular weights were produced by in vitro translation using the Promega tnt coupled transcription/translation kit. C3H10T1/2 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% FBS and antibiotics. Both cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. C3H10T1/2 cells were placed in 6-well tissue culture plates at an initial density of 1 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 0.5 μg of each luciferase reporter construct. C2C12 cells were placed in 24-well tissue culture plates at an initial density of 1 × 104 cells/well and co-transfected with 200 ng of each luciferase reporter construct and 200 ng of each pcDNA3 expression plasmid. All transfections used FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and included the LacZ reporter CMVβgal (Clontech) at one-tenth of the total DNA amount to provide an internal reference for transfection efficiency. Cellular transfection and assay conditions were otherwise as described previously (21Edelman G.M. Meech R. Owens G.C. Jones F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3038-3043Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in duplicate and the data shown were derived from at least three independent experiments. For co-transfection of C3H10T1/2 cells with the pEYFP1 plasmid (Clontech) and pcDNA3, pcBarx2, or pcMyoD plasmids, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates and transfected with 2 μg of each plasmid using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized that corresponded to each of the two E-box elements, and the CArG box/serum response element (SRE) from the murineBarx2 gene. In addition, mutant versions of these sequences were designed in which the core motifs were disrupted. Double-stranded probes were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (DuPont). Probes were purified by elution from an 8% polyacrylamide gel and their specific activity was determined. 25,000 cpm (∼10 fmol) of each probe was used in gel mobility shift experiments with C2C12 cell nuclear extracts, orin vitro translated proteins, as described previously (19Edelman D.B. Meech R. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21737-21745Google Scholar). C2C12 cell extracts were prepared from proliferating C2C12 myoblasts cultured in high serum conditions (20% FBS) or from myotubes that were prepared by culture in low serum conditions (2% horse serum) for 4 days. Although C2C12 cells have been reported to differentiate in as little as 24 h after serum withdrawal, the slow rate of differentiation of our C2C12 cells is consistent with the known variation in the differentiation capacity of different stocks of C2C12 cells (23Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Google Scholar). 2The Blau Lab Homepage www.stanford.edu/group/blau/. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (22Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6423Google Scholar). For semiquantitative gel shift experiments, equal amounts of C2C12 nuclear protein from C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes were used in each binding reaction. Relative binding of the protein to the E-box probes was determined by measuring the intensity of the probe-protein complexes formed in gel mobility-shift experiments using a PhosphorImager (Amerhsam Biosciences). The relative binding data shown in Fig. 6 were derived from four independent experiments using different C2C12 extract preparations. To determine whether Barx2 is involved in the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts, we inhibited Barx2 expression in primary myoblasts using morpholino antisense ODNs and then examined their ability to form myotubes. Morpholino ODNs are RNase H-independent, resistant to nucleases, and have a good targeting predictability (24Summerton J. Weller D. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 187-195Google Scholar, 25Summerton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 141-158Google Scholar). For this study, limb bud mesenchymal cells from E10.5 mouse embryos were cultured in micromass conditions; these micromass cultures have been shown to contain cells that are committed to either a myoblast or chondrocyte fate (26Dienstman S.R. Biehl J. Holtzer S. Holtzer H. Dev. Biol. 1974; 39: 83-95Google Scholar). The limb buds were dissected, dissociated, and cultured in low serum under micromass conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cultures were treated immediately after plating with either Barx2 antisense ODNs or control sense ODNs and examined 24 h later for formation of myotubes and for expression of Barx2 and MyoD. As shown in Fig. 1, cultures treated with ODNs antisense to Barx2 showed negligible expression of Barx2 (Fig. 1,top right panel) and formed few if any myotubes within the 24-h culture period. Many cells showed nuclear expression of MyoD, however, these cells were not fused and did not show the characteristic elongated nuclei of myotubes (Fig. 1, bottom right panel). In contrast, cultures that were treated with the sense ODNs contained many cells that expressed Barx2 and MyoD and that were fused into multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1, left panels). These results indicate that Barx2 expression is required for myoblasts to differentiate into myotubes in culture. Immunohistochemical staining showed that Barx2 antisense-treated cultures do not express Barx2, but retain appreciable, albeit diffuse, expression of MyoD. The observation that MyoD staining in antisense-treated cultures is diffuse relative to the control cultures may be due in part to the condensed and elongated morphology of nuclei in myotubes. To determine whether overexpression of Barx2 can promote myotube formation, a retroviral system was used to overexpress Barx2 proteins in limb bud cultures. Micromass cultures were infected with retroviral constructs that express either full-length Barx2 protein or a fragment of Barx2 containing the homeodomain, Barx basic region (BBR), and the carboxyl-terminal domain (Barx2/HDBBRC). The Barx2/HDBBRC fragment contains the DNA binding and transactivation domains of Barx2 and was previously shown to activate the promoter of the Barx2 target gene N-CAM, which is a cell adhesion molecule known to influence myotube fusion (19Edelman D.B. Meech R. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21737-21745Google Scholar, 27Dickson G. Peck D. Moore S.E. Barton C.H. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 348-351Google Scholar). Control cultures were infected with a retroviral construct expressing green fluorescent protein. The cells were cultured in micromass conditions (28DeLise A.M. Stringa E. Woodward W.A. Mello M.A. Tuan R.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 137: 359-375Google Scholar) for 24 h in media containing 10% serum to allow integration of the virus into dividing cells and the expression of Barx2 proteins. The cultures were then incubated for a further 24 h in media containing 2% serum to induce myotube formation. As shown in Fig. 2, micromass cultures that were infected with retroviral constructs expressing either full-length Barx2 (not shown) or the Barx2/HDBBRC fragment (Fig. 2,top right panel) formed many myotubes within 24 h of culture. In contrast, cells infected with the control retrovirus produced very few myotubes within 24 h (Fig. 2, top left panel). Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to MyoD revealed that only MyoD-positive cells fused to form myotubes. Thus Barx2 cannot promote myotube fusion in the absence of MyoD (Fig. 2,middle panels). Moreover, when the number of MyoD-positive cells was counted in three separate fields, their numbers did not change after infection with the Barx2 construct (data not shown). Thus Barx2 does not induce ectopic expression of MyoD. Together these results indicate that Barx2 acts downstream of, but does not substitute for, MyoD activity. The myotubes that formed after infection of limb bud cells with the Barx2/HDBBRC-expressing retrovirus also showed increased expression of SM-α-actin, an early marker of skeletal muscle differentiation (29Springer M.L. Ozawa C.R. Blau H.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 51: 177-186Google Scholar, 30Babai F. Musevi-Aghdam J. Schurch W. Royal A. Gabbiani G. Differentiation. 1990; 44: 132-142Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, bottom panels). The results of both Barx2 inhibition and overexpression experiments in primary limb bud cultures suggest that Barx2 acts downstream of MyoD to promote the differentiation of cells that are already committed to the myoblast fate. To formally test whether Barx2 acts upstream or downstream of MyoD, we compared the effects of overexpressing Barx2 in MyoD-positive C2C12 myoblasts and in MyoD-negative C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells. A population of C2C12 myoblasts that overexpress Barx2 was generated by stable transfection of a pcBarx2 expression plasmid, and a control population was established by stable transfection of the empty pcDNA3 vector. Overexpression of Barx2 protein in pcBarx2-transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-Barx2 antibodies (see Fig.3 D). The effect of Barx2 overexpression on myotube formation was examined by plating pcBarx2-transfected and control cells at the same initial density and culturing in media containing 2% horse serum. Under these conditions, cultures of pcDNA3-transfected C2C12 cells differentiated relatively slowly, forming myotubes after 4 days (Fig. 3 A,left panel). In contrast, C2C12 cells that were transfected with the pcBarx2 plasmid showed significantly accelerated differentiation, forming myotubes within 2 days of serum withdrawal (Fig. 3 A, right panel). These results are similar to those obtained in primary limb bud cultures and provide further evidence that expression of Barx2 promotes the differentiation of MyoD-expressing myoblasts. To test whether Barx2 is also involved in myoblast determination, we next examined the effect of overexpressing Barx2 in the mesenchymal progenitor cell line C3H10T1/2 that does not express MyoD. Ectopic expression of MyoD was previously shown to convert C3H10T1/2 cells into skeletal myoblasts that fuse into myotubes when cultured in low serum conditions (31Aurade F. Pinset C. Chafey P. Gros F. Montarras D. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 185-192Google Scholar). If Barx2 were able to induce the expression of MRFs such as MyoD it may be expected to convert C3H10T1/2 cells into myoblasts. C3H10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with either the pcBarx2 plasmid, a pcDNA expression plasmid containing the MyoD cDNA (pcMyoD), or the empty vector. To identify transfected cells, a plasmid encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) was co-transfected with the expression vectors. The cells were then incubated in media containing 2% horse serum and the formation of myotubes by the EYFP-labeled cells was examined over the next 4 days. Consistent with previous reports (31Aurade F. Pinset C. Chafey P. Gros F. Montarras D. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 185-192Google Scholar), ectopic MyoD expression induced myotube formation in nearly all of the transfected cells after 4 days of serum deprivation (Fig. 3 B, right panel). In contrast, Barx2-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells did not form myotubes (Fig.3 B, middle panel). These results indicate that, unlike MyoD, Barx2 is not sufficient to specify a skeletal myoblast fate when expressed in multipotent mesenchymal cells. Interestingly, when pcBarx2-transfected and control pcDNA3-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells were grown in high serum conditions, pcBarx2-transfected cells showed morphological changes that are consistent with the differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or myofibroblasts, including cell spreading and formation of stress fibers (Fig. 3 C) (32Worth N.F. Rolfe B.E. Song J. Campbell G.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 49: 130-145Google Scholar, 33Darby I. Skalli O. Gabbiani G. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 21-29Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 cells and other fibroblastic cell lines have been previously reported to differentiate into both SMCs and myofibroblasts in response to particular signals (34Bostrom K. Tintut Y. Kao S.C. Stanford W.P. Demer L.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 210-221Google Scholar, 35Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Google Scholar, 36Pan D. Zhe X. Jakkaraju S. Taylor G.A. Schuger L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1349-1358Google Scholar). Using immunohistochemistry, we found that Barx2-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells contained increased amounts of SM-α-actin, which is also consistent with these cellular phenotypes (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that in the absence of MyoD expression, Barx2 influences the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into contractile cell types other than skeletal myoblasts. In these studies, Barx2 overexpression increased the expression of SM-α-actin in all three cellular systems tested: primary myoblasts, C2C12 myoblasts, and C3H10T1/2 cells. To quantify this effect, we examined the expression of two cytoskeletal proteins that are regulated during myogenesis, SM-α-actin and desmin, in Barx2- and pcDNA3-transfected C2C12 cells. Quantitative Western blotting was used to measure the amount of SM-α-actin, desmin, and β-actin protein in extracts of cells grown in high serum conditions (Fig.3 D). After normalization to β-actin, the amount of SM-α-actin was, on average, 1.7-fold higher in pcBarx2-transfected cells than in pcDNA3-transfected cells in three separate experiments. In contrast the expression of desmin did not change significantly (Fig. 3 D). This indicates that Barx2 can activate particular genes that are associated with the differentiation of multiple contractile cell types. Collectively our studies in primary limb bud cultures and cell lines suggest two functions for Barx2 in muscle differentiation. In committed myoblasts that express MyoD, Barx2 promotes, and is required for, formation of myotubes, whereas in multipotent mesenchymal cells that lack MyoD, Barx2 may induce a smooth muscle or myofibroblast phenotype. The results of the studies described above suggest that Barx2 acts downstream of Myo"

Here we report the identification of a novel testicular orphan nuclear receptor-4 (TR4)-associated protein (TRA16) that is mainly localized in the nucleus of cells as a repressor to suppress TR4-mediated transactivation. The suppression of TR4-mediated transactivation is selective because TRA16 shows only a slight influence on the transactivation of androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor. Sequence analysis shows that TRA16 is a novel gene with 139 amino acids in an open reading frame with a molecular mass of 16 kDa, which did not match any published gene sequences. Mammalian two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation assays both demonstrate that TRA16 can interact strongly with TR4. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggests that TRA16 may suppress TR4-mediated transactivation via decreased binding between the TR4 protein and the TR4 response element on the target gene(s). Furthermore, TRA16 can also block the interaction between TR4 and TR4 ligand-binding domain through interacting with TR4-DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains. These unique suppression mechanisms suggest that TRA16 may function as a novel repressor to selectively suppress the TR4-mediated transactivation.

Sequence analysis shows that TR4 has 615 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kDa and has a very high homology with TR2 orphan receptor (9Chang C. Kokontis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

On the other hand, TR4 also can function as enhancer to induce the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-α and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) (12Young W.J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol.

The detailed mechanisms of how TR4 can differentially modulate its target genes, however, remain unclear. Whether some of those mechanisms may involve the association of co-repressors also remains unclear.Here we show the isolation and characterization of a novel protein, TR4-associated protein (TRA16), localized in the nucleus that may function as a repressor for suppression of TR4-mediated transactivation via decreased binding between TR4 protein and TR4 response element (TR4RE) and blockage of TR4 dimerization.DISCUSSIONNuclear hormone receptors comprise a huge family of transcriptional factors that represent important regulators in cellular proliferation, differentiation, development, and homeostasis (7Mangelsdorf D.J.

Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of nuclear hormone receptors has been generally recognized to be modulated by co-activators or co-repressors (28Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

To date, many co-activators have been identified for various nuclear receptors, but relatively fewer co-repressors have been isolated and characterized.In general, nuclear receptor co-activators (such as p160/SRC, p300/CBP, and P/CAF) act through an inherent histone acetyltransferase activity to increase the level of histone acetylation and enhance the transcriptional activity of ligand bound receptors (30Chen H.

Their data suggested that multiple signal transduction pathways regulate the actions of both N-CoR and SMRT.On the other hand, there are some co-repressors that can exert their suppression on nuclear receptors via interfering with the binding between nuclear receptors and their DNA response elements. For example, a TR uncoupling protein may inhibit TR and retinoic acid receptor-mediated transactivation via binding to the TR hinge region and the N-terminal portion of the ligand-binding domain (50Burris T.P. Nawaz Z. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9525-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Another co-repressor, calreticulin, was suggested to be able to inhibit the transactivation of glucocorticoid receptor and AR via interruption of the binding between receptors and DNA response elements (51Burns K.

Cyclin D1, a cell cycle regulating protein that functions as an AR co-repressor, may rely on its cell cycle regulating function to suppress AR (53Knudsen K.E. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2297-2301PubMed Google Scholar). There are also several proteins, such as a small ubiquitous nuclear co-repressor that may function as nuclear receptor co-repressor via forming complexes with N-CoR (54Zamir I. Dawson J. Lavinsky R.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Finally, Mathuret al. (55Mathur M. Tucker P.W. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2298-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) found that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor could suppress TR and retinoid X receptor mediated transcription through a novel polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor/Sin3-mediated pathway to recruit HDACs to the receptor DBD.For the suppression of TR4-mediated transactivation, early reports suggested that AR could also function as repressor to interrupt the binding between TR4 and TR4 DNA response elements (16Lee Y.F.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel TR4 repressor, TRA16, whose sequence was not previously reported. The amino acid sequence comparison also shows that TRA16 lacks the classic hydrophobic core motif (I/L)XXII of other repressors. The other interesting characteristic was the distribution of TRA16. We also detected the expression of TRA16 mRNA level in different cell lines with Northern blot assay (data not shown) with the same result as immunocytofluorescence assays. TRA16 expression in human lung cancer cell line H1299 cells was found to be higher than in normal human lung tissue, suggesting that TRA16 could play roles in some kinds of cancer tissues. TSA showed little effect on the TRA16-mediated suppression of TR4 transactivation, suggesting that HDAC activity may not play any roles for TRA16. Instead, we demonstrated that TRA16 may suppress TR4 transactivation via either interruption of the interaction between TR4 and its DNA response element or as competitor to block the interaction between TR4-DL and TR4-LBD. Together, our data suggest that TRA16 may function as a novel repressor to suppress TR4 function. Steroid hormones play important physiological roles in cellular differentiation, development, and homeostasis, which function through binding to the specific receptors that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily (1Chang C.

The superfamily members may act as transcriptional activators or repressors for the modulation of gene expression in a wide variety of biological processes via binding to the hormone response element that is located mainly on the 5′ promoter of target genes (2Evans R.M.

The human testis orphan receptor (TR4),1 a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, was initially isolated from human prostate, testis, and hypothalamus cDNA libraries (8Chang C. Lopes da Silva S.

Sequence analysis shows that TR4 has 615 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kDa and has a very high homology with TR2 orphan receptor (9Chang C. Kokontis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization indicate that TR4 was expressed in a variety of tissues, including the central neural system (habenula, hippocampal pyramidal cell, and granule cells of both hippocampus and cerebellum) and peripheral organs (most abundantly expressed in spermatocytes of testis, with lower amounts in adrenal cortex, spleen, thyroid, prostate, and pituitary gland) (8Chang C.

For example, it has been shown that TR4 can function as repressor to suppress the retinoic acid receptor-, retinoid X receptor-, vitamin D receptor-, androgen receptor (AR)-, and estrogen receptor-mediated transactivation (14Lee Y.F.

Commuun. 2001; 285: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TR4 could suppress the expression of the steroid 21-hydroxylase gene, which belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily and is one of the key enzymes in biosynthesis of adrenal steroid hormones, leading to the production of cortisol and aldosterone. On the other hand, TR4 also can function as enhancer to induce the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-α and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) (12Young W.J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol.

Bartunek P. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 563-572PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that the TR4 is an important regulator of myeloid progenitor cell proliferation and development. The hormone response element for the TR4 is AGGTCA with a variety of direct repeats (DRs) (16Lee Y.F. Shyr C.R. Thin T.H. Lin W.J. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The detailed mechanisms of how TR4 can differentially modulate its target genes, however, remain unclear. Whether some of those mechanisms may involve the association of co-repressors also remains unclear. Here we show the isolation and characterization of a novel protein, TR4-associated protein (TRA16), localized in the nucleus that may function as a repressor for suppression of TR4-mediated transactivation via decreased binding between TR4 protein and TR4 response element (TR4RE) and blockage of TR4 dimerization. DISCUSSIONNuclear hormone receptors comprise a huge family of transcriptional factors that represent important regulators in cellular proliferation, differentiation, development, and homeostasis (7Mangelsdorf D.J.

The transcriptional activity of nuclear hormone receptors has been generally recognized to be modulated by co-activators or co-repressors (28Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

To date, many co-activators have been identified for various nuclear receptors, but relatively fewer co-repressors have been isolated and characterized.In general, nuclear receptor co-activators (such as p160/SRC, p300/CBP, and P/CAF) act through an inherent histone acetyltransferase activity to increase the level of histone acetylation and enhance the transcriptional activity of ligand bound receptors (30Chen H.

The nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) and the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) also contain three repeated receptor interaction domains that include the conserved hydrophobic core motif (I/L)XXII, which can interact with unliganded nuclear receptors, such as retinoic acid receptor α, thyroid hormone receptor, and the orphan receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor I (37Perissi V.

Their data suggested that multiple signal transduction pathways regulate the actions of both N-CoR and SMRT. On the other hand, there are some co-repressors that can exert their suppression on nuclear receptors via interfering with the binding between nuclear receptors and their DNA response elements. For example, a TR uncoupling protein may inhibit TR and retinoic acid receptor-mediated transactivation via binding to the TR hinge region and the N-terminal portion of the ligand-binding domain (50Burris T.P. Nawaz Z. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9525-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Another co-repressor, calreticulin, was suggested to be able to inhibit the transactivation of glucocorticoid receptor and AR via interruption of the binding between receptors and DNA response elements (51Burns K.

Cyclin D1, a cell cycle regulating protein that functions as an AR co-repressor, may rely on its cell cycle regulating function to suppress AR (53Knudsen K.E. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2297-2301PubMed Google Scholar). There are also several proteins, such as a small ubiquitous nuclear co-repressor that may function as nuclear receptor co-repressor via forming complexes with N-CoR (54Zamir I. Dawson J. Lavinsky R.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Finally, Mathuret al. (55Mathur M. Tucker P.W. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2298-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) found that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor could suppress TR and retinoid X receptor mediated transcription through a novel polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor/Sin3-mediated pathway to recruit HDACs to the receptor DBD. For the suppression of TR4-mediated transactivation, early reports suggested that AR could also function as repressor to interrupt the binding between TR4 and TR4 DNA response elements (16Lee Y.F. Shyr C.R. Thin T.H. Lin W.J. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14724-14729Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel TR4 repressor, TRA16, whose sequence was not previously reported. The amino acid sequence comparison also shows that TRA16 lacks the classic hydrophobic core motif (I/L)XXII of other repressors. The other interesting characteristic was the distribution of TRA16. We also detected the expression of TRA16 mRNA level in different cell lines with Northern blot assay (data not shown) with the same result as immunocytofluorescence assays. TRA16 expression in human lung cancer cell line H1299 cells was found to be higher than in normal human lung tissue, suggesting that TRA16 could play roles in some kinds of cancer tissues. TSA showed little effect on the TRA16-mediated suppression of TR4 transactivation, suggesting that HDAC activity may not play any roles for TRA16. Instead, we demonstrated that TRA16 may suppress TR4 transactivation via either interruption of the interaction between TR4 and its DNA response element or as competitor to block the interaction between TR4-DL and TR4-LBD. Together, our data suggest that TRA16 may function as a novel repressor to suppress TR4 function. We thank Karen Wolf for preparation of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2091740421,"The 52-kDa protein, EshA, whose expression is controlled developmentally, is produced during the late growth phase of Streptomyces spp. We found that disruption of the eshA gene, which encodes the EshA protein, abolishes the aerial mycelium formation and streptomycin production in Streptomyces griseus when grown on an agar plate. The eshA disruptant KO-390 demonstrated a reduced amount of expression of the transcriptional activator strR, thus accounting for the failure to produce streptomycin. KO-390 was found to accumulate deoxynucleoside triphosphates at high levels, including dGTP, at late growth phase. The accumulation of dGTP was a cause for the impaired ability of KO-390 to produce aerial mycelium, because the ability to form aerial mycelium was completely repaired by addition of decoyinine, an inhibitor of GMP synthetase. The accumulation of dNTP in KO-390 coincided with a reduced rate of DNA synthesis. The developmental time frame of these phenomena in KO-390 matched a burst of EshA expression in the wild-type strain. In contrast to S. griseus, the eshA disruption did not affect the ability for Streptomyces coelicolor to form aerial mycelium and did not result in the aberrant accumulation of dNTP accompanied by arrest of DNA synthesis, implying qualitative differences in addition to quantitative differences between the two EshA proteins. We propose that the S. griseus EshA protein somehow positively affects (or regulates) the replication of DNA in wild-type cells at late growth phase but leads to aberrant phenotypes in mutant cells due to the disturbed DNA replication. The EshA protein was found to exist as a multimer ( approximately 20-mers) creating a cubic-like structure with a diameter of 27 nm and located predominantly in cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2051337753,"The impact upon molecular structure of an additional point mutation adjacent to the existing E6V mutation in sickle cell hemoglobin was probed spectroscopically. The UV resonance Raman results show that the conformational consequences of mutating the salt bridge pair, βGlu7–βLys132, are dependent on which residue of the pair is modified. The βK132A mutants exhibit the spectroscopic signatures of the R → T state transition in both the “hinge” and “switch” regions of the α1β2 interface. Both singly and doubly mutated hemoglobin (Hb) βΕ7Α exhibit the switch region signature for the R → T quaternary state transition but not the hinge signature. The absence of this hinge region-associated quaternary change is the likely origin of the observed increased oxygen binding affinity for the Hb βΕ7Α mutants. The observed large decrease in the W3 α14β15 band intensity for doubly mutated Hb βΕ7Α is attributed to an enhanced separation in the A helix-E helix tertiary contact of the β subunits. The results for the Hb A βGlu7–βLys132 salt bridge mutants demonstrate that attaining the T state conformation at the hinge region of the α1β2 dimer interface can be achieved through different intraglobin pathways; these pathways are subject to subtle mutagenic manipulation at sites well removed from the dimer interface.

DeoxyHb S forms polymers in the erythrocyte, which leads to microvascular blockage, organ damage, and often premature death. Structure-based drug design requires knowledge of optimal polymer disruption sites. The specific interaction in the Hb S polymer involves the steric fit of the mutated hydrophobic β6 donor site in a hydrophobic acceptor site located in an adjacent Hb S tetramer. It is well known that the hydrophobicity and the stereospecificity of the donor site are essential to the initiation of the polymerization. Lesecq et al. (1Lesecq S. Baudin V. Kister J. Marden M.

Replacing the hydrophilic Glu β7(A4) residue with a hydrophobic Ala residue resulted in a decreased polymerization of the doubly mutated rHb βE6V/E7A. It was postulated (1Lesecq S. Baudin V.

These alterations of the A helix might result in a misfit between the donor and acceptor sites, which could explain the observed diminution in polymerization. It follows from this hypothesis that modifying the other partner of the salt bridge, βLys132(H10), should have similar consequences on polymerization (2Lesecq S. Baudin V. Kister J. Poyart C. Pagnier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15242-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Visible resonance Raman spectroscopy is very useful in providing detailed information relating to the influence of tertiary and quaternary structure upon specific heme-related vibrational degrees of freedom (3Asher S.

Additionally, UV resonance Raman spectroscopy (UVRR) provides information about vibrational modes of aromatic residues within the globin. UVRR studies of hemoglobin from several research groups have shown a consistent pattern of tertiary and quaternary structure shifts coupled to spectral changes in specific tyrosine and tryptophan bands (8Kitagawa T.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In particular and most significantly, spectral features have been clearly identified that reflect the key determinants of the quaternary state, specifically in the “hinge” (βTrp37) and “switch” (αTyr42) regions of the α1β2 interface. Band intensities also respond to the packing of the A helix against the E helix and to the integrity of the salt bridge-derived scaffolding that maintains interhelical separations, a feature that is indicative of different tertiary structures within a given quaternary structure. Thus, the UVRR technique allows us to couple modifications of both local and global elements of structure with observed functional changes. For example, Hb C (β6(A3) Glu → Lys) is yet another naturally occurring mutant of Hb A, which forms crystals in erythrocytes. UVRR spectroscopy, in conjunction with other spectroscopic techniques, has been used to show that the effect of the β6 mutation is communicated to both the A helices and the central cavity where effectors such as inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) bind (18Hirsch R.

Raman Spectrosc. 1998; 29: 963-968Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, UVRR spectroscopy is utilized to probe the conformational consequences of disrupting the salt bridge between βGlu7(A4) and βLys132(H10) through examination of the tryptophan W3 and tyrosine Y8 bands, which are reporter bands for Hb tertiary and quaternary structure. The results for singly and doubly mutated recombinant Hbs βE6V, βE7A, βK132A, βE6V/E7A, and βE6V/K132A are compared with those for both wild type and recombinant Hb A (Hb A and rHb A, respectively). The deoxygenated and CO derivatives of each Hb species are examined, as is the CO derivative in the presence of IHP. The UVRR results reveal the impact of the βGlu7–βLys132 salt bridge mutations on the positioning of the A helix and on the functioning of the quaternary β37 hinge, which suggest a molecular explanation for the macroscopic changes in polymerization and ligand binding for these mutants. The βE6V, βE7A, and βK132A mutations were introduced into the β-globin cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis using synthetic primers (Genset, France). The mutated β-globin subunits were produced as fusion proteins inEscherichia coli, using the expression vector pATPrcIIFXβ-globin (21Bihoreau M. Baudin V. Marden M. Lacaze N. Bohn B. Kister J. Schaad O. Dumoulin A. Edelstein S. Poyart C. Pagnier J. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After extraction and purification, the fusion proteins were cleaved by digestion with bovine coagulation factor Xa (22Nagai K. Thogersen H. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutation(s) was confirmed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the tryptic digests and amino acid analysis of the abnormal peptides. The purified β-subunits were folded in the presence of cyanhemin and the partner α-subunits prepared from wild type Hb A, to form the tetrameric Hb α2β2 (21Bihoreau M. Baudin V. Marden M. Lacaze N.

Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7252-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The folded recombinant tetrameric Hbs were purified by preparative isoelectrofocusing on Ultrodex dextran gel using Ampholine (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Electrophoretic studies included electrophoresis on cellulose acetate and analytical isoelectrofocusing of the recombinant Hbs. The Hb samples were all at a concentration of 0.5 mm heme in 50 mm Hepes at pH 7.35. 0.4 m sodium selenate was added as an internal standard, yielding a UVRR band at 834 cm−1. Where applicable, the IHP was 0.75 mm or six times the Hb tetrameric concentration. The data were collected on samples chilled to 10 ± 4 °C to minimize photodamage. An argon laser system, described elsewhere (20Juszczak L. Hirsch R. Nagel R. Friedman J. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1998; 29: 963-968Crossref Google Scholar), was used to generate the excitation wavelength of 228.9 nm with an incident laser power of 1.8 mW. Four 3-min acquisitions were accumulated for each ligation state of each Hb variant over a 820–1670 cm−1 frequency window. The UVRR data are averages of these four independent measurements. The measurements for the CO-ligated HbE6V/K132A with and without IHP were accumulated rather than averaged; the error bars are thus not shown in Fig. 4 for these species. The data frequency scale was calibrated with indene and toluene and is accurate to ±1 cm−1. The issue of spectral reproducibility was addressed in the following manner: 1) The absorption spectra were collected before and after exposure to the UV laser beam. 2) If absorption changes were noted, the sequential UVRR acquisitions were examined for evidence of band changes. 3) Acquisitions that showed substantial changes were rejected and not included in the final UVRR average spectra. That is, separate acquisitions that were consistent in peak intensity and frequency as well as band shape were included in the averaged spectra. Spectral data were truncated to a 1530–1650 cm−1 frequency window, and the intensity was normalized at the W3 band (∼1558 cm−1) for each set of spectra in Figs. 2 and 3. The software program Grams/32 AI, version 6.00 (Galactic Industries Corp., Salem, NH) was used to determine the Y8a and W3(α14β15) peak heights used in Table I (full width at half-maximum) using the subroutine, Peakstat, and for curve fits to the W3 band, from which band heights for the β37 shoulder at ∼1548 cm−1 were determined. All W3 bands were fit to two curves of 0.7 Lorentzian/0.3 Gaussian band shape as the vibrational signature for the α14 and β15 Trps is coincidental and cannot be resolved; the second curve is for the β37 Trp. All of the band intensities given in Table I and Fig. 4 were normalized against the selenate 834 cm−1 peak. The numerical errors listed in Table I and the error bars shown in Fig. 4 were determined from the normalized peak intensities of the independent component acquisitions used for each averaged UVRR spectrum as measured by the aforementioned Peakstat subroutine. Common spectral processing techniques include smoothing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (24Wang Y. Van Wart H. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 319-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); spectral smoothing, however, was not employed here.Figure 2W3 (∼1558 cm−1) and Y8 (∼1615 cm−1) UVRR bands for hemoglobin A (top panel, set a, wild type; set b, recombinant) and hemoglobin S (bottom panel, set a, wild type; set b, recombinant).

Open table in a new tab The changes in Hb globin structure that accompany ligation at the heme can be followed by UVRR spectroscopy because of the critical sites occupied by several of the UV-resonating Trp and Tyr residues. Two of these are highly responsive to quaternary structural changes: βTrp37 and αTyr42 are located in the hinge and switch regions of the α1β2 dimer interface, respectively. In addition, there is a tryptophan on the A helix of both the α (α14) and β (β15) subunits that provides a UVRR signature for the status of the packing distance between the A and E helices (25Wang D. Zhao X. Shen T.-J. Ho C. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 11197-11203Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For human wild type Hb A, the change in ferrous heme ligation state from fully ligated to fully deligated (deoxy) is accompanied by the R → T state quaternary structure transition. The conformational changes of the aromatic residues in the interface following the R → T state transition yield two major UVRR spectral changes. These are a ∼2-cm−1 increase in frequency of the Y8a band from ∼1615 to ∼1617 cm−1 and an intensity increase of ∼37% in the W3 shoulder (W3 β37) at 1549 cm−1 (7Wang D. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9940-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar).

Thus, the association of these small spectral changes with specific changes in hemoglobin structure and ligation state is both well documented and consistent. The UVRR spectra shown in Figs. 2 and3 have been truncated to highlight the 1530–1650 cm−1 frequency window. This spectral window contains the conformation-sensitive W3 and Y8a reporter bands. The W3 band at ∼1558 cm−1 has two contributions (9Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Hu X. Spiro T.G.

Soc. 1989; 111: 3457-3459Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The central feature that peaks at ∼1558 cm−1 is derived from the two A helix tryptophans (α14 and β15), whereas the R → T state sensitive shoulder at ∼1550 cm−1 originates from βTrp37. Intensity changes in the central peak of the W3 band at ∼1558 cm−1have been shown to originate from variations in the hydrogen bond between the A helix tryptophans and their hydrogen-bonding partners on the E helix (25Wang D. Zhao X. Shen T.-J. Ho C. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 11197-11203Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Increased and decreased intensities correlate with increases and decreases in hydrogen bond strength, respectively. Modulation of the hydrogen bond strength is attributed to changes in the distance between the two helices. The intensity for the ∼1550 cm−1 shoulder on the W3 band increases as the hinge region of the α1β2 interface undergoes an R → T state transition, reflecting the changes in the hydrogen bonding pattern of βTrp37 with αAsp94. Thus, the W3 band provides information on both the functionally important hinge region of the α1β2 interface and the packing of the A and E helices. The tyrosine-derived Y8a band at ∼1616 cm−1 shows a ∼1–2-cm−1 shift to higher frequency when liganded R-state Hb A is converted to the deoxy T state (9Rodgers K. Su S. Subramaniam S. Spiro T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29Su C. Park Y.D. Liu G. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3457-3459Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This frequency shift originates primarily from αTyr42 (13Hu X. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15701-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Nagai M. Wajcman H. Lahary A. Nakatsukasa T. Nagatomo S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Huang S. Peterson E.S. Ho C. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6197-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in the switch region of the α1β2 interface. The intensity of this band has been correlated with the integrity of the scaffolding supporting the H helices. The intensity of the UVRR spectra in each set in Figs. 2 and 3 have been normalized at the W3 peak to clarify the differences in the β37 shoulder at 1548 cm−1. Both wild type Hb A and rHb A (Fig.2, top panel, sets a and b, respectively) yield the well documented Y8a frequency increase (2.9 and 1.8 cm−1, respectively; TableI), and the W3 β37 band intensity increase (0.43 and 0.44, respectively; Table I) associated with the R → T state transition, as discussed above. The spectraldifference between the W3 β37 bands for the two hemoglobin ligation states is 1 order of magnitude above the noise level of the constituent spectral acquisitions. For both species of Hb A, ligation results in an increase of intensity for the W3 α14β15 band (Fig.4 a and Table I), whereas the Y8a band intensity increases for ligated wild type Hb A only (Fig.4 b and Table I). Addition of a 5-fold excess of the effector, IHP, to ligated forms of both Hb As results in an enhancement of the W3 β37 band intensity, which is indicative of a more T state-like hinge region, but apparently has little or no effect on the Y8a band position, which remains R state like (Fig. 2, top panel, sets a and b, and Table I). The addition of IHP has a large enhancement effect on the Y8a band intensities of both ligated Hb As (Fig. 4 b and Table I) and on the W3 α14β15 band intensity of wild type Hb A (Fig.4 a and Table I). The upshift in the Y8 band frequency and the W3 β37 band intensity increase accompanying the R → T state transition for both Hb As are also found in the UVRR results for wild type Hb S and rHb S (Fig. 2, bottom panel, sets a and b, respectively, and Table I). The W3 β37 band intensity increase for deoxy wild type Hb S is comparable (0.45) with that obtained for either species of deoxy Hb A (0.43–0.44), whereas the intensity increase obtained for deoxy rHb S is higher (0.53) (Table I). Conversely, ligation, which corresponds to the T → R state transition, results in intensity increases for both the W3 and Y8 bands of wild type Hb S (0.19 and 0.26, respectively; Table I) and for those of rHb S (0.13 for W3 and 0.17 for Y8a; Fig. 4 and Table I). Addition of IHP to wild type COHb S yields little, if any, decrease in the W3 band intensity (Fig.4 a and Table I) and an unchanged Y8 band intensity (Fig.4 b and Table I). For COrHb S, the addition of IHP results in an increase in the Y8a band (Fig. 4 b and Table I). The characteristic Y8a frequency upshift accompanying the R → T state transition is also manifest by rHb βE7A (Fig. 3, top panel, set a, and Table I). The usual W3 β37 intensity increase, however, is not found in the UVRR results for this rHb mutant (Fig. 3, top panel, set a, and TableI). The W3 α14β15 and Y8a band intensities for deoxy rHb βE7A are similar in magnitude to those of wild type deoxyHb A (Fig. 2, top panel, set a), whereas ligation to rHb βE7A yields a small decrease in the W3 α14β15 band intensity and no change in the Y8a band intensity (Fig. 4 and Table I). The addition of IHP to COrHb βE7A leads to intensity increases in the Y8a and W3 β37 bands: a 0.36 increase in Y8a relative to the Y8a band of deoxy rHbβE7A (TableI) and a 0.16 increase in the W3 β37 band, comparable with the 0.11 band increase found in the results for wild type COHb A + IHP (TableI). Under the same conditions, the W3 α14β15 band intensity has merely been restored to its deoxy value (Fig. 4 a and TableI). The UVRR results for rHb βE6V/E7A following the R → T state transition are similar to those for rHb βE7A; the Y8a frequency upshift occurs, but the W3 β37 band intensity increase does not (Fig.3, top panel, set b, and Table I). This double mutation results in the lowest deoxy W3 α14β15 and Y8a band intensities observed for this set of Hbs (Fig. 4). Ligation substantially increases the intensities of both bands (Fig. 4 and TableI). Addition of IHP to the ligated species has a small effect on the intensity of the W3 α14β15 band (Fig. 4 a) but results in a substantially enhanced W3 β37 band intensity (Fig. 3, top panel, set b, and Table I). The intensity of the Y8a band is minimally influenced by the addition of IHP to CO rHb βE6V/E7A (Fig. 4 b and Table I). The K132A mutation did not affect the Y8 band shift associated with the R → T state transition (Fig. 3, bottom panel,set a, and Table I). The W3 β37 band intensity increase associated with this transition, however, was greater than that seen for wild type HbA (Fig. 3, bottom panel, set a, and Table I). Both the W3 α14β15 and Y8a band intensities for deoxy rHb K132A are higher than those for wild type deoxyHb A (Fig. 4). Ligation to rHb K132A further enhances both of these bands, and the addition of IHP leads to additional band intensity increases, with a nearly 2-fold Y8a band increase for CO rHb K132A + IHP over that of wild type deoxyHbA (Fig. 4 and Table I). In contrast to the results for the ligated rHb mutants discussed above, the addition of IHP to CO rHb K132A does not result in an increase in the W3 β37 band (Fig. 3,bottom panel, set b, and Table I). The UVRR results for the R → T state transition of rHb βE6V/K132A are similar to those for rHb K132A (Fig. 3, bottom panel, and Table I). Generally, the W3 α14β15 and Y8a band intensities for deoxy rHb βE6V/K132A are greater than those observed for wild type deoxyHbA (Fig. 4). Ligation, however, has little effect on either the W3 α14β15 band intensity or on the intensity of the Y8a band (Fig. 4). The addition of IHP enhances both the W3 α14β15 and Y8a bands, but the Y8a band for ligated rHb βE6V/K132A is reduced relative to that for ligated rHb K132A (Fig. 4 b). As for CO rHb K132A, the addition of IHP does not enhance the intensity of the W3 β37 band (Fig. 3, bottom panel, set b, and Table I). Two categories of UVRR spectral differences are observed in comparing the different Hb derivatives. One set is associated with R → T state differences and is comprised of a Y8a band shift and a W3 β37 intensity increase. The former change is observed when comparing the deoxy and CO derivatives for all the Hb species examined in the present study, whereas the latter is observed for all species exceptthe E7A mutants.

Proteins with the appropriate signal sequence (1Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Google Scholar) bind to the signal recognition particle (SRP), which pauses translation (2Walter P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SRP then binds to the SRP receptor, which brings the ribosome and nascent peptide to the ER and releases the translational pause (5Walter P. Blobel G. J.

Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 463-469Google Scholar). The nascent peptide is then translocated through protein-conducting channels (8Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1991; 65: 371-380Google Scholar). Most studies on targeting to the ER membrane have used secreted proteins with cleaved amino-terminal signal sequences for which there is tight coupling between ongoing translation and translocation (9Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 852-862Google Scholar, 10Katz F.N. Rothman J.E. Lingappa V.R. Blobel G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This tight coupling between translation and translocation has complicated the analysis of the requirements for translocation in mammalian systems, as distinct from the requirements for translation.The analysis of translocation in yeast has been more straightforward since a completely post-translational pathway has been demonstrated. Some yeast proteins can be targeted to the ER after complete synthesis and release from the ribosome (14Rothblatt J.A. Meyer D.I. Cell. 1986; 44: 619-628Google Scholar, 15Waters M.G. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1543-1550Google Scholar). This has allowed the in vitro analysis of the process in isolation of the requirements for ongoing translation, which has provided a number of insights into mechanisms of translocation. ATP is required for post-translational translocation across the yeast ER (15Waters M.G. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1543-1550Google Scholar), as a consequence of the involvement of both cytosolic and ER-lumenal ATPase chaperones (14Rothblatt J.A. Meyer D.I. Cell. 1986; 44: 619-628Google Scholar, 16Rothblatt J.A. Webb J.R. Ammerer G. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3455-3463Google Scholar,17Waters M.G. Chirico W.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2629-2636Google Scholar). The lumenal chaperone BiP (also known as Kar2 and Grp78) plays a critical role in yeast translocation. Both temperature-sensitive mutations in BiP and decreased expression of BiP cause translocation defects in vivo (18Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Google Scholar, 19Nguyen T.H. Law D.T. Williams D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1565-1569Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified yeast ER proteins required BiP for translocation as well (20Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Google Scholar).The role of ATP and BiP in mammalian translocation is unresolved. ER microsomes that had been depleted of lumenal contents (including BiP) were competent to target proteins to the membrane but failed to translocate them across the microsomal membrane (21Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Google Scholar). In other experiments, proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified ER membrane components did not require BiP (22Yu Y. Zhang Y. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9931-9935Google Scholar, 23Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Google Scholar). Because ongoing translation was required in these assays, the requirement for ATP could not be independently evaluated. Other in vitro systems have been used to partially dissociate the coupling between translation and translocation across the mammalian ER membrane. However, the targeting and translocation efficiencies were very low (24Perara E. Rothman R.E. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1986; 232: 348-352Google Scholar, 25Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2253-2261Google Scholar, 26Wilson C. Connolly T. Morrison T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 69-77Google Scholar, 27Hoffman K.E. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4381-4385Google Scholar), suggesting that efficient translocation may only occur coupled to translation.To investigate translocation in a mammalian system, we developed an assay using translation intermediates of opsin. Like most members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, opsin does not have cleaved amino-terminal signal sequence, but nevertheless, the amino terminus is translocated across the ER membrane. The first transmembrane segment functions as the signal sequence, and it must emerge from the ribosome to bind SRP and target to the membrane (28Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1985; 318: 338-343Google Scholar). This implies that the segment of opsin that is on the amino side of the first membrane segment can only translocate uncoupled from translation. Indeed, for nascent polypeptides paused as the first transmembrane segment emerges from the ribosome, the nascent opsin can efficiently target to the ER membrane and translocate uncoupled from ongoing protein synthesis (“post-translationally”) (29Kanner E.M. Klein I.K. Friedlander M. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7707-7715Google Scholar).Thus, a transient step in the biogenesis of opsin can be investigatedin vitro, isolated from the requirements for translation. Using this system, we have observed that GTP is necessary for translocation and that there is no specific requirement for ATP or cytosolic proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise noted.

Translations were labeled with translation grade [35S]methionine from Amersham Biosciences or PerkinElmer Life Sciences.ConstructsOpsin truncation mutants have been previously described (29Kanner E.M. Klein I.K. Friedlander M. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7707-7715Google Scholar). The nomenclature we use for this shortened nascent opsin construct is tOP××, for truncatedopsin, with the superscript number indicating the number of codons after the end of the first transmembrane domain (which ends at amino acid 61). The first transmembrane segment is used as a point of reference because it is the first information targeting the nascent opsin to the ER membrane (28Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1985; 318: 338-343Google Scholar). Throughout this study we use tOP30, which contains 91 amino acids total, 30 after the first transmembrane domain.TranscriptionsDNA plasmids were digested withBamHI and purified with a QIAQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The cut DNA was subsequently transcribed with a Message Machine SP6 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's specifications.TranslationsThe nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate extract and RNasin were from Promega (Madison, WI). Canine pancreatic membranes (ER membranes) were purchased from Promega or prepared as previously described (30Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Google Scholar). Translations were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications, except as described in the text.Post-translational ReactionsAfter translation with no ER membranes present, further translation was inhibited with cycloheximide (2 mg/ml final) or emetine (2 mm final) for 10 min at 25 °C. ER membranes (0.75 μl/12.5-μl reaction) were added after treatment. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for an additional 30 min. Some samples were explicitly released from the ribosome with puromycin (2 mm final) and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C then 5 min at 37 °C.Purification of Ribosome-bound Nascent Opsin Polypeptides (RBOps) by DesaltingTranslation reactions (prepared as above for post-translational reactions) were desalted using Microspin® G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with translation/translocation buffer (TB:120 mm potassium acetate (pH 7.5), 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm magnesium acetate) supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol just before use. The column was centrifuged at 735 × g av for 25–30 s. The translation was diluted with buffer to a volume of 50 μl final and then added to the column. The sample was centrifuged into the column at 735 ×g av for 25–30 s, and the flow-through was discarded. The desalted translation mix was eluted by centrifugation for 2 min at 735 × g av and diluted with TB. Supplemented reactions were typically incubated at 25 °C for 30 min.Purification of RBOp by CentrifugationTranslations (prepared as above for post-translational reactions) were diluted in TB plus dithiothreitol, overlaid on standard harvesting buffer (1m sucrose, 150 mm potassium acetate (pH 7.5), 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm magnesium acetate), and centrifuged in TLA 100 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 62,000 rpm (∼148,000 × g av) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting ribosome nascent opsin complex pellet was resuspended in TB plus dithiothreitol.Post-translational Reactions with RBOpFor reactions, 10-μl aliquots were supplemented with 1 μl of a 10× energy stock or reticulocyte-lysate (cytosol). ER membranes (0.5 μl) were added to each 10-μl reaction.ER Membrane Pretreatment with InhibitorsER membranes were diluted in TB containing 1 mm AMPPNP or GMPPNP and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Mock-treated samples were diluted in buffer alone under the same conditions. ER membrane aliquots were then added to purified RBOp for post-translational reactions as above. The final concentration of inhibitor was less than 200 μm in the reaction.ATPase assayATPase activity was measured by determining the concentration of NADH using a Genesys 2PC spectrophotometer (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) with a coupled system (that converted 1 molecule of NADH to NAD+ for each molecule of ADP generated) as previously described (31Huang T.G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Google Scholar, 32.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). 2L. Greene and S. Henikoff, Kinesin Home Page, www.proweb.org/kinesin/methods/ATPase_assay.html. Briefly, 200-μl reactions containing 1 mm MgATP, 3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.21 mm NADH, 65 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 1.3 mm MgCl2, and 1.3 mm dithiothreitol were supplemented with 3.5 μl of protein kinase/lactate dehydrogenase enzymes (Sigma) and 15 μl of ER membranes (prepared from canine pancreas). TheA 340 was monitored for 10 min at 1-min intervals to determine the rate constant. As a control, ADP was added to some samples to directly stimulate degradation of NADH. AMPPNP did not inhibit the coupled system (data not shown).RESULTSWe previously showed that nascent intermediates of opsin could target to the ER membrane and even translocate the amino terminus across without ongoing translation (29Kanner E.M. Klein I.K. Friedlander M. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7707-7715Google Scholar). In this work we examined the specific requirements for this process by removing components from the translation mix before the addition of ER membranes. As before, we generated RBOps by in vitro translation of mRNA that had been truncated at specific positions within the coding region without a stop codon. Then the RBOp were isolated from other components of the translation mix using a G-25 column or ultracentrifugation. These purified RBOp could be incubated with ER membranes and other supplements to determine the requirements for targeting and translocation. RBOp were purified over a G-25 column after treatment with emetine to block any further translation (Fig.1). The indicated band represents the nascent polypeptide still covalently bound to the tRNA as previously shown (29Kanner E.M. Klein I.K. Friedlander M. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7707-7715Google Scholar). The nascent polypeptides were still bound to functional ribosomes, since 93% could be released from the tRNA by puromycin (lane 7). Release of nascent polypeptides by puromycin requires the labile aminoacyl-tRNA bond to be positioned near the functional peptidyltransferase site (33Traut R.R. Monro R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 10: 63-72Google Scholar). Some components required for targeting and/or translation were removed by the G-25 column, because adding ER membranes to depleted RBOp did not result in appreciable glycosylation of the nascent peptides (lane 1). Without ER membranes added, supplementation of RBOp with cytosol alone did not stimulate glycosylation (lane 2). However, supplementation with cytosol and ER membranes together did result in efficient glycosylation (62%, lane 3). This was comparable with the efficiency of glycosylation of samples that were not run over the G-25 column (Untreated Translation, 83%, lane 9). Because the majority of the nascent polypeptides could be released by puromycin and the efficiency of glycosylation was comparable with the untreated samples, we can conclude that the treatment did not damage the ribosome-bound nascent chains.To determine the specific energetic requirements for targeting and translocation, individual nucleotide energy sources were added to RBOp, with ER membranes present (lanes 4–6). The addition of GTP supported glycosylation as efficiently as cytosol (compare lanes 3 and 5). The addition of ATP and GTP was no more efficient than GTP alone (compare lane 5 to lane 6). The addition of ATP alone (lane 4) supported moderate glycosylation of the tRNA-nascent opsins (48%). Because the addition of GTP was as efficient as supplementation with cytosol, the only significant/relevant factors removed by the desalting treatment were small energy molecules.In yeast, post-translational translocation depends on cytosolic proteins to maintain the nascent polypeptide in a translocation competent state (17Waters M.G. Chirico W.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2629-2636Google Scholar, 34Chirico W.J. Waters M.G. Blobel G. Nature. 1988; 332: 805-810Google Scholar). To investigate which, if any, cytosolic proteins are required for translocation of the amino terminus of opsin, RBOp were harvested by centrifugation in physiological (150 nm) or high salt (500 mm potassium acetate) conditions (Fig. 2). A high salt wash has been used previously to remove the nascent polypeptide-associated complex from ribosome-nascent peptide complexes (35Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Google Scholar). The translation was diluted with buffer (physiologic or high salt) and centrifuged through a similarly buffered sucrose cushion. Both the physiological as well as the salt-washed RBOp were then incubated with ER membranes and supplemented as indicated.Figure 2The RBOp is still competent to translocate the nascent chain after a high salt wash with only added GTP. A translation of tOP30 without membranes adjusted to 150 mm potassium acetate (KOAc) or 500 mm potassium acetate was centrifuged at 62,000 rpm for 30 min to purify the RBOps, and these were resuspended with buffer and supplemented with ER membranes (ER) and energy as indicated. RNC, ribosome nascent opsin complex. For comparison, a sample of translation that was not treated with potassium acetate (Untreated Translation) was incubated with and without membranes. Samples of both batches of RBOps that were treated with puromycin (lanes 16 and 18) are compared with untreated samples (lanes 15 and 17). Thelower arrow indicates the tRNA-nascent chain, and theupper arrow indicates the glycosylated tRNA-nascent chain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RBOp that had been harvested in high salt were as efficient in targeting and translocation as those harvested under physiological conditions (Fig. 2). Incubation with cytosol and ER membranes together resulted in glycosylation of 67% of the nascent opsin polypeptides in physiological (lane 3) and 66% in high salt (lane 9). The ability of nucleotide triphosphates to substitute for cytosol was tested in the presence of ER membranes (lanes 4–6, 10–12). The addition of ATP stimulated glycosylation of 29% of the tRNA-nascent opsin in physiological salt (lane 4) and 30% in high salt (lane 10). Consistent with the previous observations (Fig. 1), the addition of GTP was more efficient than ATP and supported glycosylation of 71% of the tRNA-nascent opsin in physiological salt (lane 5) and 70% in high salt (lane 11). Once again the GTP was as efficient as the addition of cytosol to the RBOp purified with physiological salt (lane 3) or with high salt (lane 9) and nearly as efficient as the untreated sample (lane 14). The combination of ATP and GTP was no more efficient than GTP alone (lane 6and 12). The addition of ER membranes alone showed only barely detectable levels of glycosylation (lanes 1 and7), indicating that this RBOp purification procedure also removed the majority of cytosol. As expected, cytosol in the absence of ER membranes did not support glycosylation (lanes 2 and8). The ability of puromycin to efficiently release tRNA-nascent polypeptide demonstrated that the nascent opsin was bound to a functional ribosome throughout the salt wash and purification. RBOps were incubated with (lanes 16 and 18) or without puromycin (lanes 15 and 17), and about 90% of the nascent polypeptides were released by puromycin.Lumenal chaperones have been implicated in both co-and post-translational translocation of proteins across the ER membrane (18Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Google Scholar, 19Nguyen T.H. Law D.T. Williams D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1565-1569Google Scholar, 21Nicchitta C.V.

Because these chaperones are ATPases (39Kassenbrock C.K. Kelly R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1461-1467Google Scholar) we had expected a role for ATP in the translocation of opsin. The endoplasmic reticulum has transporters for ATP and other nucleotides (40Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Google Scholar). Our results indicated only a modest effect of ATP that was less efficient than that of GTP alone (Figs. 1 and 2). We examined whether the ATP would have a more robust effect in the presence of reduced levels of GTP. RBOps purified by centrifugation were incubated with membranes and supplemented with a range of GTP concentrations either alone (Fig.3, closed circles) or in the presence of 1 mm ATP (open circles).Figure 3Low GTP supplemented with ATP or UTP is as efficient as high GTP. Centrifugation-purified ribosome-nascent chain complexes were exposed to membranes in the presence of varying concentrations of GTP (0–500 μm) alone (closed circles) or in the presence of 1 mm ATP (open circles) or 1 mm UTP (triangles). The percent glycosylation normalized to the maximum signal with ER membranes and cytosol is plotted against the GTP concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Consistent with the results in Figs. 1 and 2, 1 mm ATP (open circle, zero point on GTP axis) alone stimulated translocation but was less efficient than even 10 μm GTP alone (closed circles). However, when ATP was supplemented with even low concentrations of GTP, translocation was greatly improved, approximating that observed in samples supplemented with high levels of GTP.There are three possible explanations for the observation that ATP augmented the effects of low concentrations of GTP on the efficiency of targeting and translocation. First, GTP is necessary and sufficient for targeting and translocation, and ATP is only being used to regenerate GTP from GDP (dinucleotide exchange). Second, there are distinct ATP- and GTP-dependent steps. From previous work, these steps are potentially targeting (GTP-dependent) and translocation (ATP-dependent). In this model, high GTP concentrations could allow RBOp to target multiple times to the ER membrane, eventually overcoming the inefficient ATP-dependent step. Lower GTP concentrations require a more efficient translocation step and more ATP. Third, there are distinct ATP- and GTP-dependent steps (as described above), but the ER membranes or purified RBOps contain residual adenine nucleotides (but not residual guanine nucleotides). With only GTP added, sufficient ATP can be regenerated. However, since there is no residual guanine nucleotides, GTP cannot be regenerated. Further experiments were done to differentiate these possibilities.In cells there are abundant enzymes to generate the other nucleotide triphosphates from the large pool of ATP. One well characterized enzyme is nucleotide diphosphate kinase. Nucleotide diphosphate kinase non-specifically catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from a nucleotide triphosphate to another nucleotide diphosphate. Nucleotide diphosphate kinase is a homohexamer of 17-kDa subunits. Thus, it is expected to be too small to co-purify with ribosomes under the centrifugation conditions used. Nevertheless, it could be present with the purified RBOps or the ER membranes. To test for triphosphate exchange, UTP was used instead of ATP to supplement low levels of GTP (Fig. 3, triangles). UTP was as effective as ATP in increasing the efficiency of translocation at low levels of added GTP. This is still consistent with the first and third models. The specificity seen in the preceding experiments still may be due to specific requirement or differences in the levels of residual nucleotides present. To help distinguish these possibilities, more specific tests for the nucleotide requirements were used, namely the ability of analogs to inhibit the reactions.GDP has been shown to inhibit GTP-dependent enzymes by favoring the inactive GDP-bound form. GDP addition alone had very little effect on stimulating translocation (Fig.4). When ATP was present with lower levels of added GDP, translocation was stimulated, but at high levels of GDP there was no effect. We interpret this to mean that high levels of GDP specifically inhibit the GTP-dependent steps. At lower levels of added GDP, however, there is rapid conversion of the majority of the GDP to GTP, which can be used to support targeting and translocation. These data provide strong evidence that there is nucleotide triphosphate transfer and that GTP (or another species such as GDP that can be converted to GTP) is required. Still, a specific role for ATP may exist, since sufficient residual ATP/ADP may be present and regenerated itself in the presence of sufficient GTP.Figure 4Low GDP enhances but high GDP inhibits targeting and translocation in the presence of ATP.Centrifugation-purified ribosome-nascent chain complexes of tOP30 were prepared as before and were supplemented with membranes and nucleotides as indicated. The glycosylation was normalized to the level seen with cytosol present with membranes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further explore the energetic requirements for targeting and translocation, ER membranes were treated with non-hydrolyzable analogs of GTP, 1 mm GMPPNP, and ATP, 1 mm AMPPNP (Fig.5). The top panel shows ER membranes treated with inhibitors or mock-treated used with unpurified translations. There was efficient glycosylation of nascent opsin (60%) with the addition of untreated control ER membranes (lane 5), which was comparable with mock-treated membranes (lane 2, 49%) and AMPPNP-treated membranes (lane 3, 57%). In contrast, the glycosylation of nascent opsin was reduced to 19% in the presence of ER membranes pretreated with GMPPNP (lane 4). With no membranes added, background glycosylation was not detectable (lane 1). Similar results were observed with the inhibitors used at 10 mm (data not shown).Figure 5GMPPNP pretreatment of membranes inhibits targeting and translocation of RBOp but AMPPNP pretreatment does not. Ribosome-nascent chain complexes of tOP30 were harvested by centrifugation as described in Fig. 2. ER membranes were incubated with either 1 mm AMPPNP, 1 mm GMPPNP, or with buffer alone (mock-treated) for 10 min at 25 °C. Aliquots of membranes were added to RBOp samples and supplements as shown. The final residual concentration of AMPPNP or GMPPNP was 200 μm. Complete mixes were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Arrows indicate the tRNA-nascent chains, and the arrowheads indicate the glycosylated (Glycos.) tRNA-nascent chains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The treated ER membranes were then tested with purified RBOp and specific nucleotide supplementation. Mock-treated ER membranes (lanes 6–11) gave results very similar to those seen earlier with untreated ER membranes. Glycosylation was efficient with the addition of membranes and cytosol (lane 7). The addition of 10 μm GTP stimulated translocation above background (lane 8), whereas 1 mm GTP was nearly as efficient as cytosol (lane 9). The addition of ATP, even at 1 mm, was less efficient than 10 μm GTP (compare lanes 10 and 11 to 8 and9). Without any added energy source (lane 6), translocation was barely detectable.When AMPPNP pretreated membranes were supplemented with the same energy sources, the results were very similar to the mock-treated membranes (compare the bottom panel to the middle panel). Cytosol stimulated translocation efficiently (lane 13), low GTP was less efficient (lane 14), and high GTP was as efficient as cytosol (lane 15). Low and high ATP were still inefficient (lanes 16 and 17). With no added energy there is only barely detectable glycosylation (lane 12).With the GMPPNP pretreated membranes (bottom panel) there were two differences from the mock- and AMPPNP-treated membranes. First there was a higher background level of glycosylation with only membranes added (lane 18), which is consistent with previous work showing that GMPPNP can have a positive effect on targeting (25Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2253-2261Google Scholar, 26Wilson C. Connolly T. Morrison T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 69-77Google Scholar, 27Hoffman K.E. Gilmore R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 25-34Google Scholar) but still less efficiently than a similar concentration of GTP (data not shown). Second, GMPPNP inhibited stimulation of translocation by other energy sources. The addition of cytosol (lane 19) did not stimulate translocation detectably above background (compare with lane 18). Low GTP (lane 20) had no stimulatory effect, but high GTP (lane 21) moderately increased the targeting and glycosylation. The addition of ATP had no significant effect (lanes 22 and 23).Because AMPPNP did not inhibit translocation it was important to independently confirm that ATPase activity in the treated ER membranes had indeed been inhibited by the compound"
https://openalex.org/W2029435380,"ArsA, the peripheral membrane component of the anion-translocating ATPase ArsAB, consists of two nucleotide binding domains (A1 and A2), which are connected by a linker sequence. Previous studies on ArsA have focused on the function of each nucleotide binding domain and the role of the linker, whereas the present study looks at the interactions between the binding domains and their interactions with the linker. It has previously been shown that the A1 domain of ArsA carries out unisite catalysis in the absence of antimonite, while A2 is recruited in multisite catalysis by antimonite in the presence of a functional A1 domain. Multisite catalysis thus seems to result from an interaction between A1 and A2 brought about by antimonite. In the present study, we provide direct biochemical evidence for interaction between the two nucleotide binding domains and show that the linker region acts as a transducer of the conformational changes between them. We find that nucleotide binding to the A2 domain results in a significant, detectable change in the conformation of the A1 domain. Two ATP analogs, FSBA and ATPγS, used in this study, were both found to bind preferentially to the A2 domain, and their binding resulted in changing the otherwise compact A1 domain into an open conformation. Point mutations in the A2 domain and the linker region also produced a similar effect on the conformation of A1, thus suggesting that events at A2 are relayed to A1 via the linker. We propose that nucleotide binding to A2 produces a two-tiered conformational change. The significance of these changes in the mechanism of ArsA is discussed.

We propose that nucleotide binding to A2 produces a two-tiered conformational change. The significance of these changes in the mechanism of ArsA is discussed. ArsA is the peripheral membrane component of the anion-translocating ATPase ArsAB. It is an allosteric enzyme whose ATPase activity is stimulated by the substrates of the pump, antimonite and arsenite (1Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Google Scholar). ArsA consists of two homologous halves, A1 (residues 1–281) and A2 (residues 321–583), each half consisting of a consensus nucleotide binding domain (NBD) 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide binding domain; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); FSBA, 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid characterized by the presence of a Walker A sequence (2Kaur P. Winkelmann G. Microbial Transport Systems. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2001: 377-394Google Scholar). The two halves of ArsA are connected by a linker sequence (residues 282–320), which plays a crucial role in the function of ArsA (3Jia H. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29582-29587Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations created in specific residues in each NBD suggest that both sites are required for function of the protein (4Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Google Scholar, 5Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Google Scholar). We have proposed earlier that the two NBDs in ArsA have different conformations and different affinities for ATP (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). In a previous publication from this laboratory, we proposed that ATP binds only to the A1 site in the absence of antimonite, whereas it binds to both A1 and A2 in its presence. Thus, the function of the allosteric ligand may be to act as a switch that allows ATP binding to A2, resulting in A1-A2 interaction and catalytic co-operativity (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). Even though sequential ATP binding to A1 and A2 and the role of antimonite in allowing ATP binding to A2 has not been unequivocally verified, we have shown that antimonite is required for recruiting A2 into catalysis (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar). We showed that the A1 site carries out catalysis in the absence of antimonite, whereas A2 participates in catalysis in the presence of antimonite and a functional A1 site (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar). Catalysis by A1 in the absence of antimonite has been termed “unisite catalysis” and catalysis involving both A1 and A2 in the presence of antimonite “multisite catalysis” (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar). Studies carried out with point mutants in the A1 and the A2 domains showed that proteins containing mutations in A2 still carry out unisite catalysis in A1, but no multisite catalysis is seen (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar). However, proteins containing mutations in A1 show neither unisite nor multisite catalysis (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar). These results showed that not only is the A1 site first in the sequence of events but for participation of A2 in catalysis, a functional A1 domain, in addition to antimonite, is required (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar). In a recent study (8Zhou T. Shen J. Liu Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23815-23820Google Scholar), Rosen and co-workers studied intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of a residue near A2 to understand the role of A2 NBD. Their data are consistent with the proposed unisite and multisite catalytic mechanism (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar) of ArsA and demonstrate independently that A2 is catalytic only when antimonite is present and when the A1 site is functional (8Zhou T. Shen J. Liu Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23815-23820Google Scholar). The studies discussed above point to a sequence in the catalytic mechanism of ArsA, and at the same time suggest interaction between the A1 and the A2 domains, which may be responsible for catalytic co-operativity. The present work provides direct biochemical evidence for interaction between the domains. We find that events at the A2 domain result in a significant conformational change in the A1 domain, thus providing strong evidence for interaction. Our results also indicate that the linker region acts as the mediator of the conformational changes between A1 and A2 and that events from A2 are transduced to A1 via the linker. His-tagged wild type and mutant ArsA proteins were purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography according to the procedure described earlier (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). ArsA (10 μm) in a 100-μl reaction volume containing MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5 was incubated with the indicated substrates for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were then subjected to different concentrations of trypsin, as indicated, for 60 min at 25 °C. Proteolysis was terminated by addition of 2-fold excess soybean trypsin inhibitor. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gel, followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot analysis using anti-N18 (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P.

To determine the inhibitory effect of ATPγS on the ATPase activity of ArsA, either the coupled assay (5Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Google Scholar) or the32Pi release assay (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar) was employed, as described below. ArsA (15 μg) was incubated with the reaction components of the coupled assay and the indicated concentrations of ATPγS in a 1-ml cuvette. Antimonite (0.5 mm) and ATP (1 mm) were added, and the samples were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were started by the addition of magnesium and decrease in absorbance of NADH was monitored at 340 nm. A control experiment showed that ATPγS has no effect on the components of the coupled assay system itself. To determine the protective effect of ATP on ATPγS inhibition, ArsA was incubated with different concentrations of ATP, antimonite (0.5 mm), and a fixed concentration of ATPγS in the coupled assay system for 10 min. The reaction was started by the addition of magnesium. ArsA (1 μg) was preincubated with [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi) and different concentrations of ATPγS in a 40-μl reaction volume in 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5 for 10 min at 37 °C. Antimonite was added to the preincubation mixture where indicated. The reaction was started by the addition of magnesium, and the samples were withdrawn at different times, followed by TLC. Purified ArsA (10 μm) was incubated with γ-35S-ATP (10 μCi) in 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were placed in a microtitration plate and subjected to UV cross-linking by placing a hand-held UV lamp (254 nm) directly above the microtitration plate for 30 min on ice. The samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation and resuspension of the pellet in 100 μl of the buffer A. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. ArsA, UV cross-linked with γ-35S-ATP in buffer A, as described above, was directly mixed with trypsin at a trypsin/protein ratio of 1:1000. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 60 min, followed by addition of 2-fold excess trypsin inhibitor. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. The dried gel was subjected to fluorography and autoradiographed. Trypsin-digested fragments were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing using a Beckman model LF3000 solid phase amino acid sequencer in the core facility of the Department of Biology at the Georgia State University. Previous studies have shown that Arg-290 in the linker region (residues 282- 320) of ArsA is a readily accessible trypsin site (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). At a ratio of trypsin to ArsA of 1:1000, cleavage at Arg-290 divides the protein into two halves, a 32-kDa N-terminal fragment (residues 1–290) and a 27-kDa C-terminal fragment (starting at residue 290). The N-terminal 32-kDa fragment is very compact and is resistant to further cleavage by trypsin, whereas the 27-kDa fragment is cleaved further into smaller fragments (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). This digestion pattern is seen in the control sample (no substrate) as well as in the presence of ATP. Interestingly, however, in the presence of ATP and antimonite, ArsA acquires a trypsin-resistant conformation, which has been designated AS as compared with the A conformation obtained in the presence of ATP alone (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). Most ArsA in the AS conformation is found in the 63-kDa species, indicating that Arg-290 is now buried in the structure and is inaccessible to trypsin. In this study, we looked at the ability of the point mutants in the nucleotide binding sites of ArsA to acquire the AS conformation. Two point mutants were chosen, G20S with a mutation in the A1 NBS (4Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Google Scholar) and K340E with a mutation in the A2 NBS (5Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 1 suggest that, unlike in the wild type ArsA (lanes 1–3), neither G20S nor K340E can acquire the AS conformation in the presence of ATP and antimonite. The digestion pattern of K340E is exactly the same under three different conditions, which include the control (no substrate,lane 7), A (ATP, lane 8), or the AS (ATP and antimonite, lane 9). The N-terminal 32-kDa fragment, which results from cleavage at Arg-290, is the predominant fragment in all situations (Fig. 1, lanes 7–9). The AS conformation is also completely absent in G20S (Fig. 1, lanes 4–6). Since the AS conformation of ArsA is resistant to trypsin at a concentration of 1:1000, trypsin concentrations of 1:100 and 1:50 were employed to analyze the AS conformation further. The data in Fig.2 A show that Arg-290 in AS is relatively inaccessible even at high trypsin concentrations, however a new 40-kDa fragment is produced exclusively in the AS sample (lanes 3 and 5) and not in the A sample (lanes 2 and 4). Western blot analysis (Fig.2 B) showed that this band cross-reacts with both anti-N18 (residues 1- 176) (lane 2) and anti-C30 (residues 320–583) (lane 4) antibodies, thus suggesting that it originates within the A1 domain and extends into the A2 domain. This fragment was designated the NC40 fragment. An N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of this fragment showed that it originates at residue Arg88 in the A1 domain and it bears the amino acid sequence89IVDPIKGVL (Table I). Since this site is inaccessible to trypsin in the control (no substrate) or in the A (with ATP) conformation, it suggests that an alternate trypsin site within the A1 domain becomes available in the AS conformation, albeit only at high concentrations of trypsin.

Abbreviations and notations: AS, ArsA incubated with ATP and antimonite; FSBA, ArsA incubated with FSBA; ATPγS, ArsA incubated with ATPγS; D303G mutation, ArsA containing D303G linker mutation. AnX in the amino acid sequence indicates a residue that could not be definitively identified. To determine if availability of the alternate trypsin site (Arg-88) in A1 depends on nucleotide binding to A2, analogs of ATP, including FSBA and ATPγS, were used. FSBA inhibits the ATPase activity of ArsA in a specific manner (10Hsu C.-M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Google Scholar). It was chosen for this study, in particular, because it binds preferentially to the A2 domain of ArsA, and its binding results in protection of the C27 fragment from proteolysis at a trypsin concentration of 1:1000 (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). In the present work, we find that binding of FSBA to ArsA results not only in the protection of the C27 fragment but it also produces another fragment of about 25 kDa in size, which is present exclusively in the FSBA-treated ArsA samples (Fig.4 A, lane 3) and not present in the control (lane 1) or the ATP (lane 2) sample. To determine the origin of this fragment, Western blot analysis was carried out. Data in Fig. 4 B show that the 25-kDa band cross-reacts with the anti-N18 antibody (lane 3) but not with the anti-C30 antibody (lane 6), thus implying that this fragment is the result of further breakdown of the otherwise compact N32 fragment (residues 1–290). This fragment is designated N25. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that this fragment contains the sequence 89IVDPIKGVLP, thus this fragment also results from cleavage at Arg-88 in A1 (Table I). Based on its size of 25 kDa, this fragment is expected to lie between Arg-88 and Arg-290. Effect of FSBA binding to the point mutants, G20S and K340E, was also studied. The data in Fig. 4 A show that the N25 fragment is produced when G20S is treated with FSBA (lane 6). Interestingly, however, trypsin proteolysis of K340E results in the N25 fragment irrespective of the presence or absence of FSBA (lanes 7–9). Effect of binding of another ATP analog, ATPγS, on the function of ArsA was also studied. Initial experiments focused on determining if ATPγS inhibits the ATPase activity of ArsA and in localization of its binding site in ArsA. To determine if ATPγS inhibits the ATPase activity, ArsA was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of ATPγS in the presence of antimonite and ATP, and its effect on the ATPase activity was determined by the coupled assay, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The ATPase activity of ArsA was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5). Half-maximal inhibition was observed at 20–40 μm ATPγS. ATP was found to protect against the inhibitory effect of ATPγS. Complete protection from inhibition was observed at 8 mm ATP (data not shown), suggesting that ATPγS binds more tightly to one or both sites in ArsA as compared with ATP. To understand the mechanism of ATPγS inhibition, its effect on the kinetic parameters was determined (Fig.6). ArsA was preincubated in the presence of antimonite, ATP, and different concentrations of ATPγS. In the control reaction carried out in the absence of ATPγS, aK m of 131 μm and aV max of 966 nmol/min/mg ArsA was observed. These values are consistent with the values reported earlier (1Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Google Scholar, 5Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Google Scholar). In the presence of increasing concentrations of ATPγS, an increase inK m was observed, whereas V maxwas found to remain unchanged (Fig. 6). These data show that in the presence of ATPγS, affinity of ArsA for ATP is significantly decreased, suggesting that ATPγS is a competitive inhibitor that binds with a higher affinity than ATP. ArsA has previously been shown to exhibit unisite catalysis from the A1 site in the absence of antimonite and multisite catalysis involving A1 and A2 in the presence of antimonite (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar, 8Zhou T. Shen J. Liu Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23815-23820Google Scholar). The effect of different concentrations of ATPγS on the initial rate of unisite and multisite catalysis was determined by the 32Pi release assay. Preincubation with ATPγS was carried out in the presence of ATP and either the presence (multisite conditions) or the absence of antimonite (unisite conditions). Data in Fig.7 show that the unisite activity of ArsA (squares) is unaffected even at concentration as high as 100 μm ATPγS, thus suggesting that ATPγS either does not bind to the A1 site or it does not inhibit the unisite activity of A1. However, a significant decrease in the initial rate of activity in the presence of antimonite was seen (triangles), which may suggest binding of ATPγS primarily to the A2 domain of ArsA. To identify the ATPγS binding site, ArsA was mixed with γ-35S-ATP and exposed to UV light as described under “Materials and Methods.” Wild type ArsA was seen to form a UV-activated adduct with γ-35S-ATP (Fig.8, lane 1). The addition of antimonite or magnesium was not found to increase the efficiency of labeling (data not shown). UV-induced photolabeling in the presence of γ-35S-ATP was also studied in the A1 (G20S) or the A2 (K340E) mutants. The data in Fig. 8 show that the A1 mutant, G20S, forms adduct with γ-35S-ATP (lane 2), while no labeling is seen in the A2 mutant, K340E (lane 3). These results thus suggest that labeling with γ-35S-ATP most likely occurs to the A2 domain. To localize the binding site of γ-35S-ATP in ArsA, partial trypsin proteolysis of the labeled proteins was carried out. Under the trypsin conditions employed (described under “Materials and Methods”), ArsA is cleaved at Arg-290 into an N-terminal 32-kDa and a C-terminal 27-kDa fragment (Fig.9 A, lanes 3 and4). We find that in a buffer containing 10% glycerol (as used in this experiment), the C27 fragment is stable and is not digested further, thus allowing us to determine the relative labeling of N32 versus C27 with γ-35S-ATP. The autoradiogram in Fig. 9 B shows that the C-terminal 27-kDa fragment is the predominant labeling site in wild type ArsA and in G20S (lanes 3 and 4). A smaller fragment of about 18 kDa is also labeled (lanes 3 and 4). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 18-kDa fragment was determined and it corresponds to 291LXSXQPVA, indicating that it is the breakdown product of C27 (Table I and Fig. 3). The data from the experiments outlined above suggest that ATPγS, like FSBA, binds to the A2 domain of ArsA. If so, does binding of ATPγS to A2 also produce a conformational change in A1? Trypsin analysis showed that binding of ATPγS, in the presence of magnesium, releases a 40-kDa fragment (Fig. 10,lane 5). N-terminal sequence analysis of the 40-kDa fragment showed that it also results from cleavage at Arg-88 and contains the sequence 89IVDPIKGVL (Table I). This fragment is thus similar to the NC40 fragment produced by trypsin cleavage of ArsA in the AS conformation and it, once again, suggests a conformational change in A1 upon binding of nucleotide to A2. This article describes the long range conformational changes that occur in the A1 domain of ArsA on nucleotide binding to the A2 domain and elucidates the role of the linker in transducing these changes. It is previously known that ArsA, in the presence of ATP and antimonite, acquires a conformation strikingly different from the conformation produced in the presence of either by itself (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). We have proposed earlier that the A conformation of ArsA results from ATP binding to the A1 site, whereas the AS conformation results from binding of ATP to A1 and A2 in the presence of antimonite, followed by interaction between the domains (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). The significance of the AS conformation of ArsA is evident from the fact that point mutants in either NBD of ArsA do not produce the AS conformation (Fig. 1). This suggests that AS conformation is indeed the result of interaction between two functional NBDs with ATP bound to one or both. AS conformation is the trypsin-resistant conformation so that Arg-290 in the linker is not accessible to trypsin. However, we find that at a higher concentration of trypsin, an alternate site, Arg-88, becomes accessible in AS. Cleavage at Arg-88 results in the NC40 fragment. These data imply a conformational change in A1 resulting from its interaction with A2 in the presence of antimonite. Do these data also indicate that ATP binding to A2 in the presence of antimonite results in a conformational change in A1? To answer that question, further experimental evidence was collected. Since FSBA, an ATP analog, binds preferentially to the A2 domain of ArsA (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar), we asked if binding of FSBA to the A2 domain produces a conformational change in A1. In this study, we find that FSBA binding to A2 protects C27 from further cleavage by trypsin (as shown before in Ref. 6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar), and, at the same time, it produces a conformational change in the A1 domain making it accessible to trypsin (Fig. 4). This results in a new fragment N25, which originates from Arg-88 in A1 (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus FSBA binding studies demonstrate very clearly that nucleotide binding to A2 results in a conformational change in A1. Interestingly, our results also show that a mutation in the A2 domain (e.g.K340E) results in the N25 fragment both in the presence or absence of FSBA, suggesting that the A1 domain in K340E is locked in an open conformation, thus providing further evidence that the conformational change in A1 is induced by events at A2. Furthermore, we find that binding of another ATP analog, ATPγS, to the A2 domain of ArsA also results in a conformational change in A1. A 40-kDa fragment, originating at Arg-88, is produced in the presence of ATPγS and magnesium (Fig. 10). This 40-kDa band is similar to the NC40 fragment produced on trypsin cleavage of the AS conformation (Fig.1). Thus, cleavage at Arg-88 on nucleotide binding to A2 results in either the N25 (with FSBA) or the NC40 (with ATP or ATPγS) fragment depending, most likely, on the binding characteristics of the nucleotide in question (for binding sites, please see Fig. 3). The two NBDs of ArsA are connected by a linker sequence, which has been shown to play a crucial role in the function of the protein (3Jia H. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29582-29587Google Scholar). Several mutations in the linker region were reported earlier (3Jia H. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29582-29587Google Scholar). One mutation, D303G, was found to be particularly interesting (3Jia H. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29582-29587Google Scholar). In addition to resulting in high arsenite sensitivity, this mutation was shown to produce a conformational change in the A1 domain resulting in a new fragment N25 (3Jia H. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29582-29587Google Scholar). In light of the studies reported here, this observation takes on a new significance. We decided to determine its N-terminal amino acid sequence and found that it too results from cleavage at Arg-88 (Table I). Thus a mutation in the linker (D303G) has the same effect on the conformation of A1 as a mutation in A2 (K340E), or binding of an ATP analog to A2 (FSBA). It implies, as suggested earlier (3Jia H. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29582-29587Google Scholar), that interaction between A1 and A2 involves the linker. That these three components (A1, A2, linker) interact closely is further evidenced by the fact that a mutation in any of these three components prevents the formation of the AS conformation (Fig. 1 and Ref. 3Jia H. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29582-29587Google Scholar). It suggests that A1 communicates with A2 via the linker, and this flow of information is disrupted in the D303G mutation (no AS is seen). Thus, the linker functions as a transducer of conformational changes from A1 to A2 and vice versa. In summary, the point mutants in the two binding sites and the linker allow us to look at the conformational changes that would normally occur in the wild type ArsA. Whereas wild type ArsA switches from A to AS on addition of antimonite, the point mutants in any of the three domains do not make this transition. The A2 mutation and the D303G linker mutation, however, have the effect of locking the A1 domain in a particular trypsin-sensitive conformation, irrespective of whether nucleotide is bound to A2 or not. Thus there is evidence for two separate effects resulting from events at A2: a long range conformational change in A1 (reflected in trypsin accessibility of Arg-88), and a movement of the A1 and A2 domains (reflected in the AS conformation and inaccessibility of Arg-290). In the wild type ArsA the long range conformational change in A1 is accompanied by the formation of the AS, whereas in the mutants it is not. There is no doubt that these conformational changes reflect interaction between A1 and A2, most likely via the linker; however, this raises the question: what is the significance of these changes in the mechanism of catalysis by ArsA? The answer may be linked to the asymmetric nature of the two sites in ArsA. We have proposed that the two sites in ArsA are non-equivalent and that only the A1 NBD is competent to bind ATP in the absence of antimonite, whereas ATP binding to A2 is “switched on” in the presence of antimonite (6Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Google Scholar). Even though clear evidence for this proposal is still lacking, this could very well be the basis for sequential participation of A1 and A2 in catalysis (7Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Google Scholar). We have shown that A1 participates in catalysis first in the absence of the ligand (unisite catalysis), whereas A2 comes into play later, in the presence of the ligand and a functional A1 (multisite catalysis). This has recently been verified in independent studies carried out by Zhouet al. (8Zhou T. Shen J. Liu Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23815-23820Google Scholar). Thus the conformational changes observed in this study may play a role in the cycle of ATP binding and ADP release from A1 and A2. The following sequence of steps might be envisioned: ATP binding and hydrolysis occurs in A1 first in the absence of antimonite, which produces a change in A2 so that A2 is now competent to bind ATP. If antimonite is available, ATP binding to (and perhaps hydrolysis by) A2 (in turn) produces a conformational change in A1, causing release of tightly bound ADP from A1 and allowing binding of another molecule of ATP to A1. Whether antimonite indeed acts as a switch for ATP binding to A2 could be answered by structural studies, however, crystals of ArsA in the absence of antimonite have not been obtained (11Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the crystal structure studies have confirmed that the two sites in ArsA are non-equivalent and that the exchange with nucleotides occurs only at the A2 site (11Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Google Scholar). Further, these studies have also shown that the nature of the nucleotide bound at A2 is reflected in the conformation of the A1 domain (12Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30414-30422Google Scholar). Simultaneous changes in the conformation of the linker region of ArsA have also been reported (12Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30414-30422Google Scholar). Thus, our biochemical studies are, to a large extent, supported by the crystal structure data. Finally, a comparison of ArsA to CFTR and P-glycoprotein, two other proteins that contain two NBDs each (13Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Google Scholar, 14Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Google Scholar) suggests that ArsA is more similar to CFTR in its mode of function than it is to P-glycoprotein. The two NBDs in CFTR and ArsA seem to be non-equivalent and participate sequentially in the catalytic cycle; whereas in Pgp, the two sites seem to be equivalent and even though they alternate in catalysis, there is no sequence to the steps. Each cycle of hydrolysis and transport in Pgp involves hydrolysis of only one ATP at either site. However, in both CFTR and ArsA, the N-terminal NBD is the first site to come into play; for one complete cycle, both NBDs seem to be involved. For example, in CFTR, a hydrolytic event at the N-terminal site opens the channel and another event at the C-terminal site closes the channel. In ArsA, binding of ATP to the N-terminal site and its hydrolysis occurs first and it is essential for participation of the C-terminal NBD and for multisite catalysis."
